1711,IFNL4 and IFNL3 Associated Polymorphisms Strongly Influence the Spontaneous IFN-Alpha Receptor-1 Expression in HCV-Infected Patients,2015-02-12,"Single-nucleotide polymorphism in IFNL3 gene (rs12979860) predicts spontaneous and therapy-induced HCV clearance. In a previous study from our group PBMC from patients with favourable rs12979860 genotype showed higher levels of IFNAR-1 mRNA. Recently, a dinucleotide polymorphism, ss469415590 (TT or ΔG), has been discovered in the region upstream IFNL3 gene, which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860. ss469415590[ΔG] is a frameshift variant that creates a novel gene, designed IFNL4, encoding the interferon-lambda 4 protein (IFNL4). The aim of the present study was to extend the analysis of IFNAR-1 mRNA levels to the ss469415590 variants. Our results highlight that the difference of IFNAR-1 mRNA levels between favourable and unfavourable genotype combinations, at both rs12979860 and ss469415590 loci, is stronger than that observed for single polymorphisms at each locus. These findings suggest may represent the biological basis for the observed association between IFNL3 CC and IFNL4 TT/TT genotypes and favourable outcome of either natural HCV infection (clearance vs chronic evolution) or IFN-based therapy.","Bordi, Licia; Caglioti, Claudia; Garbuglia, Anna Rosa; Lapa, Daniele; Castilletti, Concetta; Taibi, Chiara; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Lalle, Eleonora",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326132/,316
2056,Survival in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbations: the non-steroid approach,2015-12-14,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbation (IPF-AE) constitutes IPF’s most devastating event, representing the unexpected superimposition of diffuse alveolar damage of unknown etiology. Guidelines recommend high-dose steroids treatment despite unproven benefit. We hypothesized that previous immunosuppression and the administration of high-dose steroids adversely affect IPF-AE outcome. METHODS: We studied all consecutive patients hospitalized in our department for IPF deterioration from 2007 to June 2013. Our protocol consisted of immediate cessation of immunosuppression (if any), best supportive care, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and thorough evaluation to detect reversible causes of deterioration. Patients were followed-up for survival; post-discharge none received immunosuppression. RESULTS: Twenty-four out of 85 admissions (28 %) fulfilled IPF-AE criteria. IPF-AE were analyzed both as unique events and as unique patients. As unique events 50 % survived; 3 out of 12 (25 %) in the group previously treated with immunosuppression whereas nine out of 12 (75 %) in the group not receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.041). As unique patients 35.3 % survived; 3 out of 6 (50 %) in the never treated group whereas three out of 11 (27.3 %) in the group receiving immunosuppression (p = 0.685). The history of immunosuppression significantly and adversely influenced survival (p = 0.035). Survival was greater in the never treated group compared to the immunosuppressed patients (p = 0.022). Post-discharge, our IPF-AE survivors had an 83 % 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: By applying the above mentioned protocol half of our patients survived. The history of immunosuppression before IPF-AE adversely influences survival. Avoiding steroids in IPF patients may favor the natural history of the disease even at the moment of its most devastating event.","Papiris, Spyros A; Kagouridis, Konstantinos; Kolilekas, Likurgos; Papaioannou, Andriana I; Roussou, Aneza; Triantafillidou, Christina; Baou, Katerina; Malagari, Katerina; Argentos, Stylianos; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Karakatsani, Anna; Manali, Effrosyni D",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4678631/,316
3432,"Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Prolonged Macrolide, Corticosteroid, Doxycycline, and Levofloxacin against Macrolide-Unresponsive Mycoplasma pneumoniae Pneumonia in Children",2018-09-18,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of prolonged macrolide (PMC), corticosteroids (CST), doxycycline (DXC), and levofloxacin (LFX) against macrolide-unresponsive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia in children and to evaluate the safety of the secondary treatment agents. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with MP pneumonia hospitalized between January 2015 and April 2017. Macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of ≥ 38.0°C at ≥ 72 hours after macrolide treatment. The cases were divided into four groups: PMC, CST, DXC, and LFX. We compared the time to defervescence (TTD) after secondary treatment and the TTD after initial macrolide treatment in each group with adjustment using propensity score-matching analysis. RESULTS: Among 1,165 cases of MP pneumonia, 190 (16.3%) were unresponsive to macrolides. The proportion of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 96.9% (31/33), 85.7% (12/14), and 83.3% (5/6), respectively. The TTD after initial macrolide treatment did not differ between PMC and CST groups (5.1 vs. 4.2 days, P = 0.085), PMC and DXC groups (4.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.453), and PMC and LFX groups (4.4 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.283). No side effects were observed in the CST, DXC, and LFX groups. CONCLUSION: The change to secondary treatment did not show better efficacy compared to PMC in children with macrolide-unresponsive MP pneumonia. Further studies are needed to guide appropriate treatment in children with MP pneumonia.","Ha, Seok Gyun; Oh, Kyung Jin; Ko, Kwang-Pil; Sun, Yong Han; Ryoo, Eell; Tchah, Hann; Jeon, In Sang; Kim, Hyo Jeong; Ahn, Jung Min; Cho, Hye-Kyung",J Korean Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193889/,316
3992,Is Fever a Red Flag for Bacterial Pneumonia in Children With Viral Bronchiolitis?,2019-08-06,"We hypothesized that fever in children with viral bronchiolitis indicates the need for consideration of superimposed bacterial pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study of 349 children aged 2 years and younger with diagnoses of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and viral upper respiratory infection. Data were analyzed using Pearson χ(2) test. One hundred seventy-eight children had RSV with no other identified virus. The majority of children (56%) who had only RSV were afebrile. Febrile children with RSV were over twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia as those who were afebrile (60% vs 27%, P < .001). In the 171 children who had bronchiolitis caused by a virus other than RSV, 51% were afebrile. These children were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than those who were afebrile (65% vs 8%, P < .001). Evaluation of febrile children with viral bronchiolitis may allow early diagnosis and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia.","Elmore, Dominique; Yaslam, Balfaqih; Putty, Krista; Magrane, Thomas; Abadir, Anthony; Bhatt, Saloni; Frazier, Marie; Flesher, Susan",Glob Pediatr Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6686317/,316
4271,A Cholecystokinin Receptor Antagonist Halts Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and Prevents Hepatocellular Carcinoma,2019-07-11,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common inflammatory liver condition that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Risk factors for NASH include a saturated fat diet, altered lipid metabolism, and genetic and epigenetic factors, including microRNAs. Serum levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) are elevated in mice and humans that consume a high-saturated fat diet. CCK receptors (CCK-Rs) have been reported on fibroblasts which when activated can induce fibrosis; however, their role in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. We hypothesized that elevated levels of CCK acting on the CCK-Rs play a role in the development of NASH and in NASH-associated HCC. METHODS: We performed a NASH Prevention study and Reversal study in mice fed a saturated fat 75% choline-deficient–ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 12 or 18 weeks. In each study, half of the mice received untreated drinking water, while the other half received water supplemented with the CCK-R antagonist proglumide. CCK-R expression was evaluated in mouse liver and murine HCC cells. RESULTS: CCK receptor antagonist treatment not only prevented NASH but also reversed hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis and normalized hepatic transaminases after NASH was established. Thirty-five percent of the mice on the CDE diet developed HCC compared with none in the proglumide-treated group. We found that CCK-BR expression was markedly upregulated in mouse CDE liver and HCC cells compared with normal hepatic parenchymal cells, and this expression was epigenetically regulated by microRNA-148a. CONCLUSION: These results support the novel role of CCK receptors in the pathogenesis of NASH and HCC.","Tucker, Robin D.; Ciofoaia, Victor; Nadella, Sandeep; Gay, Martha D.; Cao, Hong; Huber, Matthew; Safronenka, Anita; Shivapurkar, Narayan; Kallakury, Bhaskar; Kruger, Annie J.; Kroemer, Alexander H.

6490,Emergency versus elective living-donor liver transplantation: a comparison of a single center analysis,2011-11-25,"We retrospectively evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (1,200 cGy) and melphalan (MEL) (100–110 mg/m(2)) myeloablative conditioning in 48 patients with nonremission AML (n = 14), ALL (n = 10), NHL (n = 18), and other refractory hematologic malignancies (n = 6) who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) between 2002 and 2011. Median age was 48 years (22 to 68); 14 out of 26 leukemia patients (54 %) had circulating blasts at transplant, 20 (50 %) evaluable patients had poor-risk cytogenetics, 12 (25 %) had prior SCT, and 10 (21 %) received stem cells from a mismatch donor. All patients received tacrolimus with or without methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis. At the time of analysis, 13 patients (27 %) were alive and disease free. Engraftment was complete in all patients. The median time to ANC recovery (>500) was 12 days (range, 6–28). The most common grade III and IV toxicities were mucositis and infections. Eighteen patients (43 %) developed grade II–IV acute GVHD, and eight (26 %) had extensive chronic GVHD. Of 44 evaluable patients for response, 28 (64 %) achieved a complete remission (CR), and seven (15 %) had a partial remission after the transplant. With a median follow-up of 30 months (4 to 124 months) for surviving patients, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 45 % at 1 year, and the probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 22.5 %. Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (<80,000/mL) and lactic dehydrogenase (>500 IU/L) at SCT were associated with relapse. Age less than 53 years and CR after SCT were associated with better OS. Our data suggest that TBI-MEL can result in CR in two thirds, durable remission in one third, and 5-year survival in about one quarter of patients with nonremission hematologic malignancies. Further studies with TBI-MEL in standard risk transplant patients are warranted.","Bhatnagar, Bhavana; Rapoport, Aaron P.; Fang, Hong-Bin; Ilyas, Can; Marangoz, Deniz; Akbulut, Vinil; Ruehle, Kathleen; Badros, Ashraf; Yanovich, Saul; Akpek, Görgün",Ann Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101620/,316
6534,Septicemia due toStreptococcus mitis in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia,1990,"Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) with two units has been conducted with promising results in adults to overcome the limitation of low cell numbers. In an attempt to improve the outcomes, double UCBT was performed in children and adolescents. Sixty-one patients, including 44 acute leukemia, and 17 other hematologic diseases, received double UCBT. Donor-type engraftment achieved in 82% of patients. Except one patient with persistent mixed chimerism of two units, other 49 patients showed dominancy of one unit and only the CFU-GM was significant factor influencing dominancy. The event-free survival (EFS) of leukemia and other hematologic disease were 59% and 53%, respectively, and the EFS of acute leukemia patients who received transplant in first or second CR (68.6%) was significantly better than in those with advanced disease (22.2%) (P = 0.007). Among the factors influencing outcomes, low cell dose difference between two units (TNC difference/TNC of large unit <15%) were associated with higher TRM, relapse, and lower EFS. Double UCBT was a promising modality of transplant in children and adolescence. However, engraftment and other results were not so satisfactory yet. To improve the outcomes, development of new selection guideline, probably including cell dose difference between two units and technology to enhance engraftment and reduce transplantation-related mortality are warranted.","Kang, Hyoung Jin; Yoo, Keon Hee; Lee, Ji Won; Kim, Hyery; Lee, Soo Hyun; Sung, Ki Woong; Park, Kyung Duk; Koo, Hong Hoe; Shin, Hee Young; Ahn, Hyo Seop",Ann Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101701/,316
6639,A case of pulmonary toxicity associated with G-CSF and doxorubicin administration,2001,"Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection endemic in the southwestern United States, can cause life-threatening infections in immunosuppressed patients. We report the contrasting cases of two adolescents with lupus nephritis, treated with intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide and daily oral corticosteroids, who developed pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. One patient developed a fatal form of fulminant disseminated coccidioidomycosis, while the other patient developed a solitary pulmonary Coccidioides immitis abscess which was responsive to intravenous liposomal amphotericin and fluconazole therapy. Because serologies and initial X-ray studies can be negative, definitive diagnostic studies including bronchioaveolar lavage and needle aspiration should be performed when there is clinical suspicion of coccidioidomycosis in an immunocompromised patient. Immunosuppressed patients with coccidioidomycosis should receive early intravenous amphotericin therapy and may benefit from long-term suppressive antifungal therapy to prevent relapse.","Yorgin, Peter D.; Rewari, Mona; Al-Uzri, Amira Y.; Theodorou, Andreas A.; Scott, Katherine M.; Barton, Leslie L.",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101878/,316
6717,Clinical study of Japanese spotted fever and its aggravating factors,2003,"Every year, influenza causes seasonal epidemics and is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. In general, clinical signs include fever, respiratory symptoms and myalgia. Human influenza viruses include influenza viruses A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, influenza virus B and influenza virus C. Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoir of influenza A virus. On a sporadic basis novel viruses can emerge from the zoonotic reservoir and cross the species barrier. In such events clinical presentation in humans can range from mild (e.g. conjunctivitis) to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In early 2013, a novel avian influenza A virus H7N9 emerged in China and the clinical presentation included bilateral pneumonia with ARDS and a high case fatality rate. In this article a summary is given on diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of influenza and on future developments.","Panning, M.",Pneumologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102018/,316
6814,Changes in the coagulation-fibrinolysis balance of endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes: role in disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with infectious diseases,1992,"With increased use of medical imaging, the incidental detection of benign solid liver tumors has become more frequent. Facing with benign disease, the indications for surgery are still object of discussion in light of the stable natural course of most lesions and obvious drawbacks of any surgical intervention; therefore, in most situations, a conservative approach is recommended, and surgery is mainly reserved for those cases with persistent or worsening symptoms, or who are at risk for complications as malignant transformation. The advent of ablative techniques has widened the range of treatment options available to these patients, presenting as a valid alternative to resection in terms of safety and efficacy in selected cases, particularly in patients who are considered poor surgical candidates and with smaller lesions. This review outlines the role of percutaneous ablative methods for benign solid liver tumors that are encountered in adults, providing a per histology analysis of the existing evidence. The up-to-date strategies for management of the most common benign solid tumors are recapitulated.","Carnevale, Aldo; Pellegrino, Fabio; Cossu, Alberto; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Parenti, Gian Carlo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Giganti, Melchiore",Med Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102179/,316
6828,Analysis of early infectious complications in pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation,1999,"In addition to the classical hormonal (tissue-to-tissue) renin-angiotensin system (RAS), there are a paracrine (cell-to-cell) and an intracrine (intracellular/nuclear) RAS. A local paracrine brain RAS has been associated with several brain disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Classically, angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main RAS effector peptide and acts through two major receptors: Ang II type 1 and 2 (AT1 and AT2) receptors. It has been shown that enhanced activation of the Ang II/AT1 axis exacerbates dopaminergic cell death. Several new components of the RAS have more recently been discovered. However, the role of new Ang 1-7/Mas receptor RAS component was not investigated in the brain and particularly in the dopaminergic system. In the present study, we observed Mas receptor labeling in dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in rat mesencephalic primary cultures; substantia nigra of rats, monkeys, and humans; and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from healthy controls and sporadic PD patients. The present data support a neuroprotective role of the Ang 1-7/Mas receptor axis in the dopaminergic system. We observed that this axis is downregulated with aging, which may contribute to the aging-related vulnerability to neurodegeneration. We have also identified an intracellular Ang 1-7/Mas axis that modulates mitochondrial and nuclear levels of superoxide. The present data suggest that nuclear RAS receptors regulate the adequate balance between the detrimental and the protective arms of the cell RAS. The results further support that the brain RAS should be taken into account for the design of new therapeutic strategies for PD.","Costa-Besada, Maria A.; Valenzuela, Rita; Garrido-Gil, Pablo; Villar-Cheda, Begoña; Parga, Juan A.; Lanciego, Jose L.; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L.",Mol Neurobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102204/,316
6846,Life-threatening complications of adult-onset Still’s disease,2014-01-17,"PURPOSE: This paper describes the radiological and clinical findings identified in a group of patients with H1N1 influenza. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and mid-November 2009, 3,649 patients with suspected H1N1 influenza presented to our hospital. Our study population comprised 167 (91 male, 76 female patients, age range 11 months to 82 years; mean age 29 years) out of 1,896 patients with throat swab positive for H1N1 and clinical and laboratory findings indicative of viral influenza. All 167 patients were studied by chest X-ray (CXR), and 20 patients with positive CXR and worsening clinical condition also underwent computed tomography (CT). The following findings were evaluated on both modalities: interstitial reticulation (IR), nodules (N), ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations (CONS), bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Ninety of 167 patients had positive CXR results. Abnormalities identified on CXR, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 53 IR, 5 N, 13 GGO, 50 CONS; the predominant combination was represented by six GGO with CONS. Of the 20 CXR-positive cases also studied by CT, 17 showed pathological findings. The abnormalities identified on CT, variously combined and distributed, were as follows: 14 IR, 2 N, 5 GGO; the predominant combination was 10 GGO with CONS. Despite the differences between the two modalities, the principle radiological findings of bacterial superinfection were tree-in-bud pattern, consolidation with air bronchogram, and pleural and pericardial effusion. Fifteen of the 20 patients studied by both CXR and chest CT showed respiratory complications with bilateral and diffuse CONS on CXR and CT. Six of 15 died: 4/6 of acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2/6 of multiple organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the radiological and clinical characteristics of a large population of patients affected by H1N1 influenza. CXR and chest CT identified the site and extent of the pulmonary lesions and documented signs of bacterial superinfection and pulmonary complications.","Coppola, M.; Porto, A.; De Santo, D.; De Fronzo, S.; Grassi, R.; Rotondo, A.",Radiol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102231/,316

9663,A Curious Case of Confusion in a Patient with Cirrhosis,2020-04-15,"SUMMARY The features of naturally occurring Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype III infections in 16 sheep, one goat and 3 pigs, and Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I infections in 3 goats, are described. Affected animals usually had diarrhoea and were in poor condition or emaciated. A number were moribund or dead when submitted for necropsy. Thickening of the caecal and colonic mucosa was the only gross lesion attributable to Y. pseudotuberculosis infection, with liver or other visceral abscesses not being seen. Characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 10 sheep, one goat and one pig infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III and one goat infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I. Sheep, goats and pigs dosed orally with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III, the serotype isolated most commonly from these species, developed intestinal infection. In sheep and pigs, infection was accompanied by diarrhoea. Haematological changes and specific antibodies were elicited in all 3 species in response to infection. Microabscesses were seen in the intestinal mucosa of all experimentally exposed animals. The occurrence of field cases and the results of experimental exposure confirm that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteropathogen of sheep, goats and pigs. The association of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I with lesions in a goat, indicates that this bacterium may also be a pathogen of this species. It is concluded that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteric pathogen of a wide range of ungulate species including cattle, buffalo, deer, antelopes, sheep, goats and pigs. Serotypes I and II, while having a more restricted host range, are probably also pathogens of ungulates and, in particular, deer, antelopes and goats.","SLEE, KJ; BUTTON, C",Aust Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158859/,316
9795,Inflammasome Is Activated in the Liver of Cholestatic Patients and Aggravates Hepatic Injury in Bile Duct–Ligated Mouse,2019-12-27,"BACKGROUND: The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan that develops in red blood cells (RBCs) and requires various host factors. For its development in RBCs, nutrients not only from the RBC cytosol but also from the extracellular milieu must be acquired. Although the utilization of host nutrients by P. falciparum has been extensively analysed, only a few studies have reported its utilization of host serum proteins. Hence, the aim of the current study was to comprehensively identify host serum proteins taken up by P. falciparum parasites and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum was cultured with human serum in vitro. Uptake of serum proteins by parasites was comprehensively determined via shotgun liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and western blotting. The calcium ion concentration in serum was also evaluated, and coagulation activity of the parasite lysate was assessed. RESULTS: Three proteins, vitamin K-dependent protein S, prothrombin, and vitronectin, were selectively internalized under sufficient Ca(2+) levels in the culture medium. The uptake of these proteins was initiated before DNA replication, and increased during the trophozoite and schizont stages, irrespective of the assembly/disassembly of actin filaments. Coagulation assay revealed that prothrombin was activated and thereby induced blood coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Serum proteins were taken up by parasites under culture conditions with sufficient Ca(2+) levels. This uptake phenomenon was associated with their pathogenicity.","Tougan, Takahiro; Edula, Jyotheeswara R.; Morita, Masayuki; Takashima, Eizo; Honma, Hajime; Tsuboi, Takafumi; Horii, Toshihiro",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161009/,316

Donor quality is often cited as a reason for declining organs offered from donors infected with influenza, presumably due to concern about disease transmission at transplant leading to severe disease. We previously described an excellent outcome after heart transplant from a donor infected with influenza B that had been treated with a complete course of oseltamivir. In this report, we describe a similar outcome after transplantation of an organ from an influenza A‐positive donor with symptomatic disease incompletely treated with oseltamivir. Due to the availability of effective antiviral treatment, we suggest that influenza A is also a manageable donor infection that need not preclude heart placement.","Smith, Clyde J.; McCulloch, Michael D.; Shirley, Debbie‐Ann; L'Ecuyer, Thomas J.",Pediatr Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167790/,316

Report of 19 Cases and Review of the Literature,2004-05-04,"Emergency nurses frequently encounter uncertainty and changes during the management of emerging infectious diseases, which challenge their capability to perform their duties in a well-planned and systematic manner. To date, little is known about the coping strategies adopted by emergency nurses in addressing uncertainty and changes during an epidemic event. The present study explored emergency nurses’ behaviours and strategies in handling uncertainty and practice changes during an epidemic event. A qualitative study based on the Straussian grounded theory approach was established. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses for data collection. Adapting protocol to the evolving context of practice was revealed as the core category. Four interplaying subcategories were identified: (1) Completing a comprehensive assessment, (2) continuing education for emerging infectious disease management, (3) incorporating guideline updates and (4) navigating new duties and competencies. The nurses demonstrated the prudence to orientate themselves to an ambiguous work situation and displayed the ability to adapt and embrace changes in their practice and duties. These findings offer insights into the need for education and training schemes that allow emergency nurses to acquire and develop the necessary decision-making and problem-solving skills to handle a public health emergency.","Lam, Stanley K.K.; Kwong, Enid W.Y.; Hung, Maria S.Y.; Chien, Wai-tong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177466/,316
10728,Maurizio Galderisi. In Memoriam,2020-05-04,"This study evaluated the microbial contamination of health care workers’ (HCWs) mobile phones. The study was conducted at a secondary referral hospital in July 2010. Samples were taken from all surfaces of the mobile phones using a sterile swab, and incubated on Brain Heart Infusion agar at 37.5°C for 24 hr. Any isolated microorganisms were grown aerobically on 5% sheep blood agar and eosin methylene-blue agar medium at 37.5°C for 24–48 hr. The Sceptor microdilution system was used to identify the microorganisms, together with conventional methods. The oxacillin disc diffusion test and double-disc synergy test were used to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacilli, respectively. The mobile phones were also categorized according to whether the HCWs used them in the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, 183 mobile phones were screened: 94 (51.4%) from nurses, 32 (17.5%) from laboratory workers, and 57 (31.1%) from health care staff. In total, 179 (97.8%) culture-positive specimens were isolated from the 183 mobile phones, including 17 (9.5%) MRSA and 20 (11.2%) ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, which can cause nosocomial infections. No statistical difference was observed in the recovery of MRSA (p = 0.3) and ESBL-producing E. coli (p = 0.6) between the HCW groups. Forty-four (24.6%) of the 179 specimens were isolated from mobile phones of ICU workers, including two MRSA and nine ESBL-producing E. coli. A significant (p = 0.02) difference was detected in the isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli between ICU workers and non-ICU workers. HCWs’ mobile phones are potential vectors for transferring nosocomial pathogens between HCWs, patients, and the community.","Ustun, Cemal; Cihangiroglu, Mustafa",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196688/,316
11178,Cognitive Function in Liver Transplantation,2020-03-26,"Hypoxic injury results in cell death, tissue damage and activation of inflammatory pathways. This is mediated by pathological Connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel (HC) opening resulting in osmotic and ionic imbalances as well as cytokine production perpetuating the inflammatory environment. Gap19 is an intracellularly acting Cx43 mimetic peptide that blocks HC opening and thus promotes cell survival. However, native Gap19, which must enter the cell in order to function, exhibits low cell permeability. In this study, Gap19 was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide, Xentry, to investigate if cellular uptake could be improved while maintaining peptide function. Cellular uptake of Xentry-Gap19 (XG19) was much greater than that of native Gap19 even under normal cell culture conditions. Peptide function was maintained post uptake as shown by reduced ethidium homodimer influx and ATP release due to Cx43 HC block. While XG19 blocked pathologic HC opening though, normal gap junction communication required for cell repair and survival mechanisms was not affected as shown in a dye scrape-load assay. Under hypoxic conditions, increased expression of Syndecan-4, a plasma membrane proteoglycan targeted by Xentry, enabled even greater XG19 uptake leading to higher inhibition of ATP release and greater cell survival. This suggests that XG19, which is targeted specifically to hypoxic cells, can efficiently and safely block Cx43 HC and could therefore be a novel treatment for hypoxic and inflammatory diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Investigation of incidence and complication rate of cannula changes in long-term tracheotomized patients suffering spinal cord injury. SETTING: University hospital in Bochum, Germany. METHODS: Prospective data collection of all cannula changes between September 2016 and September 2017. Physicians recorded mechanical complications and techniques to solve them, and/or complications resulting in patient-threatening condition. RESULTS: There were 149 cannula changes during 3191 observation days. Overall, urgent cannula changes occurred 2.1 times per 100 observation days. Within the first 8 weeks after tracheostomy, urgent cannula changes were necessary four times per 100 observation days, and were mandatory less than two times per 100 observation days thereafter. Overall, mechanical complications occurred in 12% of cannula changes, and 8% of cannula changes were accompanied by patient-threatening complications. Accidental decannulation (AD) occurred in 0.97 of 100 observation days. Recannulation after AD was accompanied by 29% of mechanical complications during reinsertion, and 16% led to patient-threatening complications. The major risk factors for mechanical complications were the time lag between cannula change and tracheostomy, and the urgency of the procedure while the thyroid cartilage–jugular distance was significantly associated with patient-threatening complications. CONCLUSION: AD and the requirement for urgent cannula changes are common and often related with mechanical and patient-threatening complications. Even weeks after tracheostomy, caregivers need to be aware of serious events, and therefore provide monitoring, knowledge, and appropriate resources to handle these events.","Wiefhoff, Jan; Jansen, Oliver; Kamp, Oliver; Aach, Mirko; Schildhauer, Thomas A.; Waydhas, Christian; Hamsen, Uwe",Spinal Cord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223970/,316

The synthesis is straightforward and efficient, involving two steps: acylation of aminoquinoline followed by complexation with metal acetate (Cu(2+), Co(2+) and Cd(2+)) or chloride (Zn(2+)). The synthesized QSC compounds were characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction on single crystal. The QSC compounds were preliminary screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activity and the obtained results are very promising. In this respect, the hybrid N-(quinolin-8-yl)-4-chloro-benzenesulfonamide cadmium (II), considered as leading structure for further studies, has an excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 (with a diameters of inhibition zones of 21 mm and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 19.04 × 10(−5) mg/mL), a very good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC25922 (with a diameters of inhibition zones of 19 mm and a MIC of 609 × 10(−5) mg/mL), and again an excellent antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC10231 (with a diameters of inhibition zones of 25 mm and a MIC of 19.04 × 10(−5) mg/mL).","Diaconu, Dumitrela; Mangalagiu, Violeta; Amariucai-Mantu, Dorina; Antoci, Vasilichia; Giuroiu, Cristian Levente; Mangalagiu, Ionel I.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7356327/,316

Environmental perception has been linked with both reproduction and parenting, but links between subjective environmental experiences and breastfeeding remain unclear. Using retrospective data from an online survey of UK mothers of children aged 0–24 months, Cox-Aalen survival models test whether negative subjective environmental experiences negatively correlated with any and exclusive breastfeeding (max n = 473). Matching predictions, hazards of stopping any breastfeeding were increased, albeit non-significantly, across the five environmental measures (HR: 1.05–1.26) Hazards for stopping exclusive breastfeeding were however (non-significantly) reduced (HR: 0.65–0.87). Score processes found no significant time-varying effects. However, estimated cumulative coefficient graphs showed that the first few weeks postpartum were most susceptible to environmental influences and that contrary to our predictions, mothers with worse subjective environmental experiences were less likely to stop breastfeeding at this time. In addition, the hazard of stopping exclusive breastfeeding declined over time for mothers who thought that littering was a problem. The predicted increased hazards of stopping breastfeeding were only evident in the later stages of any breastfeeding and only for mothers who reported littering as a problem or that people tended not to know each other. Perceived harsher physical and social environmental conditions are assumed to deter women from breastfeeding, but this may not always be the case. Women’s hazards of stopping breastfeeding change over time and there may be particular timepoints in their breastfeeding journeys where subjective environmental experiences play a role.","Brown, Laura J.; Myers, Sarah; Page, Abigail E.; Emmott, Emily H.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7662350/,316

A CT scan showed a large pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis, small bilateral pleural effusions and small amount of ascites. Several serological tests were done, which were all found to be normal. Pericardial and pleural fluid aspirates revealed an exudate. Culture of the pleural fluid yielded growth of S. mitis and this was deemed the cause of the polyserositis, which is rare. The patient made a spontaneous recovery. He was started on colchicine by the cardiologists to help prevent pericardial fluid recurrence and this was continued for 3 months.

The Smart Class teaching module is a new online teaching module for rehabilitation-related medical English, the efficacy of which has yet to be established in the literature. Gender differences should also not be ignored in our study, taking into account the proven performance differences between males and females in language learning. MATERIAL/METHODS: First-year physiotherapy students in Grade 2018 and Grade 2019 at Guangzhou Medical University were recruited to participate in this study. Grade 2019, as the experimental group, completed the Smart Class teaching module, while Grade 2018, as the control group, completed the Traditional Class teaching module. The efficacy of both modules was assessed objectively using the students’ medical English exam scores and subjectively using the students’ responses to a questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 242 questionnaires were distributed, and 210 valid questionnaires were returned, of which 119 were from the Smart Class teaching module group and 91 were from the Traditional Class teaching module group. There was no statistically significant difference between the medical English exam scores of the 2 groups (P=0.324). However, the subjective assessment revealed that the students experienced a significantly greater burden from the workload in the Smart Class teaching module group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found both the Smart Class teaching module and the Traditional Class teaching module achieved similar teaching outcomes.

15458,"Deceased Organ Transplantation in Bangladesh: The Dynamics of Bioethics, Religion and Culture",2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a change in physiology resulting from mechanical causes, trauma, or sepsis. Neurological manifestations of FES can vary from mild cognitive changes to coma and even cerebral oedema and brain death. Here, we present an unusual case of cerebral fat emboli that occurred in the absence of acute chest syndrome or right-to-left shunt. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 57-year-old right-handed male was admitted to our department because of unconsciousness after a car accident for 3 days. He suffered from multiple fractures of the bilateral lower extremities and pelvis. This patient had severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Head MRI showed multiple small lesions in the whole brain consistent with a “star field” pattern, including high signals on T2-weighted (T2w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in the bilateral centrum semiovale; both frontal, parietal and occipital lobes; and brainstem, cerebellar hemisphere, and deep and subcortical white matter. Intravenous methylprednisolone, heparin, mannitol, antibiotics and nutritional support were used. Although this patient had severe symptoms at first, the outcome was favourable. CONCLUSIONS: When patients have long bone and pelvic fractures, multiple bone fractures and deteriorated neurological status, cerebral fat embolism (CFE) should be considered. Additionally, CFE may occur without an intracardiac shunt. The early diagnosis and appropriate management of FES are important, and prior to and following surgery, patients should be monitored comprehensively in the intensive care unit. With appropriate treatment, CFE patients may achieve good results.","Wang, Wei; Chen, Weibi; Zhang, Yan; Su, Yingying; Wang, Yuping",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7890386/,316

METHODS: In 2018, health care hospitals were assessed using a World Health Organization (WHO) adapted tool aimed at implementing the WHO’s IPC Core Components. The study included site assessments at 41 of Georgia’s 273 hospitals, followed by structured interviews with 109 hospital staff, validation observations of IPC practices, and follow up document reviews. RESULTS: IPC programs for all hospitals were not comprehensive, with many lacking defined objectives, workplans, targets, and budget. All hospitals had at least one dedicated IPC staff member, 66% of hospitals had IPC staff with some formal IPC training; 78% of hospitals had IPC guidelines; and 55% had facility-specific standard operating procedures. None of the hospitals conducted structured monitoring of IPC compliance and only 44% of hospitals used IPC monitoring results to make unit/facility-specific IPC improvement plans. 54% of hospitals had clearly defined priority healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), standard case definitions and data collection methods in their HAI surveillance systems. 85% hospitals had access to a microbiology laboratory. All reported having posters or other tools to promote hand hygiene, 29% had them for injection safety. 68% of hospitals had functioning hand-hygiene stations available at all points of care. 88% had single patient isolation rooms; 15% also had rooms for cohorting patients. 71% reported having appropriate waste management system. CONCLUSIONS: Among the recommended WHO IPC core components, existing programs, infrastructure, IPC staffing, workload and supplies present within Georgian healthcare hospitals should allow for implementation of effective IPC. Development and dissemination of IPC Guidelines, implementation of an effective IPC training system and systematic monitoring of IPC practices will be an important first step towards implementing targeted IPC improvement plans in hospitals.","Deryabina, Anna; Lyman, Meghan; Yee, Daiva; Gelieshvilli, Marika; Sanodze, Lia; Madzgarashvili, Lali; Weiss, Jamine; Kilpatrick, Claire; Rabkin, Miriam; Skaggs, Beth; Kolwaite, Amy",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903395/,316

Our secondary goals were to assess the impact of EEG programs on participants’ core knowledge, and the agreement between non-experts and experts for seizure identification. SOURCE: Major databases were searched from inception to 30 August 2020. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and descriptive studies were all considered if they reported an EEG curriculum for non-neurologists in a critical care setting. Data were presented thematically for the qualitative primary outcome and a meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed for the quantitative secondary outcomes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-nine studies were included after reviewing 7,486 citations. Twenty-two studies were single centre, 17 were from North America, and 16 were published after 2016. Most EEG studies were targeted to critical care nurses (17 studies), focused on processed forms of EEG with amplitude-integrated EEG being the most common (15 studies), and were shorter than one day in duration (24 studies). In pre-post studies, EEG programs significantly improved participants’ knowledge of tested material (standardized mean change, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 2.73). Agreement for seizure identification between non-experts and experts was moderate (Cohen’s kappa = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to teach basic EEG to participants in critical care settings from different clinical backgrounds, including physicians and nurses. Brief training programs can enable bedside providers to recognize high-yield abnormalities such as non-convulsive seizures.

16089,Association of Anti–Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy With Mortality Among Veterans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION: Although advance care planning may be beneficial for older adults in the last year of life, its relevance following an emergency hospitalisation requires further investigation. This study quantifies the one-year mortality outcomes of all emergency admissions for patients aged 70+ years and explores patient views on the value of advance care planning following acute hospitalisation. METHOD: This mixed methods study used a two-stage approach: firstly, a quantitative longitudinal cohort study exploring the one-year mortality of patients aged 70+ admitted as an emergency to a large multi-centre hospital cohort; secondly, a qualitative semi-structured interview study gathering information on patient views of advance care planning. RESULTS: There were 14,260 emergency admissions for 70+-year olds over a 12-month period. One-year mortality for admissions across all conditions was 22.6%. The majority of these deaths (59.3%) were within 3 months of admission. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated higher one-year mortality with increasing age and male sex. Interviews with 20 patients resulted in one superordinate theme, “Planning for health and wellbeing in the spectrum of illness”. Sub-themes entitled (1) Advance care planning benefitting healthcare for physical and psycho-social health, (2) Contemplation of physical deterioration death and dying and 3) Collaborating with healthcare professionals to undertake advance care planning, suggest that views of advance care planning are shaped by experiences of acute hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: Since approximately 1 in 5 patients aged 70+ admitted to hospital as an emergency are in the last year of life, acute hospitalisation can act as a trigger for tailored ACP. Older hospitalised patients believe that advance care planning can benefit physical and psychosocial health and that discussions should consider a spectrum of possibilities, from future health to the potential of chronic illness, disability and death. In this context, patients may look for expertise from healthcare professionals for planning their future care.","Bielinska, Anna-Maria; Archer, Stephanie; Obanobi, Adetokunbo; Soosipillai, Gehan; Darzi, Lord Ara; Riley, Julia; Urch, Catherine",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935239/,316

A number of studies have shown a correlation between depressive states and the progress of somatic diseases. It seems that the proper cooperation of specialists may result in the improvement of the patient’s well-being and a positive effect on the course of the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as the assessment of the relationship of psychological symptoms with sociodemographic factors and physical condition. Materials and Methods: The study enrolled 51 COPD patients who underwent a three-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. After admission to the rehabilitation department, the subjects were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, the Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: Anxiety states were diagnosed in 70% of respondents and depressive states were diagnosed in 54% of patients. Some of the respondents (14%) also showed a tendency to experience various grounded stresses. Additionally, there were correlations between the mental state and the results of fitness and respiratory tests. Conclusions: Patients with COPD are at risk for mental disorders, which may adversely affect their general health and significantly limit their physical and respiratory efficiencies. The development of widely available therapeutic solutions to reduce symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and stress seems to be an important challenge for the management of patients with COPD.","Wrzeciono, Adam; Czech, Oliver; Buchta, Katarzyna; Zabłotni, Sabina; Gos, Edyta; Tłuczykont, Łukasz; Górecka, Dagmara; Pastuła, Agnieszka; Adamczyk, Mateusz; Jach, Ewa; Świerkowski, Igor; Szary, Patryk; Szczegielniak, Jan",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996584/,316

In 2016–17, Italy experienced a significant avian influenza epidemic caused by a highly pathogenic A(H5N8) virus, which affected domestic premises housing around 2.7 million birds, primarily in the north‐eastern regions with the highest density of poultry farms (Lombardy, Emilia‐Romagna and Veneto). We perform integrated analyses of genetic, spatiotemporal and host data within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. Using continuous and discrete phylogeography, we estimate the locations of movements responsible for the spread and persistence of the epidemic. The information derived from these analyses on rates of transmission between regions through time can be used to assess the success of control measures. Using an approach based on phylogenetic–temporal distances between domestic cases, we infer the presence of cryptic wild bird‐mediated transmission, information that can be used to complement existing epidemiological methods for distinguishing transmission within the domestic population from incursions across the wildlife–domestic interface, a common challenge in veterinary epidemiology. Spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic reveals a highly skewed distribution of virus movements with a high proportion of shorter distance local movements interspersed with occasional long‐distance dispersal events associated with wild birds. We also show how such inference be used to identify possible instances of human‐mediated movements where distances between phylogenetically linked domestic cases are unusually high.","Harvey, William T.; Mulatti, Paolo; Fusaro, Alice; Scolamacchia, Francesca; Zecchin, Bianca; Monne, Isabella; Marangon, Stefano",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048528/,316

Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes can be asymptomatic or lead to disease with clinical symptoms ranging from undifferentiated and self-limiting fever to severe dengue disease, which can be fatal in some cases. Currently, no specific antiviral compound is available for treating DENV. The aim of this study was to identify compounds in plants from Paraguayan folk medicine with inhibitory effects against DENV. We found high virucidal activity (50% maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 24.97 µg/mL) against DENV-2 in the ethanolic extract of the roots of Solanum sisymbriifolium Lam. (Solanaceae) without an evident cytotoxic effect on Vero E6 cells. Three saponins isolated from the root extract showed virucidal effects (EC(50) values ranging from 24.9 to 35.1 µg/mL) against DENV-2. Additionally, the saponins showed inhibitory activity against yellow fever virus (EC(50) values ranging from 126 to 302.6 µg/mL), the prototype virus of the Flavivirus genus, suggesting that they may also be effective against other members of this genus.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: S. mutans ATCC 25,175 in suspension and also combined with C. albicans ATCC 18,804 in biofilm were cultured. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), crystal violet colorimetric assay, and colony-forming unit counting (CFUs/mL) were performed. RESULTS: An increased MIC of chlorhexidine against S. mutans was observed when the drugs were administered mixed in a single formulation and with time intervals in between, except for the 30-min interval. The biofilm optical density (OD) in treatments using chlorhexidine and nystatin combined did not significantly differ from chlorhexidine alone. Either in biofilm colorimetric assay or determination of CFUs, the combined treatments with nystatin administered before chlorhexidine had less effect on chlorhexidine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Nystatin interferes with the action of chlorhexidine against S. mutans. The antimicrobial effectiveness of the combined drugs depends on their concentration, time interval used, and the planktonic or biofilm behavior of the microorganisms. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In view of the great number of patients that can receive a prescription of chlorhexidine and nystatin concomitantly, this study contributes to the knowledge about the effect of the combined drugs.

While critiques of LARC-first programming abound in the Global North, there have been few studies of the impact of LARC-centric programmes on patient-centred outcomes in the Global South. METHODS: Here, we explore the impact of a PPIUD intervention at five Tanzanian hospitals and their surrounding satellite clinics on quality of contraceptive counselling and person-centred care using 20 qualitative in-depth interviews with pregnant women seeking antenatal care at one of those clinics. Using a modified version of the contraceptive counselling quality framework elaborated by Holt and colleagues, we blend deductive analysis with an inductive approach based on open coding and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Interpersonal aspects of relationship building during counselling were strong, but a mix of PPIUD intervention-related factors and structural issues rendered most other aspects of counselling quality low. The intervention led providers to emphasise the advantages of the IUD through biased counselling, and to de-emphasise the suitability of other contraceptive methods. Respondents reported being counselled only about the IUD and no other methods, while other respondents reported that other methods were mentioned but disparaged by providers in relation to the IUD. A lack of trained providers meant that most counselling took place in large groups, resulting in providers’ inability to conduct needs assessments or tailor information to women’s individual situations. DISCUSSION: As implemented, LARC-centric programmes like this PPIUD intervention may decrease access to person-centred contraceptive counselling and to accurate information about a broad range of contraceptive methods. A shift away from emphasising LARC methods to more comprehensive, person-centred contraceptive counselling is critical to promote contraceptive autonomy.","Senderowicz, Leigh; Pearson, Erin; Hackett, Kristy; Huber-Krum, Sarah; Francis, Joel Msafiri; Ulenga, Nzovu; Bärnighausen, Till",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230964/,316
18921,Morbidity and mortality of iatrogenic hemothorax occurring in a cohort of liver transplantation recipients: a multicenter observational study,2021-07-03,"Babesia orientalis, belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, is mainly accountable for water buffalo babesiosis, which adversely affected the livestock industry in China. Variant erythrocyte surface antigen-1 (VESA1), an antigen that helps infected erythrocytes to escape from host immune responses, was first reported in Babesia bovis. Various VESA1 proteins have also been characterized in other Babesia species. Nevertheless, there is no research on the identification and characterization of VESA1 proteins in Babesia orientalis. In this study, the BoVESA1 gene was amplified from both gDNA and cDNA. The results revealed that it is an intronless gene with a full length of 753 bp, encoding a protein of 250 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 28 kDa. The coding sequence (CDS) was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector using a homologous recombination kit and expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein with a molecular weight of 53 kDa. The tertiary structure of BoVESA1 was predicted using the I-TASSER software. The recombinant protein was subjected to western blotting; the immunogenicity of recombinant BoVESA1 (rBoVESA1) was identified by incubating it with B. orientalis-positive serum. The native BoVESA1 was identified using the lysates of B. orientalis-infected water buffalo erythrocytes incubated with the anti-rBoVESA1 mouse serum. The results showed a band of ~ 28 kDa, which is similar to the predicted size. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-rBoVESA1 serum probed indicated a strong signal in the infected RBCs, while the negative control showed no signal. In conclusion, the VESA1 protein was first identified in B. orientalis. This study facilitated further investigation of B. orientalis, and the results indicated that BoVESA1 may serve as a potential candidate antigen for diagnosis and detection of B. orientalis infection.","Han, Zhen; Nie, Zheng; Shu, Xiang; Zheng, Yaxin; Luo, Wanxin; Zhang, Hongyan; Xia, Yingjun; Li, Fangjie; He, Lan; Zhao, Junlong",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8255115/,316

At present, the expansion of human communities overlapping of macaques’ natural habitat causes human-macaque conflicts. To mitigate this problem in Thailand, the National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU), was granted the permit to catch the surplus wild-born macaques and transfer them to the center. Based on the fact that the diets provided and the captive environments were different, their oral-gut microbiota should be altered. Thus, we investigated and compared the oral and fecal microbiome between wild-born macaques that lived in the natural habitats and those transferred to and reared in the NPRCT-CU for 1 year. The results from 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the captive macaques had distinct oral-gut microbiota profiles and lower bacterial richness compared to those in wild macaques. The gut of wild macaques was dominated by Firmicutes which is probably associated with lipid absorption and storage. These results implicated the effects of captivity conditions on the microbiome that might contribute to crucial metabolic functions. Our study should be applied to the animal health care program, with respect to microbial functions, for non-human primates.","Sawaswong, Vorthon; Praianantathavorn, Kesmanee; Chanchaem, Prangwalai; Khamwut, Ariya; Kemthong, Taratorn; Hamada, Yuzuru; Malaivijitnond, Suchinda; Payungporn, Sunchai",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275770/,316
19293,Antileukotrienes for the prevention and treatment of chronic lung disease in very preterm newborns: a systematic review,2021-07-17,"INTRODUCTION: Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilated HABP (vHABP), and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Common pathogens, including Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are prevalent in healthcare settings and have few effective treatment options due to high rates of antibacterial resistance. Resistant pathogens are associated with significantly worse outcomes, relative to patients with susceptible infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) has established efficacy in clinical trials of patients with NP. This review aims to collate data on C/T use for HABP/vHABP/VABP infections in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: This systematic literature review searched online biomedical databases for real-world studies of C/T used to treat Gram-negative respiratory tract infections (RTIs) between January 2009 and June 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies comprising 658 patients were identified. Pneumonia was the most common infection treated with C/T (85%), with a smaller number of unspecified RTIs (9%) and tracheobronchitis (5%) reported. The majority of patients had respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa (92.8%), of which 88.1% were multidrug-resistant. Examination of these studies demonstrated an increase in the percentage of patients receiving the recommended dose of C/T for respiratory infections (3 g q8h or renal impairment-adjusted) over time (36.8% of patients in 2017 to 71.5% in 2020). Clinical success rates ranged from 51.4 to 100%, with 10 studies (55.6% of studies reporting clinical success) reporting clinical success rates of > 70%; microbiological success rates ranged from 57.0 to 100.0%, with three studies (60.0% of studies reporting microbiological success) reporting microbiological success rates of > 70%. Thirty-day mortality ranged from 0.0 to 33.0%, with nine studies (90% of studies reporting mortality) reporting 30-day mortality of < 30%. CONCLUSIONS: The studies identified in this review demonstrate that C/T shows similar outcomes as those seen in clinical trials, despite the higher frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens, and comorbidities that may have been excluded from the trials.

19438,Treatment of the neurogenic bladder in spina bifida,2008-06-01,"We assessed the long-term renal complications in a regional cohort of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) children born in 2002–2004. The study group, comprising 78 children born as ELBW infants (88% of the available cohort), was evaluated with measurement of serum cystatin C, urinary albumin excretion, renal ultrasound, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements. The control group included 38 children born full-term selected from one general practice in the district. Study patients were evaluated at a mean age of 6.7 years, and had a median birthweight of 890 g (25th–75th percentile: 760–950 g) and a median gestational age of 27 weeks (25th–75th percentile: 26–29 weeks). Mean serum cystatin C levels were significantly higher (0.64 vs. 0.59 mg/l; p = 0.01) in the ELBW group. Hypertension was diagnosed in 8/78 ELBW and 2/38 of the control children (p = 0.5). Microalbuminuria (>20 mg/g of creatinine) was detected only in five ELBW children (p = 0.17). The mean renal volume was significantly lower in the ELBW group (absolute kidney volume 81 ml vs. 113 ml; p < 0.001, relative kidney volume 85 vs. 97%; p < 0.001). Abnormally small kidneys (<2/3 of predicted size) were detected in 19 ELBW and four control children (p = 0.08). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the only independent risk factor for renal complications was weight gained during neonatal hospitalization (odds ratio: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.39–0.94). Serum cystatin C and kidney volume are significantly lower in school-age ELBW children. It is important to include systematic renal evaluation in the follow-up programs of ELBW infants.","Kwinta, Przemko; Klimek, Małgorzata; Drozdz, Dorota; Grudzień, Andrzej; Jagła, Mateusz; Zasada, Magdalena; Pietrzyk, Jacek Jozef",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098355/,316

There are puzzling observations indicating that a comprehensive mechanistic model for glomerular filtration is still necessary. There is no doubt that podocytes are essential for glomerular filtration barrier integrity. However, most albumin never reaches the podocyte because it is prevented from entering the glomerular filter at the endothelium level. Another puzzling observation is that the glomerular filter never clogs despite its high load of several kilograms of plasma proteins per day. Recently, we proposed a novel model in which an electrical potential difference is generated across the glomerular filtration barrier by filtration. The model offers novel potential solutions to some of the riddles regarding the glomerular filter.","Menzel, Sylvia; Moeller, Marcus J.",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163769/,316

RECENT FINDINGS: Investigations using animal models and human tissues have identified a T(RM) transcriptional profile and elucidated signals within the tissue microenvironment leading to T(RM) development and maintenance. T(RM) are major contributors to host response in infectious diseases and cancer; in addition, T(RM) contribute to pathogenic inflammation in a variety of settings. Although T(RM) are daunting to study in HIV infection, recent work has helped define their molecular signatures and effector functions and tested strategies for their mobilization. SUMMARY: Exclusive reliance on blood sampling to gain an understanding of host immunity overlooks the contribution of T(RM), which differ in significant ways from their counterparts in circulation. It is hoped that greater understanding of these cells will lead to novel approaches to prevent and/or eradicate HIV infection.","Shacklett, Barbara L.; Ferre, April L.; Kiniry, Brenna E.",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072053/,316

In a population-based prospective cohort study, from foetal life onwards, we constructed reference curves for kidney growth from the third trimester of pregnancy until early childhood, using data from 1,158 healthy children. Kidney size, defined as length, width, depth and volume, was measured in the third trimester of pregnancy and at the postnatal ages of 6 months and 24 months. Analyses were based on more than 2,500 kidney measurements. In the third trimester of pregnancy and at 6 months of age all kidney measurements were larger in boys than in girls. At 24 months of age, these gender differences were only significant for left kidney structures and right kidney length. Both groups showed trends towards smaller left kidney measurements than right kidney measurements at all ages. Gender-specific reference curves based on post-conceptional and postnatal ages were constructed for left and right kidney length, width, depth and volume. We concluded that kidney size is influenced by age and gender. Left kidney size tended to be smaller than right kidney size, except for kidney length. The reference curves can be used for assessing kidney structures by ultrasound in foetal life and early childhood.

We explored the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation (SI) with special attention to patterns according to generation cohort (millennials: 22–37 years old, generation X: 38–53 years old, and baby boomers: 54–72 years old), and assessed the extent to which mood and anxiety disorders account for the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation. Patients in behavioral healthcare services of a large federally qualified health center (n = 4,392) were assessed at baseline on ACEs, SI, and mood and anxiety disorders. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the data. Emotional neglect was the strongest predictor of SI among Millennials (OR = 1.59), Generation X (OR = 1.81), and Baby Boomers (OR = 1.88) after controlling for mood and anxiety disorders, race/ethnicity, and gender. Findings suggest ACEs predict an increased likelihood of having SI over and above the influence of mood and anxiety disorders, in models adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity. Across generations, the association with suicidal ideation was strongest for any child abuse and neglect, but not for household dysfunction. The observed association of ACEs with suicidal ideation suggests that ACEs should be considered as a risk factor and incorporated into screening assessments for suicidal ideation. Lastly, additional research on the association of ACEs and suicidality in individuals not actively being managed in behavioral healthcare settings is also warranted.","Damian, April Joy; Oo, May; Bryant, Daniel; Gallo, Joseph J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8274860/,316

Therefore, an increase in self-control or, on the contrary, the decrease or elimination of impulsive versus compulsive behaviors becomes necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the role of impulsivity versus compulsivity in treatment adherence in the prison population. The study included 134 men from the Penitentiary Center of Granada who were divided into two groups. Group 1 was considered treatment adherent, and Group 2 was considered non-adherent to treatment. The following instruments were used: Symptom Inventory (SCL-90-R), Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI), Impulsivity Scale (UPPS-P), and Compulsive Belief Questionnaire (OBQ-44). Statistically significant differences were found in impulsivity in the dimensions of negative urgency, sensation seeking, and positive urgency, with higher scores in all cases for the non-adherent group than for the adherent group. We also found statistically significant differences in responsibility/inhibition, perfectionism/uncertainty, and importance/control, with higher scores for the non-adherent group compared to the adherent group.

In December 2019, we conducted an assessment of Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV) in Ondo State, in Southwest Nigeria. The objectives were to determine the magnitude of, explore the reasons for, as well as possible solutions for reducing MOV in the State. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using a mixed-methods approach. We purposively selected 66 health facilities in three local government authorities, with a non-probabilistic sampling of caregivers of children 0–23 months for exit interviews, and health workers for knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys. Data collection was complemented with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with caregivers and health workers. The proportion of MOV among children with documented vaccination histories were determined and thematic analysis of the qualitative data was carried out. RESULTS: 984 caregivers with children aged 0–23 months were interviewed, of which 869 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The prevalence of MOV was 32.8%. MOV occurred among 90.8% of children during non-vaccination visits, and 7.3% during vaccination visits. Vaccine doses recommended later in the immunization series were given in a less timely manner. Among 41.0% of health workers, they reported their vaccination knowledge was insufficient. Additionally, 57.5% were concerned about and feared adverse events following immunization. Caregivers were found to have a low awareness about vaccination, and issues related to the organization of the health system were found to contribute towards MOV. CONCLUSIONS: One in three children experienced a MOV during a health service encounter. Potential interventions to reduce MOV include training of health workers about immunization policies and practices, improving caregivers’ engagement and screening of vaccination documentation by health workers during every health service encounter.","Fatiregun, Akinola Ayoola; Lochlainn, Laura Nic; Kaboré, Lassané; Dosumu, Modupeola; Isere, Elvis; Olaoye, Itse; Akanbiemu, Francis Adegoke; Olagbuji, Yetunde; Onyibe, Rosemary; Boateng, Kofi; Banda, Richard; Braka, Fiona",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396738/,316

Data from each country was systematically acquired from five major databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar (for any missing articles and grey literature)). Meta-analytic techniques were then used to estimate the prevalence of various post-stoke psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. A total of 36 articles were accrued from 11 countries, of which 25 were evaluated as part of the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of post-stroke depression as per the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale ranged from 28.00 to 50.24%. Pooled prevalence of post-stroke anxiety based on the HADS and SCAN was 44.19% and 10.96%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment as per the Mini-Mental Status Examination was 16.76%.

20529,The Therapeutic Strategies for Uremic Toxins Control in Chronic Kidney Disease,2021-08-17,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a new world alphavirus and a category B select agent. Currently, no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics are available to treat VEEV exposure and resultant disease manifestations. The C-terminus of the VEEV non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) facilitates cell-specific and virus-specific host factor binding preferences among alphaviruses, thereby providing targets of interest when designing novel antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we utilized an overexpression construct encoding HA-tagged nsP3 to identify host proteins that interact with VEEV nsP3 by mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analyses of the putative interactors identified 42 small molecules with the potential to inhibit the host interaction targets, and thus potentially inhibit VEEV. Three inhibitors, tomatidine, citalopram HBr, and Z-VEID-FMK, reduced replication of both the TC-83 strain and the Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain of VEEV by at least 10-fold in astrocytoma, astroglial, and microglial cells. Further, these inhibitors reduced replication of the related New World (NW) alphavirus Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in multiple cell types, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Time-course assays revealed all three inhibitors reduced both infectious particle production and positive-sense RNA levels post-infection. Further evaluation of the putative host targets for the three inhibitors revealed an interaction of VEEV nsP3 with TFAP2A, but not eIF2S2. Mechanistic studies utilizing siRNA knockdowns demonstrated that eIF2S2, but not TFAP2A, supports both efficient TC-83 replication and genomic RNA synthesis, but not subgenomic RNA translation. Overall, this work reveals the composition of the VEEV nsP3 proteome and the potential to identify host-based, broad spectrum therapeutic approaches to treat new world alphavirus infections.","Bakovic, Allison; Bhalla, Nishank; Alem, Farhang; Campbell, Catherine; Zhou, Weidong; Narayanan, Aarthi",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8402862/,316

We studied the efficacy of an anti-HMGB1 mAb using an in vitro model of TNF-α stimulation or influenza A virus infection in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). METHODS: Vascular permeability of HMVECs was quantified using the Boyden chamber assay under tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation or influenza A virus infection in the presence of anti-HMGB1 mAb or control mAb. The intracellular localization of HMGB1 was assessed by immunostaining. Extracellular cytokine concentrations and intracellular viral mRNA expression were quantified by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative reverse transcription PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Vascular permeability was increased by TNF-α stimulation or influenza A infection; HMVECs became elongated and the intercellular gaps were extended. Anti-HMGB1 mAb suppressed both the increase in permeability and the cell morphology changes. Translocation of HMGB1 to the cytoplasm was observed in the non-infected cells. Although anti-HMGB1 mAb did not suppress viral replication, it did suppress cytokine production in HMVECs.

Despite this, there is scant literature addressing the topic. We aimed to describe demographic characteristics, type of infection, healthcare utilization, disposition and outcomes among patients hospitalized for IDU-related infection over a multi-year period at a large tertiary care referral center in Boston, MA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients hospitalized for IDU-related infection from 1/1/2012-9/30/2015. 901 charts were initially identified using administrative codes; 234 met the following inclusion criteria: 1) hospitalization within the study period for treatment of ≥1 of 6 selected infections and 2) IDU within 6-months preceding qualifying hospitalization. During the study period, 234 patients had 488 cumulative admissions. Admissions for IDU-related infection and ≤30-day readmission, all-cause, underwent detailed abstraction (N = 338; 69%). RESULTS: Of 234 patients, over half were male (57%; N = 134), 78% white (N = 183), 17% homeless (N = 37), 88% had public insurance (N = 210); 53% had a history of Hepatitis C infection (N = 124), most with untreated or unknown infection status (86%; N = 107). Average age was 38 (range 18-75). Fifty-eight percent (N = 136) of patients had one admission during the study period, the remainder had between 2-13 (mean = 3.6). Sentinel admission infection types were 1) skin and soft tissue (SSTI) N = 111 (42%), 2) endocarditis N = 70 (30%), 3) bone and joint N = 26 (10%), 4) pyogenic spinal N = 39 (15%), 5) isolated bacteremia N = 9 (3%) 6) and acute viral hepatitis N = 8 (3%). Of 338 admissions, 57% (N = 192) included infectious disease consultation; 50% resulted in discharge to another facility and 82% (excluding isolated SSTI) required multi-week intravenous antibiotics on discharge. By 15-months following the study period, 12% were deceased (N = 28); 5 died during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our study describes the characteristics of patients hospitalized with IDU-related infection over a multi-year period in a region highly impacted by the opioid epidemic.

Of the estimated 2.1 million deaths in children aged less than 5 years in Southeast Asia in 2010, 47 % are attributable to infectious causes (Liu et al., Lancet 379:2151–2161, 2012). As such, Asia is both vulnerable to imported EIDs and a global focus of major social and environmental change that may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of new pathogens. However, it would be too simplistic to present the extensive changes in Asia as inevitably increasing the risk of EIDs. Some aspects of socio-economic change might serve to reduce the overall risk of infectious disease emergence, but all ecosystem changes have the potential to provide new opportunities for microorganisms to spill-over into human populations.","Horby, Peter W.; Hoa, Ngo Thi; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Wertheim, Heiman F.

24662,The Lung and Its Transplantation and Artificial Replacement,2013-01-08,"With the rising importance of knowledge interchange, many industrial and academic applications have adopted ontologies as their conceptual backbone. Business dynamics and changes in the operating environment often give rise to continuous changes in application requirements that may be fulfilled only by changing the underlying ontologies. This is especially true for Semantic Web applications, which are based on heterogeneous and highly distributed information resources and therefore need efficient mechanisms to cope with changes in the environment. In our previous work we have developed the KAON ontology evolution framework that (i) enables handling the required ontology changes; (ii) ensures the consistency of the underlying ontology and all dependent artefacts; (iii) supports the user to manage changes more easily; and (iv) offers advice to the user for continual ontology reengineering. In this paper we apply the proposed approach on the MEDLINE system and discuss its benefits. First, we translated the MeSH/MEDLINE into a set of the ontologies by enriching the MeSH vocabulary with the set of rules and by eliminating some inconsistencies. Second, we showed that ontology evolution ensures the consistency between all related data. Third, we indicated how formal semantics provided by an ontology might be useful to improve the indexing in the existing MEDLINE system.","Abcckcr, Andrcas; Stojanovic, Ljiljana",Wirtschaftsinformatik 2005,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121047/,316

Thus, prevention of variceal formation (pre-primary prophylaxis) or at least prevention of variceal bleeding are important goals to improve life quality and—if possible—survival of patients with liver cirrhosis. Interruption of the underlying cause of liver disease is the most successful approach, which, however, often fails. For this situation interruption or modulation of different pathophysiological mechanisms leading to fibrosis, hyperdynamic circulation and portal hypertension have been shown effective in animal models. But few could be translated to humans. By contrast, different steps to prevent first bleeding from varices have proven successful in many clinical trials. These applied mainly drugs to lower portal pressure, such as nonselective β-blockers, or endoscopic obliteration of varices, while prophylactic shunt procedures are not advised.","Sauerbruch, Tilman; Trebicka, Jonel",Variceal Hemorrhage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121476/,316

We also describe infection prevention and control strategies applicable to this patient population. These practices focus on clinical interventions and environmental controls designed to prevent the spread of potentially pathogenic organisms in the healthcare setting.

However, for most pathogens, we still have a limited understanding of how this affects epidemiology, persistence and virulence of infections—including several zoonotic pathogens that reside in wild animal reservoirs and spillover into humans. In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) as host for pathogens. This species is widely distributed, often occupying habitats close to humans and livestock, and is an important game bird species and the ancestor to domestic ducks—thereby being an excellent model species to highlight aspects of the wildlife, domestic animal interface and the relevance for human health. We discuss mallard as host for a range of pathogens but focus more in depth of it as a reservoir host for influenza A virus (IAV). Over the last decades, IAV research has surged, prompted in part to the genesis and spread of highly pathogenic virus variants that have been devastating to domestic poultry and caused a number of human spillover infections. The aim of this chapter is to synthesise and review the intricate interactions of virus, host and environmental factors governing IAV epidemiology and evolution.","Wille, Michelle; Latorre-Margalef, Neus; Waldenström, Jonas",Modeling the Transmission and Prevention of Infectious Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123570/,316

Furthermore, TRPV4 controls a MAPK molecular switch from predominately c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK activation, to that of p38 activation, that mediates phagocytosis and cytokine secretion in a matrix stiffness-dependent manner. Expanding knowledge regarding the downstream mechanisms by which TRPV4 acts to tailor macrophage function in pulmonary inflammatory diseases will allow for formulation of novel therapeutics.","Scheraga, Rachel G.; Southern, Brian D.; Grove, Lisa M.; Olman, Mitchell A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333351/,316

38469,Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM),2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND: The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework was developed two decades ago and conceptualizes successful implementation (SI) as a function (f) of the evidence (E) nature and type, context (C) quality, and the facilitation (F), [SI = f (E,C,F)]. Despite a growing number of citations of theoretical frameworks including PARIHS, details of how theoretical frameworks are used remains largely unknown. This review aimed to enhance the understanding of the breadth and depth of the use of the PARIHS framework. METHODS: This citation analysis commenced from four core articles representing the key stages of the framework’s development. The citation search was performed in Web of Science and Scopus. After exclusion, we undertook an initial assessment aimed to identify articles using PARIHS and not only referencing any of the core articles. To assess this, all articles were read in full. Further data extraction included capturing information about where (country/countries and setting/s) PARIHS had been used, as well as categorizing how the framework was applied. Also, strengths and weaknesses, as well as efforts to validate the framework, were explored in detail. RESULTS: The citation search yielded 1613 articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 1475 articles were read in full, and the initial assessment yielded a total of 367 articles reported to have used the PARIHS framework. These articles were included for data extraction. The framework had been used in a variety of settings and in both high-, middle-, and low-income countries. With regard to types of use, 32% used PARIHS in planning and delivering an intervention, 50% in data analysis, 55% in the evaluation of study findings, and/or 37% in any other way. Further analysis showed that its actual application was frequently partial and generally not well elaborated. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous citation analysis of the use of theoretical frameworks in implementation science, we also found a rather superficial description of the use of PARIHS. Thus, we propose the development and adoption of reporting guidelines on how framework(s) are used in implementation studies, with the expectation that this will enhance the maturity of implementation science.","Bergström, Anna; Ehrenberg, Anna; Eldh, Ann Catrine; Graham, Ian D.; Gustafsson, Kazuko; Harvey, Gillian; Hunter, Sarah; Kitson, Alison; Rycroft-Malone, Jo; Wallin, Lars",Implement Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7450685/,316

The chapter reviews the role of international development organizations advocating for and developing frameworks in support of climate change education. This is followed by an analysis of ongoing efforts of climate change education. The chapter argues that more effective education for climate change at the primary and secondary education levels around the world requires context specific strategies that align the specific learning outcomes with the impacts of climate change in that context. Implementing those strategies requires the development of institutional capacity in schools that is aligned to the stage of institutional development of the school. The chapter explains how a multidisciplinary framework that accounts for the cultural, psychological, professional, institutional and political dimensions of the change process can support the development of collaboration and coherence in implementing those climate change education strategies. Those strategies need to also specify the particular populations that need to develop such competencies and the optimal means of delivery. The chapter also situates the literature on climate change education within the larger context of the literature on deeper learning, twenty first century skills and education system change, explaining how deeper learning in climate change education might influence attitudes and behaviors in ways that prevailing didactic approaches focused principally on the transmission of scientific knowledge do not. To develop such context specific climate change education strategies and to build the institutional capacity to implement them, the chapter makes the case for more intentional engagement of universities, in partnership with schools and non-formal education organizations. This would serve the dual role of providing support for schools in advancing climate change education, while also educating higher education students on climate change through problem based, participatory and contextually situated approaches.","Reimers, Fernando M.",Education and Climate Change,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711748/,316

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the single TB vaccine licensed for use in human beings and effectively protects infants and children against severe military and meningeal TB. We applied advanced computational techniques to develop a universal TB vaccine. In the current study, we select the very conserved, experimentally confirmed Mtb antigens, including Rv2608, Rv2684, Rv3804c (Ag85A), and Rv0125 (Mtb32A) to design a novel multi-epitope subunit vaccine. By using the Immune Epitopes Database (IEDB), we predicted different B-cell and T-cell epitopes. An adjuvant (Griselimycin) was also added to vaccine construct to improve its immunogenicity. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict, refined, and validate the 3D structure and then docked with toll-like-receptor (TLR-3) using different servers. The constructed vaccine was used for further processing based on allergenicity, antigenicity, solubility, different physiochemical properties, and molecular docking scores. The in silico immune simulation results showed significant response for immune cells. For successful expression of the vaccine in E. coli, in-silico cloning and codon optimization were performed. This research also sets out a good signal for the design of a peptide-based tuberculosis vaccine. In conclusion, our findings show that the known multi-epitope vaccine may activate humoral and cellular immune responses and maybe a possible tuberculosis vaccine candidate. Therefore, more experimental validations should be exposed to it.","Bibi, Shaheen; Ullah, Inayat; Zhu, Bingdong; Adnan, Muhammad; Liaqat, Romana; Kong, Wei-Bao; Niu, Shiquan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807040/,316
45583,Un test RT-PCR salivaire pour l’Europe,2021-02-09,"Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by a virus through bites or saliva of an infected animal. Dogs are the main reservoir of rabies and responsible for most cases in humans worldwide. In this article, a delay differential equations model for assessing the effects of controls and time delay as incubation period on the transmission dynamics of rabies in human and dog populations is formulated and analyzed. Analysis from the model show that there is a locally and globally asymptotic stable disease-free equilibrium whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, the control reproduction number [Formula: see text] , is less than unity. Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic equilibrium when [Formula: see text] exceed unity which is also locally and globally asymptotically stable for all delays. Time delay is found to have influence on the endemicity of rabies. Vaccination of humans and dogs coupled with annual crop of puppies are imposed to curtail the spread of rabies in the populations. Sensitivity analysis on the number of infected humans and dogs revealed that increasing dog vaccination rate and decreasing annual birth of puppies are more effective in human populations. However in dog populations, the vaccination and birth control of puppies, have equal effective measures for rabies control. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results and control strategies.","Abdulmajid, Shafiu; Hassan, Adamu Shitu",Afr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862050/,316

Then we discuss the overall impact on education sectors, with specific focus on disaster risk reduction (DRR) education and education for sustainable development (ESD). Disaster risk reduction education and ESD are analyzed from the perspective of school-community-family linkages. Specific case analysis of COVID-19 response in the education sector is presented from Omuta City, Japan, which is considered as a champion city for ESD. Four phases of response in Omuta City are characterized with three specific foci: (1) mitigating covid impacts on educational program and participants; (2) preventing exacerbation of covid transmission within and outside schools; and (3) maintaining educational program integrity despite covid. Key lessons are summarized in the concluding section, which explore the importance of (1) educational governance (on critical decision making) during the pandemic as well as with cascading risks; (2) enhancement of school-community-family linkages as pandemic response commonalities between ESD and DRR education; (3) risk communication and citizen behavior; and (4) use of technology. We argue that integration of health and DRR education is important, that resilience needs to be redefined in terms of sustainable development goals (SDGs), and that education plays a vital role in achieving these ends.","Shaw, Rajib; Sakurai, Aiko; Oikawa, Yukihiko",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993903/,316

A nationally representative cross-sectional survey was conducted among 503 health professionals across eight health professions who provided estimates of health service activity standards in Ghana’s Primary Health Care (PHC) settings. Outpatient consultation time was 16 min, translating into an annual standard workload of 6030 consultations per year for General Practitioners. Routine nursing care activities take an average of 40 min (95% CI: 38–42 min) for low acuity patients; and 135 min (95% CI: 127–144 min) for high dependency patients per inpatient day. Availability of tools/equipment correlated with reduced time on clinical procedure. Physician Assistants in health centres spend more time with patients than in district hospitals. Midwives spend 78 min more during vaginal delivery in health centres/polyclinics than in district/primary hospital settings. We identified 18.9% (12 out of 67) of health service activities performed across eight health professional groups to differ between health centres/polyclinics and district/primary hospitals settings. The workload in the health facilities was rated 78.2%, but as the workload increased, and without a commensurate increase in staffing, health professionals reduced the time spent on individual patient care, which could have consequences for the quality of care and patient safety. Availability of tools and equipment at PHC was rated 56.6%, which suggests the need to retool these health facilities. The estimated standard workloads lay a foundation for evidence-based planning for the optimal number of health professionals needed in Ghana’s PHC system and the consequent adjustments necessary in both health professions education and the budgetary allocation for their employment. Finally, given similarity in results with Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) methodology used in Ghana, this study demonstrates that cross-sectional surveys can estimate health service activity standards that is suitable for health workforce planning just as the consensus-based estimates advocated in WISN.","Asamani, James Avoka; Christmals, Christmal Dela; Reitsma, Gerda Marie",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000167/,316
50987,New Therapeutic Landscape in Neuromyelitis Optica,2021-03-30,"Work organization practices, including work flexibility, are changing and can affect worker well-being. Common work flexibility types include working at home, taking time off when needed, and changing one’s work schedule. Given the changes in and the importance of work flexibility, the study assesses its prevalence and association with worker well-being in the United States. We used 2002–2018 General Social Survey—Quality of Worklife (GSS-QWL) data, descriptive statistics, and regression analyses to assess the reported likelihood of job stress, job satisfaction, healthy days, and days with activity limitations among workers reporting work flexibility. The prevalence of work flexibility remained relatively stable during the period examined. Working at home increased the likelihood of job stress by 22% and job satisfaction by 65%. Taking time off decreased the likelihood of job stress by 56% and days with activity limitations by 24%, and more than doubled the likelihood of job satisfaction. Changing one’s schedule decreased the likelihood of job stress by 20% and increased the likelihood of job satisfaction by 62%. This study used all the available data from GSS-QWL and demonstrated the ongoing importance of work flexibility for well-being.","Ray, Tapas K.; Pana-Cryan, Regina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8004082/,316

51550,The Adjuvant Effects on Vaccine and the Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Polysaccharides From Traditional Chinese Medicine,2021-04-01,"Gastrointestinal tract infections with acute diarrhea are indeed a serious cause of concern that held back the swine industry of North East India and among the various etiological agents causing the disease, group A rotavirus is the most common. In this regard, molecular characterization of the viral strains circulating in the region is of utmost importance for a strategic approach to control the disease. Thus, in the present study, diarrheic fecal samples from piglets of Tripura and Assam were evaluated for genotypic characterization of VP7 and VP4 gene of the virus. The samples positive for group A rotavirus were subjected to G and P type determination by nested- multiplex RT PCR as well as nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 gene. Nested- multiplex RT PCR revealed the presence of porcine group A rotavirus in the genotypic combination of G1P[6], G3P[6], G8P[6] and G4P[6] in the two states of North East India. Nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 genes however, revealed emergence of an unusual genotypic combination G26P[13]. VP7 and VP4 nucleotide and its deduced amino acid sequences when compared with global isolates, showed that the present strains shared closest similarity to the porcine rotavirus strain TJ4-1from Japan and hp140 from Eastern India. Identification of a novel genotype G26P[13] in the RVA infected pig population of Tripura and Assam, suggested presence of a greater diversity in rotavirus strains in the region. Thus, it evokes the need for continuous monitoring to assess and consider the strain variability in the design of a suitable vaccine candidate against the virus.

With the similar structures to the binding domains of the three cytokines to their cognate receptors, the novel peptide KCF18 can simultaneously inhibit TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. We elucidated whether KCF18 can alleviate injury of liver in endotoxemic mice. Adult male mice (BALB/cJ) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 15 mg/kg; LPS group) or LPS with KCF18 (LKCF group). Mice in the LKCF group received KCF18 (i.p.) at 2 h (0.6 mg/kg), 4 h (0.3 mg/kg), 6 h (0.3 mg/kg), and 8 h (0.3mg/kg) after LPS administration. Mice were sacrificed after receiving LPS for 24 h. Our results indicated that the binding levels of the three cytokines to their cognate receptors in liver tissues in the LKCF group were significantly lower than those in the LPS group (all p < 0.05). The liver injury level, as measured by performing functional and histological analyses and by determining the tissue water content and vascular permeability (all p < 0.05), was significantly lower in the LKCF group than in the LPS group. Similarly, the levels of inflammation (macrophage activation, cytokine upregulation, and leukocyte infiltration), oxidation, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and apoptosis (all p < 0.05) in liver tissues in the LKCF group were significantly lower than those in the LPS group. In conclusion, the KCF18 peptide–based simultaneous inhibition of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 can alleviate liver injury in mice with endotoxemia.","Shih, Hung-Jen; Chang, Chao-Yuan; Chiang, Milton; Le, Van Long; Hsu, Hao-Jen; Huang, Chun-Jen",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8161041/,316
54211,P482 Safety and efficacy of ustekinumab for Crohn’s disease in the elderly population,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19-related school closures hindered the provision of meals to school-age youth nationwide, risking deficits in nutrition, health, and development. Foodservice staff faced substantial difficulties in their efforts to maintain foodservice operations. The state of Ohio, in which the prevalence of child food insecurity exceeds the national average (18.9% versus 15.2%), offers an illustrative case for exploration of these adaptations. The objective of this study was to characterize COVID-19-related foodservice adaptations, including impacts on both summer and school year meal provision. METHODS: An administrative representative from each Ohio school district was emailed in December 2020 and invited to complete an online survey. This cross-sectional analysis focuses on public school district experiences. RESULTS: Among responding districts (n = 298 of 611, 49%), the majority continued providing meals after the Spring 2020 shutdowns (73%) and functioned as an ‘open site’ (63%), offering food to students’ families and households without district affiliation. Most schools offered meals either once weekly (41%) or once per weekday (30%) and offered an average of 3.7 days-worth of meals at a time. Half (48%) of the districts employed a pre-order system. Districts used various distribution methods: 76% had central school or district-affiliated pick-up point(s); 38% delivered meals to community location(s); and 34% delivered directly to some households. Supply chain disruptions led the vast majority of schools to seek USDA meal pattern waivers. Only 39% of districts maintained food service operations during summer 2020. The majority of districts were hybrid (59%) or fully online (24%) for at least a portion of Fall 2020, yet only 12% reported offering meal delivery or pick-up. Districts reported many “successes” (e.g., feeding students safely) and “challenges” (e.g., extra costs, poor parental participation). CONCLUSIONS: Public school districts in Ohio made numerous COVID-related foodservice adaptations in order to serve both their students and the community at large, though districts reported poor utilization of this service. Future research should evaluate whether reduced access to school meals impacted child food security and food security-related outcomes during this period.

However, compliance with treatment is influenced by patients’ perception of benefits versus risks. Understanding these perceptions and their influence on patients’ treatment decision-making is crucial for achieving compliance, especially during Covid-19 pandemic. Aim: to assess patients’ perception of risks of IBD exacerbation and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their influence on patients’ decisions regarding biologic and immunosuppressive treatments during Covid-19 pandemic in Israel. METHODS: A prospective internet-based survey among Meir Medical Center, IBD clinic patients. RESULTS: 116 patients have responded. Mean age 42 (18–84), 44 (38%) males, 75 (64%) Crohn’s disease, 38 (32%) ulcerative colitis, 34 (29%) with history of abdominal surgery, 47 (40%) were in remission and 9(7.5%) with severe disease. 18 (15%) patients were on Immunosuppressive and 76 (66%) on biologic treatments. Concerns of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection: 56 (48%) patients considered their risk as equal to that of the general population whereas 53 (46%) considered it to be increased. 55% of the patients related the increase risk of COVID-19 infection to their IBD treatment, whereas 47% related it to having IBD. Patients treated with biologics were more concerned of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 then those who were not. There was also a significant association between depression and anxiety levels and the fear of becoming infected (r= 0.3 for depression and 0.4 for anxiety). Adherence to IBD treatment: Only 8 (7.5%) patients considered stopping their IBD treatment, and only 4 (3.7%) patients actually stopped their treatment. Patients with more severe disease were more inclined to stop their treatment compared to those with mild disease. Reasons for not stopping treatment were fear of disease exacerbation in 37 (32%) patients, and reassuring information received from medical providers, in 25 (21.5%) patients. When faced with a theoretical question of trading long-term remission versus risk of SARS-CoV-2infection, 34 (29%) patients were willing to accept a 10% infection risk for a 10-year remission CONCLUSION: Significant portion of the patients with IBD believe that they are at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection, and more than half of them related the increase risk to their IBD treatment. However, despite their fear most patients felt safe enough to continue their treatment. Patients with more severe disease and treated with biologics experienced higher levels of anxiety, depression and fear of COVID-19 infection. Identifying and addressing these fears early might increase patient’s adherence to treatment and prevent the hazardous effects of discontinuation of treatment.","Lior, O; Sergeev, I; Ruhimovich, N; Openheim, M; Benjaminov, F; Feldman, D; Ringel, Y; Naftali, T",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194675/,316

Blood. 2011;118(16):4493-4495.",2015-07-16,"INTRODUCTION: SARS‐CoV‐2 has struck as a major global pandemic causing COVID19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other respiratory diseases gradually affecting multiple organs. Currently, SARS‐CoV‐2 is affecting over 85.1 million global cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 (20.7 millions in US) infections with 1.84 million (0.352 million in US) deaths globally. SARS‐CoV‐2 genome is 30kb in size and makes 29 proteins including key Spike protein (SP) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The SP facilitates the entry of the virus into human host cells. Interactions of potential drugs with the SP can prevent or inhibit the entry of the virus into the host cells by blocking the interaction. Similarly, the non‐structural proteins (nsp) 7 and 8 facilitate the function of the RdRp/nsp12 that is essential for the replication of viral genome leading to multiply and spread of the virus within and from the host. In this study, we have selected 26 known phytochemicals (TC1 ‐ TC26) from medicinally important Ayurvedic plant, Tinospora cordifolia (TC), to study the interactions of these phytochemicals with key SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins using in silico methods. We have identified promising interactions between TC phytochemicals, and the key SARS‐CoV2 proteins that can potentially block the viral entry and/or replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 thereby preventing and treating COVID19. METHODS: A molecular docking algorithm, PatchDock, was used to study the interactions between target proteins and phytochemicals of TC. To filter out the redundant docking predictions resulting from the patch matching system, a RMSD clustering calculation is used. The molecular display program, Chimera, was used to display the interactions between the phytochemicals and SARS‐CoV‐2 viral proteins. RESULTS: Of the 26 compounds tested (TC1 ‐ TC26), 11 showed effective binding to inhibit the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins, SP or nsp7/8/12 complex including RdRp. The effectiveness of the docking compounds was measured in terms of atomic contact energy (ACE) Scores and rankings based on clusters. The compounds TC1, TC4, TC10 and TC14 achieved lower scores (of binding) less than ‐100 showing potential binding to all three viral proteins/complexes, SP, RdRp and nsp7/8/12. Further, analysis indicates that TC4 and TC10 are binding remarkably close to the active site of the SP that binds to the ACE2 receptor of host cells, providing evidence for effective inhibition of the SP. TC1 and TC14 binds between the N‐terminal, palm domain, and thumb domain of the RdRp, creating an interaction inside the active site, substantially inhibiting its critical replication function. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we present in silico evidence that TC4 and TC10, and TC1 and TC14 potentially impair the entry and replication of SARS‐COV‐2 proteins respectively by inhibiting the functions of Spike and RdRp/nsp7‐8/12 proteins respectively.","Badri, Kameswara; Aramgam, Sreelatha; Muppuru, Kesavulu; Kona, Abhishek; Kona, Abhinav",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239793/,316

We aimed to investigate the demographic data, clinical and radiological features of COPD patients permanently residing at the Tibet Plateau (≥3000 meters above sea level). METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study which consecutively enrolled COPD patients visiting the outpatient of Respiratory Medicine at Tibet Autonomous Region People’s Hospital from January 2018 to March 2021. All patients were Tibetan permanent residents aging ≥40 years and met the diagnosis of COPD according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Data including demographic characteristics, altitude of residence, risk factors, respiratory symptoms, comorbidities and medications, as well as computed tomography (CT) measurements were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients with definite COPD were enrolled for analysis. Their mean age was 64.7 (±9.1) years. All patients lived at ≥3000 m above sea level and 34.5% of them lived at ≥4000 m. About 8.3% of the patients were current smokers and 44.0% were ex-smokers. Up to 88.1% of the patients reported long-term exposure to indoor biomass fuels. Most of the patients were classified as having mild-to-moderate (GOLD I: 27.4%; GOLD II: 51.2%) COPD, while 89.3% had a CAT score ≥10. Only 36.9% of the patients received regular long-term medications for COPD in the past year, in whom ICS/LABA and oral theophylline were the most common used pharmacological therapy. On CT scanning, the majority of our patients (70.7%) showed no or minimal emphysema, while signs of previous tuberculosis were found in 45.1% of the patients. CONCLUSION: COPD patients living at the Tibet Plateau had a heavy respiratory symptom burden, but most of them did not receive adequate pharmacological treatment.

PAI due to adrenal hypoplasia (syndromic/non-syndromic) is a rare disorder. MIRAGE is a recently described syndrome with PAI and multisystem involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: A preterm female neonate presenting with PAI and persistent severe thrombocytopenia was diagnosed to have MIRAGE syndrome due to a de novo pathogenic variant c.3406G>C (p. Glu1136Gln) in the SAMD9 gene. In the first year of life, she had recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infection causing failure to thrive. At 17 months, she suffered recurrent intussusception requiring treatment with parenteral nutrition and high-dose steroids. Subsequently, she established oral feeds with hydrolysed formula and demonstrated good weight gain. CONCLUSION: In neonates presenting with PAI and associated multisystem involvement, a thoughtful approach and genetic testing is valuable in discerning an etiological diagnosis. This case of MIRAGE adds to the spectrum of reported cases and is the first to report on recurrent intussusception and its management with high-dose steroids.","Chin, Xinyi; Sreedharan, Aravind Venkatesh; Tan, Ene Choo; Wei, Heming; Kuan, Jyn Ling; Ho, Christopher Wen Wei; Lam, Joyce Ching Mei; Ting, Teck Wah; Vasanwala, Rashida Farhad",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511671/,316

The analysis was carried out by designing a structural equation modeling (SEM), which allowed to analyze the main variables that influenced the happiness of the karate athlete and consequently to study their effect on people's loyalty to sports federations. In particular, Partial least squares SEM was applied in an overall model when it was possible to understand the happiness role in relation with other traditional relevant variables on loyalty. The data were obtained through primary sources employing a survey sent to the autonomous federations in the discipline of karate, obtaining a sample of 682 federated members in Spain. The results of the model revealed that consumer satisfaction, engagement, and meaningful influence on consumer happiness, but engagement was the most important and relevant variable for affecting this variable. Finally, consumer satisfaction and consumer happiness influence loyalty, and consumer satisfaction was the most important variable, but consumer happiness showed a real alternative for improving loyalty in karate sports federations. Then, one of the implications of this work was that it helped to explain how the federations can be managed to achieve loyal consumers together with a more considerable increase in the number of federated members.","Núñez-Barriopedro, Estela; Cuesta-Valiño, Pedro; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Pablo; Ravina-Ripoll, Rafael",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.653034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897562/,316

As is known, most of the present energy supply comes from coal, oil, and natural gas. The overreliance on fossil energy brings serious environmental problems in addition to the scarcity of energy. One of the most concerning environmental problems is the large contribution to global warming because of the massive discharge of CO2 in the burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, many efforts have been made to resolve such issues. Among them, the preparation of valuable fuels or chemicals from greenhouse gas (CO2) has attracted great attention because it has made a promising step toward simultaneously resolving the environment and energy problems. This article reviews the current progress in CO2 conversion via different strategies, including thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, light-capturing agents including macrocycles with conjugated structures similar to chlorophyll have attracted increasing attention. Using such macrocycles as photosensitizers, photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, or coupling with enzymatic reactions were conducted to fulfill the conversion of CO2 with high efficiency and specificity. Recent progress in enzyme coupled to photocatalysis and enzyme coupled to photoelectrocatalysis were specially reviewed in this review. Additionally, the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of different conversion methods were also presented. We wish to provide certain constructive ideas for new investigators and deep insights into the research of CO2 conversion.","Xu, Luyi; Xiu, Yang; Liu, Fangyuan; Liang, Yuwei; Wang, Shengjie",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796612/,316

RESULTS Of the 147 women originally included, 75 (51%) were successfully re-contacted a median of 7 years after the initial surgery. The primary outcome, subjective recurrence of prolapse, was similar between the TVM and the anterior colporrhaphy groups (31 vs 34% respectively). Anatomical recurrence was less likely in the TVM group (67 vs 24%, p = 0.004). Mesh exposure occurred in 4 of the 39 patients (13%) during follow-up, 2 of which had a surgical reintervention. Reintervention for prolapse took place in 7 patients (9%). CONCLUSION Seven-year follow-up showed similar functional outcomes for mesh and native tissue repair in anterior vaginal wall prolapse. TVM did not reduce repeat surgery in the long term; it did, however, reduce anatomical recurrence. Mesh exposure rates were relatively high, but no difference in outcome of pain or dyspareunia was noted.","Allègre, Lucie; Callewaert, Geertje; Alonso, Sandrine; Cornille, Arnaud; Fernandez, Hervé; Eglin, Georges; de Tayrac, Renaud",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-019-04073-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506808/,316

Whilst the boundaries of what can be achieved by advanced endoscopy are continually expanding, we believe that one of the most fundamental steps to achieving our goal is to raise the quality of everyday endoscopy. The development of robust, consensus- and evidence-based key performance measures is the first step in this vision.ESGE and UEG have identified quality of endoscopy as a major priority. This paper explains the rationale behind the ESGE Quality Improvement Initiative and describes the processes that were followed. We recommend that all units develop mechanisms for audit and feedback of endoscopist and service performance using the ESGE performance measures that will be published in future issues of this journal over the next year. We urge all endoscopists and endoscopy services to prioritize quality and to ensure that these performance measures are implemented and monitored at a local level, so that we can provide the highest possible care for our patients.","Rutter, Matthew D; Senore, Carlo; Bisschops, Raf; Domagk, Dirk; Valori, Roland; Kaminski, Michal F; Spada, Cristiano; Bretthauer, Michael; Bennett, Cathy; Bellisario, Cristina; Minozzi, Silvia; Hassan, Cesare; Rees, Colin; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mário; Hucl, Tomas; Ponchon, Thierry; Aabakken, Lars; Fockens, Paul",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1569580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26662057/,316

Current standard microbiological culture-based tests are laborious and time consuming. Thus, patients are initially treated empirically, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians and scientists with a review of recently available commercial multiparametric molecular diagnostics tests for the detection of RTIs so that they can be considered for use instead of, or in combination with, traditional culture techniques. RECENT FINDINGS Several technologies have become commercially available for the multiparametric molecular detection of RTIs in the past decade including tests based on PCR-array, PCR-mass spectrometry, and multiplex qPCR technologies. The majority of these tests are for the detection of viruses, but more recently companies have begun to focus on detection of viruses, bacteria, and associated drug resistances in a single product to maximize the information provided to the clinician by a single test. SUMMARY We describe the recent advances in commercial multiparametric molecular diagnostics technologies for the diagnosis of RTIs. Combining the specific and sensitive molecular detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and drug resistances is key if molecular methods are to replace traditional culture. The reliability of the molecular drug-resistance markers chosen, the need for the quantitative detection of some organisms, and throughput are also important considerations for new technology developers.","Reddington, Kate; Tuite, Nina; Barry, Thomas; O'Grady, Justin; Zumla, Alimuddin",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e32835f1b32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23425918/,316

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Using a full factorial design, first-time donors (N = 2002) were randomly assigned to a no-treatment control condition or to one of seven intervention conditions designed to promote donation competence, autonomy, relatedness, a combination of two (e.g., competence and autonomy), or all three constructs. Participants completed donor motivation measures before the intervention and 6 weeks later, and subsequent donation attempts were assessed for 1 year. RESULTS There was no significant group difference in the frequency of donation attempts or in the number of days to return. Significant effects of group were observed for 10 of the 12 motivation measures, although follow-up analyses revealed significant differences from the control group were restricted to interventions that included an autonomy component. Path analyses confirmed direct associations between interventions involving autonomy and donor motivation, and indirect mediation of donation attempts via stronger donation intentions and lower donation anxiety. CONCLUSION Among young, first-time, whole blood donors, brief interventions that include support for donor autonomy were associated with direct effects on donor motivation and indirect, but small, effects on subsequent donation behavior.","France, Christopher R; France, Janis L; Himawan, Lina K; Fox, Kristen R; Livitz, Irina E; Ankawi, Brett; Slepian, P Maxwell; Kowalsky, Jennifer M; Duffy, Louisa; Kessler, Debra A; Rebosa, Mark; Rehmani, Shiraz; Frye, Victoria; Shaz, Beth H",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224590/,316

Three-dimensionally (3D) printed bioceramic (BioCer) implants consisting of additively manufactured titanium frames enveloped with CaP BioCer or titanium control implants with similar designs were implanted in the ovine skull and at s.c. sites and retrieved after 12 and 3 mo, respectively. Samples were collected for morphological, ultrastructural, and compositional analyses using histology, electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Here, we show that BioCer implants provide osteoinductive and microarchitectural cues that promote in situ bone regeneration at locations distant from existing host bone, whereas bone regeneration with inert titanium implants was confined to ingrowth from the defect boundaries. The BioCer implant promoted bone regeneration at nonosseous sites, and bone bonding to the implant was demonstrated at the ultrastructural level. BioCer transformed to carbonated apatite in vivo, and the regenerated bone displayed a molecular composition indistinguishable from that of native bone. Proof-of-principle that this approach may represent a shift from mere reconstruction to in situ regeneration was provided by a retrieved human specimen, showing that the BioCer was transformed into well-vascularized osteonal bone, with a morphology, ultrastructure, and composition similar to those of native human skull bone.","Omar, Omar; Engstrand, Thomas; Kihlström Burenstam Linder, Lars; Åberg, Jonas; Shah, Furqan A; Palmquist, Anders; Birgersson, Ulrik; Elgali, Ibrahim; Pujari-Palmer, Michael; Engqvist, Håkan; Thomsen, Peter",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2007635117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046631/,316

This study compared the lobar perfusion determined by scintigraphy (PS) with data from SPECT/low-dose-CT (SPECT/ldCT) analyzed manually and semi-automatic. METHODS Retrospective analysis on 39 patients (m/f = 25/14; age: 72.5 [22-89] years) with indication for pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy. Imaging was performed using SPECT/ldCT. Data was analyzed manually and by semi-automatic software. Readers' confidence in 3D-segmentation was scored by two independent readers. Interrater agreement was calculated. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation and Wilcoxon's test were used. RESULTS Results from PS differed significantly from SPECT/ldCT processed manually or semi-automatically in 4/5 lobes (total difference ≤21.6%; rho ≥0.44) and in 3/5 (total difference 21.6%; rho ≥0.37), respectively. Readers' confidence in 3D-segmentation showed a perfect interrater agreement (κ = 0.98). CONCLUSION Quantification of lobar perfusion by SPECT/ldCT differs significantly from planar scintigraphy (e.g., with potential influence on therapy).

Approaches with open access in silico tools have revolutionized disease management due to early prediction of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles of the chemically designed and eco-friendly next-generation drugs. AREAS COVERED This review meticulously encompasses the fundamental functions of open access in silico prediction tools (webservers and standalone software) and advocates their use in drug discovery research for the safety and reliability of any candidate-drug. This review also aims to help support new researchers in the field of drug design. EXPERT OPINION The choice of in silico tools is critically important for drug discovery and the accuracy of ADMET prediction. The accuracy largely depends on the types of dataset, the algorithm used, the quality of the model, the available endpoints for prediction, and user requirement. The key is to use multiple in silico tools for predictions and comparing the results, followed by the identification of the most probable prediction.","Kar, Supratik; Leszczynski, Jerzy",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1798926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735147/,316

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effectiveness of supervised exercise compared to non-supervised home-based exercise after total hip replacement on patient-reported function, hip-pain, health-related quality of life and performance-based function. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of supervised exercise compared to non-supervised home-based exercise. An electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase and CINAHL on 14 March 2018. The methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Seven studies were included with a total of 389 participants. A small and non-significant difference in favour of the supervised groups was found in patient-reported function (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to 0.02)), hip-related pain (SMD -0.03 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.21)), health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) -3.08 (95% CI -6.29 to 0.14)) and performance-based function (SMD -0.26 (95% CI -0.68 to 0.17)) at end of treatment and in patient-reported function (MD -1.31 (95% CI -3.79 to 1.16)) at the 6- to 12-month follow-up. LIMITATIONS: The literature search was systematic, but limited to three databases. The overall quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate due to lack of blinding in included studies. CONCLUSION: Supervised exercise was not significantly effective compared to non-supervised home-based exercise on patient-reported function, pain, health-related quality of life and performance-based function after primary total hip replacement.

63434,Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular flow diverters are increasingly used for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) in a consecutive series of 50 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Inclusion criteria were wide-neck, blister-like, or fusiform/dissecting aneurysms independent of size, treated with the FRED between February 2014 and May 2015. Assessment criteria were aneurysm occlusion, manifest ischemic stroke, bleeding, or death. The occlusion rate was assessed at 3 months with flat panel CT and at 6 months with DSA by using the Raymond classification and the O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale. RESULTS Fifty patients with 52 aneurysms were treated with 54 FREDs; 20 patients were treated with the FRED and coils. Aneurysm size ranged from 2.0 to 18.5 mm. Deployment of the FRED was successful in all cases. There were no device-associated complications. One patient developed mild stroke symptoms that fully receded within days. There have been no late-term complications so far and no treatment-related mortality. Initial follow-up at 3 months showed complete occlusion in 72.3% of the overall study group, Six-month follow-up showed total and remnant-neck occlusion in 87.2% of patients, distributed over 81.5% of the FRED-only cases and 95.0% of the cases with combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS The FRED flow diverter is a safe device for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms of various types. Our data reveal high occlusion rates at 3 and 6 months, comparable with those in other flow diverters. Long-term occlusion rates are expected.","Luecking, H; Engelhorn, T; Lang, S; Goelitz, P; Kloska, S; Roessler, K; Doerfler, A",AJNR.

Societal and familial poverty, loss or incapacitation/illness of parents, lack of social security and protection, and ignorance about the value of, or limited access to, education are among the myriad reasons for the involvement of children in the workforce. Child labour is a barrier to the development of individual children and their society and economy. Global estimates indicate that 152 million children (64 million girls and 88 million boys) are working, accounting for almost one in 10 of all children worldwide. Currently the COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market consequences are having a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, impoverished families and their children are often the first to suffer, which may push many more vulnerable children into child labour situations. Child labour in India is more prevalent than in many other countries, with approximately 10 million children actively engaged in, or seeking, work. This paper focuses on the issue of child labour, its causes and its ill effects. Further, it also reviews the international legal framework relating to child labour and legislative issues in India.

METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for original studies describing sleep abnormalities in children and adolescents with or without pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pooled estimates for various sleep abnormalities were calculated using a random-effect model. RESULTS Of 371 articles screened, 16 studies were included. Among these, five studies were in preschool children, two were in children with pre-existing neurobehavioral disorders and the remaining were in school going children and adolescents. The outcome measures used for sleep were markedly heterogeneous across the studies. The pooled prevalence of any sleep disturbance in children during the pandemic was 54%(95%CI:50-57%). Interestingly, the prevalence in pre-school children was lower than pre-pandemic times (RR = 0.87; 95% CI:0.58-1.30) but this was not statistically significant. The pooled prevalence of children not meeting sleep recommendation was 49% (95%CI: 39-58%). CONCLUSION The prevalence of sleep problems in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic is alarming. Pre-school children had a trend towards relatively fewer sleep disturbances due to home confinement measures in comparison with pre-pandemic times. Sleep duration recommendations were not met in nearly half of healthy children. However, these conclusions need to be seen in light of limited literature on the topic, few included studies done in heterogenous populations, and dubious quality of inferences drawn from these studies which were predominantly online surveys.

This study evaluates physical and psychosocial effects of exercise on renal transplant recipients (RTRs). PATIENTS AND METHODS Eight RTRs were evaluated before and after an exercise training consisting of thirty 40-minute sessions, three times a week, performed with the interval training technique. RESULTS Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) significantly decreased (p<0.04 and <0.008, respectively). Quality of life mean scores (SF-36 test) significantly increased (p<0.000). No differences were recorded for muscle and fat mass, maximal explosive power of the lower limbs, alkaline and acid phosphatase, parathormone (PTH), myoglobin, lipoprotein-A, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), at rest heart rate, and cardiac troponin. IL-6 decreased from 2.8±0.6 to 1.7±0.5 pg/mL (p<0.01). Resting MAP fell from 112±4 to 99±3 mmHg (p<0.02). The metabolic threshold rose from 33±4 to 43±5% (p<0.033). The blood lactate level at peak exercise increased from 5.2±0.9 to 6.2±0.7 mmol/L (p<0.012). The maximum oxygen uptake increased from 1200±210 to 1359±202 mL/min (p<0.05), iso-load oxygen uptake decreased from 1110±190 to 1007±187 mL/min (p<0.034). The maximum working capacity increased from 90±14 to 115±15 watts (p<0.000).

This study sought to examine the impact of COVID-19's stay-at-home order on daily vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and MVCs in Connecticut. METHODS Using an interrupted time series design, we analysed daily VMT and MVCs stratified by crash severity and number of vehicles involved from 1 January to 30 April 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. MVC data were collected from the Connecticut Crash Data Repository; daily VMT estimates were obtained from StreetLight Insight's database. We used segmented Poisson regression models, controlling for daily temperature and daily precipitation. RESULTS The mean daily VMT significantly decreased 43% in the post stay-at-home period in 2020. While the mean daily counts of crashes decreased in 2020 after the stay-at-home order was enacted, several types of crash rates increased after accounting for the VMT reductions.

65013,Combined Intravenous Thrombolysis and Thrombectomy vs Thrombectomy Alone for Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Pooled Analysis of the SWIFT and STAR Studies.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Coronaviruses which are single-stranded RNAs, are members of a large family of viruses that may be important pathogens for humans. SARS-CoV-2 was found to cause the severe respiratory syndrome, and on January 22, 2020 first human-to-human transmission was reported. We aimed to reveal the complete genomes of 19 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Denizli province and identify Turkish patients' genetic similarities. METHODOLOGY 15 samples with the highest viral loads resulting from RT-PCR were selected for NGS analysis. Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis and uploaded to the GISAID database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using MEGAX software. RESULTS Whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA samples revealed 32 missense, 21 synonymous, and 4 non-coding alleles. In all samples c.1-25C>T (5'UTR), c.14144C>T (ORF1ab), c.2772C>T (ORF1ab) and c.1841A>G(S) mutations were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the present study's genomes are in 20B clade while the two are in 20A. The phylogenetic tree constructed with all complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Turkey showed that the viruses were spread nearly homogenous on eastern (around Kars) and western (around Istanbul) sides. CONCLUSIONS Here, we reported the viral genomes in Denizli comprehensively for the first time. We identified 11 rare missense mutations in the virus compared to the reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that while most of our isolates were similar to European sequences, some had different sublineages depending on their genomic variants.","Tokgun, Onur; Caliskan, Ahmet; Coskun, Cagil; Tokgun, Pervin Elvan; Akca, Hakan",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956645/,316

Our objectives were to compare gender differences in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS Data sources: Studies from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. RESULTS We included four eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low risk of bias. COVID-19 vaccine was significantly effective in both males and females. Slightly more SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in females than in males, but the difference was not significant (RR 1.064 [0.888-1.274]; p = .502, I2 = 5.7%; p = .367, 643,127 participants). CONCLUSION Despite significant biological and behavioral differences between males and females, we found no significant gender differences in the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, especially in younger populations.

66012,Dynamic cerebral autoregulation is an independent outcome predictor of acute ischemic stroke after endovascular therapy.,2020-05-15,"Introduction/Purpose: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and in the United States alone, CVD causes nearly 840,000 deaths annually. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tool to assess brain activity, researchers have identified some brain-behavior connections and predicted several self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample characteristics of individuals with CVD who participated in fMRI studies. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. No date or language restrictions were applied and research methodology filters were used. In October 2017, 1659 titles and abstracts were identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) utilized an empirical study design, (2) used fMRI to assess brain activity, and (3) focused on patients with CVD-related chronic illness. Articles were excluded if they: were theory or opinion articles, focused on mental or neuropathic illness, included non-human samples, or were not written in English. After duplicates were removed (230), 1,429 titles and abstracts were reviewed based on inclusion criteria; 1,243 abstracts were then excluded. A total of 186 studies were reviewed in their entirety; after additional review, 142 were further excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles met criteria and were included in the final review. An evidence table was created to capture the demographics of each study sample. Results: Ninety eight percent of the studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Most studies (66%) contained more men than women. Mean age ranged from 38 to 78 years; 77% reported mean age ≥50 years. The most frequently studied CVD was stroke (86%), while hypertension was studied the least (2%). Conclusion: Understanding brain-behavior relationships can help researchers and practitioners tailor interventions to meet specific patient needs. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed that focus on populations historically underrepresented in fMRI research. Researchers should thoughtfully consider diversity and purposefully sample groups by including individuals that are: women, from diverse backgrounds, younger, and diagnosed with a variety of CVD-related illnesses. Identifying and addressing these gaps by studying more representative samples will help healthcare providers reduce disparities and tailor interventions for all CVD populations.","Jones, Lenette M; Ginier, Emily; Debbs, Joseph; Eaton, Jarrod L; Renner, Catherine; Hawkins, Jaclynn; Rios-Spicer, Rosanna; Tang, Emily; Schertzing, Catherine; Giordani, Bruno",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32477079/,316

Background: While at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the need for intensive care is increasing, the specific care needs of patients are still largely unknown. This is a challenge for the work of intensive care staff. AIM The aim of the study is to understand how intensive care nurses perceive their working conditions and the consequences for patient care. METHODS The study is a qualitative survey. Using a web-based questionnaire, narratives of n = 902 nurses were collected. This article reports the perceptions of n = 397 intensive care nurses. The evaluation is based on the qualitative content analysis according to 18-2Mayring (2015). RESULTS The analysis of the data shows the following six categories: ""The lack of staff is extremely noticeable"" to ""Waiting for something"", ""struggle for PPE (personal protective equipment)"", ""time to learn"", ""considerable discrepancy"" in patient care, ""attempts to compensate"" and ""constantly a bad feeling"". The tension between the lack of knowledge and information on the one hand and the professional demand to do justice to the seriously ill and their relatives on the other hand, brings nurses to their professional limits. CONCLUSION Conditions for ethical decision making have to be developed and concepts for a clear attribution of autonomy and responsibility for intensive care nurses must be introduced.","Begerow, Anke; Michaelis, Ulrike; Gaidys, Uta",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811326/,316

Our aim was to compare the outcome of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in low and high SES group. Prospective cohort study of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals. Electronic case notes were analysed for baseline characteristics and admission investigations. Scottish Index for Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) was used to divide patients into two groups: more deprived (SIMD 1-5) and less deprived (SIMD 6-10) and results compared. Poor outcome was defined as either need for intubation and/or death. 173 patients were identified, one was excluded. 108 (62.8%) were males, mean age was 68.5 ± 14.7 years. Commonest comorbidity was hypertension 87 (50.6%). 117 (68.0%) patients were in more deprived group. Baseline characteristics, admission blood profile and reason for admission were evenly matched in both groups. Outcomes were comparable in both groups: transfer to critical care (27.4% vs 27.3%, p 0.991), intubation (18.8% vs 20.2%, p 0.853), 30-day all-cause mortality (19.7% vs 14.5%, p 0.416) and overall poor outcome (30.8% vs 30.9%, p 0.985). Median time to discharge was 7 days longer (17 vs 10 days, p=0.018) and median time to death was 4.5 days longer in more deprived group (17 vs 12.5 days, p=0.388). Contrary to recent literature on COVID-19 in other geographical areas, our study suggests that the SES does not have any impact on outcome of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, however it negatively impacts length of stay.

Our hypotheses were that being a junior doctor, having a previous mental health diagnosis and treating Covid-19 positive patients would predict higher rates of distress. METHODS Cross-sectional survey conducted via Survey Monkey. Voluntary participants were recruited from the mailing list of a national-based referral service for doctors to psychiatrists. Distress was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Demographic factors were analysed for predictive value of a higher rating on the K10. Areas of concern in relation to Covid-19 and preference for support services were measured on a Likert scale and compared to levels of distress. RESULTS The rate of very high distress was 15%. Being a junior doctor and having a previous mental health diagnosis were predictive factors of a higher K10 score. K10 was not affected by likelihood of contact with Covid-19-positive patients. Social isolation had a larger impact on mental health in the context of a previous psychiatric diagnosis. Face-to-face assessments were preferred.

Here, we generate Setd1a mutant mice carrying the frameshift mutation that closely mimics a loss-of-function variant of SCZ. Our Setd1a (+/-) mice display various behavioral abnormalities relevant to features of SCZ, impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and altered expression of diverse genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders and synaptic functions in the mPFC. RNAi-mediated Setd1a knockdown (KD) specifically in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC only recapitulates impaired sociality among multiple behavioral abnormalities of Setd1a (+/-) mice. Optogenetics-assisted selective stimulation of presynaptic neurons combined with Setd1a KD reveals that Setd1a at postsynaptic site is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that reduced SETD1A may attenuate excitatory synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ.","Nagahama, Kenichiro; Sakoori, Kazuto; Watanabe, Takaki; Kishi, Yusuke; Kawaji, Keita; Koebis, Michinori; Nakao, Kazuki; Gotoh, Yukiko; Aiba, Atsu; Uesaka, Naofumi; Kano, Masanobu",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937141/,316

66605,Studying Kidney Diseases at the Single-Cell Level.,2021-09-01,"Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is an emerging RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family that was recently discovered in domestic cats (Felis catus). To date, 2 genotypes (FeMV-1 and FeMV-2) have been detected in cats from various countries, and FeMV-1 is recognized as a pathogen associated with nephritis. However, information regarding the pathological roles and potential transmission to other felids is limited. In this article, we describe the identification of FeMV in 2 black leopards (Panthera pardus) in Thailand that showed severe azotemia and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Molecular analysis of the partial coding sequence of the L gene revealed that these leopard FeMV strains were genetically close to the FeMV-1 isolate from domestic Thai cats. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses using polyclonal IgG antibodies against the FeMV matrix (M) protein showed FeMV-M antigen in renal tubular epithelial cells. These analyses also showed infiltrating lymphocytes in the renal parenchymal lesions and in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells residing in the spleen, suggesting viral tropism and a possible pathological role. These findings are the first evidence that indicates that the black leopard could be a possible host for FeMV infection. As for other cats, the role of FeMV as a potential cause of renal disease remains to be established. The pathogenesis of FeMV infection in black leopards, or in other wild felids, through a viral transmission mechanism warrants further investigation.","Piewbang, Chutchai; Chaiyasak, Surangkanang; Kongmakee, Piyaporn; Sanannu, Saowaphang; Khotapat, Pornsuda; Ratthanophart, Jadsada; Banlunara, Wijit; Techangamsuwan, Somporn",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820948820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830605/,316

The present study used a subcutaneous rat model to compare the tissue response, including macrophage phenotype, remodeling potential, and calcification propensity of a biologic scaffold composed of glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (GF-BP), the standard of care for heart valve replacement, with those of an electrospun polycarbonate-based supramolecular polymer scaffold (ePC-UPy), urinary bladder extracellular matrix (UBM-ECM), and a polypropylene mesh (PP). The ePC-UPy and UBM-ECM materials induced infiltration of mononuclear cells throughout the thickness of the scaffold within 2 days and neovascularization at 14 days. GF-BP and PP elicited a balance of pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and anti-inflammatory (M2-like) macrophages, while UBM-ECM and ePC-UPy supported a dominant M2-like macrophage phenotype at all timepoints. Relative to GF-BP, ePC-UPy was markedly less susceptible to calcification for the 180 day duration of the study. UBM-ECM induced an archetypical constructive remodeling response dominated by M2-like macrophages and the PP caused a typical foreign body reaction dominated by M1-like macrophages. The results of this study highlight the divergent macrophage and host remodeling response to biomaterials with distinct physical and chemical properties and suggest that the rat subcutaneous implantation model can be used to predict in vivo biocompatibility and regenerative potential for clinical application of cardiovascular biomaterials.","Cramer, Madeline; Chang, Jordan; Li, Hongshuai; Serrero, Aurelie; El-Kurdi, Mohammed; Cox, Martijn; Schoen, Frederick J; Badylak, Stephen F",Journal of biomedical materials research.

This study, therefore, revisited results of an earlier published clinical trial investigating the effects of the herbal drug preparation from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides EPs 7630, administered as add-on therapy in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with respect to HRQoL and other PRO. METHODS A total of 199 adults diagnosed with COPD stages II/III and receiving standard treatment according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) were randomly assigned to add-on therapy with EPs 7630 or placebo for 24 weeks.

Learners identified specifically what went well with each module session (Plus) and how to improve for the next time (Delta). After each session, narrative responses were reviewed, aggregated into meaningful categories, and implemented when possible. Implemented improvements focused on increasing session interactivity and enhancing communication. Learners pointed to the uniqueness of the model and applauded efforts to embed them in the cocreation process. Asking learners to debrief their experience-especially during a module which is iteratively redesigned week-by-week-can offer a realistic view of what is working and what needs further refinement.

The value of chest computed tomography (CT) is debatable during the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Compared with traditional chest X-ray radiography, quantitative CT may supply more information, but its value on COVID-19 patients was still not proven. Methods An automatic quantitative analysis model based on a deep network called VB-Net for infection region segmentation was developed. A quantitative analysis was performed for patients diagnosed as severe COVID 19. The quantitative assessment included volume and density among the infectious area. The primary clinical outcome was the existence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A univariable and multivariable logistic analysis was done to explore the relationship between the quantitative results and ARDS existence. Results The VB-Ne model was sensitive and stable for pulmonary lesion segmentation, and quantitative analysis indicated that the total volume and average density of the lung lesions were not related to ARDS. However, lesions with specific density changes showed some influence on the risk of ARDS. The proportion of lesion density from -549 to -450 Hounsfield unit (HU) was associated with increased risk of ARDS, while the density was ranging from -149 to -50 HU was related to a lowered risk of ARDS. Conclusions The automatic quantitative model based on VB-Ne can supply useful information for ARDS risk stratification in COVID-19 patients during treatment.","Wang, Yi; Chen, Yuntian; Wei, Yi; Li, Man; Zhang, Yuwei; Zhang, Na; Zhao, Shuang; Zeng, Hanjiang; Deng, Wen; Huang, Zixing; Ye, Zheng; Wan, Shang; Song, Bin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566621/,316

Introduction of flow-diverting stents has revolutionized the treatment of aneurysms with wide necks and of complex morphology. The authors report their experience with the endovascular treatment of fusiform aneurysms using the Pipeline Embolization Device. METHODS A retrospective review of 146 patients with cerebral aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device between June 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Twenty-four patients were identified as having fusiform aneurysms. Twenty-four aneurysms in these 24 patients were treated. The mean patient age was 59 years. There were 9 men and 15 women. Angiographic and clinical data (including the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score) were recorded at the time of treatment and at follow-up. The aneurysms were located in the internal carotid artery in 8 patients (33.3%), middle cerebral artery in 8 patients (33.3%), anterior cerebral artery in 1 patient (4%), and vertebrobasilar circulation in 7 patients (29%). The aneurysms were smaller than 10 mm in 3 patients, 10-25 mm in 16 patients, and larger than 25 mm in 5 patients. The mean largest dimension diameter was 18 mm. RESULTS Stent deployment was successful in all cases. The minor procedural morbidity was 4% (1 case). Morbidity and mortality related to aneurysm treatment were 4.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The mean mRS scores preoperatively and at clinical follow-up (median 6.0 months, mean 6.9 months) were 0.71 and 1.2, respectively (91.7% presented with an mRS score of 2 or better, and 79.2% had an mRS score of 2 or better at the 6.0-month follow-up). At clinical follow-up, 82.6% of patients were stable or had improved, 13.0% worsened, and 4.2% had died. Twenty-two (91.7%) of 24 patients had follow-up angiography available (mean follow-up time 6.3 months); 59% had excellent angiographic results (> 95% or complete occlusion), 31.8% had complete aneurysm occlusion, 27.3% had greater than 95% aneurysm occlusion, 18.2% had a moderate decrease in size (50%-95%), 4.5% had a minimal decrease in size (< 50%), 13.6% had not changed, and 4.5% had an increase in size. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates that endovascular treatment of fusiform cerebral aneurysms with flow diversion was a safe and effective treatment. Procedural complications were low. Long-term morbidity and mortality rates were acceptable given the complex nature of these lesions.","Monteith, Stephen J; Tsimpas, Asterios; Dumont, Aaron S; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Gonzalez, L Fernando; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Jabbour, Pascal",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2013.12.jns13945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460489/,316

68354,Complete infrahepatic inferior vena cava occlusion presenting as congenital absence.,2011,"BACKGROUND Full-thickness rectal prolapse has a significant negative impact on quality of life. The therapeutic options, specifically in elderly patients, are imperfect. Perineal stapled rectal prolapse resection is a novel operation for treating external rectal prolapse. Long-term follow-up following this procedure is lacking. In our study, we report a long-term follow-up of 30 patients, analyzing the long-term recurrence rate, morbidity, and functional outcome. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the long-term results of perineal stapled rectal resection in a population unfit for prolonged general anesthesia. DESIGN This was a cohort study with a prospective follow-up. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a single tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Patients undergoing perineal stapled rectal resection from January 2010 to June 2013 were included. INTERVENTIONS Perineal stapled rectal prolapse resection was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measured was prolapse recurrence. RESULTS A total of 30 patients underwent the surgical intervention. The median follow-up period was 61 months (range, 37-65). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Six patients (20%) had recurrent rectal prolapse, and continence was not achieved in any of the patients. Two patients who had recurrence underwent a redo perineal stapled rectal resection. LIMITATIONS This study was limited by the small cohort of selected patients. CONCLUSIONS Frail patients that can only endure a short procedure under regional anesthesia should be considered for perineal stapled rectal prolapse resection. The lack of mortality and morbidity, specifically in this population, along with the low long-term recurrence rates, make this a favorable surgical alternative.

68407,Ethics for laboratory professionals during the Covid pandemic.,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND/AIMS To investigate sequential changes in laboratory markers after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the relationship of these changes to the severity of the underlying liver disease. METHODS This retrospective analysis included 65 patients (44 males, 21 females) who underwent RFA of HCC. Hematologic and biochemical markers were assessed at the pre-RFA period and 1 day, 2-3 days, and 1-2 weeks after RFA. We classified the subjects into two groups: Child-Pugh A (n=41) and Child-Pugh B (n=24). The ablative margin volume (AMV) of each patient was measured. We analyzed the changes in laboratory profiles from the baseline, and investigated whether these laboratory changes were correlated with the AMV and the Child-Pugh classification. RESULTS Most of the laboratory values peaked at 2-3 days after RFA. AMV was significantly correlated with changes in WBC count, hemoglobin level, and serum total bilirubin level (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.324-0.453; P<0.05). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level varied significantly over time (P=0.023). CONCLUSIONS Most of the measured laboratory markers changed from baseline, peaking at 2-3 days. The ALT level was the only parameter for which there was a significant difference after RFA between Child-Pugh A and B patients: it increased significantly more in the Child-Pugh A patients.","Shin, Sang-Wook; Jeong, Woo Kyoung; Lim, Sanghyeok; Kim, Yongsoo; Kim, Jinoo",Clinical and molecular hepatology,https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2015.21.1.71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25834804/,316

68731,Failed Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Return of the Stent?,2018,"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is a global threat, causing high mortality, especially in the elderly. The main symptoms and the primary cause of death are related to interstitial pneumonia. Viral entry also into myocardial cells mainly via the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) receptor and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however, also make the heart susceptible to injury. In addition to the immediate damage caused by the acute inflammatory response, the heart may also suffer from long-term consequences of COVID-19, potentially causing a post-pandemic increase in cardiac complications. Although the main cause of cardiac damage in COVID-19 remains coagulopathy with micro- (and to a lesser extent macro-) vascular occlusion, open questions remain about other possible modalities of cardiac dysfunction, such as direct infection of myocardial cells, effects of cytokines storm, and mechanisms related to enhanced coagulopathy. In this opinion paper, we focus on these lesser appreciated possibilities and propose experimental approaches that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. We first discuss approaches to characterize cardiac damage caused by possible direct viral infection of cardiac cells, followed by formulating hypotheses on how to reproduce and investigate the hyperinflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions observed in the heart of COVID-19 patients using experimental in vitro systems. Finally, we elaborate on strategies to discover novel pathology biomarkers using omics platforms.","Pesce, Maurizio; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Bøtker, Hans-Erik; Brundel, Bianca; Davidson, Sean M; De Caterina, Raffaele; Ferdinandy, Peter; Girao, Henrique; Gyöngyösi, Mariann; Hulot, Jean-Sebastien; Lecour, Sandrine; Perrino, Cinzia; Schulz, Rainer; Sluijter, Joost P G; Steffens, Sabine; Tancevski, Ivan; Gollmann-Tepeköylü, Can; Tschöpe, Carsten; van Linthout, Sophie; Madonna, Rosalinda",Cardiovascular research,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvab201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117887/,316

DESIGN Retrospective computer-based review. SETTING Multicenter (1 university teaching hospital and 2 district hospitals). METHODS We reviewed the outcomes of patients with colonoscopic perforations surgically managed between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2005. Predictors of mortality and stoma formation were identified with multivariable analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality and stoma rates and their predictors. RESULTS A total of 37,971 colonoscopies were performed during the study period, and 43 colonoscopic perforations were identified. The overall perforation rate was 0.113% and represented a decreasing trend. There was no significant difference in the perforation rate between gastroenterologists (0.148%) and surgeons (0.091%) (P = .15). Perforations that occurred during diagnostic colonoscopies were significantly larger than those that occurred during therapeutic colonoscopies (P = .04), and the patients presented earlier (P = .02). Surgical intervention was performed in 39 patients. The overall morbidity and mortality rate was 48.7% and 25.6%, respectively. The stoma rate was 38.5%. The predictors of stoma formation include moderate to severe peritoneal contamination and the presence of malignant colonic neoplasms (P = .01 and P = .008, respectively). The predictors of mortality include American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 or higher and antiplatelet therapy (P = .009 and P = .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Colonoscopic perforations were in a decreasing trend. Patients with predictors of mortality should not be treated conservatively. Other options of large bowel investigations should be considered in high-risk patients when the potential diagnostic yield is low.","Teoh, Anthony Yuen Bun; Poon, Chi Ming; Lee, Janet Fung Yee; Leong, Hing Tat; Ng, Simon Siu Man; Sung, Joseph Jao Yiu; Lau, James Yun Wong",Archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2008.503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19153318/,316
69761,Malposition of a central venous catheter into the right internal mammary vein: review of complications of catheter misplacement.,2012,"A simple approach for analyzing longitudinally measured biomarkers is to calculate summary measures such as the area under the curve (AUC) for each individual and then compare the mean AUC between treatment groups using methods such as t test. This two-step approach is difficult to implement when there are missing data since the AUC cannot be directly calculated for individuals with missing measurements. Simple methods for dealing with missing data include the complete case analysis and imputation. A recent study showed that the estimated mean AUC difference between treatment groups based on the linear mixed model (LMM), rather than on individually calculated AUCs by simple imputation, has negligible bias under random missing assumptions and only small bias when missing is not at random. However, this model assumes the outcome to be normally distributed, which is often violated in biomarker data. In this paper, we propose to use a LMM on log-transformed biomarkers, based on which statistical inference for the ratio, rather than difference, of AUC between treatment groups is provided. The proposed method can not only handle the potential baseline imbalance in a randomized trail but also circumvent the estimation of the nuisance variance parameters in the log-normal model. The proposed model is applied to a recently completed large randomized trial studying the effect of nicotine reduction on biomarker exposure of smokers.","Shi, Luoxi; Hatsukami, Dorothy K; Koopmeiners, Joseph S; Le, Chap T; Benowitz, Neal L; Donny, Eric C; Luo, Xianghua",Pharmaceutical statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151513/,316

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Exposure to surgical smoke has been equated to cigarette smoking and thought to be hazardous to health care workers despite limited data. METHODS PM was measured during 15 operations in ORs with 24.8 ± 2.0 air changes/hour, and in controls (cigarettes, office air with 1.9-2.9 air changes/hour). Mutagenic potential was assessed by γH2AX staining of DNA damage in small airway epithelial cells co-cultured with PM. RESULTS Average PM concentration during surgery was 0.002 ± 0.002 mg/m3 with maximum values at 1.08 ± 1.30 mg/m3. Greater PM correlated with more diathermy (ρ = 0.69, p = 0.006). Values were most often near zero, resulting in OR average values similar to office air (0.002 ± 0.001 mg/m3) (p = 0.32). Cigarette smoke average PM concentration was significantly higher, 4.8 ± 5.6 mg/m3 (p < 0.001). PM collected from 14 days of OR air caused DNA damage to 1.6 ± 2.7% of cultured cells, significantly less than that from office air (27.7 ± 11.7%, p = 0.02), and cigarette smoke (61.3 ± 14.3%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The air we breathe during surgery has negligible quantities of PM and mutagenic potential, likely due to low frequency of diathermy use coupled with high airflow. This suggests that exposure to surgical smoke is associated with minimal occupational risk.","Stewart, Camille L; Raoof, Mustafa; Lingeman, Robert; Malkas, Linda; Flores, Viviana; Caldwell, Kerry; Fong, Yuman; Melstrom, Kurt",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938490/,316

The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400-600 °C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 °C but at 600 °C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.","Saeaung, Koranit; Phusunti, Neeranuch; Phetwarotai, Worasak; Assabumrungrat, Suttichai; Cheirsilp, Benjamas",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.04.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932851/,316

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with UGB in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We formed 2 control groups: COVID-19 patients without UGB (control group A) and non-COVID-19 patients with UGB (control group B). Fifty-three independent variables and 4 outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS We identified 83 UGB in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 who were attending EDs (1.11%, 95% CI=0.88-1.38). This incidence was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients [2474/1,388,879, 1.78%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.71-1.85; odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 95% CI=0.50-0.77]. Clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 patients presenting with UGB were abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, dyspnea, expectoration, melena, fever, cough, chest pain, and dysgeusia. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients with UGB, COVID-19 patients with UGB more frequently had fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, interstitial lung infiltrates, and ground-glass lung opacities. They underwent fewer endoscopies in the ED (although diagnoses did not differ between cases and control group B) and less endoscopic treatment. After adjustment for age and sex, cases showed a higher in-hospital all-cause mortality than control group B (OR=2.05, 95% CI=1.09-3.86) but not control group A (OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.59-2.19) patients. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of UGB in COVID-19 patients attending EDs was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients. Digestive symptoms predominated over respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 patients with UGB underwent fewer gastroscopies and endoscopic treatments than the general population with UGB. In-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with UGB was increased compared with non-COVID patients with UGB, but not compared with the remaining COVID-19 patients.","González González, Rebeca; Jacob, Javier; Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; González Del Castillo, Juan; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco J; Lamberechts, Jorge G; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Higa-Sansone, Leopoldo; Gayoso Martín, Sara; Carbajosa, Virginia; Beddar Chaib, Fahd; Salido, Manuel; Marchena González, María J; Calvo López, Ricardo; González Martínez, Félix; Pavón Monzo, José; Velarde Herrera, Desiré M; Niembro Valdés, Ana P; Quero Motto, Eva; Ferreras Amez, José M; Piñera-Salmerón, Pascual",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252555/,316

The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was selected as a model drug and embedded in the inner gelatin core to obtain high encapsulation efficiency. The advantage of the outer magnetic layer is that it targets the drug to the tumor tissue and provides controlled drug release. The physicochemical properties of doxorubicin-gelatin/Fe3O4-alginate nanoparticles (DG/FA NPs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction. The mean diameter of DG/FA NPs, which was determined using a zeta potential analyzer, was 401.8 ± 3.6 nm. The encapsulation rate was 64.6 ± 11.8%. In vitro drug release and accumulation were also studied. It was found that the release of DOX accelerated in an acidic condition. With the manipulation of an external magnetic field, DG/FA NPs efficiently targeted Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells and showed in the nucleus after 6 h of incubation. After 12 h of incubation, the relative fluorescence intensity reached 98.4%, and the cell viability of MCF-7 cells decreased to 52.3 ± 4.64%.

71301,Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes: a burgeoning problem with unclear solutions.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated intraperitoneal (IP) lidocaine administration and intravenous (IV) lidocaine infusion for postoperative pain control after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS Patients who underwent LC were randomized to either group IV (intravenous lidocaine infusion), group IP (intraperitoneal lidocaine administration), or group C (control, IP and IV saline). Outcome measures were total postoperative pain severity (TPPS), total fentanyl consumption (TFC), frequency of administering patient-controlled analgesia (FPB), and a pain control satisfaction score (PCSS). RESULTS Significantly reduced TPPS, TFC and FPB scores were observed in groups IP (n = 22) and IV (n = 26) compared with controls (n = 24). PCSS was higher in groups IP and IV than in controls. At 2 h postoperation, TPPS was significantly lower in group IP than group IV; at 0-2 h postoperation, FPB was lower in group IP than group IV. CONCLUSIONS The IP administration of lidocaine and IV lidocaine infusion significantly reduced postoperative pain and opioid consumption in LC patients, compared with control infusions. For convenience, IV lidocaine could be used for pain reduction following LC; IP administration places additional burden on the surgeon.","Yang, So Young; Kang, Hyun; Choi, Geun Joo; Shin, Hwa Yong; Baek, Chong Wha; Jung, Yong Hun; Choi, Yoo Shin",The Journal of international medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060513505493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648482/,316

71656,Effect of Recanalization on Cerebral Edema in Ischemic Stroke Treated With Thrombolysis and/or Endovascular Therapy.,2019-12-10,"PURPOSE Single-port laparoscopic surgery has evolved from an effort to minimize tissue trauma, limit morbidity, and maximize cosmesis. Limited data exist comparing single-port with conventional laparoscopy for right colectomy. Our aim is to compare single-port with laparoscopic colectomy with regard to safety and feasibility. We assert that this approach can be adopted in a safe and efficacious manner while using standard laparoscopic instrumentation. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data regarding 16 single-port and 27 conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed by a single surgeon between January 2008 and February 2009. Demographics, operative outcomes, and morbidity were included and analyzed using either Student t test or Fisher exact probability test. RESULTS Single-port and conventional laparoscopic groups were similar with regard to age, gender, body mass index, prior abdominal surgery, and co-morbidity. Seventy-five percent and 70% of the operations were performed for malignancy in the single-port and the conventional laparoscopy group, respectively (P = .69). Operative duration was 106 minutes in the single-port group vs 100 minutes in the conventional group (P = .64). Blood loss was 54 mL and 90 mL, respectively (P = .07). No conversions or additions of ports occurred. Hospital stay was 5.3 days in the single-port group vs 6 days in the conventional group (P = .53). Margins were negative in both groups. Mean lymph node number was 18 and 16 nodes (P = .92). There was one death in the conventional group (P = .44). Morbidity including wound infection was 18.8% and 14.9%, respectively (P = .73). CONCLUSIONS These findings support single-port right colectomy as a safe and efficacious approach to right colon resections in patients eligible for laparoscopy with minimal additional equipment or learning curve for experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons. The single port was undertaken without an increase in morbidity or mortality. There was no increase in operative time with use of the single-port approach. Finally, adequate lymph node harvest and margin clearance was maintained.","Waters, Joshua A; Guzman, Michael J; Fajardo, Alyssa D; Selzer, Don J; Wiebke, Eric A; Robb, Bruce W; George, Virgilio V",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181f23ca0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20940593/,316

The traditional spectral methods for soil heavy metal monitoring and assessment cannot meet the needs for large-scale areas. Therefore, in this study, we used HyMap-C airborne hyperspectral imagery to explore the estimation of soil heavy metal concentration. Ninety five soil samples were collected synchronously with airborne image acquisition in the mining area of Yitong County, China. The pre-processed spectrum of airborne images at the sampling point was then selected by the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method. The selected spectral features and the heavy metal data of soil samples were inverted to establish the inversion model. An ensemble learning method based on a stacking strategy is proposed for the inversion modeling of soil samples and image data. The experimental results show that this CARS-Stacking method can better predict the four heavy metals in the study area than other methods. For arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), the determination coefficients of the test data set (RP2) are 0.73, 0.63, 0.60, and 0.71, respectively. It was found that the estimated results and the distribution trend of heavy metals are almost the same as in actual ground measurements.","Tan, Kun; Ma, Weibo; Chen, Lihan; Wang, Huimin; Du, Qian; Du, Peijun; Yan, Bokun; Liu, Rongyuan; Li, Haidong",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645545/,316

Suhiya oxbow-lake in the middle alluvial plain of the River Ganga, was selected as the natural laboratory. A top-down multidisciplinary approach was chosen employing satellite imagery to analyse the annual oxbow-lake surface vegetation dynamics (Eichhornia and Hydrilla). Side-scan sonar profiles across two oxbow lakes along with River Ganga core data and vintage topographical maps, estimated the lake-sedimentation rate of 9.6 cm/yr. Organic carbon [amino acids, aromatics, lingo-phenols and lipids hydrocarbons] infiltration-based on hydrophobicity and molecular-mass was detected at different depths along the water and sedimentary column. Elemental analysis showed lake surface to groundwater the As conc. varied from (0.37 to 185 μg/l). A microbial diversity based study showed that large sized photoautotrophs Nostoc, Anabaena are replaced by Fe-oxido-reducing As-metabolizing bacteria e.g. Acidovorax, Dechloromonas and enteric organisms e.g. Enterobacter, Salmonella at bottom of water column. Based on these inferences, a conceptual organic carbon transport model was constructed to understand the preferential preservation and microbial diagenesis resulting in mobilization of As and other geogenic elements.","Ghosh, Devanita; Kumar, Santosh; Donselaar, Marinus Eric; Corroto, Cynthia; Ghosh, Ashok K",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385790/,316
73473,Visual Dermatology: Pemphigus Vegetans.,2020-06-30,"INTRODUCTION Sleeve gastrectomy has become a popular stand-alone bariatric procedure with comparable weight loss and resolution of comorbidities to that of laparoscopic gastric bypass. The simplicity of the procedure and the decreased long-term risk profile make this surgery more appealing. Nonetheless, the ever present risk of a staple-line leak is still of great concern and needs further investigation. METHODS An electronic literature search of MEDLINE database plus manual reference checks of articles published on laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity and its complications was completed. Keywords used in the search were ""sleeve gastrectomy"" OR ""gastric sleeve"" AND ""leak."" We analyzed 29 publications, including 4,888 patients. We analyzed the frequency of leak after sleeve gastrectomy and its associated risks of causation. RESULTS The risk of leak after sleeve gastrectomy in all comers was 2.4%. This risk was 2.9% in the super-obese [body mass index (BMI) > 50 kg/m(2)] and 2.2% for BMI < 50 kg/m(2). Staple height and use of buttressing material did not affect leak rate. The use of a size 40-Fr or greater bougie was associated with a leak rate of 0.6% compared with those who used smaller sizes whose leak rate was 2.8%. Leaks were found at the proximal third of the stomach in 89% of cases. Most leaks were diagnosed after discharge. Endoscopic management is a viable option for leaks and was documented in 11% of cases as successful. CONCLUSIONS Sleeve gastrectomy has become an important surgical option for the treatment of the ever growing morbidly obese population. The risk of leak is low at 2.4%. Attention to detail specifically at the esophagogastric junction cannot be stressed enough. Careful patient selection (BMI < 50 kg/m(2)) and adopting the use of a 40-Fr or larger bougie may decrease the risk of leak. Vigilant follow-up during the first 30 days is critical to avoid catastrophe, because most leaks will happen after patient discharge.","Aurora, Alexander R; Khaitan, Leena; Saber, Alan A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2085-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179470/,316

The Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Core Administrators Network Coordinating Committee initiated a forum-wide discussion followed by a global survey to gain information on how institutions and, specifically, shared resource core facilities were responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey aimed to identify shared resource core facility challenges and opportunities related to operational ramp downs, shutdowns, or research ""pauses"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as new practices and resources needed to ensure business continuity. Although a number of positive outcomes from remote work hold promise for improved core operations, the survey results revealed a surprising level of unfamiliarity with business continuity planning for cores and limited coordination within institutions.

The limited selections of drug treatment are not able to control the progress of disease in people with active and persistent HBV infection. Immunotherapy to control the degree of viral infection is one possible alternative solution to this challenge. HBV DNA vaccines, with their strong ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses, offer an attractive option. HBV surface protein is important in viral immunity. Re-establishing anti-S immunity in chronic HBV infected patients will bring significant benefit to the patients. Previous studies have shown that HBV S DNA vaccines are immunogenic in a number of animal studies. In the current study, we further investigated the effect of glycosylation to the expression and immunogenicity of S DNA vaccines. Our results demonstrate that deglycosylation at the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in S protein resulted in a significant decrease of S-specific cell-mediated immune responses, but did not affect anti-S antibody responses. This finding provides important direction to the development of S DNA vaccines to elicit the optimal and balanced antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to treat people with HBV chronic infections.","Xing, Yiping; Huang, Zuhu; Lin, Yan; Li, Jun; Chou, Te-Hui; Lu, Shan; Wang, Shixia",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.03.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18462847/,316

However, there are some deficiencies in the past research, because the vast majority of known infertile patients were included in the study samples. Taking infertile men as the research object to analyse the impact of obesity on semen quality, which cannot accurately prove that the impact on semen quality is caused by obesity, because the impact on semen quality may also be caused by other factors. Therefore, we selected ordinary obese men rather than infertile patients to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of obesity on semen parameters. The results showed that obesity had no effect on sperm concentration (SMD: -0.15, 95% CI: -0.32 ~ 0.02, p = .088) and percentage of normal sperm morphology (SMD: -0.17, 95% CI: -0.66 ~ 0.32, p = .487), but decreased semen volume (SMD: -0.32, 95% CI: -0.52 ~ -0.12, p = .002), total sperm number (SMD: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.31 ~ -0.23, p = .005), percentage of forward progression (SMD: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.7 ~ -0.19, p = .014) and percentage of viability (SMD: -0.812, 95% CI: -1.532 ~ -0.093, p = .027).

74374,"Platycladus orientalis leaves: a systemic review on botany, phytochemistry and pharmacology.",2014,"UNLABELLED Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are intracellular proteins that inhibit cytokine signaling in a variety of cell types. A number of viral infections have been associated with SOCS upregulation; however, not much is known about the mechanisms regulating SOCS expression during viral infection. In this study, we used two pathologically distinct intracerebral (i.c.) infection models to characterize temporal and spatial aspects of SOCS expression in the virus-infected central nervous system (CNS), and by employing various knockout mouse models, we sought to identify regulatory mechanisms that may underlie a virus induced upregulation of SOCS in the CNS. We found that i.c. infection with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or yellow fever virus (YF) results in gradual upregulation of SOCS1/3 mRNA expression peaking at day 7 postinfection (p.i.). In the LCMV model, SOCS mRNA was expressed in brain resident cells, including astrocytes and some neurons, and for SOCS1 in particular this upregulation was almost entirely mediated by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) produced by infiltrating T cells. After infection with YF, we also found SOCS expression to be upregulated in brain resident cells with a peak on day 7 p.i., but in this model, the upregulation was only partially dependent on IFN-γ and T cells, indicating that at least one other mediator was involved in the upregulation of SOCS following YF infection. We conclude that virus-induced inflammation of the CNS is associated with upregulation of SOCS1/3 mRNA expression in brain resident cells and that at least two distinctive pathways can lead to this upregulation. IMPORTANCE In the present report, we have studied the induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in the context of virus-induced CNS infection. We found that both a noncytolytic and a cytolytic virus induce marked upregulation of SOCS1 and -3 expression. Notably, the kinetics of the observed upregulation follows that of activity within proinflammatory signaling pathways and, interestingly, type II interferon (IFN), which is also a key inducer of inflammatory mediators, seems to be essential in initiating this counterinflammatory response. Another key observation is that not only cells of the immune system but also CNS resident cells are actively involved in both the pro- and the counterinflammatory immune circuits; thus, for example, astrocytes upregulate both C-X-C-motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and SOCS when exposed to type II IFN in vivo.","Steffensen, Maria Abildgaard; Fenger, Christina; Christensen, Jeanette Erbo; Jørgensen, Carina Krogsgaard; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard; Finsen, Bente; Thomsen, Allan Randrup",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01346-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25253351/,316

In the present study, we demonstrated that HEPIS was capable of suppressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression controlled by different enhancerelements in a transcription assay. HEPIS interacted specifically with the HSP70 TATA sequence, and not with various other enhancer elements in a binding test. Furthermore, we co-immunoprecipitated HEPIS with BTF3, a component of the RNA pol II initiation complex, and observed reduced proliferation of HeLa cells transfected with the HEPIS gene.

The pseudoaneurysm was not present on initial angiograms but became apparent radiographically 19 days after the endoscopic procedure. Endovascular treatment consisted of coil and Onyx embolization for sacrifice of the parent vessel proximal to the lesion. Early recognition of iatrogenic intracranial vascular injury is important to allow for rapid treatment. Initial radiographic studies may be unreliable in excluding the presence of a pseudoaneurysm so delayed repeat angiographic assessment is necessary, particularly in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion. Endovascular techniques may provide an effective and safe option for the treatment of iatrogenic anterior cerebral artery distribution pseudoaneurysms.","Munich, Stephan A; Cress, Marshall C; Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Krishna, Chandan; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Snyder, Kenneth V",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011693.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25994943/,316

For people with mental illness who have greater healthcare needs and are at risk for poor health outcomes, reduced access to care constitutes a crisis. While the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic continues to affect the United States, specifying what it means to have access to mental healthcare is more critical than ever. OBJECTIVE The aim of this concept analysis is to review definitions and descriptions of access to mental healthcare in the literature and to synthesize the relevance of these findings to inform future research, theory development, policy, and practice. STUDY DESIGN The concept of access to mental healthcare was analyzed using Rodgers's evolutionary concept analysis method. CINAHL, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were queried for peer-reviewed articles about access to mental healthcare published from January 2010 to April 2020 (n = 72). Data were reviewed for concept antecedents, attributes, consequences, surrogate, and related terms. RESULTS Five models of access to mental healthcare were identified, with several antecedents and consequences: utilization, economic loss/gain, incarceration, and patient/provider satisfaction. Cross-sectional and predictive studies highlighted three interrelated attributes: clinical management, healthcare delivery, and connectedness.

The search for alternative diagnostic techniques is still ongoing. OBJECTIVE To determine the accuracy of microultrasound (microUS) for the diagnosis of csPCa within prospectively collected cohort of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) according to MRI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 320 consecutive patients with at least one Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) ≥3 lesion according to MRI were prospectively enrolled. INTERVENTION All patients received microUS before prostate biopsy using the ExactVu system; the Prostate Risk Identification using microUS (PRI-MUS) protocol was used to identify targets. The urologists were blinded to MRI results until after the microUS targeting was completed. All patients received both targeted (based on either microUS or MRI findings) and randomized biopsies. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The sensitivity and specificity of microUS to determine the presence of csPCa (defined as at least one core with a Gleason score ≥7 PCa) were determined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to determine the predictors of csPCa. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Clinically significant PCa was diagnosed in 116 (36.3%) patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of microUS for csPCa diagnosis were 89.7% and 81.5%, while specificity and positive predictive value were 26.0% and 40.8%, respectively. A combination of microUS-targeted and randomized biopsies would allow diagnosing the same proportion of csPCa as that diagnosed by an approach combining MRI-targeted and randomized biopsies (n = 113; 97.4%), with only three (2.6%) csPCa cases diagnosed by a microUS-targeted and three (2.6%) by an MRI-targeted approach. In a logistic regression model, an increasing PRI-MUS score was an independent predictor of csPCa (p ≤ 0.005). The main limitation of the current study is represented by the fact that all patients had suspicious MRI. CONCLUSIONS Microultrasound is a promising imaging modality for targeted prostate biopsies. Our results suggest that a microUS-based biopsy strategy may be capable of diagnosing the great majority of cancers, while missing only few patients with csPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY According to our results, microultrasound (microUS) may represent an effective diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, providing high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the potential role of microUS in the diagnostic pathway of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer.","Lughezzani, Giovanni; Maffei, Davide; Saita, Alberto; Paciotti, Marco; Diana, Pietro; Buffi, Nicolò Maria; Colombo, Piergiuseppe; Elefante, Grazia Maria; Hurle, Rodolfo; Lazzeri, Massimo; Guazzoni, Giorgio; Casale, Paolo",European urology focus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069624/,316

INTRODUCTION In the US, two vaccines are recommended for all pregnant women to prevent illness in the infant: inactivated influenza vaccine (recommended since 2004), and the combined tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (recommended since 2013). This scoping review maps the studies conducted to date that address questions about pediatric safety and effectiveness of vaccines administered during pregnancy and provides a knowledge base for evaluating the use of RWD to study this issue. METHODS The scoping review was conducted following a published protocol. Methods included an electronic search of PubMed and Embase, screening of titles and abstracts by two reviewers, and double extraction of data for summary and synthesis. Studies that reported on pregnant women and the effectiveness or safety outcomes in their infants were included. RESULTS Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria of the scoping review protocol using RWD to assess safety or effectiveness of influenza or pertussis vaccinations administered to pregnant women with respect to pregnancy, infant or child outcomes. Detailed information about data sources, linkage of maternal and infant data, and operational definitions for gestational age were largely absent from the majority of studies raising concerns about reproducibility and validity of study findings. CONCLUSIONS A body of literature is available from which to plan and design future studies of vaccination in pregnant women using RWD. This is of intense importance as new vaccines, such as those for COVID-19, become available to the general population via approval or authorization without inclusion of pregnant women in the clinical trials.","Lasky, Tamar; McMahon, Ann W; Hua, Wei; Forshee, Richard",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090699/,316

76107,Endovascular Reconstruction of Extrahepatic Portal Vein in Noncirrhotic and Nonmalignant Chronic Portal Vein Thrombosis Secondary to an Iatrogenic Stenotic Lesion.,2016,"PURPOSE Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpression is a predictor of response to anti-HER2 therapy in breast and gastric cancer. Currently, HER2 status is assessed by tumour biopsy, but this may not be representative of the larger tumour mass or other metastatic sites, risking misclassification and selection of suboptimal therapy. The designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) G3 binds HER2 with high affinity at an epitope that does not overlap with trastuzumab and is biologically inert. We hypothesized that radiolabelled DARPin G3 would be capable of selectively imaging HER2-positive tumours, and aimed to identify a suitable format for clinical application. METHODS G3 DARPins tagged with hexahistidine (His6) or with histidine glutamate (HE)3 and untagged G3 DARPins were manufactured using a GMP-compatible Pichia pastoris protocol and radiolabelled with (125)I, or with (111)In via DOTA linked to a C-terminal cysteine. BALB/c mice were injected with radiolabelled G3 and tissue biodistribution was evaluated by gamma counting. The lead construct ((HE)3-G3) was assessed in mice bearing HER2-positive human breast tumour (BT474) xenografts. RESULTS For both isotopes, (HE)3-G3 had significantly lower liver uptake than His6-G3 and untagged G3 counterparts in non-tumour-bearing mice, and there was no significantly different liver uptake between His6-G3 and untagged G3. (HE)3-G3 was taken forward for evaluation in mice bearing HER2-positive tumour xenografts. The results demonstrated that radioactivity from (111)In-(HE)3-G3 was better maintained in tumours and cleared faster from serum than radioactivity from (125)I-(HE)3-G3, achieving superior tumour-to-blood ratios (343.7 ± 161.3 vs. 22.0 ± 11.3 at 24 h, respectively). On microSPECT/CT, (111)In-labelled and (125)I-labelled (HE)3-G3 could image HER2-positive tumours at 4 h after administration, but there was less normal tissue uptake of radioactivity with (111)In-(HE)3-G3. Preadministration of trastuzumab did not affect the uptake of (HE)3-G3 by HER2-positive tumours. CONCLUSION Radiolabelled DARPin (HE)3-G3 is a versatile radioligand with potential to allow the acquisition of whole-body HER2 scans on the day of administration.","Goldstein, Robert; Sosabowski, Jane; Livanos, Maria; Leyton, Julius; Vigor, Kim; Bhavsar, Gaurav; Nagy-Davidescu, Gabriela; Rashid, Mohammed; Miranda, Enrique; Yeung, Jenny; Tolner, Berend; Plückthun, Andreas; Mather, Stephen; Meyer, Tim; Chester, Kerry",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-014-2940-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391547/,316

76316,Pig lung transplant survival model.,2018,"UNLABELLED Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) have been identified to be key effector molecules in the host type I interferon defense system. The invasion of host cells by a large range of RNA viruses is inhibited by IFITMs during the entry step. However, the roles of IFITMs in DNA virus infections have not been studied in detail. In this study, we report that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a large human DNA virus, exploits IFITMs to facilitate the formation of the virion assembly compartment (vAC) during infection of human fibroblasts. We found that IFITMs were expressed constitutively in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC5 cells). HCMV infection inhibited IFITM protein accumulation in the later stages of infection. Overexpression of an IFITM protein in MRC5 cells slightly enhanced HCMV production and knockdown of IFITMs by RNA interference reduced the virus titer by about 100-fold on day 8 postinfection, according to the findings of a virus yield assay at a low multiplicity of infection. Virus gene expression and DNA synthesis were not affected, but the typical round structure of the vAC was not formed after the suppression of IFITMs, thereby resulting in defective virion assembly and the production of less infectious virion particles. Interestingly, the replication of herpes simplex virus, a human herpesvirus that is closely related to HCMV, was not affected by the suppression of IFITMs in MRC5 cells. These results indicate that IFITMs are involved in a specific pathway required for HCMV replication. IMPORTANCE HCMV is known to repurpose the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) viperin and tetherin to facilitate its replication. Our results expand the range of ISGs that can be exploited by HCMV for its replication. This is also the first report of a proviral function of IFITMs in DNA virus replication. In addition, whereas previous studies showed that IFITMs modulate virus entry, which is a very early stage in the virus life cycle, we identified a new function of IFITMs during the very late stage of virus replication, i.e., virion assembly. Virus entry and assembly both involve vesicle transport and membrane fusion; thus, a common biochemical activity of IFITMs is likely to be involved. Therefore, our findings may provide a new platform for dissecting the molecular mechanism of action of IFITMs during the blocking or enhancement of virus infection, which are under intense investigation in this field.","Xie, Maorong; Xuan, Baoqin; Shan, Jiaoyu; Pan, Deng; Sun, Yamei; Shan, Zhao; Zhang, Jinping; Yu, Dong; Li, Bin; Qian, Zhikang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03416-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552713/,316

In the current research, four isolated constitutes namely lapacho (1), peshawaraquinone (2), indanone derivatives (3), α-lapachone (4) of H. adenophyllum were tested for anti-inflammatory effect using the carrageenan- and histamine-induced paw edema paradigm. The tested compounds (1-4) were evaluated for anti-inflammatory effect during the early and late phase of edema induction. In the early phase, all tested compounds (0.5 2.5 mg/kg each i.p.) demonstrated less than 50% effect, while in the later phase, compounds (2 and 3) demonstrated 85.66 and 89.87% attenuation. In addition, compounds (1-4) were subjected to histamine-induced inflammation, where compounds 2 and 3 exhibited excellent effects 86.87 and 89.98%, respectively at 5 mg/kg after the 2nd hour of administration, whereas compounds 1 and 4 did not exhibit any significant effect as compared with the negative control. Molecular docking results revealed a very high potency of compound based on the protein-ligand interaction (PLI) profile, which was further evaluated through a molecular dynamic simulation study. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of H. adenophyllum attributed to the presence of these bioactive compounds (1-4) strongly supports the traditional uses of H. adenophyllum for treatment of inflammation. However, compounds 2 and 3 which exerted anti-inflammatory effect must be subjected for further mechanistic studies.","Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Shah, Zafar Ali; Rauf, Abdur; Wadood, Abdul; Bawazeer, Saud; Muhammad, Naveed; El-Esawi, Mohamed A; Alhumaydhi, Fahad A; Aljohani, Abdullah S M; El-Sharkawy, Eman; Mubarak, Mohammad S; Isayeva, Kuralay; Shariati, Mohammad Ali",Inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-020-01333-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901390/,316

Up to 20% of Canadian patients pay for medications out of pocket. We sought to identify strategies that patients and prescribers can employ to reduce these costs. METHODS We collected data from outpatient pharmacies in Hamilton, Ontario. We determined prices for different medications in each of the drug classes recommended for HF with reduced ejection fraction in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's guidelines. We examined differences in dispensing and delivery fees and inquired about other cost-saving strategies. RESULTS We collected data from 24 different pharmacies, including a selection of hospital-based, independent, and larger chain pharmacies. In the most extreme scenario (i.e., 90-day prescription instead of a 30-day prescription and the least expensive generic drug instead of the most expensive brand name drug), total medication costs can differ by up to $495.56 per month. Costs were affected by choice of agent within a drug class, generic versus brand-name drug, quantity dispensed, dispensing fee, and delivery cost. CONCLUSIONS Prescription content, dispensing practice, and pharmacy choice can remarkably impact out-of-pocket costs for HF medications. Prescribers can reduce costs by writing 90-day prescriptions and choosing the lowest-cost generic drugs in each therapeutic class. Patients should consider the services received for their pharmacy dispensing fees, use free delivery services where needed, and request inexpensive generic drugs. Pharmacists can facilitate cost minimization without compromising therapeutic efficacy.","McIntyre, William F; Belesiotis, Peter; McClure, Graham R; Demers, Catherine; Chahill, Gurneet; Hayes, Abigail; Sohi, Gursharan; Bordman, Wendy; Whitlock, Richard P; Belley-Côté, Emilie P",Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10557-020-07046-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803405/,316

Moreover, HCoV-OC43 is neuroinvasive, neurotropic, and neurovirulent in susceptible mice, where it induces chronic encephalitis. Herein, we show that a single point mutation in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (Y241H), acquired during viral persistence in human neural cells, led to a hind-limb paralytic disease in infected mice. Inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity using a 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propranoic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (GYKI-52466) improved clinical scores related to the paralysis and motor disabilities in S mutant virus-infected mice, as well as protected the CNS from neuronal dysfunctions, as illustrated by restoration of the phosphorylation state of neurofilaments. Expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1, responsible for glutamate homeostasis, was downregulated following infection, and GYKI-52466 also significantly restored its steady-state expression level. Finally, GYKI-52466 treatment of S mutant virus-infected mice led to reduced microglial activation, which may lead to improvement in the regulation of CNS glutamate homeostasis. Taken together, our results strongly suggest an involvement of excitotoxicity in the paralysis-associated neuropathology induced by an HCoV-OC43 mutant which harbors a single point mutation in its spike protein that is acquired upon persistent virus infection.","Brison, Elodie; Jacomy, Hélène; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05576-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21957311/,316

No evidence regarding optimal treatment targets exists. METHODS The Carbon dioxide, Oxygen, and Mean arterial pressure After Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (COMACARE) trial is a pilot multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the feasibility of targeting low- or high-normal PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP in comatose, mechanically ventilated patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as well as its effect on brain injury markers. Using a 23 factorial design, participants are randomized upon admission to an intensive care unit into one of eight groups with various combinations of PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP target levels for 36 h after admission. The primary outcome is neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentration at 48 h after cardiac arrest. The main feasibility outcome is the between-group differences in PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP during the 36 h after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes include serum concentrations of NSE, S100 protein, and cardiac troponin at 24, 48, and 72 h after cardiac arrest; cerebral oxygenation, measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); potential differences in epileptic activity, monitored via continuous electroencephalogram (EEG); and neurological outcomes at six months after cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION The trial began in March 2016 and participant recruitment has begun in all seven study sites as of March 2017. Currently, 115 of the total of 120 patients have been included. When completed, the results of this trial will provide preliminary clinical evidence regarding the feasibility of targeting low- or high-normal PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP values and its effect on developing brain injury, brain oxygenation, and epileptic seizures after cardiac arrest.

For many cancer types, treatment paradigms have changed, as immunotherapy is increasingly being integrated into frontline standard-of-care treatments and producing meaningful and prolonged responses. This has inspired an avalanche of clinical trials studying ICIs in all types of malignancies, including gynecological cancers. Ovarian and endometrial cancers are characterized by DNA damage repair defects, either via disruption of the homologous recombination DNA repair mechanism in the former or via defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway in the latter, which lead to a high load of neoantigens in both. Cervical cancer is dependent on the expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) proteins, which induce an immune response. Regardless, clinical trials testing ICIs in gynecological malignancies have initially led to disappointing results. Despite durable responses in some patients, overall response rates have been dismal. Nevertheless, in recent years, with the development of better predictive tumor biomarkers, such as microsatellite instability for endometrial cancer and programmed death ligand 1 for cervical cancer, ICIs have found their way into routine treatments for patients with advanced-stage disease. ICI-based combinations, although adding toxicity, have further improved response rates, and new combinations are currently being tested in clinical trials, as are other immunotherapy modalities, such as adoptive cell transfer and HPV-based vaccines. This review summarizes current clinical evidence supporting the use of immunotherapy in gynecological malignancies and describes studies in progress, with a focus on ICIs and predictive response biomarkers.","Taha, Tarek; Reiss, Ari; Amit, Amnon; Perets, Ruth","BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-020-00450-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141420/,316

METHODS The retrospective analysis of patients who were hospitalized due to emerging acute symptoms of an ""intrathoracic stomach"" between January 2009 and May 2013 was used as method. Patients were categorized into three groups: emergency operation within 24 h after admission, semi-elective operation within the first 7 days after admission and elective operation. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were identified. Only three (12.5 %) patients required laparoscopic emergency surgery and two incurred a perioperative complication. In consequence of persistent or early recurrent complaints a laparoscopic operation was required prior to discharge semi-elective in 6/24 (25 %) patients without complications. The remaining 15/24 (62.5 %) patients were free of complaints after conservative therapy, but all of them decided upon elective operation after informed consent. One minor complication occurred. CONCLUSION The majority of patients with acute symptoms due to an intrathoracic stomach can primarily be treated conservatively and timing of elective repair should be performed after resuscitation in a center of laparoscopic antireflux surgery.","Köhler, G; Koch, O O; Antoniou, S A; Emmanuel, K; Pointner, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1285-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060238/,316

Therefore, we proposed that DPP4 might be responsible for the preservation of renal function. In this study, to verify the role of DPP4 in the preservation of renal function, we performed a microarray analysis of the kidneys of WT and DPP4-deficient rats after STZ treatment, and gene expression analysis using rat kidneys, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and human renal cancer cells (CakI-1). The microarray analysis indicated that the expression levels of the transporter activity, heme-binding, and pheromone binding-related genes changed significantly. The results of gene expression analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in the expression levels of hemoglobin mRNA between the DPP4-deficient and WT rats; however, the expression levels of hemoglobin mRNA in the kidneys of DPP4-deficient rats tended to decrease when compared with those of both the non-STZ-treated and STZ-treated WT rats. The expression levels of hemoglobin in HEK293 and Caki-1 cells were significantly decreased when DPP4 was knocked down by siRNA, were significantly increased by the addition of soluble human DPP4, and were also significantly increased by the addition of the DPP4 inhibitor, sitagliptin. The expression level of DPP4 was also significantly increased by the addition of sitagliptin in both cell types. Our findings indicate that DPP4 regulates the expression of the hemoglobin genes, and might play a role in the preservation of renal function; however, the underlying mechanism of this preservation remains to be elucidated.","Sato, Youichi; Kamada, Takanobu; Yamauchi, Aiko",The Journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1530/joe-14-0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122001/,316

This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.","Zhou, L; Liu, K; Liu, H G",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200229-00219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118391/,316

The antimicrobial activity of all complexes was evaluated by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 477, and Burkholderia contaminans IST408, and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus Newman. Camphor imine complexes based on the hydroxyl silver center ({Ag(OH)}) typically perform better than those based on the nitrate silver center ({Ag(NO3)}), while ligands prone to establish hydrogen bonding facilitate interactions with the bacterial cell surface structures. A different trend is observed for the silver camphor sulfonimine complexes that are almost non-sensitive to the nature of the metal cores {Ag(OH)} or {Ag(NO3)} and display low sensitivity to the Y substituent. The antibacterial activities of the Ag(I) camphor sulfonimine complexes are higher than those of the camphor imine analogues.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. RESULTS The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.

80256,Best practices consensus protocol for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement by interventional radiologists.,2014,"BACKGROUND Implant infection is one of the most severe complications within the field of orthopaedic surgery, associated with an enormous burden for the healthcare system. During the last decades, attempts have been made to lower the incidence of implant-related infections. In the case of cemented prostheses, the use of antibiotic-containing bone cement can be effective. However, in the case of non-cemented prostheses, osteosynthesis and spinal surgery, local antibacterial prophylaxis is not a standard procedure. For the development of implant coatings with antibacterial properties, there is a need for a reliable animal model to evaluate the preventive capacity of such coatings during a specific period of time. Existing animal models generally present a limited follow-up, with a limited number of outcome parameters and relatively large animal numbers in multiple groups. METHODS To represent an early post-operative implant infection, we established an acute tibial intramedullary nail infection model in rabbits by contamination of the tibial nail with 3.8 × 10⁵ colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical, haematological and radiological parameters for infection were weekly assessed during a 6-week follow-up with post-mortem bacteriological and histological analyses. RESULTS S. aureus implant infection was confirmed by the above parameters. A saline control group did not develop osteomyelitis. By combining the clinical, haematological, radiological, bacteriological and histological data collected during the experimental follow-up, we were able to differentiate between the control and the infected condition and assess the severity of the infection at sequential timepoints in a parameter-dependent fashion. CONCLUSION We herein present an acute early post-operative rabbit implant infection model which, in contrast to previously published models, combines improved in-time insight into the development of an implant osteomyelitis with a relatively low amount of animals.","Odekerken, Jim C E; Arts, Jacobus J C; Surtel, Don A M; Walenkamp, Geert H I M; Welting, Tim J M",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-799x-8-38; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24188807/,316

METHODS A 45-year-old female patient presented to the rhinology clinic with a nasal mass. A biopsy revealed a highly vascular mass consistent with a sinonasal unclassified spindle cell sarcoma. Secondary to its extensive vascularity, the patient underwent preoperative transarterial embolization (TAE) before definitive resection. Due to complex vascular anatomy including feeding vessels emanating from intracranial circulation, incomplete embolization was achieved. Subsequently, intraoperative embolization with Onyx at the time of resection was performed. RESULTS Intraoperative Onyx use resulted in almost complete devascularization of the tumor with decreased risk of intracranial embolization. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative embolization with Onyx after an incomplete TAE can be a safe and effective method of achieving near-total embolization of sinonasal tumors.","Kansal, Ankit; Srinet, Prateek; Manes, Richard Peter",Journal of neurological surgery reports,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1586210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27652195/,316

Prenatal screening is offered as part of routine clinical prenatal services with variable uptake. Surveillance of the effect of prenatal screening and diagnosis on the birth prevalence of congenital anomalies is limited by gaps and variations in surveillance systems. Newborn screening programs vary between provinces and territories in terms of organization and conditions screened for. The last decade has witnessed a four-fold increase in requests for genetic testing, especially for late onset diseases. Tests are performed in provincial laboratories or outside Canada. There is wide variation in participation in laboratory quality assurance schemes, and there are few regulatory frameworks in Canada that are directly relevant to genetics testing services or population genetics.

80690,Penny Ingestion: Can We Really Manage Expectantly?,2020-05-26,"Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium pathogenic to various insect species. This property is due to the Cry toxins encoded by plasmid genes and mostly produced during sporulation. B. thuringiensis contains a remarkable amount of extrachromosomal DNA molecules and a great number of plasmid rap-phr genes. Rap-Phr quorum sensing systems regulate different bacterial processes, notably the commitment to sporulation in Bacillus species. Rap proteins are quorum sensors acting as phosphatases on Spo0F, intermediate of the sporulation phosphorelay, and are inhibited by Phr peptides that function as signaling molecules. In this study, we characterize the Rap63-Phr63 system encoded by the pAW63 plasmid from the B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD73 strain. Rap63 has a moderate activity on sporulation and is inhibited by the Phr63 peptide. The rap63-phr63 genes are co-transcribed and the phr63 gene is also transcribed from a σH-specific promoter. We show that Rap63-Phr63 regulates the sporulation together with the Rap8-Phr8 system harbored by the plasmid pHT8_1 of the HD73 strain. Interestingly, the deletion of both phr63 and phr8 genes in the same strain has a greater negative effect in sporulation than the sum of the loss of each phr gene. Despite the similarities in the Phr8 and Phr63 sequences, there is no crosstalk between the two systems. Our results suggest a synergism of these two Rap-Phr systems in the regulation of sporulation of B. thuringiensis at the end of the infectious cycle in insect, thus pointing out the role of the plasmids to the fitness of the bacteria.IMPORTANCEThe life cycle of Bacillus thuringiensis in insect larvae is regulated by quorum sensing systems of the RNPP family. After the toxemia caused by Cry insecticidal toxins, the sequential activation of these systems allows the bacteria to trigger a state of virulence (regulated by PlcR-PapR), then a necrotrophic lifestyle (regulated by NprR-NprX) and ultimately the sporulation is controlled by the Rap-Phr systems. Our study describes a new rap-phr operon carried by a B. thuringiensis plasmid and shows that the Rap protein has a moderate effect on sporulation. However, in combination with another plasmid rap-phr operon, both systems provide an effective control of sporulation when the bacteria develop in the cadavers of infected insect larvae. Overall, this study highlights the important adaptive role of the plasmid Rap-Phr systems in the developmental fate and the survival of B. thuringiensis within their ecological niche.","Cardoso, Priscilla; Fazion, Fernanda; Perchat, Stéphane; Buisson, Christophe; Vilas-Bôas, Gislayne; Lereclus, Didier",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01238-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680861/,316

The results of X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyses, and scanning electron microscopy indicated that β-CD excluded from the polymer chains and aggregated to form crystals during film formation, which drove HCS to interact with KGM more compactly. The thickness and transparency of the films increased after β-CD was incorporated. More associations of HCS/KGM enhanced the mechanical properties and reduced the moisture content of the films. The water vapor permeability of the HCS/KGM composite film was also improved significantly with the incorporation of β-CD. The enhanced association between biopolymers in the presence of β-CD will advance the development of a degradable active composite packaging film.","Zou, Yiyuan; Yuan, Chao; Cui, Bo; Sha, Haojie; Liu, Pengfei; Lu, Lu; Wu, Zhengzong",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594885/,316
81045,Usefulness of collagen type IV in the detection of significant liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,2020-12-29,"Varicocele is a well-established cause of male subfertility, which is directly proportional to its clinical grade. Although newer ultrasonic grading systems have taken into account the existence of pampiniform venous plexi, little is known about the clinical significance of the number of veins ligated during surgery. Very few undersized studies reported an influence which triggered the need to evaluate such association. This is a retrospective study of 378 patients who underwent left microsurgical subinguinal varicocoelectomy. Semen analyses and blood hormone studies performed pre-operatively were compared to those executed 6 months after surgery. Patients were divided into abnormal semen and normal semen groups based on their initial semen results. They were also subdivided according to the number of veins ligated intraoperatively into three groups: <5, 5-10, and >10 veins. Sperm count, total motility, and progressive motility were significantly increased in 62, 60.3, and 53.3% of patients post-operatively (p = 0.001), respectively. No significant differences in hormone levels were detected overall. Of the 378 patients, 332 had an abnormal semen analysis, while the remaining 46 patients had a normal result. Sperm count, total motility, and progressive motility significantly increased after varicocoelectomy in patients with an abnormal initial semen analysis (p = 0.001). In 48.7% of patients, 5-10 veins were ligated during surgery, whereas 28.3% had >10 and 23% had <5 ligated veins. No statistically significant differences were noted in the initial or the follow-up results among the number of vein subgroups. Varicocele ligation improves patients' fertility potential. This improvement, however, is not influenced by the number of veins ligated intraoperatively. Clinical grading maintains its superiority in the evaluation of varicocele patients.","Majzoub, A; Elbardisi, H; Arafa, M; Agarwal, A; Al Said, S; Al Rumaihi, K",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317389/,316

METHODS We tested 594 nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals with COVID-19 (RT-PCR cycle threshold [Ct] values ≤ 40) or non-COVID-19 (Ct values > 40) diagnoses. RT-PCR positive samples were assigned to diagnostic, screening, or monitoring groups of testing. RESULTS With a limit of detection of 1.2 × 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4, 80.0, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. Additional testing of RT-PCR positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA showed that, by three groups, PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively. PPAs dropped to 55.6, 20.0, or 41.7% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively.

Thirteen captive individuals of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were chosen as focal subjects in the monocular box task. In total, 4 emotional categories (the preferred, the novel, the neutral, and the fearful) of visual stimuli were applied, and eye preference was recorded when individuals looked at each stimulus through an observation hole in the box. We found evidence of visual laterality at the individual level, but not at the group level for each stimulus. For the preferred stimulus, 9 individuals showed significant right-eye preference while 4 individuals showed significant left-eye preference. For the other 3 stimuli, 7 individuals displayed significant right-eye preference while 6 individuals displayed significant left-eye preference. Totally, 11 of 13 individuals showed consistency in the visual laterality direction (7 right-eye preference and 4 left-eye preference) across the 4 stimuli. The remaining 2 individuals displayed right-eye preference for the preferred stimulus while they showed left-eye preference for the other 3 stimuli. There was no significant difference among various stimuli regarding the direction of visual laterality. However, there was a significant difference in the strength of visual laterality among various stimulus categories. The strength of visual laterality for the preferred stimulus was significantly lower than that for the other 3 stimuli. The strength of visual laterality for the fearful stimulus was significantly higher than that for the novel stimulus and the neutral stimulus. Furthermore, the looking duration for the preferred stimulus was significantly higher than that for the other 3 stimuli. The looking duration for the novel stimulus was significantly higher than that for the neutral stimulus and the fearful stimulus. The looking duration for the neutral stimulus was significantly higher than that for the fearful stimulus.

In the latest studies benefit for laparoscopic approach is reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic sigmoid resections for diverticulitis regarding conversion rate, operation time and intraoperative and postoperative complications, and defining strategies to prevent complications. METHODS Out of a prospective database with all laparoscopic colon resection between May 1999 and January 2008 the patients with laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticulitis were analyzed. Preoperative diagnosis was made by abdominal computed tomography with irrigoscopy and/or endoscopy. Indications for laparoscopic sigmoid resections were diverticulitis as an early elective or elective operation and selected cases with perforated diverticulitis. RESULTS Between May 1999 and January 2008, 200 patients (97 women, 103 men) were operated by laparoscopy for diverticulitis. Mean age at surgery was 59 years (range: 27 to 86); mean preoperative body mass index was 27.2 kg/m2 (range: 20 to 38). Mean operating time was 121 minutes (range: 60 to 239). Operating time was reduced due to experience and dropped from a mean of 150 minutes for the first 50 patients, 115 minutes for the second, 110 minutes for the third, and 107 minutes for the last 50 patients (P<0.05). Conversion rate was 1.5%, total morbidity rate was 19%, and reoperation rate was 6%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic sigmoid resections for diverticulitis can be performed with great safety and low conversion rate. Several adjustments in operation technique and perioperative management had to be done to achieve a complication rate and conversion rate at an acceptable low level.","Zehetner, Jörg; Szabo, Kornel; Wayand, Wolfgang; Shamiyeh, Andreas","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181a091eb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19390278/,316
81740,Sickle cell disease and ventricular myocardial strain: A systematic review.,2021-03-19,"For cell staining, fixation methods decrease generally into two classes, organic solvents and cross-linking reagents. Organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone remove lipids and dehydrate the cells, precipitating the proteins on the cellular architecture. Cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde form intermolecular bridges, normally through free amino groups, thus creating a network of linked antigens. Choosing between fixation in organic solvents or cross-linking agents is empirical. There are no general rules to decide between the two and both procedures are described here. Both methods may denature protein antigens, and for this reason, antibodies prepared against denatured proteins may be more useful for cell staining. In some instances, anti-denatured-protein antibodies are the only ones that can work. Fixation in protein cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde preserves cell structure better than organic solvents but may reduce the antigenicity of some cell components. Simple fixation with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde does not allow the antibody to access the specimen and therefore is followed by a permeabilization step using an organic solvent or nonionic detergent. Using the organic solvent is easy, but it can destroy certain elements of the cell architecture, although prior fixation with paraformaldehyde does help to preserve the cellular structure. If preservation of cell structure is important, the best first choice would be to use a nonionic detergent.","Rodig, Scott J",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,https://doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot099689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747585/,316

The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an on-site vaccination-dedicated clinic on the vaccination coverage rates of HCWs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study was carried out among under-graduate and post-graduate students attending medical and healthcare professions schools. Vaccinations that were considered for eligibility were the following: 1) related to professional risks (Hepatitis B; acellular Pertussis, in the combination vaccine with Tetanus and Diphtheria; Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella); 2) related to specific age groups or underlying clinical conditions (Meningococcal conjugate vaccines; Human papillomavirus; Hepatitis A; 13-valent Pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine and Influenza). RESULTS we enrolled 804 students, 404 in the control and 400 in the experimental group. A significantly higher increase of vaccination coverage in the experimental group than in the control group for all the investigated vaccinations (p<0.001) was found. The odds of adherence to vaccinations in the experimental group, compared to the control group, ranged from 6.9 fold (95% CI 3.51-13.44) to 18.9 fold (95% CI 10.85-32.96). The increase in the coverage rate in the control group was between 2.5% and 3.5%, whereas in the experimental group, higher increases were found, ranging from 34.8% to 71%. CONCLUSIONS The extraordinary increase in the adherence to HCWs recommended vaccinations found in the study seems to indicate a significant role of enabling factors in the complex process of decision-making and implementation of health-related behaviors.","De Sarro, Caterina; Papadopoli, Rosa; Cautela, Vincenza; Nobile, Carmelo Giuseppe Angelo; Pileggi, Claudia; Pavia, Maria",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1915776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896347/,316
81758,Prediction models in respiratory medicine.,2020-05-20,"To understand the influence of different hydrophobic amino acids at ""a"" and ""d"" positions of a heptad repeat sequence on antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and antiendotoxin properties, four 15-residue peptides with leucine (LRP), phenylalanine (FRP), valine (VRP), and alanine (ARP) residues at these positions were designed, synthesized, and characterized. Although valine is similarly hydrophobic to leucine and phenylalanine, VRP showed significantly lesser cytotoxicity than LRP and FRP; further, the replacement of leucines with valines at ""a"" and ""d"" positions of melittin-heptads drastically reduced its cytotoxicity. However, all four peptides exhibited significant antimicrobial activities that correlate well with their interactions with mammalian and bacterial cell membranes and the corresponding lipid vesicles. LRP most efficiently neutralized the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators like NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 in macrophages followed by FRP, VRP, and ARP. The results could be useful for designing short antimicrobial and antiendotoxin peptides with understanding the basis of their activity.","Azmi, Sarfuddin; Srivastava, Saurabh; Mishra, Nripendra N; Tripathi, Jitendra K; Shukla, Praveen K; Ghosh, Jimut Kanti",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jm301407k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23324083/,316

METHODS Systematic searches carried out in five databases and handsearching were used to identify the studies from 2010 to 2016, with a populations, exposures and outcomes (PEO) search strategy, focusing on the question: In which databases or other information resources do hospital nurses search for evidence based information, and how often? RESULTS Of 5272 titles retrieved based on the search strategy, only nine studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. The studies are from the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Nigeria. The results show that hospital nurses' primary choice of source for evidence based information is Google and peers, while bibliographic databases such as PubMed are secondary choices. Data on frequency are only included in four of the studies, and data are heterogenous. CONCLUSIONS The reasons for choosing Google and peers are primarily lack of time; lack of information; lack of retrieval skills; or lack of training in database searching. Only a few studies are published on clinical nurses' retrieval behaviours, and more studies are needed from Europe and Australia.","Alving, Berit Elisabeth; Christensen, Janne Buck; Thrysøe, Lars",Health information and libraries journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29327483/,316

Tapentadol is approved for cancer pain in Japan; however, real-world evidence on tapentadol's effectiveness and safety for cancer-related pain in Japan is limited. METHODS This retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of tapentadol (by patient type-opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant) in 84 patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain at Ichikawa General Hospital between September 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS Almost 93% of patients achieved clinically relevant pain relief within 4 days (median). Over 90% of patients with neuropathic pain or mixed pain and all patients with nociceptive pain were responders. Pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline through to the end of maintenance period in opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients. No patients discontinued tapentadol due to serious adverse events. No opioid-naïve patients experienced nausea or vomiting during tapentadol treatment. Only three opioid-tolerant patients experienced nausea which was considered to be related to tapentadol. CONCLUSION Tapentadol is effective and well tolerated in opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain of varying pathophysiology, including those with nociceptive and/or neuropathic components. Tapentadol may be considered for first-line use in moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.","Sazuka, Shoichiro; Koitabashi, Toshiya",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02821-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648017/,316

It may be asymptomatic and go undiagnosed, or minimal transient manifestations may follow, commanding a higher index of suspicion than ordinarily exists to avoid misdiagnosis. Reported herein is a 27-year-old man who suffered extracranial internal carotid artery dissection while practicing a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu submission maneuver. The patient's condition suddenly deteriorated one week later due to distal embolization and stroke. Despite endovascular treatment, with stenting of the cervical carotid artery, neurologic deficits remained. Of note, the objective in martial arts, which is to kill or incapacitate, has yet to be fully tempered in transitioning to sport. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, a relatively new and fast-growing form of martial art, places emphasis on submission maneuvers. Related injuries are not common knowledge and are poorly described in the literature. This account is intended to shed light on the risk of this discipline. Through education and improved supervision, vascular injuries of this nature and the potentially lethal or disabling consequences may thus be prevented in young athletes.","Demartini, Zeferino; Rodrigues Freire, Maxweyd; Lages, Roberto Oliver; Francisco, Alexandre Novicki; Nanni, Felipe; Maranha Gatto, Luana A; Koppe, Gelson Luis",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2017.19.2.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152471/,316

We evaluated the technical and clinical success of MT in relation to the location of the occlusion (internal carotid artery, M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery). METHODS We prospectively reviewed 130 patients of whom 105 met the inclusion criteria. Baseline clinical, procedural and imaging variables, technical outcome (TICI, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction), 24 h imaging outcome and three-month clinical outcome (mRS, modified Rankin Scale) were recorded. Differences between the groups were studied with statistical tests according to the type of the variable. RESULTS There were 37, 46 and 22 patients in the internal carotid artery (ICA), M1 and M2 groups, respectively. TICI 2b or 3 was achieved in 92 cases (88 %) with a non-significant trend towards a better recanalization outcome in the ICA and M1 groups. Overall, 57 of the 105 patients (55 %) experienced favorable clinical outcome (mRS ≤ 2) with no significant differences between the groups. Excellent outcome (mRS ≤ 1) was seen in 40 patients (39 %) and there proportionally more patients with excellent outcome in the ICA and M1 groups (ICA: 44 %, M1: 41 %, M2: 23 % of patients, p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS There were no statistically significant differences in the technical or clinical outcomes between the different sites of occlusion (ICA, M1 or M2). There was a non-significant trend towards achieving excellent clinical outcome (3-month mRS ≤ 1) more often and better recanalization results in the two more proximal locations.","Protto, Sara; Sillanpää, Niko; Pienimäki, Juha-Pekka; Matkaselkä, Ira; Seppänen, Janne; Numminen, Heikki",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1315-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940703/,316
82864,Quiescent-Interval Slice-Selective MRA Accurately Estimates Intravascular Stent Dimensions Prior to Intervention in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease.,2021-07-29,"Introduction Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often caused by respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, laboratory and computed tomography features of patients with hospitalized COPD exacerbations in which respiratory viruses were detected using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Materials and Methods This retrospectively planned study included patients hospitalized in the chest diseases clinic due to exacerbation of COPD between November 2018-February 2019. The study included patients who had virus-specific real-time PCR, and computed tomography scans of the chest. Result A total of 110 patients were included in the study. Respiratory viruses were identified in the nasopharyngeal swabs of 50 patients (45.5%) using the real-time PCR method, with rhinovirus (25%), influenza A (13.1%) and coronavirus (11.8%) being the most commonly isolated agents. The mean age of the patients was 68.28 ± 9.59 years in the virus-positive group and 68.20 ± 8.27 years in the virus-negative group (p= 0.963). Gender distribution, rate of smokers, exposure to biofuels, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, FEV1/FVC ratio did not significantly differ between the two groups (p> 0.05). Procalcitonin (PCT) and FEV1 values were significantly lower (p= 0.001 and p= 0.028, respectively) and the number of exacerbations was significantly higher in the virus-positive group (p= 0.001). The length of hospital stay was longer in the virus-positive group than in the virus-negative group (p= 0.012). Among the findings of computed tomography (CT) of the chest, bronchial wall thickening, cystic bronchiectasis, and emphysema did not differ significantly (p> 0.05). The rate of infiltrative lesions (tree-in-bud opacity, ground-glass opacity, atypical pneumonia) was significantly higher in the virus-positive group (p= 0.020). Conclusions Viral respiratory tract infections should be considered in hospitalized patients with an exacerbation of COPD who have a history of frequent exacerbations, normal PCT value, and the absence of consolidation in CT scan of the chest. The use of broadspectrum antibiotic therapy should be avoided in patients with these features.","Yormaz, Burcu; Fındık, Duygu; Süerdem, Mecit",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.68471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414643/,316
82896,Transradial middle meningeal artery embolization for chronic subdural hematoma using Onyx: case series.,2020-06-29,"BACKGROUND Prediction of ligand binding and design of new function in enzymes is a time-consuming and expensive process. Crystallography gives the impression that proteins adopt a fixed shape, yet enzymes are functionally dynamic. Molecular dynamics offers the possibility of probing protein movement while predicting ligand binding. Accordingly, we choose the bacterial F1Fo ATP synthase ε subunit to unravel why ATP affinity by ε subunits from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus PS3 differs ~500-fold, despite sharing identical sequences at the ATP-binding site. METHODS We first used the Bacillus PS3 ε subunit structure to model the B. subtilis ε subunit structure and used this to explore the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the influence of residues outside the ATP binding site. To verify the MD predictions, point mutants were made and ATP binding studies were employed. RESULTS MD simulations predicted that E102 in the B. subtilis ε subunit, outside of the ATP binding site, influences ATP binding affinity. Engineering E102 to alanine or arginine revealed a ~10 or ~54 fold increase in ATP binding, respectively, confirming the MD prediction that E102 drastically influences ATP binding affinity. CONCLUSIONS These findings reveal how MD can predict how changes in the ""second shell"" residues around substrate binding sites influence affinity in simple protein structures. Our results reveal why seemingly identical ε subunits in different ATP synthases have radically different ATP binding affinities. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE This study may lead to greater utility of molecular dynamics as a tool for protein design and exploration of protein design and function.","Krah, Alexander; van der Hoeven, Bas; Mestrom, Luuk; Tonin, Fabio; Knobel, Kirsten C C; Bond, Peter J; McMillan, Duncan G G",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

83050,[Experience with 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in HIV-infected patients].,2020-12-26,"BACKGROUND Ligation clips are used ubiquitously throughout minimally invasive surgery for apposition of tissues. Their size limits their application beyond ligation of small tubular structures. A novel clip and clip applicator that allows for broad-area clamping and rotation has been developed by our team. The primary aim of this study is to provide preliminary data assessing tensile strength of the clip across apposed segments of bowel. METHODS A comparative study evaluating the maximum load (N) held across two apposed tissues by (a) our novel broad-area clip and (b) a conventional commercial clip was performed. Two sections of porcine bowel were clamped together and the maximum load (N) was measured using a tensile strength material testing machine. A preliminary experiment comparing staple line leak pressures in a porcine model ± clip enforcement of staple line was also conducted. p < 0.05 determined statistical significance. RESULTS Twenty-four samples (intervention = 15; control = 9) of porcine bowel annealed by surgical clips were tested. The mean maximum force withheld by the bowel and staples was greater for our novel clip design (2.043 ± 0.831 N) than the control clip (1.080 ± 0.466 N, p = 0.004). Ten staple line (intervention = 5; control = 5) pressures of porcine bowel were measured. There was no statistically significant difference between the leak pressures with clip reinforcement (84.8 mmHg; range 71.8-109.8 mmHg), or without (54.1 mmHg; range 26.3-98.9 mmHg). CONCLUSION These preliminary results suggest that our novel clip is able to withstand higher tensile force across tissues compared to a leading commercial clip. A small preliminary trial of effect on leak pressures demonstrated no statistical significance; however, increasing reliability of staple line deformation may be a clinically important finding. Whilst further iteration of product design and clinical testing is required, this product may occupy an important clinical niche through staple line reinforcement, enterotomy closure and other applications.","Erridge, Simon; Payne, Christopher J; Sodergren, Mikael",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06860-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227900/,316

While current data suggest that single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy is feasible, safe, and roughly equivalent to standard laparoscopic right colectomy, the technique has to date only been described in highly selected patients. Single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy has not yet been assessed in a standard patient population. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate all single-incision right hemicolectomies performed by a single surgeon between May 2010 and April 2011. Demographic data, operative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy was performed in a series of 30 consecutive patients with indications for right colectomy. One patient required conversion to an open procedure for extensive adhesions, while no patients required additional port placement. Mean operative time was 107 min. All patients had negative margins and had an average of 20 lymph nodes harvested. Mean length of stay was 6 days. There were no intraoperative complications and no mortality in the study. The perioperative complication rate was 37%, with 71% of complications being grade 1. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is feasible, safe, efficient, and oncologically sound for most patients who are seen in a typical colorectal practice. These data are useful as single-incision laparoscopic colectomy becomes more broadly implemented.","Boone, Brian A; Wagner, Patrick; Ganchuk, Emily; Evans, Leonard; Zeh, Herb J; Bartlett, David L; Holtzman, Matthew P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2076-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179463/,316

Cichlid fishes are well known for spectacular evolutionary radiations, as they have repeatedly evolved into large and phenotypically diverse arrays of species. Cichlid genomes carry signatures of past events and, at the same time, are the substrate for ongoing evolution. We survey genome-wide data and the available literature covering 438 cichlid populations (412 species) across multiple radiations to synthesize information about patterns and sharing of genetic variation. Nucleotide diversity within species is low in cichlids, with 92% of surveyed populations having less diversity than the median value found in other vertebrates. Divergence within radiations is also low, and a large proportion of variation is shared among species due to incomplete lineage sorting and widespread hybridization. Population genetics therefore provides a suitable conceptual framework for evolutionary genomic studies of cichlid radiations. We focus in detail on the roles of hybridization in shaping the patterns of genetic variation and in promoting cichlid diversification.

Planned Happenstance Theory (PHT) is a career development model focusing on positive outcomes resulting from unpredictable pre-career events. This mixed methods study explores how PHT applies to the career paths of a clinical anatomy (CA) post-graduate cohort. It provides insight into educational practices designed to equip students for labor markets inside and outside academia. Alumni of CA (n = 12; 2014-2018) were interviewed about career related events transpiring from graduate studies to present, allowing exploration on how PHT contextualizes their shared experiences. Planned happenstance career inventory (PHCI) enumerated planned happenstance skill (PHS) scores. Total PHS was referenced 527 times across 12 interviews. Of the PHS references, curiosity established highest incidence (154 references, 29%), optimism (132 references, 25%), flexibility (101 references, 19%), risk-taking (85 references, 16%), and persistence (55 references, 10%) and 43 distinct happenstance events were documented. In addition, social networking (52 references) arose as an emergent code and was divided into internal networking (28 references, 54%) and external networking (24 references, 46%). Application of the five-point PHCI scale revealed: curiosity (4.4 ±0.3; mean ±SD), flexibility (3.6 ±0.7), persistence (4.4 ±0.3), optimism (4.3 ±0.4), and risk-taking (4.1 ±0.5). Curiosity had the strongest association with happenstance event incidence. Social networking was a key substituent of PHT not yet described in the literature.

For symptomatic patients in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST), we assessed if differences in time between symptoms and carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting are associated with differences in risk of periprocedural stroke or death. METHODS We analyzed the 1180 symptomatic patients in CREST who received their assigned procedure and had clearly defined timing of symptoms. Patients were classified into 3 groups based on time from symptoms to procedure: <15, 15 to 60, and >60 days. RESULTS For carotid endarterectomy, risk of periprocedural stroke or death was not significantly different for the 2 later time periods relative to the earliest time period (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-2.49 for 15-60 days and hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-3.33 for >60 days; P=0.89). For carotid artery stenting, risk of periprocedural stroke or death was also not significantly different for later time periods relative to the earliest time period (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-2.40 for 15-60 days and hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-2.75 for >60 days; P=0.93).

84590,Endothelial trauma from mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke: in vitro live-cell platform with animal validation.,2015,"PURPOSE To report low complication rates in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, a novel glass injector, and donor tissue prestripped by an eye bank technician. METHODS A standardized technique of DMEK was performed in 80 consecutive Fuchs corneal dystrophy cases using technician-prestripped tissue, a novel glass injector, a modified Yoeruek tap technique, and an SF6 gas (20% concentration) bubble for prolonged tissue support. Twenty-five donors were premarked with an ""S"" stamp for intraoperative orientation. Surgery was performed by 2 experienced DMEK surgeons and 2 inexperienced cornea fellows. Complications were recorded, and the percent endothelial cell loss was calculated at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS There were 5 cases that received an air bubble injection postoperatively (6% rebubble rate). There were 6 grafts that immediately failed, 2 because of excessive surgical trauma, and 4 because of upside-down graft placement documented by optical coherence tomography. None of the 25 cases with an S stamp failed. Recipient corneas cleared quickly with no clinical evidence of toxicity from the SF6 gas bubble, and the grafts experienced a mean endothelial cell loss of 27% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Tissue prestripped by an eye bank technician can be safely used for DMEK surgery. SF6 gas for prolonged tissue support may reduce the rebubble rate in DMEK, with no apparent acute toxic effect. An unrecognized upside-down graft was the primary cause of graft failure in this series. Upside-down grafts may be eliminated by the use of donor tissue premarked by the eye bank with an S orientation stamp.","Terry, Mark A; Straiko, Michael D; Veldman, Peter B; Talajic, Julia C; VanZyl, Cor; Sales, Christopher S; Mayko, Zachary M",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000000479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26075461/,316

O-LI farms had the largest perennial pasture area (52.3%), with the greatest botanical richness during all seasons. Area of perennial pasture was positively correlated with number of species consumed by the animals (R² = 0.74). Milk from O-LI farms had higher levels of fat and total solids only during the winter. Hygienic and microbiological quality of the milk was poor for all farms and need to be improved. C-HI farms had high milk yield related to high input, C-LI had intermediate characteristics and O-LI utilized a year round perennial pasture as a strategy to diminish the use of supplements in animal diets, which is an important aspect in ensuring production sustainability.","Kuhnen, Shirley; Stibuski, Rudinei Butka; Honorato, Luciana Aparecida; Filho, Luiz Carlos Pinheiro Machado",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani5030367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479369/,316

METHOD Patients undergoing liver resection for CLM by 5 surgeons at 3 institutions from 2000 to early 2014 were analysed. IPTW based on propensity scores were generated and used to assess the marginal treatment effect of the laparoscopic approach via a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS A total of 298 operations were performed in 256 patients. 7 patients with planned two-stage resections were excluded leaving 284 operations in 249 patients for analysis. After IPTW, the population was well balanced. With a median follow up of 36 months, 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the cohort were 59% and 38%. 146 laparoscopic procedures were performed in 140 patients, with weighted 5-year OS and RFS of 54% and 36% respectively. In the open group, 138 procedures were performed in 122 patients, with a weighted 5-year OS and RFS of 63% and 38% respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of OS or RFS. CONCLUSION In the Brisbane experience, after accounting for bias in treatment assignment, long term survival after LLR for CLM is equivalent to outcomes in open surgery.","Lewin, Joel W; O'Rourke, Nicholas A; Chiow, Adrian K H; Bryant, Richard; Martin, Ian; Nathanson, Leslie K; Cavallucci, David J",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2015.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902138/,316
85202,Is Bridging Necessary? A Pilot Study of Bridging versus Primary Stentriever-Based Endovascular Reperfusion in Large Anterior Circulation Strokes.,2015,"When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established in 1988, an estimated 350,000 poliomyelitis cases were reported worldwide. In 2020, 140 wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were confirmed, representing a 99.99% reduction since 1988. WPV type 1 transmission remains endemic in only two countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan), but outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) occurred in 33 countries during 2019-2020 (1,2). Poliovirus transmission is detected primarily through syndromic surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years, with confirmation by laboratory testing of stool specimens. Environmental surveillance supplements AFP surveillance and plays an increasingly important role in detecting poliovirus transmission. Within 2 weeks of COVID-19 being declared a global pandemic (3), GPEI recommended continuing surveillance activities with caution and paused all polio supplementary immunization activities (4). This report summarizes surveillance performance indicators for 2019 and 2020 in 42 priority countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission and updates previous reports (5). In 2020, 48% of priority countries* in the African Region, 90% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 40% in other regions met AFP surveillance performance indicators nationally. The number of priority countries rose from 40 in 2019 to 42 in 2020.† Analysis of 2019-2020 AFP surveillance data from 42 countries at high risk for poliovirus transmission indicates that national and subnational nonpolio AFP rates and stool specimen adequacy declined in many priority countries, particularly in the African Region, suggesting a decline in surveillance sensitivity and quality. The findings in this report can be used to guide improvements to restore a sensitive surveillance system that can track poliovirus transmission and provide evidence of interruption of transmission.","Tuma, Jude N; Wilkinson, Amanda L; Diop, Ousmane M; Jorba, Jaume; Gardner, Tracie; Snider, Cynthia J; Anand, Abhijeet; Ahmed, Jamal",MMWR.

85623,Early results of endovascular treatment of patients with bilateral stenoses of the internal carotid arteries using proximal protection systems at 30-day follow-up.,2017,"PURPOSE Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a prevalent sleep disorder in which apnea and hypopnea occur frequently during sleep and result in increase of the risk of lifestyle-related disease development as well as daytime sleepiness. Although SAS is a common sleep disorder, most patients remain undiagnosed because the gold standard test polysomnography (PSG), is high-cost and unavailable in many hospitals. Thus, an SAS screening system that can be used easily at home is needed. METHODS Apnea during sleep affects changes in the autonomic nervous function, which causes fluctuation of the heart rate. In this study, we propose a new SAS screening method that combines heart rate measurement and long short-term memory (LSTM) which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). We analyzed the data of intervals between adjacent R waves (R-R interval; RRI) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) records, and used an LSTM model whose inputs are the RRI data is trained to discriminate the respiratory condition during sleep. RESULTS The application of the proposed method to clinical data showed that it distinguished between patients with moderate-to-severe SAS with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%, results which are superior to any other existing SAS screening methods. CONCLUSION Since the RRI data can be easily measured by means of wearable heart rate sensors, our method may prove to be useful as an SAS screening system at home.","Iwasaki, Ayako; Nakayama, Chikao; Fujiwara, Koichi; Sumi, Yukiyoshi; Matsuo, Masahiro; Kano, Manabu; Kadotani, Hiroshi",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02249-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423183/,316

Seven major metabolic indices were measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT in 93 patients with HCC, prior to OLT. The Mann-Whitney U test was then used to predict the association of metabolic indices, including the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), tumor-to-mediastinum SUV ratio, tumor-to-normal-liver SUV ratio, SUV normalized to lean body mass metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and uptake-volume product (UVP), with the recurrence risk. The Deauville-like scoring system was used to quantify the recurrence risk. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were performed to determine survival rate. The results showed that Deauville-like score (PET-negative vs. -positive), MTV (cutoff value, 13.36), TLG (cutoff value, 62.21) and UVP (cutoff value, 66.60) had high prediction performance for tumor recurrence (P<0.05). TLG had the highest receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.725. Among the clinical factors, high level of α-fetoprotein (AFP, ≥144 ng/ml), Milan criteria, tumor number (>3), involvement of both right and left lobes, and tumor size (>5 cm) were found to be significant predictors of tumor recurrence. Patients in the low metabolic group had longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) times compared with those in the high metabolic group, regardless of whether they met the Milan criteria or not. AFP, uptake-volume product according the SUV mean of mediastinum (UVP-M), Milan criteria, lymph node metastasis, and the number of tumors were significant prognostic factors for RFS (P<0.05) in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Additionally, the MVI was a significant prognostic factor based on univariate survival analyses. Overall, the present study demonstrated the metabolic burden indices measured by PET/CT, Deauville-like score, MTV, TLG and UVP as significant prognostic factors in patients with HCC following OLT. The combination of metabolic indices measured by PET/CT and the existing criteria, such as the Milan criteria, may play an important role in evaluating the suitability of OLT in specific patients.","Ding, Enci; Lu, Dongyan; Wei, Lijuan; Feng, Xuemin; Shen, Jie; Xu, Wengui",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724365/,316
86216,Time and diffusion lesion size in major anterior circulation ischemic strokes.,2014,"BACKGROUND Surgical training has long been to ""never let the sun set on a bowel obstruction"" without an operation to rule out and/or treat compromised bowel. However, advances in diagnostics have called into question the appropriate timing of non-emergent operations and expectant management is increasingly used. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of expectant management for adhesive small bowel obstruction (aSBO) compared to early, non-emergent operation. MATERIALS & METHODS We queried PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies (1990-present) comparing early, non-emergent operations and expectant management for aSBO (PROSPERO #CRD42017057676). RESULTS Of 4873 studies, 29 cohort studies were included for full-text review. Four studies directly compared early surgery with expectant management, but none excluded patients who underwent emergent operations from those having early non-emergent surgery, precluding a direct comparison of the two treatment types of interest. When aggregated, the rate of bowel resection was 29% in patients undergoing early operation vs. 10% in those undergoing expectant management. The rate of successful, non-operative management in the expectant group was 58%. There was a 1.3-day difference in LOS favoring expectant management (LOS 9.7 vs. 8.4 days), and the rate of death was 2% in both groups. CONCLUSION Despite the shift towards expectant management of aSBO, no published studies have yet compared early, non-emergent operation and expectant management. A major limitation in evaluating the outcomes of these approaches using existing studies is confounding by indication related to including patients with emergent indications for surgery on admission in the early operative group. A future study, randomizing patients to early non-emergent surgery or expectant management, should inform the comparative safety and value of these approaches.","Thornblade, Lucas W; Verdial, Francys C; Bartek, Matthew A; Flum, David R; Davidson, Giana H",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-018-4017-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788717/,316

87384,Acute ischemic stroke with tandem lesions: technical endovascular management and clinical outcomes from the ESCAPE trial.,2018,"Poorly regulated reward seeking is a central feature of substance use disorder. Recent research shows that rewarding drug-related experiences induce synchronous activation of a discrete number of neurons in the nucleus accumbens that are causally linked to reward-related contexts. Here we comprehensively characterize the specific ensemble of neurons built through experience that are linked to seeking behavior. We additionally address the question of whether or not addictive drugs usurp the neuronal networks recruited by natural rewards by evaluating cocaine- and sucrose-associated ensembles within the same mouse. We used FosCreERT2/+/Ai14 transgenic mice to tag cells activated by and potentially encoding cocaine and sucrose seeking. We tagged ~1% of neurons in the core subregion of the accumbens (NAcore) activated during cue-induced seeking for cocaine or sucrose. The majority of tagged cells in the seeking ensembles were D1-MSNs, and specifically activated during seeking, not during extinction or when mice remained in the home cage. To compare different reward-specific ensembles within the same mouse, we used a dual cocaine and sucrose self-administration protocol allowing reward-specific seeking. Using this model, we found ~70% distinction between the cells constituting the cocaine- compared to the sucrose-seeking ensemble. Establishing that cocaine recruits an ensemble of NAcore neurons largely distinct from neurons recruited into an ensemble coding for sucrose seeking suggest a finely tuned specificity of ensembles. The findings allow further exploration of the mechanisms that transform reward-based positive reinforcement into maladaptive drug seeking.","Bobadilla, Ana-Clara; Dereschewitz, Eric; Vaccaro, Lucio; Heinsbroek, Jasper A; Scofield, Michael D; Kalivas, Peter W",Molecular psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00888-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985600/,316

METHOD This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial conducted at three academic medical centers. Participants were 139 outpatients with persistent symptoms of major depression after an 8-week open-label trial of escitalopram (phase 1), randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive adjunctive ziprasidone (escitalopram plus ziprasidone, N=71) or adjunctive placebo (escitalopram plus placebo, N=68), with 8 weekly follow-up assessments. The primary outcome measure was clinical response, defined as a reduction of at least 50% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A) and Visual Analog Scale for Pain were defined a priori as key secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Rates of clinical response (35.2% compared with 20.5%) and mean improvement in HAM-D total scores (-6.4 [SD=6.4] compared with -3.3 [SD=6.2]) were significantly greater for the escitalopram plus ziprasidone group. Several secondary measures of antidepressant efficacy also favored adjunctive ziprasidone. The escitalopram plus ziprasidone group also showed significantly greater improvement on HAM-A score but not on Visual Analog Scale for Pain score. Ten (14%) patients in the escitalopram plus ziprasidone group discontinued treatment because of intolerance, compared with none in the escitalopram plus placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Ziprasidone as an adjunct to escitalopram demonstrated antidepressant efficacy in adult patients with major depressive disorder experiencing persistent symptoms after 8 weeks of open-label treatment with escitalopram.","Papakostas, George I; Fava, Maurizio; Baer, Lee; Swee, Michaela B; Jaeger, Adrienne; Bobo, William V; Shelton, Richard C",The American journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14101251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26085041/,316

These tools can tackle the disparities in healthcare access as the technology can be implemented on smartphones. We present the first, large-scale study on patients with skin-of-color, in which the feasibility of a novel mobile health application (mHealth app) was investigated in actual clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE To develop a mHealth app to diagnose 40 common skin diseases and test it in clinical settings. METHODS A convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained with clinical images of 40 skin diseases. A smartphone app was generated and validated on 5,014 patients, attending rural and urban outpatient dermatology departments in India. The results of this mHealth app were compared against the dermatologists' diagnoses. RESULTS The machine-learning model, in an in silico validation study, demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 76.93±0.88% and mean area-under-curve of 0.95±0.02 on a set of clinical images.

In many settings, particularly Canada, the majority of overdose deaths occur indoors and impact structurally vulnerable people who use drugs alone, making targeted housing-based interventions a priority. Mobile applications have been developed that allow individuals to solicit help to prevent overdose death. We examine the experiences of women residents utilizing an overdose response button technology within a supportive housing environment. METHODS In October 2019, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 14 residents of a women-only supportive housing building in an urban setting where the overdose response button technology was installed. Data was analyzed thematically and framed by theories of structural vulnerability. RESULTS While participants described the utility and disadvantages of the technology for overdose response, most participants, unexpectedly described alternate adoptions of the technology. Participants used the technology for other emergency situations (e.g., gender-based violence), rather than its intended purpose of overdose response. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the limitations of current technologies while also demonstrating the clear need for housing-based emergency response interventions that address not just overdose risk but also gender-based violence.

During the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made patient travel to the hospital challenging and necessitated reduction in operative volume so that resources could be conserved. We report our experience with synchronous bilateral metastasectomies for the treatment of disease in both lungs. METHODS Patients with bilateral pulmonary metastases who underwent simultaneous bilateral resections were compared with a cohort of patients who underwent staged resections. We used nearest-neighbor propensity score (1:1) matching to adjust for confounders. Perioperative outcomes were compared between groups using paired statistical analysis techniques. RESULTS Between 1998 and 2020, 36 patients underwent bilateral simultaneous metastasectomies. We matched 31 pairs of patients. The length of stay was significantly shorter in patients undergoing simultaneous resection (median 3 vs. 8 days, p < .001) and operative time was shorter (156 vs. 235.5 min, p < .001) when compared to the sum of both procedures in the staged group. The groups did not significantly differ with regard to postoperative complications. CONCLUSION In a carefully selected patient population, simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy is a safe option. A single procedure confers benefits for both the patient as well as the hospital resource system.","Feldman, Hope A; Zhou, Nicolas; Antonoff, Mara B; Hofstetter, Wayne L; Rajaram, Ravi; Rice, David C; Sepesi, Boris; Vaporciyan, Ara A; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Mehran, Reza J",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684226/,316

METHODS Twenty obese patients and 20 non-obese patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery were given dexmedetomidine infusion schemes. Venous blood samples were taken during and after dexmedetomidine administration. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was undertaken to investigate fat free mass (FFM) and normal fat mass (NFM) as size descriptors of volumes and clearances using non-linear mixed effects modeling. NFM partitions total body weight into FFM and fat mass calculated from total body weight (TBW) minus FFM. The relative influence of fat mass compared to FFM is described by the fraction of fat mass that makes fat equivalent to FFM (Ffat). RESULTS Theory-based allometric scaling using FFM best described weight and body composition differences in clearances and volumes A negative effect of fat mass of with an exponential parameter of -0.00541/kg (95 % CI -0.0118 to -0.00246) was estimated for clearance which indicates increased fat mass is associated with impairment of clearance. CONCLUSIONS The use of theory-based allometry with predictions of fat free mass has been able to separate the influences of weight and body composition and indicates that size-normalized clearance of dexmedetomidine is impaired in patients who are obese.,"Cortínez, Luis I; Anderson, Brian J; Holford, Nick H G; Puga, Valentina; de la Fuente, Natalia; Auad, Hernán; Solari, Sandra; Allende, Fidel A; Ibacache, Mauricio",European journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-015-1948-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26407689/,316

The presence of lumbosacral spine disease, a common cause of nonvascular lower extremity pain, may confound the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. The goal of this study was to quantify the prevalence of severe lumbar spine degenerative disease in patients referred for lower extremity arterial studies. METHODS All patients over age 18 years referred for segmental limb pressures and pulse volume recordings at rest and following treadmill exercise testing at a tertiary medical center accredited vascular diagnostic laboratory, who also underwent magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the lumbar spine within 6 months of the arterial studies, were included in the analysis. Frequencies of peripheral artery disease and lumbar spine degenerative disease were determined, and medical records were reviewed for cardiovascular risk factors and prior vascular and spinal interventions. RESULTS One hundred seven subjects (63 men) with a mean age of 70 years (range 35-88 years) were included in the analysis. Lumbar spine disease was present in 81 (75.7%) of the patients referred for vascular testing. The percentage of lumbar spine disease was equivalent in both patients with exercise-induced deterioration in arterial pressure and in those with a physiologic response to exercise. Compared with patients with a normal response to exercise, patients with exercise-induced peripheral artery disease had a lower resting ankle-brachial index (mean 0.79 vs 1.09, P <.001), abnormal pulse volume recordings, and were less likely to use opiate analgesics and more likely to have undergone lower extremity revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Severe lumbar spine degenerative disease is widely prevalent in patients referred for lower extremity arterial studies. Our findings may help explain the high prevalence of atypical limb symptoms among peripheral artery disease patients.","Ain, David L; Slovut, David P; Kamath, Ravi; Jaff, Michael R",The American journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22444105/,316

Results from the SITS International Stroke Thrombolysis Register.,2018,"The purpose of this project was to survey rural, minority, and underserved Alabamians regarding their perceptions of COVID-19 information, testing, and vaccination. Community health workers surveyed 3721 individuals from October 20-December 31, 2020. Participants came from 46 of Alabama's 67 counties (35 rural and 11 urban counties) and were largely Black (69.6%), female (56.5%), and between the ages of 40-59 years (34.8%). The majority of respondents reported that recommendations from public health agencies were easy to understand, information on COVID-19 was easy to find, and they felt confident in keeping themselves safe from infection. Most also reported they would get tested for COVID-19 if they had been exposed to someone who tested positive. Hesitancy to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was very high among all respondents; only 38.7% said they would be vaccinated. Significant differences by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and/or rural/urban status were seen for all survey items. Findings from this survey differ from other published studies and will be of interest to states with large rural, underserved, and minority populations as they tailor messaging for those most vulnerable. Findings also are now validated by Alabama's poor response to vaccine administration, which falls far short of the national vaccination rate, putting Alabamians at even greater risk. Building vaccine confidence among low vaccine populations remains challenging yet is imperative, especially for those populations with preexisting economic, social, and physical conditions that place them at continued high risk for COVID-19 infection.","Crozier, Joe; Christensen, Nicholas; Li, Peng; Stanley, Glenda; Clark, Debra S; Selleck, Cynthia",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2021.0216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637631/,316
89624,Letter: extending FIT from DG30 to NG12 patients.,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE To compare outcomes of lower eyelid retraction repair with 3 types of spacer grafts: autologous auricular cartilage, bovine acellular dermal matrix (Surgimend, Integra, Plainsboro, NJ), porcine acellular dermal matrix (Enduragen, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). METHODS A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted in patients undergoing lower eyelid retraction repair with spacer graft. Subjects received autologous auricular cartilage, bovine acellular dermal matrix, or porcine acellular dermal matrix between June 2015 and July 2016. Patient demographics, margin to reflex distance 2, conjunctival injection, eyelid swelling, tearing, discomfort, itching, and complications were recorded preoperatively and at postoperative week 1, month 1, month 3, and month 6. RESULTS Of the 49 randomized lower eyelids (39 patients), 42 eyelids (32 patients) completed the study. The preoperative margin to reflex distance 2, conjunctival injection, eyelid swelling, tearing, discomfort, and itching showed no statistical difference. Postoperative week 1 swelling was statistically significantly higher in auricular cartilage, followed by bovine acellular dermal matrix, then porcine acellular dermal matrix (p = 0.04). The mean postoperative month 6 margin to reflex distance 2 trended toward a better outcome from auricular cartilage over bovine acellular dermal matrix (p = 0.029), but after p was adjusted for multiple pairwise comparisons, this was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.088). All other postoperative 6-month measurements showed no statistical difference. CONCLUSIONS Among patients randomized to 3 types of spacer grafts for lower eyelid retraction repair, outcomes were not statistically significant different when the 3 groups were compared.","Barmettler, Anne; Heo, Moonseong",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/iop.0000000000000946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28658181/,316

While numerous health behaviour interventions targeting obesity exist, they are more successful at engaging higher socioeconomic status populations, leaving those in less affluent circumstances with poorer outcomes. This highlights a need for more tailored interventions. The aim of this study was to enhance an existing weight loss course for adults living in low socioeconomic communities. METHODS The Behaviour Change Wheel approach was followed to design an add-on intervention to an existing local authority-run weight loss group, informed by mixed-methods research and stakeholder engagement. RESULTS The COM-B analysis of qualitative data revealed that changes were required to psychological capability, physical and social opportunity and reflective motivation to enable dietary goal-setting behaviours. The resulting SMART-C booklet included 6 weeks of dietary goal setting, with weekly behavioural contract and review. CONCLUSION This paper details the development of the theory- and evidence-informed SMART-C intervention. This is the first report of the Behaviour Change Wheel being used to design an add-on tool to enhance existing weight loss services. The process benefitted from a further checking stage with stakeholders.","Coupe, Nia; Cotterill, Sarah; Peters, Sarah",Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350682/,316

91920,Impact of collaterals on successful revascularization in Solitaire FR with the intention for thrombectomy.,2014,"OBJECT Flow diversion has emerged as a promising treatment alternative for cerebral aneurysms. As a new device, treatment-related events and complications are currently being characterized. METHODS Data on 100 consecutive procedures with the intention to use flow diversion were prospectively collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Ninety-five aneurysms were treated in 93 patients during 100 consecutive procedures in which the intention was to treat an intracranial aneurysm with flow diversion. Death occurred in 1% and permanent morbidity in 1%. However, periprocedural technical complications occurred in 35% of the procedures and included proximal device migration in 12%, incomplete device expansion in 9%, catheter-induced vasospasm in 6%, and artery perforation from the wire in 3%. Perioperative clinical events were seen in 28% (thromboembolism and access site complications were the most common, being observed in 6.5% of patients). Worsened extraocular motility was seen in 5.4% and resolved in 4/5 patients. Mean clinical follow-up was 17 months. There were no late clinical or technical issues resulting in permanent deficits, although one patient suffered worsening ataxia. Overall, using very strict angiographic criteria, complete angiographic obliteration was 50% at 6 months and 69% after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion for intracranial aneurysms is a safe and effective treatment. Technical and clinical events are common in the perioperative period. Careful perioperative care and proper management of technical and clinical events encountered is key to achieving low morbidity and mortality. Late clinical events can occur but are unlikely to result in permanent complications.","Burrows, Anthony M; Cloft, Harry; Kallmes, David F; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25082803/,316

Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens.

The aim of this study was to characterize pharyngeal and esophageal pH-impedance reflux patterns in a group of patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux and to determine predictive factors of response to proton pump inhibitors. METHODS Patients with chronic pharyngolaryngeal symptoms were evaluated with a symptom score questionnaire, laryngoscopy, and 24-hour pharyngeal and esophageal pH-impedance monitoring at baseline and after 8-week treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. Response to treatment was defined by a diminution of more than 50% of the score for the primary symptom. Reflux patterns and baseline impedance values were compared to those obtained in 46 healthy subjects. KEY RESULTS Twenty-four patients were included (17 women, median age 54 years), all previously refractory to antisecretory therapy. Symptom scores were 46 (32-62) and 40 (27-76) off and on therapy, respectively (P=.1). There was no significant difference between patients and controls for pH-impedance reflux parameters and baseline values off and on therapy in distal and proximal esophagus and in the pharynx. Median numbers of pharyngeal reflux were 0 and 0 off and on therapy, respectively. Only two patients were responders to treatment, both with excessive distal reflux but no pharyngeal reflux. Only one patient had abnormal pharyngeal reflux but did not respond to proton pump inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS Patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux refractory to therapy do not exhibit abnormal pharyngeal or esophageal pH-impedance reflux. In these patients, laryngopharyngeal reflux is unlikely.","Dulery, C; Lechot, A; Roman, S; Bastier, P-L; Stoll, D; de Gabory, L; Zerbib, F",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27424517/,316

STUDY DESIGN Systematic search of randomized and nonrandomized studies assessing early mobilization-based physical therapy in critically ill children under 18 years of age in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, the National Institutes of Health, Evidence in Pediatric Intensive Care Collaborative, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the Mobilization-Network. We extracted data to identify the types of mobility-based interventions and definitions for early, as well as barriers, feasibility, adverse events, and efficacy outcomes (mortality, morbidities, and length of stay). RESULTS Of 1199 titles found, we included 11 studies (2 pilot trials and 9 observational studies) and 1 clinical practice guideline in the analyses. Neurodevelopmentally appropriate increasing mobility levels have been described for critically ill children, and ""early"" mobilization was defined as either a range (within 48-72 hours) from admission to the pediatric intensive care unit or when clinical safety criteria are met. Current evidence suggests that early mobilization is safe and feasible and institutional practice guidelines significantly increase the frequency of rehabilitation consults, improve the proportion of patients who receive early mobilization, and reduce the time to mobilization. However, there were inconsistencies in populations and interventions across studies, and imprecision and risk of bias in included studies that precluded us from pooling data to evaluate the efficacy outcomes of early mobilization. CONCLUSIONS The definition of early mobilization varies, but seems to be feasible and safe in critically ill children. The efficacy for early mobilization in this population is yet undetermined because of the low certainty of the evidence available.","Cuello-Garcia, Carlos A; Mai, Safiah Hwai Chuen; Simpson, Racquel; Al-Harbi, Samah; Choong, Karen",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2018.07.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172429/,316

Currently, it is unclear when this inflammatory syndrome develops in respect to a COVID-19 infection. The clinical features of this syndrome seem to overlap between Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and myocarditis. All patients presenting to our emergency department had fever, variable rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Patients remained persistently tachycardic and febrile despite being given proper doses of antipyretics. Severity of presentations varied among the 4 cases. All 4 patients were found to have antibodies to COVID-19.

Adolescents have been especially affected with school closure and home confinement. The impact of the pandemic on sleep habits and quality of sleep and quality of life among adolescents have not been adequately characterized. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic induced an evening shift of the daily rhythm among adolescents and adversely affected sleep quality and quality of life of high school students. METHODS Students were questioned about their usual bed and wake-up times and answered the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) before and during the pandemic. RESULTS Ninety-four students (64% females, aged 15+1 years) participated in both phases of the study. Students delayed bed and wake-up times in 1.5[0.5-2.0] and 2.0[1.5-2.5]h, respectively. Chronotype (MEQ) shifted towards eveningness during the pandemic. Sleep duration increased and quality of sleep (PSQI) improved only among those students with shorter sleep duration before the pandemic. During the pandemic, the physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL worsened but the environmental domain improved as compared to the study before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS High school students delayed bed and wake-up times and shifted chronotype towards eveningness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The worsening of the physical and psychological WHOQOL domains and improvement of the environmental domain highlights the conflicting experiences that high school students are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Genta, Felipe Dias; Rodrigues Neto, Guilherme Brito; Velletri Sunfeld, João Pedro; Porto, João Fabio; Xavier, Andressa Dallago; Moreno, Claudia R C; Lorenzi-Filho, Geraldo; Genta, Pedro Rodrigues",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.9196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666168/,316

The mechanisms that result in depressive behaviors are not fully understood; however, the hippocampus has been noted as a key structure in the pathophysiology of depression. In addition to neural implications of depression, the cardiovascular system is impacted. Although not as commonly considered, the cerebrovasculature is critical to brain function, impacted by environmental stimuli, and is capable of altering neural function and thereby behavior. In the current study, we assessed the relationship between depressive behavior and a marker of vascularization of the hippocampus in adult female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Similar to previously noted impacts on neuropil and glia, the depressed phenotype predicts a reduction in a marker of vascular length in the anterior hippocampus. These data reinforce the growing recognition of the effects of depression on vasculature and support further consideration of vascular endpoints in studies aimed at the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying depression.","Kalidindi, Anisha; Kelly, Sean D; Singleton, Kaela S; Guzman, Dora; Merrill, Liana; Willard, Stephanie L; Shively, Carol A; Neigh, Gretchen N",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423324/,316

Restrictions such as banning visitors, sequestering residents, and testing health care staff have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, consequences include a decline in mental and physical health, decompensation, and a sense of hopelessness among residents. We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.","Parekh de Campos, Amisha; Daniels, Susan",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417386/,316

94833,Is duodenojejunal anastomosis to the left of the superior mesenteric vessels a feasible option for tumors of the angle of Treitz?,2016,"Computational docking and virtual screening are two main important methods employed in structure-based drug design. Unlike the traditional approach that allows docking of a flexible ligand against a handful of receptor structures, receptor flexibility has now been appreciated and increasingly incorporated in computer-aided docking. Using a diverse set of receptor conformations increases the chances of finding potential drugs and inhibitors. Molecular dynamics (MD) is greatly useful to generate various receptor conformations. However, the diversity of the structures of the receptor, which is usually much larger than the ligand, depends on the sampling efficiency of MD. Enhanced sampling methods based on accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) can alleviate the sampling limitation of conventional MD and aid in representation of the phase space to a much greater extent. RaMD-db, a variant of aMD that applies boost potential to the rotatable dihedrals and non-bonded diffusive degrees of freedom has been proven to reproduce the equilibrium properties more accurately and efficiently than aMD. Here, we discuss recent advances in the aMD methodology and review the applicability of RaMD-db as an enhanced sampling method. RaMD-db is shown to be able to generate a broad distribution of structures of a drug target, Cyclophilin A. These structures that have never been observed previously in very long conventional MD can be further used for structure-based computer-aided drug discovery, and docking, and thus, in the identification and design of potential novel inhibitors.","Rodriguez-Bussey, Isela G; Doshi, Urmi; Hamelberg, Donald",Biopolymers,https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.22740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26352326/,316

The most important factor in the synthesis of SACs is the selection of appropriate support and formation of metal-support interaction. Among a large number of nanomaterials, MXenes can be utilized as benign supports for fixing SACs because of their expansive specific surface area, regulable bandgap, superior electronic conductivity, and strong mechanical stability. The structure and property of MXenes can be manipulated by changing transition metal elements and surface termination. Here, the uniqueness and superiority of MXenes as superexcellent supports for confining SACs are analyzed from structure and property. The synthetic strategy of MXene-supported SACs is also summarized, especially emphasizing the immobilization of isolated atom against aggregation by utilizing the formidable metal-support covalent coordination interaction. In addition, the applications of MXene-supported SACs in electrocatalytic field are highlighted, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Finally, the challenges and prospects are pointed out for the further understanding and practical application of MXene-supported SACs in electrocatalysis.","Zhang, Mingming; Lai, Cui; Li, Bisheng; Liu, Shiyu; Huang, Danlian; Xu, Fuhang; Liu, Xigui; Qin, Lei; Fu, Yukui; Li, Ling; Yi, Huan; Chen, Liang",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202007113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047018/,316

METHODS We developed a probabilistic Markov model to estimate health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), life years gained (LYG), and costs over lifetime and 10-year horizons. Combined common BS procedures were compared with CM. Clinical and utility inputs were obtained from the literature and resource use and costs from local sources (€2017). RESULTS Over the 10-year horizon, BS led to a cost increment of €9,386 and 1.6 additional QALY (€5,966/QALY). Leading to 0.6 LYG and 4.4 QALY gains and €300/patient average cost savings over lifetime, BS could potentially significantly reduce diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk over the considered horizons. Despite short-term cost reductions, surgery delay may lead to significant clinical benefits loss. CONCLUSIONS Compared to CM, BS is a more effective and less costly alternative for treating morbid obesity in Spain.","Sanchez-Santos, Raquel; Padin, Esther Mariño; Adam, Daniel; Borisenko, Oleg; Fernandez, Sergio Estevez; Dacosta, Ester Carrera; Fernández, Sonia González; Vazquez, Juan Turnes; de Adana, Juan Carlos Ruiz; de la Cruz Vigo, Felipe",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2018.1407649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29188745/,316

The purpose of this investigation was to understand the prevalence of veterinarians' behaviours around neutering cats at four months of age and to identify any needs of the veterinary profession on this. METHODS A sample of 483 veterinarians that completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire were included in quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS Almost 70 per cent of veterinarians indicated they were comfortable carrying out neutering on cats of four months of age, and approximately half of veterinarians indicated they would recommend neutering client-owned cats at four months of age if practice policy permitted. There was no association found between these practices and geographic risk factors. Instead, neutering at four months was associated with the gender of the veterinarian, their practice policy and whether they routinely neuter unowned cats. Veterinarians have contrasting beliefs on similar themes, depending on whether they neuter kittens at four months or not, including differing opinions on general anaesthetic, surgery risks, owner compliance and their perceptions of neutering practices within the wider profession. CONCLUSION Familiarity and experience with the procedure, alongside perceived norms, are central to beliefs. We also highlight informational and learning barriers.","McDonald, Jenni; Clements, Jane",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.105887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764034/,316

Women who continued to work at their workplace presented significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those who stayed at home. No significant differences were found regarding depression and anxiety symptoms scores when comparing the current sample with an infertility reference sample and a community sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms remained stable, but there was a significant decrease in perceived stress over the eight-week period. Although these findings do not suggest a worsening of psychological difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals should be attentive to patients' long-term psychological consequences.

96562,Tribute to Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki - Discoverer of Kawasaki Disease and a Great Pediatrician.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used to treat patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). CPAP treatment in severe CHF with concomitant SDB and atrial fibrillation has been linked to impairment of cardiac output (CO) as a potential cause for adverse outcome. The aim of the present study was to test whether incremental CPAP application in awake CHF patients with SDB, with and without atrial fibrillation, induces acute alterations of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and CO. METHODS During daytime, we applied incremental CPAP (4-10 cmH2O) in 37 stable patients with CHF and SDB. BP and HR were assessed after each 1 cmH2O CPAP increase in 5-min intervals in the entire sample, and CO was assessed at one centre (n = 11). RESULTS Neither mean BP, HR nor CO changed significantly with incremental CPAP (at 0 and 10 cmH2O: 85 ± 2 and 84 ± 2 mm Hg, P = 1.0, 63 ± 1 to 61 ± 2 b.p.m., P = 0.88 and 2.03 ± 0.5 and 2.35 ± 0.8 L/min/m2 , P = 0.92, respectively). No significant differences in maximum BP drop or HR drop between patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation were found. In 1 of 37 patients, a prespecified event of haemodynamic compromise (drop of mean BP >15 mm Hg) without clinical signs occurred. CONCLUSIONS These results contribute to the evidence that CPAP does not cause haemodynamic compromise in the vast majority of normotensive CHF patients with SDB.","Schroll, Stephan; Sériès, Frédéric; Lewis, Keir; Benjamin, Amit; Escourrou, Pierre; Luigart, Ruth; Pfeifer, Michael; Arzt, Michael",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24103043/,316
96565,Assessment of thrombotic adverse events and treatment patterns associated with varicose vein treatment.,2015,"PURPOSE The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increasing overload of the medical system. Healthcare workers (HCW) in radiology departments are exposed to a high infection risk similar to HCWs in the ICU or dedicated COVID wards. The goal of our paper is to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 among radiology HCWs in two different hospitals and regions in Germany with a low and high COVID-19 prevalence and to compare it to the prevalence in other clinical personnel. Additionally, we assessed the number of radiological procedures performed in patients with a positive PCR test (C+) followed by a short review of the risk for nosocomial infections of radiology HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS During the first COVID-19 wave between March and July 2020, we evaluated a region with one of the highest COVID-19 rates (776-1570/100 000) in Germany (Hospital A). Additionally, we assessed Hospital B in a region with a low prevalence (65/100 000). We tested the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among the whole staff with a subgroup analysis for radiology in both hospitals. We calculated the total number of different radiological procedures performed in C+ patients. RESULTS In Hospital A 594 PCR-proven C+ patients were treated resulting in 2723 radiological procedures. 24 % (n = 6) of the radiology technicians and 13.35 (n = 2) of radiologists had a positive IgG test. The rates were similar to positive rates in HCWs in COVID-19 wards and ICUs within the hospital. The most frequently performed procedures in C+ patients were chest X-rays (3.17/patient) and CT examinations (1.15/patient). In Hospital B 50 C+ patients were treated, resulting in 64 radiological procedures. None of the HCWs tested IgG positive. The most frequently performed examinations were also chest X-rays (1.04/patient) and CT (0.2/patient). CONCLUSION HCWs in radiology have a high occupational infection risk similar to that of HCWs in ICUs and dedicated COVID wards. KEY POINTS · The risk of acquiring COVID-19 increases with the amount of contact with infected individuals.. · The occupational risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection for radiology staff is similar to that of nurses and physicians in COVID wards.. · Hygiene concepts and medical resources have to be adapted for further COVID outbreaks.. · Reporting of an occupational disease can be considered in the case of seropositive staff..

Hopelessness, anhedonia, and dissociation represent some of the most pervasive psychopathological symptoms that often lead to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and actions. To further research on the concept of depression endophenotypes, this study aimed to assess the possible relationships between hopelessness and other clinical and biological correlates (i.e., striatal dopaminergic dysfunction) in depressed patients. Methods: We recruited 51 subjects with MDD. All subjects underwent 123I-FP-CIT SPECT to assess striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability and a psychometric evaluation using the psychometric scale to assess depressive, anxious, dissociative, and hopelessness symptoms aside from suicidal ideation. Result: An inverse correlation between the hopelessness score and dopamine transporter availability in all basal ganglia was bilaterally found. (Right Putamen, r = -0.445, p < 0.01; Left Putamen, r = -0.454, p < 0.01; Right Caudate, r = -0.398, p < 0.01; Left Caudate, r = -0.467, p < 0.01) Moreover, a positive correlation was also found between hopelessness and dissociative symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide important evidence on the neurobiological and clinical correlates of different psychopathological symptoms of depression with potential implications in terms of devising more effective treatment programs.","Pettorruso, Mauro; d'Andrea, Giacomo; Martinotti, Giovanni; Cocciolillo, Fabrizio; Miuli, Andrea; Di Muzio, Ilenia; Collevecchio, Rebecca; Verrastro, Valeria; De-Giorgio, Fabio; Janiri, Luigi; di Giannantonio, Massimo; Di Giuda, Daniela; Camardese, Giovanni",Brain sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10080519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764310/,316

By May 17, 2020 this number increased to 315,005. The risk of death is higher above the age of 60, but there are many deaths below 60 (for example, in Sao Paulo, 25%). Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than ""nothing"". Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions. Unfortunately, the Brazilian government is not fulfilling this role; on the contrary, it is a hindrance.

97723,Practices to Foster Physician Presence and Connection With Patients in the Clinical Encounter.,2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND Surgical patients present with a wide variety of body sizes and blood volumes, have large differences in baseline volume status, and may exhibit significant differences in cardiac function. Any closed-loop fluid administration system must be robust against these differences. In the current study, we tested the stability and robustness of the closed-loop fluid administration system against the confounders of body size, starting volume status, and cardiac contractility using control engineering methodology. METHODS Using an independently developed previously published hemodynamic simulation model that includes blood volumes and cardiac contractility, we ran a Monte-Carlo simulation series with variation in starting blood volume and body weight (phase 1, weight 35-100 kg), and starting blood volume and cardiac contractility (phase 2, contractility from 1500 [severe heart failure] to 6000 [hyperdynamic]). The performance of the controller in resuscitating to the target set point was evaluated in terms of milliliters of blood volume error from optimal, with <250 mL of error defined as ""successful."" RESULTS One thousand simulations were run for each of the 2 phases of the study. The phase 1 mean blood volume error ± SD from optimal was 25 ± 59 mL. The phase 2 mean blood volume error from optimal was -60 ± 89 mL. The lower 95% Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval for resuscitation to within 250 mL of optimal blood volume for phase 1 and 2 was 99.6% and 97.1%, respectively.

The World Health Organization released guidelines encouraging mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to breastfeed as the benefits of breastfeeding outweighs the possible risk of transmission. The objective of this study was to determine if SARS-CoV-2 was present in the breast milk of lactating mothers who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test prior to delivery, and the clinical outcomes for their newborns. STUDY DESIGN This was a single-center, observational, prospective cohort study. Maternal-newborn dyads that delivered at New York University Langone Hospital Brooklyn with confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2 positive screen test at the time of admission were recruited for the study. Breast milk samples were collected during postpartum hospitalization and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes N1 and N2 by two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the clinical characteristics of the maternal newborn dyad, results of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing, and neonatal follow-up data were collected. RESULTS A total of 19 mothers were included in the study and their infants who were all fed breast milk. Breast milk samples from 18 mothers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and 1 was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The infant who ingested the breast milk that tested positive had a negative nasopharyngeal test for SARS-CoV-2, and had a benign clinical course. There was no evidence of significant clinical infection during the hospital stay or from outpatient neonatal follow-up data for all the infants included in this study. CONCLUSION In a small cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive lactating mothers giving birth at our institution, most of their breast milk samples (95%) contained no detectable virus, and there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in their breast milk-fed neonates. KEY POINTS · Breast milk may rarely contain detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA and was not detected in asymptomatic mothers.. · Breast milk with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a symptomatic mother had no clinical significance for her infant.. · Breast feeding with appropriate infection control instructions appears to be safe in mother with COVID infection..","Kunjumon, Bgee; Wachtel, Elena V; Lumba, Rishi; Quan, Michelle; Remon, Juan; Louie, Moi; Verma, Sourabh; Moffat, Michael A; Kouba, Insaf; Bennett, Terri-Ann; Mejia, Claudia Manzano De; Mally, Pradeep V; Lin, Xinhua; Hanna, Nazeeh",American journal of perinatology,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1731451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182576/,316

Our aim was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of time-of-flight MR angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography for identification of vessel occlusion and collateral status in acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-three patients with stroke with large-vessel occlusion before thrombectomy were included in this retrospective study. Before thrombectomy, 3T MR imaging, including conventional 3D TOF-MRA of the intracranial arteries and contrast-enhanced MRA of intra- and extracranial arteries, was performed. Both techniques were assessed independently by 2 neuroradiologists for location of the occlusion, imaging quality, and collateral status. Findings were compared, with subsequent DSA as the reference standard. RESULTS Both techniques had good interrater agreement of κ = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.83) for TOF-MRA and κ = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.80) for contrast-enhanced MRA. Occlusion localization differed significantly on TOF-MRA compared with DSA (P < .001), while no significant difference was observed between DSA and contrast-enhanced MRA (P = .75). Assessment of collaterals showed very good agreement between contrast-enhanced MRA and DSA (94.9% with P = .25), but only fair agreement between TOF-MRA and DSA (23.2% with P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Contrast-enhanced MRA offers better diagnostic accuracy than TOF-MRA in acute ischemic stroke. Contrast-enhanced MRA was superior in localizing vessel occlusion within a shorter acquisition time while providing a larger coverage, including extracranial vessels, and a more accurate assessment of collateral status.

99344,Modified thresholds for fibrosis risk scores in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are necessary in the obese.,2017,"BACKGROUND Atherosclerosis is now widely recognized as a multifactorial disease with outcomes that arise from complex factors such as plaque components, blood flow, and inflammation. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active fat depot, abundant in proinflammatory cytokines, and has been correlated with the extent and severity of carotid artery disease (CD). The locations most frequently affected by carotid atherosclerosis are the proximal internal carotid artery (ie, the origin) and the common carotid artery bifurcation. Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. However, there are no systematic analyses or well-conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship between EAT and CD. The aim of this study is to examine this association of EAT with CD in different ages and sex. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted using published studies that will be identified from electronic databases (ie, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies that (1) examined the association between EAT and CD, (2) focus on cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies, (3) will conducted among in adults aged 40 to 70 years, (4) provided sufficient data for calculating ORs or relative risk with a 95% CI, (5) will published as original articles written in English or other languages, and (6) have been published until January 2018 will be included. Study selection, data collection, quality assessment and statistical syntheses will be conducted based on discussions among investigators. RESULTS We propose the current protocol to evaluate the evaluation of EAT with ED. CONCLUSION This systematic review will not need ethical approval, because it does not involve human beings. The results and findings of this study will be submitted and published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval was not required for this study because it was based on published studies. The results and findings of this study will be submitted and published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal.

We reviewed the National Cancer Database for men with Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer treated with RP and had pathologically node-negative disease. LNY was modeled as a continuous and categorical variable grouped by quartiles of LNY. Secondary treatment was defined as the use of radiation or systemic therapy post-RP. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to test for an association of LNY with OS and secondary treatments, respectively. We identified 89,416 men with pN0 prostate cancer treated with RP from 2010-2015. LNY was associated with improved OS when modeled as a categorical and continuous variable. The third (6-9 nodes) and fourth (≥10 nodes) quartiles of LNY were associated with improved OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96, P = 0.006 and HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98, P= 0.017, respectively) when compared with the lowest quartile of LNY (≤3 nodes) and the hazard of death decreased by 1% for each benign lymph node removed (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P= 0.022). Additionally, categorical and continuous LNY was associated with significantly less use of post-RP secondary treatments. Removal of additional negative lymph nodes was associated with improved OS and less secondary treatments in patients with pN0 prostate cancer. These data suggest that removing a higher quantity of lymph nodes provides more accurate staging and prognosis.","Ginsburg, Kevin B; Pressprich, Mark F; Wurst, Hallie A; Cher, Michael L",Current problems in cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2021.100740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931243/,316

We conducted the current study to assess KAP among the general population of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, based on an online cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a questionnaire we developed consisting of KAP questions. We also collected sociodemographic information and source of information about disease awareness. The main source of information regarding COVID-19 was Internet social media (66.3%) followed by TV (17.4%). We conducted nonparametric analyses on KAP scores using a Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis H tests (P < .05) to find out the association with sociodemographic characteristics. The overall knowledge score (correct answer) was 88.9%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, and occupation. The positive attitude score was 73.3%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, and geographic area. Overall, 93.0% positive practices were observed in the general population based on asked questions. These scores were significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, area, and occupation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the consequences of ignoring such signals in terms of the increased risk and vulnerability of insecure labor. This paper explores how such trends are generating intersecting adverse health outcomes for workers, communities, and environments and the implications for breaking siloes and building links between the paradigms, science, practice, and tools for occupational health, public health, and eco-health. Applying the principle of controlling hazards at the source is argued in this context to call for an understanding of the upstream production and socio-political factors that are jointly affecting the nature of work and employment and their impact on the health of workers, the public, and the planet.","Loewenson, Rene",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,https://doi.org/10.1177/10482911211017106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000888/,316

99816,Ischemic Stroke Risk Associated with Mitochondrial Haplogroup F in the Asian Population.,2020-08-11,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) plays a role in protecting retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from oxidative stress (OS), a causative factor of RPE cell death. Genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used to treat critical and incurable retinal diseases. Here, we overexpressed PEDF in placenta-derived MSCs (PD-MSCsPEDF, PEDF+) using a nonviral gene delivery system and evaluated the characteristics of PD-MSCsPEDF and their potential regenerative effects on RPE cells damaged by H2O2-induced OS. PD-MSCsPEDF maintained their stemness, cell surface marker, and differentiation potential characteristics. Compared to naive cells, PD-MSCsPEDF promoted mitochondrial respiration by enhancing biogenesis regulators (e.g., NRF1, PPARGC1A, and TFAM) as well as antioxidant enzymes (e.g., HMOXs, SODs, and GPX1). Compared to OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with naive cells, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF showed PEDF upregulation and VEGF downregulation. The expression levels of antioxidant genes and RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, RGR, and RRH, were significantly increased in RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF. Furthermore, OS-damaged RPE cells cocultured with PD-MSCsPEDF had dramatically enhanced mitochondrial functions, and antiapoptotic effects improved due to cell survival signaling pathways. In the H2O2-induced retinal degeneration rat model, compared to administration of the naive counterpart, intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF alleviated proinflammatory cytokines and restored retinal structure and function by increasing PEDF expression and decreasing VEGF expression. Intravitreal administration of PD-MSCsPEDF also protected retinal degeneration against OS by increasing antioxidant gene expression and regulating the mitochondrial ROS levels and biogenesis. Taken together, PEDF overexpression in PD-MSCs improved the mitochondrial activities and induced OS-damaged RPE cell regeneration by regulating the oxidative status and mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that genetic modification of PEDF in PD-MSCs might be a new cell therapy for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.","Kim, Jae Yeon; Park, Sohae; Park, So Hyun; Lee, Dongsook; Kim, Gyu Hyun; Noh, Jung Eun; Lee, Kea Joo; Kim, Gi Jin",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-0470-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724163/,316

METHODS Prospective observational before-after study performed in a ten-bed ICU. Cuff pressure was continuously recorded for 24 h in 76 intubated patients, including 26 with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 22 with cylindrical polyurethane (CPU), and 28 with tapered polyurethane (TPU)-cuffed tracheal tubes. P (cuff) was manually adjusted every 8 h by nurses and was maintained around 25 cmH(2)O. Time spent with cuff underinflation and overinflation was continuously measured. In addition, pepsin, a proxy for microaspiration of gastric contents, was quantitatively measured in tracheal secretions at the end of recording period. RESULTS A total of 1,824 h of continuous recording of cuff pressure was analyzed. Patient characteristics were similar in the three groups. No significant difference was found in percentage of time spent with underinflation (mean +/- SD, 26 +/- 22, 28 +/- 12, 30 +/- 13% in PVC, CPU, and TPU groups, respectively) and overinflation [median (IQR), 7 (2-14), 6 (3-14), 11% (5-20)] among the three groups. However, a significant difference was found in the coefficient of variation of P (cuff) (mean +/- SD, 82 +/- 48, 92 +/- 47, 135 +/- 67, p = 0.002). While the coefficient of P (cuff) variation was significantly (p < 0.017) higher in the TPU compared to CPU and PVC groups, no significant difference was found between the CPU and PVC groups. The pepsin level was significantly different among the three groups (408 +/- 282, 217 +/- 159, 178 +/- 126 ng/ml; p < 0.001). In fact, the pepsin level was significantly lower in the CPU and TPU groups compared with the PVC group. CONCLUSION PU does not impact variations in P (cuff) in critically ill patients.","Nseir, Saad; Zerimech, Farid; De Jonckheere, Julien; Alves, Isabelle; Balduyck, Malika; Durocher, Alain",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-010-1892-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20397001/,316

The factors that contribute to the increased propensity of RSV-induced distal airway disease compared with other commonly encountered respiratory viruses remain unclear. Here, we identified the RSV-encoded nonstructural 2 (NS2) protein as a viral genetic determinant for initiating RSV-induced distal airway obstruction. Infection of human cartilaginous airway epithelium (HAE) and a hamster model of disease with recombinant respiratory viruses revealed that NS2 promotes shedding of infected epithelial cells, resulting in two consequences of virus infection. First, epithelial cell shedding accelerated the reduction of virus titers, presumably by clearing virus-infected cells from airway mucosa. Second, epithelial cells shedding into the narrow-diameter bronchiolar airway lumens resulted in rapid accumulation of detached, pleomorphic epithelial cells, leading to acute distal airway obstruction. Together, these data indicate that RSV infection of the airway epithelium, via the action of NS2, promotes epithelial cell shedding, which not only accelerates viral clearance but also contributes to acute obstruction of the distal airways. Our results identify RSV NS2 as a contributing factor for the enhanced propensity of RSV to cause severe airway disease in young children and suggest NS2 as a potential therapeutic target for reducing the severity of distal airway disease.","Liesman, Rachael M; Buchholz, Ursula J; Luongo, Cindy L; Yang, Lijuan; Proia, Alan D; DeVincenzo, John P; Collins, Peter L; Pickles, Raymond J",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci72948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713657/,316

A novel product, Surgicel® Powder - Absorbable Hemostatic Powder (SP), made from oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) fabric, has been developed for adjunctive use in surgical procedures to assist in control of oozing bleeding over broad areas and where access could be difficult with a fabric ORC product. This study compares the new SP to other commercially available hemostatic powder products in two in vivo models. Methods Hemostatic efficacy of SP was compared to two polysaccharide-based hemostats in a porcine liver punch biopsy model and to three polysaccharide-based hemostats and one non-regenerated oxidized cellulose hemostat in a porcine liver abrasion model. Primary outcomes measured were hemostatic efficacy, defined as hemostasis within 10 minutes of application, and time-to-hemostasis (TTH). Results In the punch biopsy model, SP displayed significantly higher effective hemostasis rates than one of the polysaccharide hemostats (p=0.047) and faster TTH than both (p<0.001). In the liver abrasion model, SP had significantly higher effective hemostasis rates (p≤0.002) and faster TTH (p<0.001) than the other four hemostatic agents. The amount of powder applied within the ranges used did not appear to affect hemostatic efficacy. Conclusion In both the liver punch biopsy model of mild to moderate bleeding and the liver abrasion model of mild but diffuse oozing, SP provided more effective hemostasis and faster TTH than other marketed hemostatic powders. The results from this in vivo study suggest that Surgicel Powder may be useful in clinical applications where control of oozing capillary, mild venous, and small arterial hemorrhage is required including bleeding in difficult-to-access locations.","MacDonald, Melinda H; Wang, Allen Y; Clymer, Jeffrey W; Hutchinson, Richard W; Kocharian, Richard",Medical devices,https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s140663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238233/,316

Methods to sort individual cells of interest from custom microscale devices to standardized culture dishes in an efficient and automated manner without affecting the viability of the cells are critical. Combining a commercially available instrument for colony picking (CellCelector, AVISO GmbH) and a customized software module, we have established an optimized process for the automated retrieval of individual antibody-producing cells, secreting desirable antibodies, from dense arrays of subnanoliter containers. The selection of cells for retrieval is guided by data obtained from a high-throughput, single-cell screening method called microengraving. Using this system, 100 clones from a mixed population of two cell lines secreting different antibodies (12CA5 and HYB099-01) were sorted with 100% accuracy (50 clones of each) in approximately 2 h, and the cells retained viability.","Choi, Jae Hyeok; Ogunniyi, Adebola O; Du, Mindy; Du, Minna; Kretschmann, Marcel; Eberhardt, Jens; Love, J Christopher",Biotechnology progress,https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20063389/,316

We searched (5 July 2016) the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization trials portal. We selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias with two independent reviewers. We calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed the quality of evidence using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Ten trials (934 participants) were included. Hospital (outpatient) and home-based ETPs (seven trials) were equally effective at improving HRQoL on the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (dyspnoea: MD -0.09, 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.10; fatigue: MD -0.00, 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.17; emotional: MD 0.10, 95% CI: -0.24 to 0.45; and mastery: MD -0.02, 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.25; moderate quality) and on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (MD -0.82, 95% CI: -7.47 to 5.83, low quality).

The aim of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of barbed sutures to close the gastric pouch-jejunal anastomosis (GPJA) in laparoscopic gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-RYGB, and One-Anastomosis gastric bypass-OAGB) using propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic gastric bypasses between January 2012 and December 2017 was performed. Patients were divided into two different groups (RYGB-G and OAGB-G). PSM analysis was performed to minimize patient selection bias between the two types of sutures (barbed-BS and conventional-CS) in each group. A total of 808 patients were reviewed. After PSM, 488 (244 BS vs 244 CS) patients in RYGB-G and 48 in OAGB-G (24 BS vs 24 CS) patients were compared. Median operative time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) for BS in RYGB-G. In OAGB-G, BS were associated with a shorter operative time, although no significant difference was observed (p = 0.183). Post-operative hospital stay was significantly shorter for BS in both the groups (p < 0.001). Post-operative 30th-day complications were comparable: no leakage or bleeding of GPJA was observed in BS groups. At median follow-up of 28.78 months, no late complications were observed. Barbed sutures appear to be effective to close GPJA during gastric bypass and as safe as conventional suture.

102231,Factors affecting health-related quality of life among prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.,2020-09-25,"Scaffold material is essential in providing mechanical support to tissue, allowing stem cells to improve their function in the healing and repair of trauma sites and tissue regeneration. The scaffold aids cell organization in the damaged tissue. It serves and allows bio mimicking the mechanical and biological properties of the target tissue and facilitates cell proliferation and differentiation at the regeneration site. In this study, the developed and assayed bio-composite made of unique collagen fibers and alginate hydrogel supports the function of cells around the implanted material. We used an in vivo rat model to study the scaffold effects when transplanted subcutaneously and as an augment for tendon repair. Animals' well-being was measured by their weight and daily activity post scaffold transplantation during their recovery. At the end of the experiment, the bio-composite was histologically examined, and the surrounding tissues around the implant were evaluated for inflammation reaction and scarring tissue. In the histology, the formation of granulation tissue and fibroblasts that were part of the inclusion process of the implanted material were noted. At the transplanted sites, inflammatory cells, such as plasma cells, macrophages, and giant cells, were also observed as expected at this time point post transplantation.

Overall, the results of the current study proved for the first time that the implantable scaffold for long-term confirms the well-being of these rats and is correspondence to biocompatibility ISO standards and can be further developed for medical devices application.","Benayahu, Dafna; Pomeraniec, Leslie; Shemesh, Shai; Heller, Snir; Rosenthal, Yoav; Rath-Wolfson, Lea; Benayahu, Yehuda",Marine drugs,https://doi.org/10.3390/md18080420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796603/,316
102361,Admission Blood Pressure in Relation to Clinical Outcomes and Successful Reperfusion After Endovascular Stroke Treatment.,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE There is very limited data concerning utilization of flow diverters in children. Our aim is to report results for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms and carotid cavernous fistulas by using flow diverters in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of children (17 years of age or younger) treated with flow diverters between May 2011 and July 2014 was performed. Clinical and laboratory data and angiographic findings were extracted. Seven patients (6 males, 1 female; mean age, 12.7 years; range, 3-16 years) were included. Two presented with posttraumatic fistulas. The remaining patients presented with traumatic aneurysms of the cavernous carotid artery or fusiform aneurysms of the distal vertebral artery, M1, or A2 segments. All patients were premedicated with clopidogrel (75 mg daily for patients with body weights of >45 kg, 37.5 mg daily for 1 small child with a body weight of <45 kg) and aspirin (300 mg daily for ≥45 kg, 100 mg daily for smaller children). RESULTS VerifyNow and Multiplate Analyzer values were higher than expected. No clinical complications were noted. Imaging performed at 7-52 months after the procedure (mean/median, 22.3/14 months) revealed occlusions of all aneurysms and fistulas. One patient had an asymptomatic occlusion of the parent artery; otherwise, no hemodynamically significant parent artery restenosis was observed. There were no clinically significant neurologic events during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Although flow-diverter placement appears to be safe and effective on midterm follow-up in children, longer follow-up is critical. The current sizes of flow diverter devices and delivery systems cover the pediatric size range, obviating developing flow diverters specific to children.","Barburoglu, M; Arat, A",AJNR.

102418,Comparative Effectiveness of Carotid Artery Stenting Versus Carotid Endarterectomy Among Medicare Beneficiaries.,2016,"Changing gloves more frequently is encouraged, more now than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic. When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process. It was found a stronger chlorination was detrimental when the hands were wet, but better when dry. Thicker gloves were also found to be detrimental.

Since then, scientists started to uncover the mechanism as well as pathophysiological impacts it has on the current understanding of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor which is present in certain parts of the body which are responsible for regulating blood pressure and inflammation in a healthy system. Presence of the receptor in the nasal and oral cavity, brain, and blood allows entry of the virus into the body and cause neurological complications. The peripheral and central nervous system could also be invaded directly in the neurogenic or hematogenous pathways, or indirectly through overstimulation of the immune system by cytokines which may lead to autoimmune diseases. Other neurological implications such as hypoxia, anosmia, dysgeusia, meningitis, encephalitis, and seizures are important symptoms presented clinically in COVID-19 patients with or without the common symptoms of the disease. Further, patients with higher severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are also at risk of retaining some neurological complications in the long-run. Treatment of such severe hyperinflammatory conditions will also be discussed, as well as the risks they may pose to the progression of the disease. For this review, articles pertaining information on the neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were gathered from PubMed and Google Scholar using the search keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", and ""neurological dysfunction"".

102982,Autoimmune Aspects of Kawasaki Disease.,2018,"The mechanism of action of pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has not been fully elucidated. To offer additional insight, we evaluated the change in the cytokine profile in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) following a six-month treatment with pirfenidone in patients with IPF. EBC concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-α and VEGF-A were assessed with ELISA and compared at baseline and after six months of pirfenidone treatment. Twenty-nine patients with IPF and 13 controls were evaluated at baseline. With the exception of IL-8 concentration, which was lower in patients with IPF when compared to controls (p = 0.005), the cytokine levels did not differ between the groups. Despite the use of a high sensitivity assay, IL-8 reached detectable values only in 24% of IPF patients. EBC analysis after six months of treatment with pirfenidone did not reveal any differences in the cytokine levels. The change in EBC vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) correlated with the change in the 6 min walk distance (r = 0.54, p = 0.045). We conclude that a six-month treatment with pirfenidone did not significantly change the EBC cytokine profile. Our findings support the potential usefulness of VEGF-A as a marker in IPF. The low EBC IL-8 level in patients with IPF is a novel finding which needs confirmation in larger studies.","Jaskiewicz, Kaja; Mycroft, Katarzyna; Maskey-Warzechowska, Marta; Paralusz, Karolina; Siemiez, Natalia; Nejman-Gryz, Patrycja; Barnas, Malgorzata; Krenke, Rafal; Gorska, Katarzyna",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9082523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764328/,316
103340,Knowledge of stroke symptoms and treatment among community residents in Western Urban China.,2014,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to a porcine entero-pathogenic alphacoronavirus, causing lethal watery diarrhea in piglets. Despite existing study reports the sole accessory protein ORF3 identified as NF-κB antagonist, the contribution of PEDV ORF3 to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by NF-κB signaling remains largely unknown. Thus in this present study, we showed that PEDV ORF3 protein significantly inhibited the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. The phosphorylation of IκBα was inhibited by ORF3 protein, but no degradation of IκBα was induced in ORF3-expressing cells. Furthermore, PEDV ORF3 inhibited NF-κB activation through preventing nuclear factor p65 phosphorylation and down-regulating p65 expression level, as well as interfering nuclear translocation of p65, eventually resulting into the inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 production. Our study definitely links PEDV ORF3 to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production, which will provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activity inhibited by PEDV proteins to facilitate virus evasion of host innate immune.","Wu, Zhijun; Cheng, Lixin; Xu, Jiaxin; Li, Pengfei; Li, Xingzhi; Zou, Dehua; Zhang, Yating; Wang, Xianhe; Wu, Xuening; Shen, Yujiang; Li, Yuchang; Yao, Lili; Guo, Dexuan; Li, Liyang; Xiao, Lijie; Song, Baifen; Ma, Jinzhu; Liu, Xinyang; Xu, Shuyan; Xu, Xin; Zhang, Hua; Zheng, Liang; Cao, Hongwei",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126183/,316
103594,The end of an extraordinary year.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In the CLARITY study, the safety and efficacy of adjunctive pimavanserin, an inverse agonist at 5-HT2A receptors, were demonstrated when added to existing treatment for MDD. This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the effects of pimavanserin on sexual function from the CLARITY study. METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of MDD in a depressive episode, inadequate response to ongoing antidepressant therapy, and a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score >20 were randomized to pimavanserin 34 mg/day or placebo added to ongoing treatment with an immediate revision of all selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine for 5 weeks (Stage 1), and nonresponders (<50% improvement from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-17]) were re-randomized for an additional 5 week (Stage 2). Effects of pimavanserin on the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Index (MGH-SFI) and HAMD-17 Item 14 (sexual interest) were examined. RESULTS Among 203 patients (51 on pimavanserin; 152 on placebo), pimavanserin demonstrated significant improvement from baseline to Week 5 on the MGH-SFI (least square [LS]mean difference -0.634, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.964, -0.304]; p = .0002; effect size [ES], Cohen's d: .614). Across Stages 1 and 2, the weighted LSmean difference was -0.468 (95% CI [-0.720, -0.216]; p = .0003) for pimavanserin versus placebo. Mean changes from baseline to Week 5 for MGH-SFI Items 1, 2, 3, and 5 and HAMD Item 14 were significantly (p < .05) greater with pimavanserin versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive pimavanserin improved sexual function in patients with MDD. Adding pimavanserin to ongoing treatment for MDD may be especially useful for patients experiencing sexual dysfunction.","Freeman, Marlene P; Fava, Maurizio; Dirks, Bryan; Jha, Manish K; Papakostas, George I; Shelton, Richard C; Thase, Michael E; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Liu, Keith; Stankovic, Srdjan",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301591/,316

METHODS The intervention was a transvaginal MA-NOS sigmoidectomy in a 78-year-old woman with a sigmoid adenocarcinoma. Maintaining triangulation the surgeon positioned himself at the right side of the patient and used the transvaginal trocar for dissection and stapling of both the inferior mesenteric vessels and the upper rectum. The colonic resection was performed extracorporeally in the conventional fashion and was followed by an intra-abdominal endoscopically assisted stapled anastomosis. RESULTS Advantages of minimally invasive surgery seemed to be enhanced with this hybrid laparoscopic approach. Postoperative course was uneventful. All oncological principles governing resection and management were accomplished and the pathology examination confirmed a T3N1 lesion. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. CONCLUSION Transvaginal MA-NOS radical sigmoidectomy is a feasible and oncologically safe procedure. MA-NOS is a realistic option for avoiding the need of assisting incisions and related morbidity in the laparoscopic resection of large intra-abdominal lesions. Combined hybrid laparoscopic NOS in humans (MA-NOS) currently provides a safe and reliable way of defining future clinical applications and advantages of NOS and NOTES. Additionally, it stimulates the active development and evaluation of the underpinning technologies and instrumentation.","Lacy, Antonio M; Delgado, Salvadora; Rojas, Oscar A; Almenara, Raúl; Blasi, Anabel; Llach, Josep",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-9956-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18461385/,316

Herein, we developed a novel kind of electrochemical microRNA biosensor based on two-dimensional nanomaterial of antimonene nano-flakes (AMNFs) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) which were used as substrating to cadmium ion (Cd2+) for specific detection of breast cancer-relevant biomarker-microRNA-21. Compared to graphene, the first principle energetic calculation shows that the AMNFs have completely a stronger force interaction with single strand (ssRNA), due to the antimonene has a more delocalized 5 s/5p orbital. After the addition of complementary microRNA, due to the low adsorption affinity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to antimonene, the hybridized target is easy to desorb from the antimonene interface, and the oxidation peak of metal ions is significantly reduced. Results showed the microRNA-21 concentration can be detected from 100 aM to 1 nM, the limit of detection as low as 21 aM toward microRNA-21, which is 3 times lower than those of the established microRNA biosensors.

The adoption of the most prudent, multifaceted approaches is recommended until there is significant evidence to reduce protective measures. The greatest threat to healthcare personnel and patients appears to be exposure to patients, healthcare personnel, or visitors who have not been recognized as contagious. The processes used within healthcare facilities must hold this concept central to any infection control plan and act in a preventive manner. This article focuses on the development of an algorithm for intensive care unit intake precautions, based on the early identification of potential source patients, as well as appropriate selection and adequate use of personal protective equipment. Visitor management, hand and respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette have been used as measures to decrease the spread of infection.

The BBB selectively regulates the transport of large molecules into the brain and thereby maintains brain homeostasis. Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) is one mechanism to deliver essential proteins into the brain parenchyma. Receptors expressed in the brain endothelial cells have been explored to ferry therapeutic antibodies across the BBB in bifunctional antibody formats. In this study, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the basigin receptor, which recently has been proposed as a target for RMT across the BBB. Antibody binding properties such as affinity have been demonstrated to be important factors for transcytosis capability and efficiency. Nevertheless, studies of basigin mAb properties' effect on RMT are limited. Here we characterize different basigin mAbs for their ability to associate with and subsequently internalize human brain endothelial cells. The mAbs were profiled to determine whether receptor binding epitope and affinity affected receptor-mediated uptake efficiency. By competitive epitope binning studies, basigin mAbs were categorized into five epitope bins. mAbs from three of the epitope bins demonstrated properties required for RMT candidates judged by binding characteristics and their superior level of internalization in human brain endothelial cells.","Christensen, Sarah Christine; Krogh, Berit Olsen; Jensen, Allan; Andersen, Christian Brix Folsted; Christensen, Søren; Nielsen, Morten Schallburg",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71286-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884039/,316

For natural scenes α takes on intermediate values ~1.25, reflecting their scale invariance. It is also well-established that, on average, images with natural scene statistics are preferred to those that deviate from these properties. Although this average pattern of preference for images with the intermediate values of α is robust, there are also marked individual differences in preference for different levels of α. This study investigated the effects of adaptation on average and individual visual preferences for synthetic filtered noise images varying in α. Participant preferences (N = 58) were measured via a 2AFC task prior to adaptation (baseline) and post-adaptation There were 3 adaptation conditions (α = 0.25, 1.25, 2.25) and 5 test levels of α (0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75, 2.25). On average, the adaptation elevated preferences for test images with α matching the adaptor conditions, especially in adaptor conditions, α = 0.25 and 2.25. We also observed marked individual differences in preference for different levels of α. These different preference profiles remained stable throughout the experiment and affected the levels of adaptation observed in different adaptation conditions.","Nguyen, Leena Yduyen; Spehar, Branka",Vision research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2020.11.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401176/,316

Current guidelines recommend surgical removal. This surgery should be carefully planned in an interdisciplinary team and involves special risks for mother and fetus. This report describes a case of a 27-year-old primigravida woman with a right renal cell carcinoma involving the lower pole of the kidney, which was removed at 30 weeks of gestation by robot-assisted retroperitoneoscopic partial nephrectomy (RARPN). CASE REPORT The patient was referred by the treating obstetrician with a newly diagnosed right lower pole renal mass of 6×4 cm in greatest diameter extending deeply into the parenchyma. No metastasis or enlarged lymph nodes were described in subsequent magnetic resonance tomography. Clinical and laboratory examinations documented a healthy mother and fetus. A right-sided RARPN was advised and planned by an interdisciplinary team of treating physicians (gynecologists, oncologists, and urologists). The surgery was conducted under general anesthesia with an obstetrician on stand-by. Surgery was performed without any complications (operation time 95 min, renal-ischemia time 15 min, and negligible blood loss) and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Further follow-up consultations showed regular wound healing and normal progression of pregnancy, and the patient gave birth to a healthy child at term. Follow-up examinations of the patient were uneventful. CONCLUSIONS This case shows that RARPN can be a safe and effective surgical procedure for partial nephrectomy during pregnancy, where surgery is performed in a specialist center and by an interdisciplinary experienced surgical team. It seems to offer advantages and better risk profile over the laparoscopic approach.","Völler, Moritz; Mahmud, Walid; Vallo, Stefan; Grabbert, Markus; John, Patricia; Khoder, Wael Y",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866322/,316

METHODS This was a post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data on recurrent stroke risk and headache as an adverse event or reason for treatment discontinuation from the PRoFESS (N = 20,332) and ESPS2 (N = 6602) trials. Hazard ratios (HRs) for recurrent stroke were calculated using the Cox model. RESULTS In PRoFESS, the 2.5-year recurrent stroke risk in patients receiving ASA+ER-DP was 8.2% in those with headache within 7 days of starting treatment and 9.4% in those without [HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.98; P = 0.03]. Recurrent stroke risk was 5.0% in patients who discontinued ASA+ER-DP due to headache by day 90 versus 9.2% in those who did not (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.77; P = 0.001). No such difference was observed in clopidogrel-treated patients. In ESPS2, risk of recurrent stroke was 6.2% in patients who discontinued ASA+ER-DP due to headache by day 90 versus 9.8% in patients who did not (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.31-1.27; P = 0.19) and 7.3% in patients who discontinued ER-DP due to headache by day 90 versus 13.2% in those who did not (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS Patients taking ASA+ER-DP in PRoFESS who developed headache had significantly reduced stroke recurrence risk versus those without headache. Similar (non-significant) findings for ASA+ER-DP and ER-DP in ESPS2 suggest that dipyridamole-induced headache may reflect better cerebrovascular function.","Davidai, G; Cotton, D; Gorelick, P; Bath, P M W; Lipton, R B; Sacco, R; Diener, H-C",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040015/,316
106213,"Epithelial dysfunction, respiratory infections and asthma: the importance of immunomodulation. A focus on OM-85.",2020-07-07,"Epidemiological models usually contain a set of parameters that must be adjusted based on available observations. Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators of model parameters for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from them will vary widely, depending on the particular values employed within the range that gives a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given an epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemic curves, whose information is encapsulated in posterior predictive distributions. From these, one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.","Mena, Ramsés H; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X; Mantilla-Beniers, Natalia B; Carranco-Sapiéns, Gabriel A; Benet, Luis; Boyer, Denis; Castillo, Isaac Pérez",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/abb115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959788/,316

METHOD A critical review of recently published empirical research, case studies, and reviews pertaining to central nervous system (CNS) complications of COVID-19 was conducted by searching PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, and bioRxiv. RESULTS After considering the available literature, areas thought to be most pertinent to clinical and research neuropsychologists, including CNS manifestations, neurologic symptoms/syndromes, neuroimaging, and potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection, were reviewed. CONCLUSION Once thought to be merely a respiratory virus, the scientific and medical communities have realized COVID-19 to have broader effects on renal, vascular, and neurological body systems. The question of cognitive deficits is not yet well studied, but neuropsychologists will undoubtedly play an important role in the years to come.","Hewitt, Kelsey C; Marra, David E; Block, Cady; Cysique, Lucette A; Drane, Daniel L; Haddad, Michelle M; Łojek, Emilia; McDonald, Carrie R; Reyes, Anny; Eversole, Kara; Bowers, Dawn",Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355617721000345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858556/,316

106460,Switch in use of midazolam for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND High incidences of silent cerebral ischemia (SCI) have been revealed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation. A high number of mostly gaseous micro-embolic signals (MESs) was detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) during PVI. In this investigation the possible relationship between MESs detected intraoperatively by TCD and new SCI on DW MRI post-ablation is reported. METHODS 27 consecutive atrial fibrillation patients (6 female, age median: 64 interquartile range: 13.23) undergoing PVI with the pulmonary vein ablation catheter, pre- and post-ablation DW MRI and intra-operative MES detection by TCD were included in the study. Procedures were performed on a therapeutic international normalized ratio (2-3) and with a target activated clotting time ≥ 350 s in all patients. DW MRI scans performed pre- and post-ablation revealed new SCI in 6 out of 27 (22%) patients. RESULTS The median (interquartile range) MES count recorded during the whole procedure was 1642 (912) in patients with and 1019 (529) in those without SCI (p = 0.129). The number of MESs recorded during pulmonary vein angiography was significantly higher in patients as compared to those without a new lesion on the post-ablation DW MRI: 257 (249) vs. 110 (71), respectively (p = 0.0009). On mul-tivariate logistic regression, the total MES count was predictive of SCI in patients older than 68 years. CONCLUSIONS Micro-embolus generation detected by TCD during pulmonary vein angiography significantly correlates with new SCI on DW MRI post-ablation.","Nagy-Baló, Edina; Martirosyan, Mihran; Sándorfi, Gábor; Hajas, Orsolya; Lánczi, Levente; Berényi, Ervin; Ladányi, Lilla; Kiss, Alexandra; Édes, István; Csanádi, Zoltán",Cardiology journal,https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.a2017.0030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281739/,316

In addition, the ability of fasted- and fed-state simulated intestinal fluids (FaSSIF, FeSSIF) to predict the intestinal solubility was evaluated. All PIs were poorly soluble in FaHIF (from 7 μM for ritonavir to 327 μM for darunavir) and FeHIF (from 15 μM for atazanavir to 409μM for darunavir). For four of nine PIs, food intake significantly enhanced the solubilizing capacity of intestinal fluids (up to 18.4-fold increase for ritonavir). The intersubject variability (average coefficient of variance CVfed = 60.6%, CVfasted = 40.4%) was higher as compared with the intrasubject variability (CVfed = 41.3%, CVfasted = 20.5%). PI solubilities correlated reasonably well between FaSSIF and FaHIF (R = 0.817), but not between FeSSIF and FeHIF (R = 0.617). To conclude, postprandial conditions increased the inter- and intrasubject variability of the PIs. The inability of FeSSIF to accurately predict the FeHIF solubility emphasizes the need for a multivariate approach to determine solubility profiles, taking into account solid-state characteristics, pH, mixed bile acid/phospholipid micelles, and digestive products.","Wuyts, Benjamin; Brouwers, Joachim; Mols, Raf; Tack, Jan; Annaert, Pieter; Augustijns, Patrick",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.23698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23939880/,316

Results supported the hypothesis that message effectiveness was moderated by mood in the direction of congruency. That is, participants in a positive mood recalled more information, were more persuaded, and were more likely to adopt the recommended behavior after exposure to advertisements with a grouped list format.

However, in borehole, objects towards azimuthal orientations pose different properties, referred to as azimuthal spatial heterogeneity. This may lead to ambiguous evaluations by utilizing present inside-out NMR measurement, which hardly resolves azimuthal information and loses the location information of oil/gas. In this paper, we for the first time design and construct an innovative tool to investigate the heterogeneity of large in-situ samples. The most key component, array coil, which performs with azimuthal selection, measurement consistency and interactive isolation, configured in this novel tool to capture heterogeneity information. Whereas, strong coupling between neighboring coil elements largely decrease the coil sensitivity. Capacitive decoupling network is bridged into adjacent ports without segmenting coils to be decoupled and could be easily adjusted by electrical relays. The coil model and numerical simulation are firstly given to demonstrate the array coil configuration, B1 field map and mutual coupling effects on coil sensitivity. Capacitive network is then introduced to be theoretically and practically analyzed to minimize coupling effects. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that these coil elements have excellent consistency and independence to feasibly acquire the azimuthal NMR data.","Luo, Sihui; Xiao, Lizhi; Zong, Fangrong; Li, Xin; Liao, Guangzhi; Shi, Guuanghui; Men, Baiyong; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Zhengduo; Sun, Zhe; Deng, Feng",Journal of magnetic resonance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2020.106735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408240/,316

Recently, several series assessing coil embolization of tiny aneurysms have presented new promising results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating endovascular treatment of very small intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a computerized search of Scopus, Medline, and the Web of Science for studies on endovascular treatment of very small (≤3 mm in diameter) intracranial aneurysms published between January 1996 and May 2015. Using a random-effects model, we evaluated clinical and angiographic outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with 1105 tiny aneurysms (844 ruptured and 261 unruptured) endovascularly treated were included. Postoperative and long-term complete occlusion was achieved in 85% (95% CI, 78%-90%) and 91% (95% CI, 87%-94%) of aneurysms, respectively. The recanalization rate was 6% (95% CI, 4%-11%) and retreatment occurred in 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) of cases. Seventy-nine percent (95% CI, 64%-89%) of patients had good neurologic outcome at long-term follow-up. Intraprocedural rupture occurred in 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) of the coiling procedures, while thromboembolic complications occurred in 4% (95% CI, 3%-6%). CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization of very small intracranial aneurysms can be performed safely and effectively. In the case of unruptured aneurysms, procedure-related complications are not negligible. Patients and providers should consider such risks when engaged in a shared decision-making process.","Yamaki, V N; Brinjikji, W; Murad, M H; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

108490,Cost-effectiveness of an insertable cardiac monitor to detect atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke.,2016,"Minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has proved to be equal and in some aspects superior to open lobectomy in T1 and T2 lung cancers. Indications for VATS pneumonectomy however are still not clearly defined and strictly limited. The minimally invasive VATS pneumonectomy can be undertaken in patients with centrally located tumors without extended invasion of the large pulmonary vessels, chest wall, pericardium, mediastinal structures or proximal part of the main bronchus and when sleeve resection is not feasible (T2). We present a case of a patient who underwent left VATS pneumonectomy due to left lung cancer. Based on the preoperative examinations any kind of less extensive resection than pneumonectomy was excluded. Our VATS technique consisted of three incisions: two ports and a 5-6 cm long utility incision without any kind of rib spreading. The whole of the procedure was controlled on the monitor via a thoracoscope and the technique of resection was described in detail. Total surgery time was 130 min and blood loss was 150 ml. The chest tube was removed on the 2(nd) post-operative day and the patient was discharged home on the 8(th) postoperative day. The final histopathological examination confirmed squamous cell lung cancer (T2aN0M0 stage IB). In the authors' opinion VATS pneumonectomy should be performed only in centers with extensive experience in minimally invasive VATS lobectomy. Despite limited indications for VATS pneumonectomy, if the patients fulfill the VATS pneumonectomy inclusion criteria they may gain from all the advantages of minimally invasive techniques.","Piwkowski, Cezary; Gabryel, Piotr; Kasprzyk, Mariusz; Dyszkiewicz, Wojciech",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.28869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256026/,316

Here, we identify that infection of host cells with reovirus can result in necroptosis. We find that necroptosis requires sensing of the genomic RNA within incoming virus particles via cytoplasmic RNA sensors to produce type I interferon (IFN). While these events that occur prior to the de novo synthesis of viral RNA are required for the induction of necroptosis, they are not sufficient. The induction of necroptosis also requires late stages of reovirus infection. Specifically, efficient synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within infected cells is required for necroptosis. These data indicate that viral RNA interfaces with host components at two different stages of infection to induce necroptosis. This work provides new molecular details about events in the viral replication cycle that contribute to the induction of necroptosis following infection with an RNA virus.IMPORTANCE An appreciation of how cell death pathways are regulated following viral infection may reveal strategies to limit tissue destruction and prevent the onset of disease. Cell death following virus infection can occur by apoptosis or a regulated form of necrosis known as necroptosis. Apoptotic cells are typically disposed of without activating the immune system. In contrast, necroptotic cells alert the immune system, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. While apoptosis following virus infection has been extensively investigated, how necroptosis is unleashed following virus infection is understood for only a small group of viruses. Here, using mammalian reovirus, we highlight the molecular mechanism by which infection with a dsRNA virus results in necroptosis.","Berger, Angela K; Hiller, Bradley E; Thete, Deepti; Snyder, Anthony J; Perez, Encarnacion; Upton, Jason W; Danthi, Pranav",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02404-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077640/,316
109042,Contraceptive Technologies: Looking Ahead to New Approaches to Increase Options for Family Planning.,2021-09-01,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Hearing rehabilitation after translabyrinthine resection of a vestibular schwannoma (VS) has largely been based on the transfer of acoustic stimulus to the contralateral ear, typically through a contralateral routing of signal hearing aid or bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA). Cochlear implant, either as a subsequent surgery or simultaneously, has become a more common treatment option; however, there is still relatively limited data available on its success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early outcomes of simultaneous cochlear implantation in patients with sporadic VS undergoing translabyrinthine resection. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, nonrandomized study. METHODS A prospective study of nonrandomized patients was completed at a tertiary care neurotology center. Audiologic outcomes, primarily based on AzBIO in quiet and background noise, as well as consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) testing of the affected ears were utilized. Tinnitus, dizziness, and spatial hearing questionnaries were also completed. Audiologic outcomes and questionnaires were compared between the pre- and postoperative groups. RESULTS Ten patients were included in the study with 3 month follow-up data. There was statistically significant improvement in AzBO with +10 and +5 signal to noise ratio and in quiet, as well as in CNC testing (P < .05). There was a significant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous cochlear implantation is a viable treatment for hearing loss after translabyrinthine approach to VS. These patients have improved hearing in background noise and tinnitus compared to their preoperative state. Further prognostic data are required to determine which patients are the best candidates.

Reported non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) allergies may predispose to use of stronger pain medications and potentially to OUD. OBJECTIVE Investigate the clinical impact of reported NSAID allergy on OUD in patients with chronic back pain. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of adults receiving care at a tertiary healthcare system from 1/1/2013-12/31/2018. Back pain and OUD were identified using administrative data algorithms. We used propensity score matching and logistic regression to estimate the impact of self-reported NSAID adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on risk of OUD, adjusting for other relevant clinical information. RESULTS Of 47,114 patients with chronic back pain, 3,620 (7.7%) had a reported NSAID ADR. In an adjusted propensity score matched analysis, patients with NSAID ADRs had higher odds (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.07-1.67]) of developing OUD as compared to those without NSAID ADRs. Additional risk factors for OUD included younger age, male sex, Medicaid insurance, Medicare insurance, higher number of inpatient and outpatient visits in the prior year, and co-morbid anxiety and depression. Patients with listed NSAID ADRs also had higher odds of a documented opioid prescription during the study period (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.11-1.34]). CONCLUSION Adults with chronic back pain and reported NSAID ADRs are at higher risk of developing OUD and receiving opioid analgesics, even after accounting for co-morbidities and health care utilization.

Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

We aim to develop an early warning model of frailty based on nutritional risk screening and apply the frailty early warning model in the clinic to screen high-risk patients and provide corresponding intervention target information. METHODS The proposed study includes two stages. In the first stage, we aim to develop a prediction model of frailty among older inpatients with nutritional risk. Study data were collected from a population-based aging cohort study in China. A prospective cohort study design will be used in the second stage of the study. We will recruit 266 older inpatients (age 65 years or older) with nutritional risk, and we will apply the frailty model in the clinic to explore the predictive ability of the model in participants, assess patients' health outcomes with implementation of the frailty model, and compare the model with existing frailty assessment tools. Patients' health outcomes will be measured at admission and at 30-day follow-up. DISCUSSION This project is the first to develop an early prediction model of frailty for older inpatients according to nutritional risk in a nationally representative sample of Chinese older inpatients of tertiary hospitals. The results will hopefully help to promote the development of more detailed frailty assessment tools according to nutritional risk, which may ultimately lead to reduced health care costs and improvement in independence and quality of life among geriatric patients.

111001,Infection Prevention and Control in Pediatric Ambulatory Settings.,2017,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the attitudes of physicians and patients toward physical examination in physically separated environments using a laryngoscopic examination model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six experienced laryngologists performed laryngoscopic examinations in 30 patients in a closed-chamber examination unit. The physicians and patients were asked to compare all domains with their previous standard laryngoscopic examination experience using a 10-point visual analog scale (0, poor performance; 10, good performance), including effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of safety against airborne transmission of COVID-19, applicability of the unit for future examinations, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort. RESULTS All laryngoscopic examinations were performed successfully. Effectiveness of communication, difficulty of examination, perception of protective environment, and overall comfort did not differ between physicians and patients (P > .05 for all comparisons). However, both physicians and patients found the examination to be difficult. While physicians evaluated the system as safe against airborne transmission of COVID-19, patients were not confident that the system was safe (8.70 ± 1.93 vs 2.87 ± 2.37, respectively, P = .001). Physicians also gave a higher score to future applicability of the unit for examinations than patients (8.90 ± 1.42 vs 7.10 ± 2.62, respectively, P = .001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical data of first and multiple CT imaging re-examination and blood glucose levels from 62 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were collected for a retrospective analysis to determine the correlation between glucose level and CT-based staging. RESULTS Of the 62 COVID-19 patients, 48 cases of early stage and 14 cases of advanced stage were found in the CT data of the first diagnosis. These 62 cases were currently under follow-up (17-32 days): 18 cases in early stage-resorption stage, 25 cases in early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, 12 cases in advanced stage-resorption stage, 5 cases in early stage -advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage, and 2 cases in advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage. Among them, the CT of 14 patients with advanced stage at the first diagnosis showed multiple stage lesions (advanced stage + early stage) at the same time. Patients presented with statistically significant changes in blood glucose at early stage-resorption stage, early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, advanced stage-resorption stage, and early stage-advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p<0.05). However, no statistically significant alterations were observed in the glucose level of patients with advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Alteration of blood glucose is positively correlated with CT-based staging of COVID-19. Blood glucose is of great value in clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and in determining the stage and prognosis of this disease.","Xu, C-C; Ruan, X-Z; Chen, X-Q; Huang, Q-L; Zhao, Z-Y; Ru, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378058/,316

Reports of severe poisonings from consumption of foraged mushrooms for food or hallucinogenic purposes increased during 1999-2016 (2), and approximately 7,500 poisonous mushroom ingestions were reported annually to poison control centers across the United States (1). To estimate the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and severe adverse outcomes associated with accidental poisonous mushroom ingestion in the United States, CDC analyzed 2016 data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's* Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (HCUP-NEDS) and National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) databases as well as 2016-2018 data from three IBM MarketScan sources: Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits (Medicare), and Multi-State Medicaid databases. During 2016, 1,328 (standard error [SE] = 100) ED visits and 100 (SE = 22) hospitalizations (HCUP data) were associated with accidental poisonous mushroom ingestion. Among 556 patients with a diagnosis of accidental poisonous mushroom ingestion, 48 (8.6%) patients experienced a serious adverse outcome during 2016-2018 (MarketScan data). Serious adverse outcomes were more common among Medicaid-insured patients than among patients with commercial insurance or Medicare (11.5% versus 6.7%, p = 0.049). Because most mushroom poisonings are preventable, wild mushrooms should not be consumed unless they are identified by an expert; increased public health messaging about the potential dangers of mushroom poisoning is needed.","Gold, Jeremy A W; Kiernan, Emily; Yeh, Michael; Jackson, Brendan R; Benedict, Kaitlin",MMWR.

Nonsense mutations are responsible for the presence of a premature termination codon (PTC) in the mRNA, creating a lack of functional protein. In this context, translational readthrough-inducing drugs (TRIDs) represent a promising approach to correct the basic defect caused by PTCs. By using computational optimization and biological screening, we identified three new small molecules showing high readthrough activity. The activity of these compounds has been verified by evaluating CFTR expression and functionality after treatment with the selected molecules in cells expressing nonsense-CFTR-mRNA. Additionally, the channel functionality was measured by the halide sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) quenching assay. All three of the new TRIDs displayed high readthrough activity and low toxicity and can be considered for further evaluation as a therapeutic approach toward the second major cause of CF.","Pibiri, Ivana; Melfi, Raffaella; Tutone, Marco; Di Leonardo, Aldo; Pace, Andrea; Lentini, Laura",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899265/,316

Thromboembolic events are recognised complications of viral infection, but the diagnosis of an acute pulmonary thrombotic complication in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be challenging because of the similarities of presentation, logistical considerations of diagnosis in a patient isolated for infection control reasons and the effects of cognitive errors in diagnostic reasoning. We present the case of a patient who was diagnosed with a pulmonary thrombotic complication during inpatient care for COVID-19. The haemostasis parameters we observed, including increased levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII, point towards a relevant involvement of endothelial cells in patients with severe COVID-19. We suggest that it is possible to hypothesise a spectrum of secondarily acquired, prothrombotic coagulopathy mediated by the endothelial interaction with SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of mortality in a subset of patients with a complicated clinical course of COVID-19. We support the recommendation of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis for inpatients with COVID-19 as a very minimum in the absence of strict contraindications, while recognising that pulmonary thrombotic complications can occur under standard thromboprophylaxis. We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed. Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation are obligatory where new evidence of a macrovascular thrombotic complication has been documented.

Some people have greater susceptibility which influences both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. Smoking is associated with increased ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates its entry through the lung. However, despite the widespread use of e-cigarettes, also known as 'vaping', little is known regarding the effects of vaping on ACE-2 expression and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the added effect of nicotine in the vapor is also unknown. Thus, we tested whether vaping induces ACE-2 expression in the mouse lung. BALB/c mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor (±nicotine) resulted in a significant increase in peribronchiolar inflammation and influx of immune cells into the airways. Vapor increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 1β, and KC levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both sexes, which were further enhanced by nicotine (whereas increase in interleukin 6 was sex and nicotine independent). The reduction in basal inspiratory capacity with vapor exposure occurred independent of sex or nicotine. The increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was independent of sex; however, in female mice it was only significant in the nicotine-exposed group. Lung ACE-2 expression was increased in male mice in a nicotine-dependent manner as compared with female mice. Collectively, while vaping (±nicotine) induced airway inflammation and impaired lung function, the induction of lung ACE-2 occurred to a significantly greater degree in males exposed to vapor containing nicotine as compared with females. Thus, via these effects on ACE-2 expression in the lungs and airways, vaping itself may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into the airways.","Naidu, Vegi; Zeki, Amir A; Sharma, Pawan",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926967/,316
112291,Corrigendum to Effects of alteplase for acute stroke according to criteria defining the European Union and United States marketing authorizations: Individual-patient- data meta-analysis of randomized trials.,2018,"BACKGROUND Acute brain injury (ABI) is a frequent complication of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) that could be detected by continuous neuromonitoring. Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows monitoring of cerebral oxygenation. OBJECTIVE To assess whether an impaired cerebral oxygenation was associated with short-term outcome during pediatric ECMO. METHODS We conducted a single-center retrospective study in a pediatric intensive care unit. Children under 18 years old were included if receiving veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO with concurrent NIRS monitoring. Cerebral saturation impairment was defined as rScO2 under 50% or 20% from the baseline for desaturation, and above 80%. Cerebral imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) was performed in case of neurological concern. A radiologist blinded for patient history identified ABI as any hemorragic or ischemic lesion, then classified as major or minor. Primary endpoint was the outcome at hospital discharge. Poor outcome was defined as death or survival with a pediatric cerebral performance category scale (PCPC) score ≥ 3 and/or a major ABI. Good outcome was defined as survival with a PCPC score ≤ 2 and/or a minor or no ABI. Secondary endpoint was mortality before PICU discharge. RESULTS Sixty-three patients met inclusion criteria; 48 (76%) had veno-arterial ECMO. Mortality rate was 51%. Forty-eight of sixty-three patients (76%) evolved with a poor outcome, including 20 major ABI. Mean rScO2 in the right/left hemisphere was 73 ± 9%/75 ± 9%. Cerebral desaturation and decline of rScO2 below 20% from the baseline, regardless of side, were each associated with poor outcome (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 4 [95%CI 1.2; 15.1], p = 0.03, and 3.9 [95%CI 1.1; 14.9], p = 0.04, respectively), as well as a mean right rScO2 < 70% during the ECMO course (adjusted OR, 5.6 [95%CI 1.3; 34], p = 0.04). Left rSCO2 ≥ 80% was inversely correlated with hospital mortality (adjusted OR of 0.14 [95%CI 0.02; 0.8], p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Cerebral desaturation attested by NIRS was associated with a poor short-term outcome in children of all ages undergoing ECMO, and rScO2 > 80% seemed to be protective. NIRS monitoring might be included within multimodal neuromonitoring to assess the risk of the brain injury related to pediatric ECMO.","Vedrenne-Cloquet, Meryl; Lévy, Raphaël; Chareyre, Judith; Kossorotoff, Manoëlle; Oualha, Mehdi; Renolleau, Sylvain; Grimaud, Marion",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-01179-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432528/,316

BACKGROUND The mortality rate for medical personnel during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which began in April 2003, was the highest among Asian countries. The SARS crisis severely challenged not only the medical skills of nurses, but also their professional commitment. DESIGN Survey. METHODS This study was conducted between August-December 2005, in Taiwan. Data were collected by structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by post to 8056 nurses nationwide; 2833 nurses completed and returned the questionnaire for a valid response rate of 39%. RESULTS The results showed that knowledge sharing correlated positively with professional commitment but negatively with the impact of SARS. Professional commitment negatively correlated with SARS impact (r = -0.074, p < 0.001); however, as knowledge sharing was a controlled variable, the partial correlation between SARS impact and professional commitment was -0.039 with a p-value of 0.045, indicating virtual insignificance. That is, knowledge sharing was an antecedent variable for both SARS impact and professional commitment. CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that knowledge sharing is significantly correlated with impact of SARS and professional commitment of nursing personnel. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Hospitals and healthcare services can enhance retention of medical personnel by encouraging knowledge sharing, which enhances professional commitment and alleviates the impact of newly introduced contagious diseases.","Chen, Shu-Lan; Chang, Shao-Min; Lin, Huey-Shyan; Chen, Chung-Hey",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02488.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19077029/,316

This study retrieved 8,671,695 MERS-related online documents from May 20 to June 18, 2015, from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents by using multilevel models and data mining with Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Buzz with negative emotions (i.e., anxiety or fear) was more prevalent in online discussion boards, Twitter, and online cafes than news sites and blogs. News buzz (b = 0.21, p < 0.001), but not rumor buzz (b = 0.06, p = 0.308), was associated with positive MERS emotions (i.e., being calm or composed). The mention of eating immunity-boosting food in the news led to a 94 percent chance of a positive MERS emotion and that such a chance of showing a positive emotion was 4.75 times higher than that without such a mention (support of 0.001, confidence of 0.94, and lift of 4.75). Even with the same precautionary messages that were disseminated, they yielded the opposite emotional reactions to people depending on the channel through which the messages were communicated. In the face of a novel and highly contagious disease such as MERS, the government must deploy a response system that includes provision and dissemination of reliable information and inhibits online diffusion of false information.","Song, Juyoung; Song, Tae Min; Seo, Dong-Chul; Jin, Dal-Lae; Kim, Jung Sun","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2016.0126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28051336/,316

The question of whether reproductive coercion (RC) influences these outcomes has received increased attention. Little is known about whether RC is independently associated with contraceptive use and having a sexually transmitted disease (STD) among African American female adolescents. Materials and Methods: Survey data for self-identified African American young women 14-19 years of age (n = 735) who accessed services at a publicly funded clinic were used to assess the extent of RC, the association between RC and other forms of intimate partner violence (IPV), and whether RC was independently associated with contraceptive use and an STD diagnosis. Results: Approximately 20% of participants had experienced RC; there was a statistically significant bivariate association between RC and other forms of IPV. In multivariate analyses, experiencing two or more forms of RC (vs. not experiencing any RC) was associated with reduced odds of contraceptive use in the past 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.76) and with increased odds of having an STD (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 2.35-4.37). Experiencing only one type of RC and experiencing other forms of IPV were not associated with the outcomes. Although ease of partner communication (aOR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.80-0.98) was associated with having an STD, few other psychosocial variables were associated with the outcomes. Conclusions: RC is associated with reduced contraceptive use and increased STDs among African American adolescent women. Interventions to prevent and respond to RC that engage adolescent women and men are needed.","Kraft, Joan Marie; Snead, Margaret Christine; Brown, Jennifer L; Sales, Jessica M; Kottke, Melissa J; Hatfield-Timajchy, Kendra; Goedken, Peggy",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.8236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667837/,316

However, it is unknown whether familial breast cancer history (FBCH) also increases individual susceptibility for breast cancer from radiation exposure. In this cohort study, 17,200 female Swedish hemangioma patients with 1,079 breast cancer cases between 1958-2013, exposed by ionizing radiation in infancy, were linked to their first-degree relatives. The association between FBCH and radiation-induced breast cancer risk was assessed. Further, the relevance for breast cancer radiotherapy and mammography screening was evaluated. On average, the radiation-induced excess relative (ERR) and absolute risk (EAR) at age 50 was ERR = 0.51 Gy-1 (95%CI: 0.33; 0.71), and EAR = 10.8 (104 PYR Gy)-1 (95%CI: 7.0; 14.6). Radiation risk was higher by a factor of 2.7 (95%CI: 1.0; 4.8, P = 0.05) if one first-degree relative was affected with breast cancer. For whole breast standard radiotherapy at age 40 with a contralateral breast dose of 0.72 Gy, the 20-year radiation-related excess contralateral breast cancer risk was estimated to increase from 0.6% for women without FBCH to 1.7% with FBCH.

113586,Neuroendovascular Surgery for Acute Ischemic Stroke: All Patients All the Time.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Diet and nutrition are leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Our study aimed to identify and synthesise evidence on the association between food environment characteristics and diet, nutrition and health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), relevant to urban settings, to support development and implementation of appropriate interventions. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of 9 databases from 1 January 2000 to 16 September 2020 with no language restrictions. We included original peer-reviewed observational studies, intervention studies or natural experiments conducted in at least one urban LMIC setting and reporting a quantitative association between a characteristic of the food environment and a diet, nutrition or health outcome. Study selection was done independently in duplicate. Data extraction and quality appraisal using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute checklists were completed based on published reports using a prepiloted form on Covidence. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS 74 studies met eligibility criteria. Consistent evidence reported an association between availability characteristics in the neighbourhood food environment and dietary behaviour (14 studies, 10 rated as good quality), while the balance of evidence suggested an association with health or nutrition outcomes (17 of 24 relevant studies). We also found a balance of evidence that accessibility to food in the neighbourhood environment was associated with diet (10 of 11 studies) although evidence of an association with health outcomes was contradictory. Evidence on other neighbourhood food environment characteristics was sparse and mixed. Availability in the school food environment was also found to be associated with relevant outcomes. Studies investigating our other primary outcomes in observational studies of the school food environment were sparse, but most interventional studies were situated in schools. We found very little evidence on how workplace and home food environments are associated with relevant outcomes. This is a substantial evidence gap. CONCLUSION 'Zoning' or 'healthy food cart' interventions to alter food availability may be appropriate in urban LMIC.

METHODS We examined 233 patients who underwent major hepatectomy with the LHM (n = 75; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 35, colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) in 10, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in 14 and perihilar bile duct carcinoma (BDC) in 16) or without it (n = 158; HCC in 78, CLM in 21, ICC in 31 and BDC in 28). RESULTS In HCC patients, cancer-positive margin rate, blood loss, transection time and prevalence of posthepatectomy ascites in the LHM group were significantly lower than those in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In CLM, transection time in the LHM group was significantly lower than that in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In BDC patients, amount of blood loss, transection time and prevalence of ascites in the LHM group were significantly lower than those in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In CLM patients, tumor recurrence rate in the non-LHM group was significantly higher than that in the LHM group and disease-free survival in the LHM group was significantly better than that in the non-LHM group in CLM patients and, however, this difference was not observed in a large CLM exceeding 5 cm. However, significant differences of posthepatectomy disease-free and overall survivals were not observed in HCC, ICC and BDC patients. CONCLUSIONS Although advantages of LHM improving surgical records in major anatomical liver resections were clarified, oncological advantages in the long-term survival of LHM was still uncertain in the hepatobiliary malignancies.","Nanashima, A; Abo, T; Takagi, K; Arai, J; To, K; Kunizaki, M; Hidaka, S; Takeshita, H; Sawai, T; Nagayasu, T",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejso.2014.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086991/,316

Our objective was to describe the cost and features of the top bathroom scales available online. We performed content analysis of top 100 scales listed on a popular online retailer. Two coders independently extracted price and scale features (i.e., digital connectivity, body mass index [BMI] calculation, maximum weight accommodated). We used t-tests and ANOVA, as appropriate, to examine the relationships between price and features. Among the 97 scales included, mean scale price was $28.99 (SD $21.06; range $7.20-$139.95). Of the advanced features, 20.6% of scales had digital connectivity and 28.9% calculated BMI. Scales with advanced features cost significantly more than scales without (digital connectivity: $49.18 vs. $23.74, P < 0.001; BMI calculation: $42.92 vs. $23.33, P < 0.001). Most scales (76.2%) had a maximum weight of 351-400 lbs, and only 17.5% could accommodate >400 lbs. Price was higher for scales with a higher maximum weight (P = 0.002). No scale with maximum weight > 500 lbs had advanced features. Scales that have digital connectivity for telemedicine or can accommodate higher weights are less commonly available online and their costs may be prohibitive for some patients who need these features. Future research might consider testing whether insurance coverage for scales improves scale access and patient weight management outcomes.","Park, Ji Seok; Bramante, Carolyn; Vakil, Rachit; Lee, Grace; Gudzune, Kimberly",Clinical obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191405/,316

METHODS In this cross-sectional survey study, 98 PA students completed surveys measuring SES, overinvolved parenting, grit (passion), grit (perseverance), self-reported GPA, and perceived stress. RESULTS More overinvolved parenting was reported by PA students under the age of 25 years compared to those over the age of 25. Lower SES predicted higher perceived stress. After controlling for SES, grit (perseverance) partially mediated the relationship between overinvolved parenting and perceived stress. Neither parenting style nor grit was associated with GPA. CONCLUSIONS Younger PA students reported higher levels of overinvolved parenting. The relationship between experiences with overinvolved parenting and current levels of stress in PA school is partially explained by reduced gritty resilience.","Francis, Andrea P; Drake, Nicole; Chen, Matthew; Young, Lauren",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/jpa.0000000000000319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810054/,316

114490,Treating spontaneous and induced septic abortions.,2015,"With a recent randomized prospective trial revealing that thermal ablative therapy as local tumor control improved overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM), thermal ablation continues to remain as an important treatment option in this patient population. Our aim of this article is to review the current role of the ablative therapy in the management of CRLM patients. Main indications for thermal ablation include (I) unresectable liver lesions; (II) in combination with hepatectomy; (III) in patients with significant medical comorbidities or poor performance status (PS); (IV) a small (<3 cm) solitary lesion, which would otherwise necessitate a major liver resection; and (V) patient preference. There are several approaches and modalities for ablative therapy, including open, percutaneous, and laparoscopic approaches, as well as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Each approach and ablation modality have its own pros and cons. Percutaneous and laparoscopic approaches are preferred due to minimally invasive nature, yet laparoscopic approach has more benefits from thorough intraoperative ultrasound (US) exam as well as complete peritoneal staging with laparoscopy. Similarly, whereas high local tumor failure rate has been a major concern with RFA, MWA or microwave thermosphere ablation (MTA) have demonstrated significantly improved local tumor control due to homogenous tissue heating, ability to reach higher tissue temperatures, and less susceptible to the ""heat-sink"" effect. Although liver resection is the standard of care for CRLM, there have been some retrospective studies demonstrating similar oncological outcome between ablative therapy and surgical resection in very selected populations with small (<3 cm) solitary CRLM. Lastly, ablative therapy and liver resection should not be mutually exclusive, especially in the management of bilobar liver metastases. Concomitant ablative therapy with hepatectomy may spare the patients from having two-stage hepatectomy with less morbidity. The role of the thermal ablation will continue to evolve in patients with resectable and ablatable lesions owing to newly emerging technology, in addition to new systemic treatment options, including immunotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).","Takahashi, Hideo; Berber, Eren",Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.21037/hbsn.2019.06.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32140478/,316
114625,Novel oral anticoagulants in secondary prevention of stroke.,2013,"CONTEXT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a strain on health care systems worldwide. Many hospitals experienced severe bed shortages; some had to turn patients away. In Singapore, the widespread outbreak, especially among the dormitory-based population, created a pressing need for alternative care sites. PROGRAM The first massive-scale community care facility (CCF) was started in Singapore to address the pandemic. It served as a low-acuity primary care center that could isolate and treat COVID-19-positive patients with mild disease. This allowed decompression of the patient load in hospitals, ensuring that those with more severe disease could receive timely medical attention. IMPLEMENTATION Various groups from the private and public sectors, including health care, construction, security, hotel management, and project coordination, were involved in the setup and operations of the CCF. A large exhibition center was converted into the care facility and segregated into zones to reduce cross-contamination. State-of-the-art technological infrastructure for health management was used. Several paraclinical services were made available. EVALUATION The CCF was a timely and robust response that fulfilled several crucial functions, including cohort isolation, triage, basic medical care, and timely reviews and escalation of patients. It placed a unique focus on promoting patient ownership, responsibility, and mental well-being. It was largely successful, with a low hospital transfer rate of 0.37%. DISCUSSION The success of the CCF could be attributed to the use of a facility of opportunity, strong interorganizational and cross-sector cooperation, an integrated and robust clinical system, and clear communication channels. It allows for efficient resource utilization and is valuable in future pandemics with similar disease characteristics.","Goei, Anne",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969951/,316

Although fruit flies are a common laboratory model organism of choice, there is relatively little understood about the ethological relationship between flies and ethanol. In this study, we find that when male flies inhabit ethanol-containing food substrates they become more aggressive. We identify a possible mechanism for this behavior. The odor of ethanol potentiates the activity of sensory neurons in response to an aggression-promoting pheromone. Finally, we observed that the odor of ethanol also promotes attraction to a food-related citrus odor. Understanding how flies interact with the complex natural environment they inhabit can provide valuable insight into how different natural stimuli are integrated to promote fundamental behaviors.","Park, Annie; Tran, Tracy; Scheuermann, Elizabeth A; Smith, Dean P; Atkinson, Nigel S",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.59853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141025/,316

METHODS Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and stroke physicians (n=326) rated each item of the NIHSS regarding suitability for prehospital use; best rated items were included. Stroke recognition was evaluated retrospectively in 689 consecutive patients with acute stroke or stroke mimics, prediction of LVO in 741 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke with acute vessel imaging independent of admission NIHSS score. RESULTS Nine of the NIHSS items were rated as 'suitable for prehospital use.' After excluding two items in order to increase specificity, the final scale (termed shortened NIHSS for EMS, sNIHSS-EMS) consists of 'level of consciousness', 'facial palsy', 'motor arm/leg', 'sensory', 'language' and 'dysarthria'. Sensitivity for stroke recognition of the sNIHSS-EMS is 91% (95% CI 86 to 94), specificity 52% (95% CI 47 to 56). Receiver operating curve analysis revealed an optimal cut-off point for LVO prediction of ≥6 (sensitivity 70% (95% CI 65 to 76), specificity 81% (95% CI 76 to 84), positive predictive value 70 (95% CI 65 to 75), area under the curve 0.81 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.84)). Test characteristics were non-inferior to non-comprehensive scales. CONCLUSIONS The sNIHSS-EMS may overcome the sequential use of multiple emergency stroke scales by permitting parallel stroke recognition, severity grading and LVO prediction. Full NIHSS-item compatibility allows for evaluation of stroke progression starting at the prehospital phase.","Purrucker, Jan Christoph; Härtig, Florian; Richter, Hardy; Engelbrecht, Andreas; Hartmann, Johannes; Auer, Jonas; Hametner, Christian; Popp, Erik; Ringleb, Peter Arthur; Nagel, Simon; Poli, Sven",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864702/,316
115543,Transatrial intrapericardial tricuspid annuloplasty.,2015,"A new operant test for preclinical pain research, termed the Mechanical Conflict System (MCS), is presented. Rats were given a choice either to remain in a brightly lit compartment or to escape to a dark compartment by crossing an array of height-adjustable nociceptive probes. Latency to escape the light compartment was evaluated with varying probe heights (0, .5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm above compartment floor) in rats with neuropathic pain induced by constriction nerve injury (CCI) and in naive control rats. Escape responses in CCI rats were assessed following intraperitoneal administration of pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg), morphine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), and the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, RP 67580 (1 and 10 mg/kg). Results indicate that escape latency increased as a function of probe height in both naive and CCI rats. Pregabalin (10 and 30 mg/kg) and morphine (5 mg/kg), but not RP 67580, decreased latency to escape in CCI rats suggesting an antinociceptive effect. In contrast, morphine (10 mg/kg) but not pregabalin (30 mg/kg) increased escape latency in naive rats suggesting a possible anxiolytic action of morphine in response to light-induced fear. No order effects following multiple test sessions were observed. We conclude that the MCS is a valid method to assess behavioral signs of affective pain in rodents.","Harte, Steven E; Meyers, Jessica B; Donahue, Renee R; Taylor, Bradley K; Morrow, Thomas J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26915030/,316
115637,Near-infrared spectroscopy: applications in neonates.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols and increased attention to value-based care have led to the reconsideration of routine postoperative admission in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) cases. We aimed to assess trends in same-day discharge (SDD) and associated readmissions and emergency room visits in a single-surgeon 10-year experience. METHODS The electronic medical record was queried for 30-day outcomes (readmission and emergency department visits with associated indications) for all cases performed between June 2010 and August 2020 by a single FPMRS surgeon. Non-FPMRS specialty cases were excluded. Patient characteristics and 30-day outcomes were compared based on SDD status for the overall cohort as well as the subset of cases traditionally involving an overnight stay (i.e., robotic transabdominal, apical prolapse repair). RESULTS 1793 surgeries were identified and analyzed, including 357 apical prolapse repairs, 370 slings, 392 neuromodulation and 114 complex mesh excisions. The majority (79.1%) had SDD. For admitted patients, mean length of stay was 1.5 (1.3) days. Among cases traditionally involving overnight stay, rates of SDD were significantly higher in 2020 than 2010 (84% vs. 32%, p < 0.001), and increased over time. Overall rates of 30-day readmission and ED visits were low (1.9% and 2.6%, respectively) and did not differ based on SDD status (p = 0.76). Readmissions occurred at mean 11.6 (7.0) days, most commonly for urinary tract infection (13/34). CONCLUSIONS SDD is not associated with increased 30-day readmission or ED visits across a wide breadth of FPMRS cases. SDD is safe and feasible in the majority of FPMRS cases.","Zillioux, Jacqueline; Werneburg, Glenn T; Goldman, Howard B",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.24739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224599/,316
115744,The Association between Multisite Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Routine Hemodynamic Measurements in Relation to Short-Term Outcome in Preterms with Clinical Sepsis.,2015,"Dynamic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) compartmental models provide a tool for predicting the size and duration of both unfettered and managed outbreaks-the latter in the context of interventions such as case detection, patient isolation, vaccination and treatment. The reliability of this tool depends on the validity of key assumptions that include homogeneity of individuals and spatio-temporal homogeneity. Although the SEIR compartmental framework can easily be extended to include demographic (e.g. age) and additional disease (e.g. healthcare workers) classes, dependence of transmission rates on time, and metapopulation structure, fitting such extended models is hampered by both a proliferation of free parameters and insufficient or inappropriate data. This raises the question of how effective a tool the basic SEIR framework may actually be. We go some way here to answering this question in the context of the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa by comparing fits of an SEIR time-dependent transmission model to both country- and district-level weekly incidence data. Our novel approach in estimating the effective-size-of-the-populations-at-risk ( Neff) and initial number of exposed individuals ( E0) at both district and country levels, as well as the transmission function parameters, including a time-to-halving-the-force-of-infection ( tf/2) parameter, provides new insights into this Ebola outbreak. It reveals that the estimate R0 ≈ 1.7 from country-level data appears to seriously underestimate R0 ≈ 3.3 - 4.3 obtained from more spatially homogeneous district-level data. Country-level data also overestimate tf/2 ≈ 22 weeks, compared with 8-10 weeks from district-level data. Additionally, estimates for the duration of individual infectiousness is around two weeks from spatially inhomogeneous country-level data compared with 2.4-4.5 weeks from spatially more homogeneous district-level data, which estimates are rather high compared with most values reported in the literature.

This study attempted to improve our recognition of postoperative bleeding. METHODS Among 1143 patients undergoing pulmonary resection for pulmonary nodules, ten underwent surgical treatment for postoperative bleeding. Clinical and pathologic data were analyzed. Additionally, the relationship between the bleeding point and an increased amount of drained bloody effusion before the second operation was analyzed. RESULTS The bleeding point was recognized in eight cases: the intercostal artery (n = 4), the lung (n = 2), aberrant vessel of the apex of the lung (n = 1) and the bronchial artery (n = 1). The bleeding points were unknown in two cases in whom the decision to perform a second operation was delayed. Potential reasons or influential factors for bleeding were stapling complications (n = 4), low coagulation ability (n = 2) and intraoperative injury (n = 1). We experienced two cases in which intercostal arterial bleeding was induced by scratching the thoracic wall or the vertebra with the edge of the reinforced stapling line or the sharp edge of a broken staple at the first operation. We divided patients into three groups based on the interval between operations. Bleeding from the arteries seemed to show a higher rate of bleeding per hour than that from the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION The bleeding points and speculated reasons for bleeding varied among patients. We were able to cure all ten cases. It might be dependent on the rapid decision of reoperation in cases with arterial bleeding was suspected.","Yano, Motoki; Numanami, Hiroki; Akiyama, Takashi; Taguchi, Rumiko; Furuta, Chihiro; Haniuda, Masayuki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-018-01060-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30656590/,316

It causes serious patient dissatisfaction and leads to higher hospital costs. For years, each clinic has made efforts to reduce this complication. Here, we aimed to summarize our techniques to prevent dehiscence. MATERIAL This retrospective study included two groups operated via median sternotomy from March 2009 to May 2019. The first group included 1,105 consecutive patients who only received sternum wire for sternum closure from March 2009 to October 2013. The second group included 1,559 consecutive patients operated from January 2014 to May 2019; preventive closure techniques were performed for predefined high-risk patients in this group. These closure techniques included polyglyconate (Maxon) or simple longitudinal reinforced sutures, sternal cable or sternoband, sternal plate, and Robiscek technique. RESULTS All patients in Group 1, and 63.8% (995/1559) patients in Group 2 received sternal wire only (P < .001). In Group 2, we applied preventive closure techniques to 564 (36.2%) patients. There was no sternal dehiscence in Group 2, whereas 29 (2.6%) patients postoperatively suffered sternal dehiscence in Group 1; this was statistically significant (P = .001, OR:85.5, 95%CI:5.22-1400.4). The overall incidence of mediastinitis was 0.94%. The incidence significantly was lower in Group 2 (P = .004, OR:3.6, 95%CI:1.52-8.82). Sternum-related mortality in Group 2 also was lower (0.54% versus 0.06%, P = .048, OR:8.5, 95% CI: 1.02-70.75).

In-line test and characterization of polarization mode dispersion are thus of critical importance to evaluate the quality of installed optical fibers that are in use for high-speed signal traffics. However, polarization-based effects in optical fibers are stochastic and quite sensitive to a range of environmental changes, including optical cable movements. This, in turn, gives rise to undesired variations in light polarization that adversely impair the quality of the signal transmission in the link. In this work, we elaborate on experimental testing and theoretical analysis to asses changes of polarization mode dispersion in optical fibers that are caused by environmental variations, here wind gusts in particular. The study was performed on commercially harnessed optical fibers installed within optical power ground wire cables, taking into account different weather conditions. More specifically, we showed that changes caused by wind gusts significantly influence the differential group delay and the principal state of polarization in those optical fibers. For this, we experimentally measured a number of parameters to characterize light polarization properties. Measurements were carried out on C-band operated fiber-optic link formed by 111-km-long power ground wire cables and 88 spectral channels, with a test time step of 1 min during 12 consecutive days. Variations in differential group delay allowed for sensitive testing of environmental changes with measured maxims up to 10 ps under the worst wind conditions. Moreover, measured parameters were used in a numerical model to assess the quality of transmitted high-bit-rate optical signals as a function of wind conditions.

In January the disease spread rapidly to other regions and beyond Chinese borders until it reached Italy where, on February 21, the first case of non-imported contagion was found. On the same date, as the commercial activities were still regularly open, the dinner, which saw as protagonists the participants of this retrospective study, took place. Of the 49 people attending the event, 47 joined the study. The participants of this study were all males, with an average age of 57 years old, all asymptomatic during the dinner. The participants voluntarily underwent serological or swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 and answered questions from our telephone interview. From the data obtained it emerges that 26 people (55.3%), after the dinner, developed one or more symptoms. The most frequently encountered symptom was fever, present in 76.9% of the symptomatic. 26 people were positive on the diagnostic tests (55.3% of the total examined), 24 of them were symptomatic. The conceivable R0 (the basic reproduction number) is higher than the one present in the literature (7.7 vs 3.8), this is probably due to the conditions in which the dinner took place (not ventilated environment, absence of safety distances, absence of personal protective equipment).","Orsucci, Giulia; Rocchi, Rachele; Menconi, Arianna; Salvoni, Franco Antonio",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3453.34420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078010/,316
117984,Hydroxychloroquine in systemic and auto-immune diseases: where are we now?,2021-01-27,"Sturmberg and Martin in 2020 argue that universal health coverage (UHC) is mainly about financing, and primary health care (PHC) is about the right care at the right time to ensure health. They maintain that the World Health Organization has recently sent the wrong message about the ""pillars"" of PHC in their relationship to UHC. An understanding of political economy is required in order to come to terms with the bases of PHC and the fundamentals of UHC that dealing with inequities is not only an economic issue but fundamentally a political issue. Neoliberal decision-making can enhance inequities in society. Two chronic health conditions, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, are examples of conditions that lead to costly and debilitating consequences for patients but also lead to substantial economic costs in terms of lost workforce participation and lost productivity. These cases demonstrate the socio-political issues involved in the management of care for a number of illnesses. The upsurge of COVID-19 has placed an enormous strain on health and broader social and economic resources and challenged the pretext of UHC as health for all: substantial differences in equity and political commitment have emerged. Sturmberg and Martin argue that the joining of UHC and PHC needs leadership, which involves local communities and resourcing. PHC is a changing system based on power relationships involving funders and the health community. In Australia as in several countries, out-of-pocket costs have grown rapidly and have affected access for some groups to PHC and have challenged the pretext of equity in UHC. In the context of PHC and UHC, we support the position that health for all goes beyond health care for all, to embrace healthy lives promoting wellbeing.","Walker, Christine; Peterson, Chris L",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189085/,316

This article presents a single centre cohort of this challenging subtype of stroke, describing the technical procedure and analysing the angiographic and clinical outcome. METHODS Clinical and imaging data of all consecutive patients between July 2008 and March 2013 with intracranial artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and additional occlusion or pseudo-occlusion of the cervical ICA were retrospectively analysed with respect to demographical and clinical characteristics. Technical approach, recanalization rate, recanalization time and short-term clinical outcome were determined. RESULTS A total of 43 patients with tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, 32 (74.4%) occlusions and 11 (25.6%) pseudo-occlusions of the extracranial ICA with additional occlusion of the distal segment of the ICA in 7.0% (3/43), the M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 81.4% (35/43) or the M2-segment of the MCA in 11.6% (5/43) of cases were treated with combined endovascular approach including extracranial stenting with angioplasty and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy. In 76.7% of cases, an angiographic recanalization result of 2b or 3 using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score was achieved. Mean time from first angiographic series to recanalization was 103 min. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 2 was achieved in 32.6% at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy of patients with tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation with emergency extracranial stenting and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy appears to be safe and may lead to a satisfactory angiographic result and clinical outcome.","Maurer, C J; Joachimski, F; Berlis, A",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-014-0318-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988990/,316

With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several concerns have been raised regarding the ability of medical systems to handle sudden changes in the daily routines of healthcare providers. One significant problem is the management of ambulance dispatch and control during a pandemic. To help address this problem, we first analyze ambulance dispatch data records from April 2014 to August 2020 for Nagoya City, Japan. Significant changes were observed in the data during the pandemic, including the state of emergency (SoE) declared across Japan. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework based on recurrent neural networks to estimate the number of emergency ambulance dispatches (EADs) during a SoE. The fusion of data includes environmental factors, the localization data of mobile phone users, and the past history of EADs, thereby providing a general framework for knowledge discovery and better resource management. The results indicate that the proposed blend of training data can be used efficiently in a real-world estimation of EAD requirements during periods of high uncertainties such as pandemics.","Rashed, Essam A; Kodera, Sachiko; Shirakami, Hidenobu; Kawaguchi, Ryotetsu; Watanabe, Kazuhiro; Hirata, Akimasa",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753268/,316

Some viruses have been shown to encode functional homologs of UPS enzymes, suggesting that a systematic identification of these products may provide new insights into virus-host cell interactions. Ubiquitin-specific proteases, collectively known as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), regulate the activity of the UPS by hydrolyzing ubiquitin peptide or isopeptide bonds. The prediction of viral DUBs based on sequence similarity with known enzymes is hampered by the diversity of viral genomes. In this study sequence alignments, pattern searches, and hidden Markov models were developed for the conserved C- and H-boxes of the known DUB families and used to search the open reading frames (ORFs) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a large gammaherpesvirus that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of human malignancies of lymphoid and epithelial cell origin. The searches identified a limited number of EBV ORFs that contain putative DUB catalytic domains. DUB activity was confirmed by functional assays and mutation analysis for three high scoring candidates, supporting the usefulness of this bioinformatics approach in predicting distant homologues of cellular enzymes.","Sompallae, Ramakrishna; Gastaldello, Stefano; Hildebrand, Sebastian; Zinin, Nikolay; Hassink, Gerco; Lindsten, Kristina; Haas, Juergen; Persson, Bengt; Masucci, Maria G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01113-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18715931/,316
119060,Outcome after stroke attributable to baseline factors-The PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke (PROSCIS).,2018,"Interactions between proteins and small molecules play important roles in the inhibition of protein function. However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-π, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-π > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","Sepay, Nayim; Saha, Pranab Chandra; Shahzadi, Zarrin; Chakraborty, Aratrika; Halder, Umesh Chandra",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp05714b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876086/,316

Regulated by the special proteins on PM, the nanomotors target the thrombus site and then PM can be ruptured under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to achieve desirable sequential drug release, including rapid release of thrombolytic urokinase (3 hours) and slow release of anticoagulant heparin (>20 days). Meantime, the motion ability of nanomotors under NIR irradiation can effectively promote them to penetrate deeply in thrombus site to enhance retention ratio. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation results confirm that the synergistic effect of targeting ability from PM and motion ability from nanomotors can notably enhance the thrombolysis effect in both static/dynamic thrombus and rat model.","Wan, Mimi; Wang, Qi; Wang, Rongliang; Wu, Rui; Li, Ting; Fang, Dan; Huang, Yangyang; Yu, Yueqi; Fang, Leyi; Wang, Xingwen; Zhang, Yinghua; Miao, Zhuoyue; Zhao, Bo; Wang, Fenghe; Mao, Chun; Jiang, Qing; Xu, Xingquan; Shi, Dongquan",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766445/,316

Reliable gestational age estimates are useful for quantifying population burdens of preterm birth and informing allocation of resources to address the problem. However, evaluating gestational age in low-resource settings can be challenging, particularly in places where access to ultrasound is limited. Our group has developed an algorithm using newborn screening analyte values derived from dried blood spots from newborns born in Ontario, Canada for estimating gestational age within one to two weeks. The primary objective of this study is to validate a program that derives gestational age estimates from dried blood spot samples (heel-prick or cord blood) collected from health and demographic surveillance sites and population representative health facilities in low-resource settings in Zambia, Kenya, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. We will also pilot the use of an algorithm to identify birth percentiles based on gestational age estimates and weight to identify small for gestational age infants. Once collected from local sites, samples will be tested by the Newborn Screening Ontario laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa, Canada. Analyte values will be obtained through laboratory analysis for estimation of gestational age as well as screening for other diseases routinely conducted at Ontario's newborn screening program. For select conditions, abnormal screening results will be reported back to the sites in real time to facilitate counseling and future clinical management. We will determine the accuracy of our existing algorithm for estimation of gestational age in these newborn samples. Results from this research hold the potential to create a feasible method to assess gestational age at birth in low- and middle-income countries where reliable estimation may be otherwise unavailable.","Bota, A Brianne; Ward, Victoria; Hawken, Stephen; Wilson, Lindsay A; Lamoureux, Monica; Ducharme, Robin; Murphy, Malia S Q; Denize, Kathryn M; Henderson, Matthew; Saha, Samir K; Akther, Salma; Otieno, Nancy A; Munga, Stephen; Atito, Raphael O; Stringer, Jeffrey S A; Mwape, Humphrey; Price, Joan T; Mujuru, Hilda Angela; Chimhini, Gwendoline; Magwali, Thulani; Mudawarima, Louisa; Chakraborty, Pranesh; Darmstadt, Gary L; Wilson, Kumanan",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13155.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501414/,316

Advances in minimally invasive surgery have led to the application of these techniques to malignant lesions, including Wilms tumor. We aim to present our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) for Wilms tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four patients with Wilms tumor were treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and afterwards underwent an LN and lymph node sampling. Four ports were placed and the tumors were removed without morcellation in an endoscopic bag through an incision by extending the umbilical or the suprapubic port site. RESULTS The average age at the time of surgery was 3 years and 7 months (range, 23 mo to 6 y). There were no intraoperative complications and the blood loss was minimal in all cases. The mean operative time was 125 minutes (range, 90 to 160 min). Among our patients, we had 2 stage IV and 2 stage I cases. The mean time of hospitalization was 3 days (range, 2 to 4 d). There were no long-term complications at the mean follow-up of 3 years and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS LN for Wilms tumor may be considered as an option in selected patients. Minimally invasive surgery allows the surgeon to follow all the oncologic principles required for surgical treatment of this neoplasm and provides the advantages of these techniques for cancer patients.

Using a human embryonic kidney 293T cell line to express human TLR3, we determined that poly(I-C)-induced signal could be significantly inhibited by single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), but not ssRNA or dsDNA. The ssDNA molecules that down-modulated TLR3 signaling did not affect TLR4 and do not require the hypomethylated CpG motif found in TLR9 ligands. The degree of modulation can be altered by the length, base sequence, and modification state of the ssDNAs. An inhibitory ssDNA was found to colocalize with TLR3 in transfected cells and in a cell line that naturally expresses TLR3. The inhibitory ssDNAs can compete efficiently with dsRNA for binding purified TLR3 ectodomains in vitro, while noninhibitory nucleic acids do not. The ssDNAs also decrease the levels of several cytokines produced by the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to poly(I-C) stimulation of native TLR3. These activities indicate that ssDNAs could be used to regulate the inflammatory response through TLR3.","Ranjith-Kumar, C T; Duffy, K E; Jordan, J L; Eaton-Bassiri, A; Vaughan, Robert; Hoose, Scott A; Lamb, Roberta J; Sarisky, R T; Kao, C Cheng",Molecular and cellular biology,https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00308-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18490443/,316

We examined whether concerns regarding transmission of COVID-19 to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were associated with HCWs' distress. We tested whether living with others modified these associations. METHOD HCWs at a New York City academic medical center (N = 767; 80.7% female, 58.5% White) enrolled in the COVID-19 Health Care Provider Study and completed a web-based survey between April 9, 2020 and May 11, 2020. RESULTS Controlling for demographics, distress regarding potential transmission to loved ones and social distancing from loved ones were each significantly associated with higher odds of a positive screen for acute stress, depression, and anxiety (ORs = 1.29-1.59, all ps < .01). Living with others was associated with lower odds of a positive screen for depression and anxiety, though the protective effect for anxiety was evident only for HCWs with no distress regarding transmission concerns. CONCLUSIONS Transmission concerns and social distancing from loved ones were associated with greater odds of psychological distress, whereas living with others was associated with lower odds of distress. Interventions should consider ways to facilitate the ability of HCWs to receive social support from loved ones, while simultaneously protecting their family's health.

As with any new surgical approach, definition of the number of procedures required to optimize the technique is an important goal. Data on this learning curve for single-incision right colectomy are lacking; therefore, we report the outcomes of consecutive single-incision right colectomies to identify the procedural learning curve. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed consecutive single-incision right colectomies performed by a single surgeon from May 2010 to May 2013. Patients were evaluated in groups of ten to minimize individual patient variability and selection bias. Demographics and peri-operative outcomes among groups were evaluated using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis. Statistical improvement was assessed between groups using Student T tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS Seventy consecutive single-incision right colectomies were performed during the study period. There were no differences in patient demographics over the course of the experiences, suggesting that the selection bias did not influence the outcomes. There was a statistical improvement in operative time after the first 10 cases (103 vs. 130 min, p = 0.01). A second statistical improvement in operative time occurred after 40 cases (97 vs. 114 min, p = 0.03). There was no statistical improvement in estimated blood loss, lymph node harvest, conversion rate, length of stay, or post-operative morbidity throughout the experience. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of our large series of consecutive cases indicates that for a surgeon trained in advanced laparoscopic techniques and given adequate case volume, the outcomes from the procedure are quickly optimized with a minimal learning curve. Operative time is optimized following 40 procedures. Identification of the learning curve is critical for surgeons wishing to implement a single-incision approach and to ensure that the outcomes are optimized prior to thorough comparison with standard laparoscopic or open approaches.","Kirk, Katherine A; Boone, Brian A; Evans, Leonard; Evans, Steven; Bartlett, David L; Holtzman, Matthew P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3803-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25171884/,316

We summarize the current techniques for lung volume assessment selected according to their possible usage in the ICU and discuss the recent findings obtained with implementation of these techniques in patients with ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS Computed tomography technique remains irreplaceable in terms of quantitative aeration of different lung regions, but the commonly used cut-offs for classification may be questioned with recent findings on nonpathological lungs. Monitoring end expiratory lung volume using nitrogen washout technique enhanced our understanding on lung volume change during positioning, pleural effusion drainage, intra-abdominal hypertension, and recruitment maneuver. Recent studies supported that tidal volume could not surrogate tidal strain, which needs measurement of functional residual capacity and which is correlated with pro-inflammatory lung response.

The concentrations were examined with non-compartmental analysis and compartmental modeling. Results: The concentration of free cefuroxime in ISF was lower in the non-ventilated lung than the ventilated one, evidenced by a lung penetration factor of 47% versus 63% (p < 0.05), the ratio between maximum concentrations (65%, p < 0.05), and the ratio between the areas under the concentration-time curve (78%, p = 0.12). The time needed to reach a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 30%-40% longer for a collapsed lung than for a ventilated one. In addition, a delay of 10-40 minutes was observed for lung ISF compared with plasma. The mean residence time values (ISF collapsed lung > ISF ventilated lung > plasma) could explain the absence of practically important differences in the time interval with the concentration of cefuroxime exceeding the MICs of sensitive strains (≤4 mg/L). Conclusion: The concentration of cefuroxime in the ISF of a collapsed porcine lung is lower than in a ventilated one; furthermore, its equilibration with plasma is delayed. Administration of the first cefuroxime dose earlier or at a higher rate may be warranted, as well as dose intensification of the perioperative prophylaxis of pneumonia caused by pathogens with higher MICs.","Děrgel, Martin; Voborník, Martin; Pojar, Marek; Karalko, Mikita; Gofus, Jan; Radochová, Věra; Studená, Šárka; Maláková, Jana; Turek, Zdeněk; Chládek, Jaroslav; Manďák, Jiří",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2019.273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633629/,316
121373,Postpartum internal carotid and vertebral arterial dissections.,2014,"BACKGROUND In patients with a vestibular schwannoma, some studies have reported that useful hearing preserved initially after surgery deteriorates gradually in the long term. Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients. This study, which analyzed one of the largest series of vestibular schwannoma patients, demonstrated that retrocochlear condition is a key factor for useful hearing maintenance. In patients with vestibular schwannoma who have preserved hearing function, regular postoperative monitoring of hearing function is as important as regular MRI.","Ichimasu, Norio; Kohno, Michihiro; Nakajima, Nobuyuki; Matsushima, Ken; Tanaka, Yujiro; Tsukahara, Kiyoaki; Inagaki, Taro; Yoshino, Masanori; Nagata, Osamu",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04523-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803370/,316

STUDY DESIGN Women scheduled for laparotomic myomectomy with intramural and/or subserous myomas of >60mm in diameter, and who wished to preserve fertility, were eligible. Patients were randomized immediately prior to abdominal wall closure to receive either hydrophilic resorbable film applied directly to the incisions (P-Group, n=33) or 500mL Ringer's lactate solution instilled into the pelvic cavity (R-Group, n=28). Incidence, severity, and extent of postoperative adhesions to the uterine incisions and adnexal and abdominopelvic adhesions were assessed during second-look laparoscopy 10-20 weeks after the initial surgery. Unedited videotapes of this second-look procedure were reviewed by two blinded independent surgeons. RESULTS Fifty-four patients (P-Group, n=28; R-Group, n=26) underwent second-look laparoscopy. Significantly fewer P-Group patients developed adhesions to uterine incisions than R-Group patients (43% vs. 92%, P=0.001). Adhesions, which were confirmed by independent reviewers, were found in significantly fewer P-Group sites than R-Group sites (29% vs. 76%, P=0.001). No serious adverse events related to the barriers used or adhesion-related complications were reported in either group. CONCLUSION The hydrophilic resorbable anti-adhesion film PREVADH™ significantly reduced adhesion incidence and severity after laparotomic myomectomy.

122024,What the SWIFT and TREVO II trials tell us about the role of endovascular therapy for acute stroke.,2013,"BACKGROUND Energy devices are essential laparoscopic tools. Residual heat is defined as the increased instrument temperature after energy activation is completed. This study aimed to determine the length of time a surgeon needs to wait before touching other tissue using four common laparoscopic energy sources. METHODS Thermal imaging quantified instrument and tissue temperature ex vivo using monopolar coagulation, argon beam coagulation, ultrasonic dissection, and bipolar tissue fusion devices. To simulate realistic operative usage, each instrument was activated for 5 s four consecutive times with 5 s pauses between fires. Thermal conductivity to bovine liver tissue was measured 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 s after final activation. RESULTS The maximum increase in instrument tip temperature was 172 ± 63°C for the ultrasonic dissection, 81 ± 18°C for the monopolar coagulation, 46 ± 19°C for the bipolar tissue fusion, and 1 ± 1°C for the argon beam coagulation (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Touching the instrument tip to tissue at four intervals after the final activation (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 s) found that ultrasonic energy raised the tissue temperature higher (maximum change, 58°C) than the other three energy devices at all four time points (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Ultrasonic energy instruments have greater residual heat than monopolar electrosurgery, bipolar tissue fusion, and argon beam. The ultrasonic energy instrument tips heated tissue more than 20°C from baseline even 20 s after activation; whereas all the other energy sources raised the tissue temperature less than 20°C by 5 s. These practical findings may alter a surgeon's usage of these common energy devices.","Govekar, Henry R; Robinson, Thomas N; Stiegmann, Greg V; McGreevy, Francis T",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1742-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21594739/,316

AIM To understand how home palliative care professionals were affected by the outbreak, describing changes and challenges in their daily work as well as their reactions to the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. DESIGN Qualitative study conducted using telephone semi-structured interviews, with thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Thirty home care professionals working for an Italian non-profit organization which provides home palliative care for cancer patients and their families. RESULTS Three main themes were identified. The first theme showed both patient-related and practice-related challenges participants faced in their daily work, requiring the implementation of different communication methods and patient and family education on risk prevention. The second theme showed the perception of increased responsibility and being the only landmark for family played a decisive role in participants' positive attitude. The third theme highlighted the participants' perception of the critical role of a home care setting in this emergency situation. CONCLUSIONS The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic brought many challenges and stressors for home palliative care professionals. On the other side, they reported a satisfaction with their critical role in carrying out their work with patients at risk.","Franchini, Luca; Varani, Silvia; Ostan, Rita; Bocchi, Ilenia; Pannuti, Raffaella; Biasco, Guido; Bruera, Eduardo",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211008732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829909/,316

Studies have shown that access to green spaces is associated with better mental and physical health, yet green spaces can also be detrimental to health if they are not managed appropriately. Despite the increasing interest in urban green spaces, little research has so far been conducted into the links between green spaces and cancer. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this scoping review is therefore to map the literature available on the types of relationship between urban green spaces and cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guideline to report the protocol. To conduct this scoping review, we will use a structured search strategy based on controlled vocabulary and relevant key terms related to green space, urban space and cancer. We will search MEDLINE (PubMed), GreenFILE (EBSCOhost), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCOhost) and ScienceDirect as electronic database as well as hand-search publications for grey literature. This review will therefore provide evidence on this current topic, one which could have practical implications for policy-makers involved in choices which are more conducive to healthy living. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No primary data will be collected since all data that will be presented in this review are based on published articles and publicly available documents, and therefore ethics committee approval is not a requirement. The findings of this review will be presented at workshops and conferences, and will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Porcherie, Marion; Lejeune, Mathilde; Gaudel, Marion; Pommier, Jeanine; Faure, Emmanuelle; Heritage, Zoé; Rican, Stéphane; Simos, Jean; Cantoreggi, Nicola Luca; Roué Le Gall, Anne; Cambon, Linda; Regnaux, Jean-Philippe",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453298/,316

However, there have been striking differences in the number of infected individuals and deaths in different countries. Particularly, within Central Europe in countries that are similar in ethnicity, age, and medical standards and have performed similar steps of containment, such differences in mortality rates remain inexplicable. We suggest to consider and explore environmental factors to explain these intriguing variations. Countries like Northern Italy, France, Spain, and UK have suffered from 5 times more deaths from the corona virus infection than neighboring countries like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Denmark related to the size of their respective populations. There is a striking correlation between the level of environmental pollutants including pesticides, dioxins, and air pollution such as NO2 known to affect immune function and healthy metabolism with the rate of mortality in COVID-19 pandemic in these European countries. There is also a correlation with the use of chlorination of drinking water in these regions. In addition to the improvement of environmental protective programs, there are possibilities to lower the blood levels of these pollutants by therapeutic apheresis. Furthermore, therapeutic apheresis might be an effective method to improve metabolic inflammation, altered vascular perfusion, and neurodegeneration observed as long-term complications of COVID-19 disease.","Bornstein, Stefan R; Voit-Bak, Karin; Schmidt, Dieter; Morawietz, Henning; Bornstein, Alexander Benjamin; Balanzew, Waldimir; Julius, Ulrich; Rodionov, Roman N; Biener, Anne Maria; Wang, Jun; Schulte, Klaus-Martin; Krebs, Peter; Vollmer, Günter; Straube, R",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1182-2016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599638/,316

In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, involvement of DC-SIGN has been linked to severe cases of COVID-19. Inhibition of the interaction between DC-SIGN and viral glycoproteins has the potential to generate broad spectrum antiviral agents. Here, we demonstrate that mannose-functionalized poly- l -lysine glycoconjugates efficiently inhibit the attachment of viral glycoproteins to DC-SIGN-presenting cells with picomolar affinity. Treatment of these cells leads to prolonged receptor internalization and inhibition of virus binding for up to 6 h. Furthermore, the polymers are fully bio-compatible and readily cleared by target cells. The thermodynamic analysis of the multivalent interactions reveals enhanced entropy-driven affinities and promising perspectives for the future development of multivalent therapeutics.","Ernst, Beat; Cramer, Jonathan; Aliu, Butrint; Jiang, Xiaohua; Sharpe, Timothy; Pang, Lijuan; Hadorn, Adrian; Rabbani, Said",ChemMedChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202100348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061468/,316

However, risks associated with CVC may be high in the initial phase of severe sepsis because of patient instability. The timing of CVC itself has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between CVC in the initial care of patients with severe sepsis and corresponding mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a nationwide retrospective analysis using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2016. We identified patients who received CVC within 30 days from hospital admission. We compared the 30-day mortality between two groups: patients who received CVC within two days (early) after admission and those who received CVC three or more days (delayed) after admission, using marginal structural models with inverse probability treatment weighting. RESULTS We identified 6,028 eligible patients from 911 hospitals among 27,497 patients with severe sepsis for this study; 4,544 (75.4%) received early CVC. Patients with early CVC had poor prognostic baselines and received more intense treatment than patients with delayed CVC. After adjusting for baseline and time-dependent treatment variables, we found that there were no significant differences between patients who received CVC within two days after admission and those who received CVC three or more days after admission (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% Confidence interval 0.62-1.10).

We conducted this study to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) in this age group with use of imaging-based selection. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 2 different comprehensive stroke centers and compared the outcomes of ET versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone among eligible nonagenarians with LVO in anterior circulation and evidence of salvageable tissue on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS A total of 617 patients of AIS had been treated with IVT or ET, including 23 eligible nonagenarians. Among these, 9 patients were treated with IVT alone (IVT group) and 14 patients received ET group. Notably, the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were significantly lower after ET than after IVT (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study II criteria, 0 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.047; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria, 7.1 vs. 66.7%; p = 0.005). Moreover, although there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups on efficacy, ET tended to lead to greater early neurologic recovery at discharge (71.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.102) and improve functional outcome at 90 days (71.4 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.383), respectively. CONCLUSION By using MRI-based selection, ET in nonagenarians with AIS caused by LVO within anterior circulation was safe and may lead to improve early neurologic recovery and functional independence at 90 days, as compared with IVT alone. Randomized trial in larger sample size testing efficacy of ET using diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuated inversion recovery mismatch selection in this age group appears feasible.","Wu, Qisi; Li, Qi; Huang, Cheng; Li, Yongmei; Wolff, Valérie; Qin, Xinyue",European neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000501552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291626/,316

123739,[The characteristics of nurses' and caregivers' behaviour in different clinical settings with special attention to burnout syndrome].,2008,"BACKGROUND Pretreatment Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores (ASPECTS) is associated with clinical outcomes. The rate of decline between subsequent images, however, may be more predictive of outcomes as it integrates time and physiology. METHODS A cohort of patients transferred from six primary stroke centers and treated with intra-arterial therapy (IAT) was retrospectively studied. Absolute ASPECTS decay was defined as ((ASPECTS First CT-ASPECTS Second CT)/hours elapsed between images). A logistic regression model was performed to determine if the rate of ASPECTS decay predicted good outcomes at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). RESULTS 106 patients with a mean age of 66±14 years and a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 19 (IQR 15-23) were analyzed. Median time between initial CT at the outside hospital to repeat CT at our facility was 2.7 h (IQR 2.0-3.6). Patients with good outcomes had lower rates of absolute ASPECTS decay compared with those who did not (0.14±0.23 score/h vs 0.49±0.39 score/h; p<0.001). In multivariable modeling, the absolute rate of ASPECTS decay (OR 0.043; 95% CI 0.004 to 0.471; p=0.01) was a stronger predictor of good patient outcome than static pretreatment ASPECTS obtained before IAT (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04; p=0.075). In practical terms, every 1 unit increase in ASPECTS decline per hour correlates with a 23-fold lower probability of a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with faster rates of ASPECTS decay during inter-facility transfers are associated with worse clinical outcomes. This value may reflect the rate of physiological infarct expansion and thus serve as a tool in patient selection for IAT.","Sun, Chung-Huan J; Connelly, Kerrin; Nogueira, Raul G; Glenn, Brenda A; Zimmermann, Susan; Anda, Kim; Camp, Deborah; Gaunt, Susan; Pallard, Herma; Eckenroth, Michele; Frankel, Michael R; Belagaje, Samir R; Anderson, Aaron M; Nahab, Fadi; Yepes, Manuel; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443414/,316

123825,A biological profile for diagnosis and outcome of COVID-19 patients.,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND Some studies suggest that patients with asthma who are homozygous for arginine at the 16th amino acid position of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (B16 Arg/Arg) benefit less from treatment with longacting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids than do those homozygous for glycine (B16 Gly/Gly). We investigated whether there is a genotype-specific response to treatment with a longacting beta2 agonist in combination with inhaled corticosteroid. METHODS In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients with moderate asthma were enrolled in pairs matched for forced expiratory volume in 1 s and ethnic origin, according to whether they had the B16 Arg/Arg (n=42) or B16 Gly/Gly (n=45) genotype. Individuals in a matched pair were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive inhaled longacting beta2 agonist (salmeterol 50 microg twice a day) or placebo given in a double-blind, crossover design for two 18-week periods. Open-label inhaled corticosteroid (hydrofluoroalkane beclometasone 240 microg twice a day) was given to all participants during the treatment periods. The primary endpoint was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00200967. FINDINGS After 18 weeks of treatment, mean morning PEF in Arg/Arg participants was 21.4 L/min (95% CI 11.8-31.1) higher when participants were assigned to receive salmeterol than when assigned to receive placebo (p<0.0001). In Gly/Gly participants, morning PEF was 21.5 L/min (11.0-32.1) higher when participants were assigned to receive salmeterol than when assigned to receive placebo (p<0.0001). The improvement in PEF did not differ between genotypes (difference [Arg/Arg-Gly/Gly] -0.1, -14.4 to 14.2; p=0.99). In Gly/Gly participants, methacholine PC20 (20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s; a prespecified secondary outcome) was 2.4 times higher when participants were assigned to salmeterol than when assigned to placebo (p<0.0001). Responsiveness to methacholine did not differ between salmeterol and placebo in Arg/Arg participants (p=0.87). The 2.5 times higher genotype-specific difference in responsiveness to methacholine was significant (1.32 doubling dose difference between genotypes, 0.43-2.21, p=0.0038). Seven Arg/Arg participants (placebo, n=5; salmeterol, n=2) and six Gly/Gly participants (placebo, n=3; salmeterol, n=3) had an asthma exacerbation. Five serious adverse events were reported, one each during the pre-match and run-in phases on open-label inhaled corticosteroid, two during double-blind treatment with salmeterol/inhaled corticosteroid, and one during double-blind treatment with placebo/inhaled corticosteroid. None of the serious events was asthma-related or related to study drugs or procedures. INTERPRETATION In asthma patients with B16 Arg/Arg and B16 Gly/Gly genotypes, combination treatment with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroid improved airway function when compared with inhaled corticosteroid therapy alone. These findings suggest that patients should continue to be treated with longacting beta2 agonists plus moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids irrespective of B16 genotype. Further investigation is needed to establish the importance of the genotype-specific difference in responsiveness to methacholine.

Methods In 2017, a general surgery resident in postgraduate year 4 travelled from VGH to HCCR Polanco for the initial exchange, followed by a trauma fellow. The surgical case volumes in a month at VGH and a month at HCCR Polanco were compared. At the end of the exchange, a 36-item Likert style questionnaire was administered to the Mexican surgeons and residents who interacted with the Canadian resident and fellow during the exchange. Results The most commonly performed procedures on the VGH acute care surgery service were laparoscopic cholecystectomy (35%) and laparoscopic appendectomy (17%). The most commonly performed procedures on the VGH trauma service were chest tube insertions (24%) and tracheostomies (24%). The most commonly performed procedures at HCCR Polanco were surgery for penetrating abdominal trauma (19%) and extremity trauma (13%). The survey results indicated that the costs of travel and accommodation were obstacles to future exchanges. All survey respondents wanted to continue collaborating with Canadians on clinical and research endeavours, felt that hosting Canadian residents was a valuable experience and felt that visiting VGH would also be valuable. Conclusion Canadian surgical trainees gained valuable exposure to operative trauma during the exchange. The mix of operations performed at VGH and HCCR Polanco was vastly different; therefore, the exchange broadened the trainees' surgical experience. There was a unanimously positive response to the exchange among the Mexican survey respondents. This exchange is part of a long-term collaboration between our surgical centres.","Margolick, Joseph; Yin, Lu; Joharifard, Shahrzad; Afya, Avi; Velez, Maria de Los Angeles Mendoza; Meza, Edgar; Sohani, Salim; Laane, Charlotte; Ball-Banting, Elenor; Joos, Emilie",Canadian journal of surgery.

In this pooled retrospective analysis, we describe changes in management patterns for patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 in two academic institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a current or historical diagnosis of malignancy were identified from the electronic medical record at the University of California, San Francisco, and Stanford University. The proportion of patients undergoing active cancer management whose care was affected was quantified and analyzed for significant differences with regard to management type, treatment intent, and the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. The duration and characteristics of such changes were compared across subgroups. RESULTS A total of 131 patients were included, of whom 55 were undergoing active cancer management. Of these, 35 of 55 (64%) had significant changes in management that consisted primarily of delays. An additional three patients not undergoing active cancer management experienced a delay in management after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The decision to change management was correlated with the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, with more delays identified in patients treated with palliative intent earlier in the course of the pandemic (March/April 2020) compared with later (May/June 2020) (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.03 to 17.3; P = .0497). This difference was not seen among patients treated with curative intent during the same timeframe. CONCLUSION We found significant changes in the management of cancer patients with COVID-19 treated with curative and palliative intent that evolved over time. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of changes in management and treatment on cancer outcomes for patients with cancer and COVID-19.","Wu, Julie Tsu-Yu; Kwon, Daniel H; Glover, Michael J; Henry, Solomon; Wood, Douglas; Rubin, Daniel L; Koshkin, Vadim S; Schapira, Lidia; Shah, Sumit A",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332170/,316
124519,The Integrated RNA Landscape of Renal Preconditioning against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,2020-02-28,"Background Understanding gender gaps in trainee evaluations is critical because these may ultimately determine the duration of training. Currently, no studies describe the influence of gender on the evaluation of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows. Objective The objective of our study was to compare milestone scores of female versus male PEM fellows. Methods This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of a national sample of PEM fellows from July 2014 to June 2018. Accreditation Council for Medical Education (ACGME) subcompetencies are scored on a 5-point scale and span six domains: patient care (PC), medical knowledge, systems-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills (ICS). Summative assessments of the 23 PEM subcompetencies are assigned by each program's clinical competency committee and submitted semiannually for each fellow. Program directors voluntarily provided deidentified ACGME milestone reports. Demographics including sex, program region, and type of residency were collected. Descriptive analysis of milestones was performed for each year of fellowship. Multivariate analyses evaluated the difference in scores by sex for each of the subcompetencies. Results Forty-eight geographically diverse programs participated, yielding data for 639 fellows (66% of all PEM fellows nationally); sex was recorded for 604 fellows, of whom 67% were female. When comparing the mean milestone scores in each of the six domains, there were no differences by sex in any year of training. When comparing scores within each of the 23 subcompetencies and correcting the significance level for comparison of multiple milestones, the scores for PC3 and ICS2 were significantly, albeit not meaningfully, higher for females. Conclusion In a national sample of PEM fellows, we found no major differences in milestone scores between females and males.","Zuckerbraun, Noel S; Levasseur, Kelly; Kou, Maybelle; Rose, Jerri A; Roskind, Cindy G; Vu, Tien; Baghdassarian, Aline; Leonard, Kathryn; Shabanova, Veronika; Langhan, Melissa L",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099991/,316

Culture conditions were optimized by growing B. cepacia BPT1213 in mineral salt medium (MSM) supplemented with 2% waste glycerol in a 2.5 L bioreactor. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the influence of aeration rate (0.6-1.8 vvm), agitation speed (100-300 rpm), and cultivation period (48-72 h) on PHA production. The optimum conditions for the growth and PHA accumulation were 1.5 vvm, 300 rpm, and 72 h, with predicted values of 5.08 g/L CDW, 66.07% PHA content, and 3.35 g/L total PHA concentration. Using these conditions, the experimental system produced 5.63 g/L of CDW with 64.00% w/w PHA content, which is threefold higher PHA concentration (3.60 g/L) compared to the non-optimized conditions. The melting temperature (Tm ) of purified PHA was 173.45 ± 1.05°C. In conclusion, the statistical approach was significantly increased the PHA production using waste glycerol as the sole carbon source.","Zain, Nor Fauziah Mohd; Paramasivam, Murugan; Tan, Joo Shun; Lim, Vuanghao; Lee, Chee Keong",Biotechnology progress,https://doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894656/,316

To date, no other studies have compared the LESS and conventional laparoscopic TEP approaches for the treatment of inguinal hernia in a prospective randomized study setting. METHODS For this study, 100 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively randomized into either the LESS TEP group or the conventional laparoscopic TEP group. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were recorded. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The median operative time was longer in the LESS TEP group (63.5 min) than in the conventional TEP group (50.5 min) (p = 0.001). No conversion was performed in either group. The mean pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional TEP group than in the LESS TEP group (3.9 vs. 2.6; p = 0.02). The postoperative results were comparable between the groups in terms of analgesic requirements, systemic stress responses, complications, and postoperative convalescence. CONCLUSIONS The LESS TEP technique is associated with a longer operative time but offers the minor benefit of a reduction in immediate postoperative pain.","Tsai, Yao-Chou; Ho, Chen-Hsun; Tai, Huai-Ching; Chung, Shiu-Dong; Chueh, Shih-Chieh",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3116-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949480/,316
124870,Occult anterograde flow is an under-recognized but crucial predictor of early recanalization with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator.,2015,"BACKGROUND Robotic prostatectomy (RP) is now increasingly performed because it allows for precise dissection of neurovascular structures with better outcomes. It is estimated that 5-12% of candidates for radical prostatectomy have detectable inguinal hernias, and simultaneous mesh hernioplasty is now well supported. A disadvantage of radical prostatectomy is obliteration of the preperitoneal space of Bogros, which can make future totally extraperitoneal (TEP) herniorrhaphy difficult and prone to complication. METHODS Four patients underwent RP using the DaVinci system. Six clinically detectable inguinal hernias were repaired. Upon completion of the prostatectomy, the peritoneum overlying the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud was opened, the orifice was dissected free and the hernia reduced. A 3 x 6 inch polypropylene mesh or 4 x 6 inch polyester mesh was then affixed overlying the orifice with titanium tacks, and the peritoneum was closed over the mesh using a running absorbable suture. RESULTS The mean operating time for the TAP was 24 min. There were no postoperative complications. At a mean follow-up of 34 months, no recurrence was noted. CONCLUSIONS With the increasing incidence of RP, we advocate the concurrent repair of any detectable inguinal hernias at the time of prostatectomy. The preperitoneal placement of a polypropylene or polyester mesh secured with a tacking device and a peritoneal closure performed with a running absorbable suture is uniquely suited to the abilities of the robot, and provides a durable repair.","Joshi, Amit R T; Spivak, Jacob; Rubach, Eugene; Goldberg, Gary; DeNoto, George",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20812271/,316
125192,Impact of ASPECTS on computed tomography angiography source images on outcome after thrombolysis or endovascular therapy in large vessel occlusions.,2016,"BACKGROUND Diaphragm motion during spontaneous or mechanical respiration hinders image-guided percutaneous interventions of tumours in lung and upper abdomen. Motion-tracking methods can be applied but increase procedure complexity and procedure time. One-lung flooding (OLF) generates a suitable acoustic pathway to lung tumours and likely suppress diaphragm motion. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of OLF on ipsilateral diaphragm motion during contralateral one-lung ventilation. METHODS To measure the diaphragm motion, M-mode ultrasonography of the right hemidiaphragm was performed during spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, as well as after right-side lung flooding, in three pigs. Diaphragm motion was analysed using magnetic resonance images during left-side lung flooding and mechanical ventilation, in four pigs. RESULTS Double-lung ventilation increased the diaphragm movement in comparison with spontaneous breathing (17.8 ± 4.4 vs. 12.2 ± 3.4 mm, p = 0.014). Diaphragm movement on the flooded side during contralateral one-lung ventilation was significantly reduced compared to that during double-lung ventilation (3.9 ± 1.0 vs. 17.8 ± 4.4 mm, p = 0.041). By analysing the magnetic resonance images, the hemidiaphragm on the flooded side showed an average displacement of 4.2 mm, a maximum displacement of 15 mm close to the ventilated lung and no displacement at the lateral side. CONCLUSION OLF leads to a drastic reduction of diaphragm motion on the ipsilateral side which implies that targeting and motion compensation algorithms for interventions like high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of intrapulmonary and hepatic lesions might not be required.","Lesser, Thomas Günther; Schubert, Harald; Güllmar, Daniel; Reichenbach, Jürgen R; Wolfram, Frank",European journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-016-0205-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957315/,316

The infection causes prolonged hospitalization and an increased mortality risk. Observations from orthopaedic surgery showed that the suction catheter used during surgery is commonly contaminated with bacteria. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of suction catheter contamination in cardiac surgery and to study if suction time influences the contamination risk. METHODS Fifty suction catheter tips were collected during 25 aortic valve replacement operations. The suction tip was exchanged once during the operation (after aortotomy closure). The tips were subjected to bacterial contamination analysis. RESULTS In 20 of the 25 investigated cases (80%), bacterial contamination was detected on one or both tips. The tip used during the beginning of the operation showed bacterial contamination in 13/25 cases (52%) and the second tip in 12/25 (48%). In 5/25 cases (20%) both tips were contaminated. There was no association between bacterial contamination and suction time. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was the most commonly detected microorganism. CONCLUSIONS The suction device should be considered as a potential source of bacterial contamination in cardiac surgery. The results suggest that the suction catheter should be replaced before key moments like valve implantation and sternal closure.","Larsson, Johanna; Sutherland, Sofia; Söderström, Åsa; Roman-Emanuel, Christine; Jeppsson, Anders; Olofsson, Elisabeth Hansson; Svensson, Per-Arne",Patient safety in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-015-0066-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972923/,316

127166,Benefit of Intravenous Thrombolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients With High Cerebral Microbleed Burden.,2019-11-19,"BACKGROUND Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are a prevalent and serious global health issue. Wound dressings are regarded as important components of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from including hydrocolloid dressings. There is a range of different hydrocolloids available including fibrous-hydrocolloid and hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of hydrocolloid wound dressings with no dressing or alternative dressings on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. SEARCH METHODS We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 4 January 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to December Week 3 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, January 03, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 December 2011). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have compared the effects on ulcer healing of hydrocolloid with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included four studies (511 participants) in the review: these compared hydrocolloids with basic wound contact dressings, foam dressings and alginate dressings. Meta-analysis of two studies indicated no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing between fibrous-hydrocolloids and basic wound contact dressings: risk ratio 1.01 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.38). One of these studies found that a basic wound contact dressing was more cost-effective than a fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing. One study compared a hydrocolloid-matrix dressing with a foam dressing and found no statistically significant difference in the number of ulcers healed. There was no statistically significant difference in healing between an antimicrobial (silver) fibrous-hydrocolloid dressing and standard alginate dressing; or an antimicrobial dressing (iodine-impregnated) and a standard fibrous hydrocolloid dressing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently there is no research evidence to suggest that any type of hydrocolloid wound dressing is more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers than other types of dressing. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.","Dumville, Jo C; Deshpande, Sohan; O'Meara, Susan; Speak, Katharine",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009099.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22336859/,316

127689,Comparing Vessel Imaging: Noncontrast Computed Tomography/Computed Tomographic Angiography Should Be the New Minimum Standard in Acute Disabling Stroke.,2016,"Since spirit possession in mediumship and shamanism resembles psychotic symptoms, early researchers perceived spirit mediums and shamans as psychiatric patients whose psychopathology was culturally sanctioned. However, other researchers have not only challenged this assumption, but also proposed that spirit possession has transformative benefits. The idiom of spirit possession provides cultural meanings for spirit mediums and shamans to express and transform their personal experiences. The present case study focuses on dang-ki healing, a form of Chinese mediumship practiced in Singapore, in which a deity possesses a human (i.e., dang-ki) to offer aid to supplicants. This study seeks to explore whether involvement in dang-ki healing is transformative; and if so, how the dang-ki's transformation is related to his self and the perceived legitimacy of his mediumship. At a shrine, I interviewed 20 participants, including a male dang-ki, 10 temple assistants, and nine clients. The results obtained were supportive of the therapeutic nature of spirit possession. First, there is a relationship between his self-transformation and the perceived legitimacy of his mediumship. As his clients and community have recognized his spirit possession as genuine, and the healing power of his possessing god, he is able to make use of mediumship as a means for spiritual development. Second, he has developed his spirituality by internalizing his god's positive traits (e.g., compassion). Deities worshipped in dang-ki healing can be conceptualized as ideal selves who represent a wide range of positive traits and moral values of Chinese culture. Thus, the possession of a deity is the embodiment of an ideal self. Finally, the dang-ki's transformation may run parallel to his god's transformation. In Chinese religions, gods have to constantly develop their spirituality even though they are already gods. An understanding of the god's spiritual development further sheds light on the dang-ki's self-transformation.","Lee, Boon-Ooi","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-016-9497-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138277/,316

In this review, we present an overview of (1) the various types of NK cell alterations that may contribute to immune evasion in cancer patients and (2) the various strategies to improve NK cell-based anticancer immunotherapies, including pharmacologic modulation and/or genetic modification.","Devillier, Raynier; Chrétien, Anne-Sophie; Pagliardini, Thomas; Salem, Nassim; Blaise, Didier; Olive, Daniel",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.5mr0920-198rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991746/,316
128909,Thrombus composition in acute ischemic stroke: a histopathological study of thrombus extracted by endovascular retrieval.,2015,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Postoperative pancreatic fistula formation remains a source of significant morbidity following distal pancreatectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of clinically significant fistulas (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grade B and grade C) after distal pancreatectomy using a fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece (TachoComb, TachoSil) with a stapled closure. METHODS Seventy-five patients underwent distal pancreatectomy at our institution between January 2005 and March 2014. A fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece was applied to the staple line of the pancreas before stapling. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (34.7%) developed a pancreatic fistula, 8 patients (10.7%) developed a grade B fistula, and no patients developed a grade C fistula. The duration of the drain was significantly different in patients with or without a pancreatic fistula (8.0 ± 4.5 vs. 5.4 ± 1.3 days, P = .0003). Histological analysis showed that there was a tight covering with the fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece. CONCLUSION The fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece (TachoComb, TachoSil) with a stapled closure has low rates of fistula formation and provides a safe alternative to the conventional stapled technique in distal pancreatectomy.","Mita, Kazuhito; Ito, Hideto; Murabayashi, Ryo; Asakawa, Hideki; Nabetani, Masashi; Kamasako, Akira; Koizumi, Kazuya; Hayashi, Takashi",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350615580649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857807/,316

METHOD In December 2020 to February 2021, across the United Kingdom, 621 adults with ID were interviewed remotely and 348 family carers or support workers of adults with ID with greater needs completed an online survey, including a question on willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine if offered. RESULTS Eighty-seven per cent of interviewees with ID were willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine, with willingness associated with white ethnicity, having already had a flu vaccine, gaining information about COVID-19 from television but not from social media, and knowing COVID-19 social restrictions rules. A percentage of 81.7% of surveyed carers of adults with ID with greater needs reported that the person would be willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine, with willingness associated with white ethnicity, having a health condition of concern in the context of COVID-19, having had a flu vaccine, being close to someone who had died due to COVID-19, and having shielded at some point during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Reported willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine is high among adults with ID in the United Kingdom, with factors associated with willingness having clear implications for public health policy and practice.","Hatton, C; Bailey, T; Bradshaw, J; Caton, S; Flynn, S; Gillooly, A; Jahoda, A; Maguire, R; Marriott, A; Mulhall, P; Oloidi, E; Taggart, L; Todd, S; Abbott, D; Beyer, S; Gore, N; Heslop, P; Scior, K; Hastings, R P",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529314/,316
129207,Protease-antiprotease imbalance in patients with severe COVID-19.,2021-03-05,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has paralysed the livelihood of the global population by inflicting higher mortality among the affected patients. Nearly the entire human physiological system can get disrupted by the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which exemplifies the significance of discovering a potential drug target. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. This review discusses the potential for bitter taste receptors to act as drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and the use of existing bitter agonists to restore T2R function.","Kumar, S A; Cheng, Weyland",Die Pharmazie,https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2021.0840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714279/,316

Radiographically, the cysts appeared as soft tissue opacities cranial to the heart. Ultrasound revealed the masses to be thin-walled, single lumen, anechoic fluid-filled structures. One cat also had thoracic and abdominal CT performed for cancer staging; the CT revealed a well-defined, fluid-attenuating mass without peripheral contrast enhancement in the cranial mediastinum. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed acellular fluid consistent with a cyst in five cases; in one case the cyst ruptured during aspiration and no fluid was obtained. Post-aspiration, all masses were no longer visible with ultrasound or radiographs. No treatment was recommended for the cysts. Long-term follow-up (2-9 years post-diagnosis) was available in all six cats. The cysts recurred in five cats yet was never associated with clinical signs. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION Mediastinal cysts are an important benign differential for cranial mediastinal masses in cats. Treatment for the cysts does not appear to be indicated.

129657,Prediction of Early Recurrent Thromboembolic Event and Major Bleeding in Patients With Acute Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation by a Risk Stratification Schema: The ALESSA Score Study.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States and has a cost burden over $120 billion per year. Readmissions following hospitalization for diabetes are common, particularly in minority patients, who experience greater rates of complications and lower quality healthcare compared to white patients. This study examines disparities in diabetes-related readmissions in the Military Health System, a universally insured, population of 9.5 million beneficiaries, who may receive care from military (direct care) or civilian (purchased care) facilities. METHODS The study identified a population of 7,605 adult diabetic patients admitted to the hospital in 2014. Diagnostic codes were used to identify hospital readmissions, and logistic regression was used to analyze associations among race, beneficiary status, patient or sponsor's rank, and readmissions at 30, 60, and 90 days. RESULTS A total of 239 direct care patients and 545 purchased care patients were included in our analyses. After adjusting for age and sex, we found no significant difference in readmission rates for black versus white patients; however, we found a statistically significant increase in the likelihood for readmission of Native American/Alaskan Native patients compared to white patients, which persisted in direct care at 60 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 11.51, 95% CI 1.11-119.41) and 90 days (AOR 18.42, 95% CI 1.78-190.73), and in purchased care at 90 days (AOR 4.54, 95% CI 1.31-15.74). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that universal access to healthcare alleviates disparities for black patients, while Native America/Alaskan Native populations may still be at risk of disparities associated with readmissions among diabetic patients in both the closed direct care system and the civilian fee for service purchased care system.","Frankel, Dianne; Banaag, Amanda; Madsen, Cathaleen; Koehlmoos, Tracey",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633784/,316

METHODS Clinical investigations were performed in each patient, and functional evaluations, involving the swallowing of an alimentary liquid containing acetaminophen (AAP), followed by measurements of the concentrations of AAP and hormones in the sitting (n = 5) and in the supine positions (n = 5), were carried out in each group. RESULTS The post-/preoperative body weight ratios were significantly higher in the L-DT and L-JIP groups than in the L-TG group. The AAP levels were significantly lower in the LPG group than in the LTG group. The AAP, insulin, and gastrin levels in the L-JIP group were markedly increased in the sitting position compared with the supine position, while those in the L-DT and L-TG groups were stable in both positions. CONCLUSIONS L-JIP and L-DT are procedures that maintain gradual intestinal absorption and help improve the quality of life. Intestinal absorption and hormonal secretion were relatively unaffected by the posture of the meal intake after L-DT, so L-DT might be the procedure providing the most stable results.","Nomura, Eiji; Kayano, Hajime; Lee, Sang-Woong; Kawai, Masaru; Machida, Takashi; Yamamoto, Soichiro; Nabeshima, Kazuhito; Nakamura, Kenji; Mukai, Masaya; Uchiyama, Kazuhisa",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-018-1699-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159780/,316

We report a case in which BIS values were decreased, despite increased rSO2 during ligation of the IJV. A 72-year-old man was diagnosed with metastasis of renal cancer to the thyroid associated with tumor embolism in the right IJV. Thyroidectomy with total laryngectomy was performed. After right IJV ligation, right rSO2 was increased from 73 to 78 %, while the right BIS value was decreased from 40 to 27. Contralateral rSO2 and BIS values were unchanged. Right rSO2 and BIS values returned to pre-ligation values in 10 min. Ligation of the IJV might increase cerebral blood flow and ipsilateral rSO2. Physicians should use BIS values with caution during IJV ligation because a sudden decrease in the BIS value is not always associated with cerebral hypoperfusion.","Hasegawa-Moriyama, Maiko; Godai, Kohei; Yamada, Tomotsugu; Matsunaga, Akira; Kanmura, Yuichi",JA clinical reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-015-0027-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497658/,316

131060,Collateral lessons from recent acute ischemic stroke trials.,2014,"PURPOSE In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the use of self-retaining barbed sutures (SRBS) instead of conventional sutures during open partial nephrectomy leads to improved surgical outcomes. PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients who underwent open partial nephrectomy for a unicentric renal tumor was performed. In 15 patients, SRBS were used for parenchymal repair during open partial nephrectomy, and in 35 patients, conventional sutures were used. The parameters related to surgical outcomes were recorded and analysis of the total patient population and subgroup analysis according to the preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical (PADUA) score classification was performed. RESULTS The preoperative baseline values did not statistically differ between the groups. Analysis of the total patient population showed a significant difference regarding ischemia time (mean ± standard deviation) between the SRBS group (15.2 ± 6.9 min), and the conventional suture group (25.7 ± 11.8 min). There was no significant difference between the barbed and conventional sutures with regard to postoperative hemoglobin levels, decline in hemoglobin percentage, or renal function parameters. In subgroup-analysis, a significant difference in ischemia time was only found for PADUA scores 6 and 7, without any effect on the outcome parameters. CONCLUSIONS The use of SRBS in parenchymal repair during open partial nephrectomy appears to be a safe and feasible option with decreased cold ischemia time when compared with conventional sutures. In PADUA subgroup-analysis this difference was only observed for PADUA scores 6 and 7.","Schauer, Ingrid; Theimer, Oliver; Klatte, Tobias; Waldert, Matthias; Klingler, Hans-Christoph; Margreiter, Markus",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-014-0529-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652018/,316

131240,Role of infection in the development and exacerbation of asthma.,2010,"IMPORTANCE Among women and men with severe obesity, evidence for improvement in urinary incontinence beyond the first year after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is lacking. OBJECTIVES To examine change in urinary incontinence before and after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with improvement and remission among women and men in the first 3 years after bariatric surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery 2 is an observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Participants were recruited between February 21, 2005, and February 17, 2009. Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of clinical care by participating surgeons between March 14, 2006, and April 24, 2009, were followed up for 3 years (through October 24, 2012). INTERVENTION Participants undergoing bariatric surgery completed research assessments before the procedure and annually thereafter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The frequency and type of urinary incontinence episodes in the past 3 months were assessed using a validated questionnaire. Prevalent urinary incontinence was defined as at least weekly urinary incontinence episodes, and remission was defined as change from prevalent urinary incontinence at baseline to less than weekly urinary incontinence episodes at follow-up. RESULTS Of 2458 participants, 1987 (80.8%) completed baseline and follow-up assessments. At baseline, the median age was 47 years (age range, 18-78 years), the median body mass index was 46 kg/m2 (range, 34-94 kg/m2), and 1565 of 1987 (78.8%) were women. Urinary incontinence was more prevalent among women (49.3%; 95% CI, 46.9%-51.9%) than men (21.8%; 95% CI, 18.2%-26.1%) (P < .001). After a mean 1-year weight loss of 29.5% (95% CI, 29.0%-30.1%) in women and 27.0% (95% CI, 25.9%-28.6%) in men, year 1 urinary incontinence prevalence was significantly lower among women (18.3%; 95% CI, 16.4%-20.4%) and men (9.8%; 95% CI, 7.2%-13.4%) (P < .001 for all). The 3-year prevalence was higher than the 1-year prevalence for both sexes (24.8%; 95% CI, 21.8%-26.5% among women and 12.2%; 95% CI, 9.0%-16.4% among men) but was substantially lower than baseline (P < .001 for all). Weight loss was independently related to urinary incontinence remission (relative risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10 in women and 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13 in men) per 5% weight loss, as were younger age and the absence of a severe walking limitation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women and men with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with substantially reduced urinary incontinence over 3 years. Improvement in urinary incontinence may be an important benefit of bariatric surgery.","Subak, Leslee L; King, Wendy C; Belle, Steven H; Chen, Jia-Yuh; Courcoulas, Anita P; Ebel, Faith E; Flum, David R; Khandelwal, Saurabh; Pender, John R; Pierson, Sheila K; Pories, Walter J; Steffen, Kristine J; Strain, Gladys W; Wolfe, Bruce M; Huang, Alison J",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.2609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26098620/,316

METHODS We conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic variables, working conditions, family dynamics, and mental health variables in nurses working in healthcare settings, in Portugal, during the Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS Portuguese nurses presented higher depression, anxiety and stress levels, when compared to the Portuguese general population, during the outbreak. Overall, nurses who did not consider the quantity and quality of personal protective equipment as adequate presented significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.

The interventions were delivered following the patient receiving an initial ICD implant. Partner health outcomes were examined longitudinally from baseline at hospital discharge to 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcomes included 6 measures: partner physical and mental health status (Short-Form-36 PCS and MCS), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), caregiver burden (Oberst Caregiver Burden Scale), and self-efficacy in ICD management (Sudden Cardiac Arrest Self-efficacy scale). Growth mixture and mixed effect modeling were used to identify and compare trajectories of 6 health outcomes within the P-only and P + P arms of the study. Partners (n = 301) were on average 62 years old, female (74.1%) and Caucasian (83.4%), with few co-morbidities (mean Charlson Co-morbidity index, 0.72 ± 1.1). Two types of profiles were observed for P-only and P + P, one profile where patterns of health outcomes were generally better across 12 months and one with outcome patterns that were generally worse across time. For PCS, no significant partner differences were observed between P-only or P + P in either the better (p = 0.067) or the worse (p = 0.129) profile types. Compared to P-only, partners in the worse profile improved significantly over 12 months in MCS (p = 0.006), caregiver burden P + P (p = 0.004) and self-efficacy P + P (p = 0.041). Compared to P-only, P + P partners in the low anxiety profile improved significantly (p = 0.001) at 3 months. Partners with more psychosocial distress at hospital discharge benefited most from the P + P intervention. Among partners with generally low levels of anxiety, those in the P + P intervention compared to P-only showed greater improvement in anxiety over 12 months.","Auld, Jonathan P; Thompson, Elaine A; Dougherty, Cynthia M",Journal of behavioral medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-021-00223-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974172/,316

Aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between validated predictive scores for VTE such as IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD and: (1) Intensification of Care (IoC, admission to Pulmonology Department or Intensive Care Unit) (2) in-hospital mortality rate 3) 30-days mortality rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 51 adult patients with laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and calculated IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD scores. All patients underwent venous color-Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs to assess the presence of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with normal values of D-dimer did not receive heparin therapy (LMWH); patients with ≥ 4 ULN values of D-dimer or with a diagnosis of DVT were treated with therapeutic LMWH dosage, while the remaining patients were treated with prophylactic LMWH dosages. RESULTS We found strong relations between IMPROVE score and the need for IoC and with the in-hospital mortality rate and between the IMPROVEDD score and the need for IoC. We defined that an IMPROVE score greater than 4 points was significantly associated to in-hospital mortality rate (p = 0.05), while an IMPROVEDD score greater than 3 points was associated with the need for IoC (p = 0.04). Multivariate logistic analysis showed how IMPROVE score was significantly associated to in-hospital and 30-days mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS IMPROVE score can be considered an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30-days mortality.","Greco, S; Zenunaj, G; Bonsi, B; Bella, A; Lopreiato, M; Luciani, F; Pedrini, D; Vestita, G; Dalla Nora, E; Passaro, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_25118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660832/,316

A 79-year-old patient presented with stomachache and nausea. Computerized tomography showed pelvic cysts on either side of the pelvis. The right tumor was 120×100 mm, and the left tumor was 45×35 mm. Our diagnosis was bilateral ovarian tumors and we performed laparoscopic tumor resection. In the abdominal cavity, we saw that the left ovary was swollen by about 3-4 cm and the right ovary was normal size. There was a mucous cyst located in the right retroperitoneal cavity that adhered around and bordered the right external iliac vein and the right obturator nerve. We peeled the adhesion away carefully and resected the tumor but the operation caused temporary obturator nerve paralysis. From pathological examination, we diagnosed the right retroperitoneal cyst to be venous ACD originating from the right external iliac vein. We found that venous ACD can grow as large as a pelvic tumor and is difficult to distinguish from an ovarian tumor, which is why we chose laparoscopic surgery. In this case, we performed the operation laparoscopically and no sequelae or recurrent tumor appeared during a 1-year follow-up. However, graft replacement is sometimes necessary for ACD, thus venous ACD should be considered a differential diagnosis and a surgical strategy should be developed when pelvic tumors are observed.","Higami, Shota; Ueda, Taeko; Sakakibara, Yu; Tohyama, Atsushi; Harada, Hiroshi; Kurita, Tomoko; Kagami, Seiji; Matsuura, Yusuke; Yoshino, Kiyoshi",Journal of UOEH,https://doi.org/10.7888/juoeh.42.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213742/,316
132382,Does Sex Modify the Effect of Endovascular Treatment for Ischemic Stroke?,2019,"BACKGROUND The nature of the COVID-19 pandemic forced several nations to impose country-wide lockdowns. The lockdown impacted several aspects of life including the economy. Food security became a growing concern for many households. AIM The aim of the study was to explore the diet diversity of urban households in India during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS Information regarding socioeconomic status (SES), family size and information regarding availability and access to food were gathered from 450 households. Diet diversity was assessed using a 69-item food frequency questionnaire. Food variety scores (FVS) were computed for individual food groups and overall. RESULTS The majority of the households (86.4%) belonged to the upper-middle or upper SES. Households did not experience any constraints in accessibility and availability of food except the meat group. Overall, 84% of the households had low FVS for most of the food groups except for sugar and milk and milk products. The household SES score was positively associated with the milk FVS (B = 0.039, p = 0.020) and negatively with the fat FVS (B = -0.062, p < 0.001). The number of adults (B = 6.773, p < 0.001) in the household positively predicted the FVS of cereal, vegetable, fruit, fat and total FVS. CONCLUSIONS The higher SES households in urban India did not experience food insecurity. Despite this, their poor diet diversity is a serious cause for concern, especially in the wake of the evolving pandemic. This highlights the need to promote consumption of a diverse variety of foods.","Aneesh, Mitravinda; Patil, Rita S",Nutrition and health,https://doi.org/10.1177/02601060211019676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041988/,316
132440,A Composite Measure for Quality of Care in Patients with Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis Using Textbook Outcome.,2020-07-27,"BACKGROUND Low tibial valgization osteotomy with medial opening wedge (LTO) is generally indicated for ankle arthritis with a small talar tilt (TT). We addressed the following research questions: the efficacy of LTO for more significant varus ankle arthritis, the effect of additional inframalleolar correction followed by LTO, and the preoperative or operation-related factors influencing postoperative TT decrease. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the radiographic and clinical findings of 31 patients with more significant varus ankle arthritis (≥8 degrees) who underwent LTO or LTO plus inframalleolar correction. We grouped the included patients according to combination with inframalleolar correction and postoperative decreased TT. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors influencing postoperative TT decrease. RESULTS Even though the mean TT was unchanged postoperatively (from 12.1 to 9.9 degrees, P = .052), clinical parameters were significantly increased. In the group with concomitant inframalleolar correction, we found that TT was more corrected (3.9 vs 1.8 degrees, P = .023) with a greater lateralization of the talar center and a greater correction of the hindfoot alignment to valgus. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between postoperative decreased TT and preoperative talar center migration (P = .016), hindfoot alignment angle (P = .033), hindfoot moment arm (P = .041), and hindfoot alignment ratio (P = .016). CONCLUSION LTO in more significant varus ankle arthritis could result in clinical improvement, although TT was not significantly changed. We recommend adding inframalleolar correction after LTO for the patients with more significant varus ankle arthritis.

132483,Time to Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Stroke-Reply.,2017,"BACKGROUND Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare stroke subtype with high mortality rates. Best BAO reperfusion strategy is still controversial. OBJECTIVE We aim to describe outcomes of BAO patients submitted to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in a comprehensive stroke center in Brazil and analyze which previous published computed tomography angiography (CTA) collateral score better predict functional outcomes. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive BAO patients. CTA was used to evaluate the posterior circulation collateral score (PC-CS), the basilar artery on CTA score, and for the presence of posterior communicating arteries. A favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Score ≤3 at 90-days. After univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify if any collateral score independently predicts favorable outcomes. RESULTS Between January 2011 and April 2017, 27 (85% male) BAO patients with median NIHSS 26 (IQR 15-32) were identified. Twenty-five (93%) patients were treated with MT devices, and only 2 (7%) patients were treated with angioplasty and stenting. Successful recanalization rate was 85%, and only 1 (3.7%) patient had symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Favorable outcomes were reached in 10 (37%) patients. In univariate analysis, female sex, NIHSS, Glasgow coma scale, mild-to-moderate symptoms on admission, onset-to-groin time, and PC-CS predicted favorable outcomes. In multivariate analysis, PC-CS (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10-2.60; p = 0.016) and NIHSS (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.77-0.93; p = 0.001) remained the only independent predictors of favorable outcomes. The PC-CS AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.62-0.98; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS MT is a promising strategy for BAO treatment. Among collateral scores, PC-CS was the only independent predictor of favorable outcomes in the present study.","Antunes Dias, Francisco; Castro-Afonso, Luis Henrique; Zanon Zotin, Maria Clara; Alessio-Alves, Frederico Fernandes; Martins Filho, Rui Kleber do Vale; Camilo, Millene Rodrigues; Nakiri, Guilherme Seizem; Abud, Daniel Giansante; Pontes-Neto, Octavio Marques",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000502083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434074/,316
132492,The smoking paradox in ischemic stroke patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis in combination with mechanical thrombectomy-VISTA-Endovascular.,2021,"Annexin A2 (p36) is usually present together with its natural ligand p11 as a heterotetramer complex, which has multiple biological functions depending on its cellular localization. However, the detailed mechanism of annexin A2 translocation and its physiological role in inflammation remain unclear. Here, we show that IFN-γ stimulation enhances surface translocation of annexin A2 on lung epithelial cells. While total annexin A2 protein remains unchanged, the expression of p11 is upregulated via the IFN-γ-activated JAK2/STAT1 signal pathway. Notably, IFN-γ-induced p11 expression is required for annexin A2 translocation to the cell surface. Since annexin A2 lacks a signal peptide for surface translocation by the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi route, its mode of trafficking remains unclear. We observed that p11-dependent surface translocation of annexin A2 is associated with the exosomal secretion pathway. The IFN-γ-induced increase of annexin A2 in the exosomes is blocked in p11-silenced cells. Furthermore, IFN-γ-induced surface expression of annexin A2 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by lung epithelial cells. These findings provide insights into the surface translocation mechanism of annexin A2 and illustrate a pivotal function of surface annexin A2 in the phagocytic response to IFN-γ.","Fang, Yi-Ting; Lin, Chiou-Feng; Wang, Chi-Yun; Anderson, Robert; Lin, Yee-Shin",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.23026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21928315/,316

133125,Jejunal varices diagnosed by capsule endoscopy in patients with post-liver transplant portal hypertension.,2017,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy of internal fixation versus hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. METHODS A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2020. The present study compared internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. RevMan5.3 software provided by the International Cochrane Group was used for the meta-analysis. To compare the differences in the operation time, intraoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay, superficial infection, Harris hip score, mortality within 1 year, mortality within 2 years, reoperation, incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), partial weight-bearing time, non-union, and implant-related complications between an internal fixation group and an hemiarthroplasty group. RESULTS A total of 1300 patients were included in nine studies. The results showed that the operation time (MD = -18.09, 95% CI: -27.85--8.34, P = 0.0003), intraoperative bleeding (MD = -195.31, 95% CI: -244.8--147.74, P < 0.0001), implant-related complications (MD = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.74-8.45, P = 0.0008), and partial weight-bearing time (MD = 17.21, 95% CI: 1.63-32.79, P = 0.03) have statistical significance. However, there is not statistical significance for the Harris hip joint function scale (HHS) (MD = 5.60, 95% CI: -1.13-12.33, P = 0.10), DVT (MD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.45-2.27, P = 0.97), length of hospital stay (MD = -1.08, 95% CI: -2.82-0.66, P = 0.22), superficial Infection (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.43-1.98, P = 0.89), mortality within 1 year (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.48, P = 0.81), mortality within 2 years (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.61-1.43, P = 0.75), reoperation (MD = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.64-5.04, P = 0.26), and non-union (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.48-3.03, P = 0.70). The result of the subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between the less than 2 years follow-up and the 2 years or more follow-up group. The only difference was for the Harris hip score: the internal fixation group was superior to the hemiarthroplasty group in the less than 2 years subgroup analysis, while there was no difference between the internal fixation group hemiarthroplasty group in the 2 years or more subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION Compared with the internal fixation group, those in the hemiarthroplasty group could carry out weight-bearing training early and implant-related complications were reduced, but it requires longer operation time and there is greater intraoperative blood loss. There is no difference in mortality, the incidence of DVT, non-union, HHS, reoperation, length of hospital stay, and superficial infection. Hemiarthroplasty may be a better choice for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly.","Tu, Dong-Peng; Liu, Zheng; Yu, Yi-Kang; Xu, Chao; Shi, Xiao-Lin",Orthopaedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/os.12736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691520/,316

METHODS Forty 4-week-old male rats weighing 115-125 g were randomly divided into BPA-treated, DBP-treated group, BPA+DBP-treated and control groups and fed with a soy- and alfalfa-free diet containing 285.4 ppm BPA, 285.4 ppm DBP, 285.4 ppm BPA plus 285.4 ppm DBP, and a control diet, respectively, for 90 consecutive days. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination via the carotid artery under diethyl etherane aesthesia and weighed. Organs, including liver, kidneys, spleen, thymus, heart, brain, and testis underwent pathological examination. The androgen receptor (AR), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR), and progesterone hormone receptor (PR) genes from the hypothalamus were detected by real-time PCR. The biomedical parameters were analyzed. RESULTS No significant difference was found in food intake, body weight, tissue weight, organ/brain weight ratio, and biomedical parameters among the four groups (P>0.05). However, BPA and DBP up-regulated AR, PR and GNRHR expression levels in rats and showed a synergistic or an additive effect in the BPA+DBP group. CONCLUSION The combined subchronic toxicity of BPA and DBP is synergistic or additive in male SD rats.","Zhang, Wen Zhong; Yong, Ling; Jia, Xu Dong; Li, Ning; Fan, Yong Xiang",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,https://doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2013.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294617/,316
133299,Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: a practical approach.,2021-04-22,"Background Anemia is common in cardiac surgery affecting 25-40% of patients and associated with increased blood transfusions, morbidity, mortality, and higher hospital costs. Higher rates of stroke, acute renal injury, and total number of adverse postoperative outcomes have also been reported to be associated with preoperative anemia. This systematic review assessed the current evidence for preoperative intravenous iron on major outcomes following cardiac surgery. Methods Outcome measures included postoperative hemoglobin, transfusion rates, major adverse events, and mortality. The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and articles were identified using PubMed, Cochrane, CLINAHL, WOS, and EMBASE databases. Articles were included if they compared patients with and without preoperative anemia based on treatment with intravenous iron. Quality was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and strength of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Results Of the articles reviewed, six met inclusion criteria. These included four randomized double-blind prospective cohort studies, one randomized non-blinded prospective study, and one non-randomized non-blinded prospective study with historical control. Across studies, 1,038 patients were enrolled. Two studies showed higher hemoglobin with iron therapy, and only one study showed significant differences in multiple outcomes such as transfusion and morbidity. Conclusions Given the paucity of studies and biases within them, the current evidence for treatment with intravenous iron prior to cardiac surgery is weak. More evidence is needed to support the administration of preoperative intravenous iron in cardiac surgery patients.","Tankard, Kelly A; Park, Brian; Brovman, Ethan Y; Bader, Angela M; Urman, Richard D",Journal of hematology,https://doi.org/10.14740/jh696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224389/,316

We herein characterized the colonic microbiota of diarrheal early-weaning piglets infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Campylobacter. Campylobacter infection significantly decreased species richness and Shannon diversity index of colonic microbiota together with a significant increase in the proportion of Campylobacter and Enterobacteriaceae, whereas no significant difference on the above indexes was observed in piglets infected with PCV2 compared with healthy piglets. PCV2 and Campylobacter infection could disturb the homeostasis of colonic microbiota through deterioration of ecological network within microbial community, and specially Campylobacter performed as a module hub in ecological networks. The microbial dysbiosis caused metabolic dysfunction and led to a remarkable reduction in production of short chain fatty acids, following by a higher pH level in colon cavity. Campylobacter infection disturbed the function of colonic tract barrier observed in terms of significant lower relative expression of claudin-1, occluding, and zonula occludens protein-1 genes, and PCV2 infection induced intestinal inflammation together with a higher permeability of colon. Generally, these results suggested that PCV2 and Campylobacter infection could induce microbial dysbiosis and metabolic dysfunction, and cause intestinal disorder, all of which finally were associated to contribute to the diarrhea of early-weaning piglets.","Yang, Gang; Yan, Yali; Zhang, Li; Ruan, Zheng; Hu, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Shuo; Li, Xiaozhen",Animal nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33005770/,316

DESIGN We reviewed vital statistics data to identify deaths registered in Los Angeles County between March 15, 2020, and August 15, 2020. Deaths with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 listed as an immediate or underlying cause of death were classified as PIC deaths. Expected deaths were calculated using negative binomial regression. Excess mortality was determined by subtracting the expected from the observed number of weekly deaths. The Department of Public Health conducts surveillance for COVID-19-associated deaths: persons who died of nontraumatic/nonaccidental causes within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test result were classified as confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Deaths without a reported positive SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction result were classified as probable COVID-19 deaths if COVID-19 was listed on their death certificate or the death occurred 60 to 90 days of a positive test. We compared excess PIC deaths with the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths ascertained by surveillance. SETTING Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS Residents of Los Angeles County who died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Excess mortality. RESULTS There were 7208 excess all-cause and 5128 excess PIC deaths during the study period. The Department of Public Health also reported 5160 confirmed and 323 probable COVID-19-associated deaths. CONCLUSIONS The number of excess PIC deaths estimated by our model was approximately equal to the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths identified by surveillance. This suggests our surveillance definition for confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths might be sufficiently sensitive for capturing the true burden of deaths caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19.","Traub, Elizabeth; Amoon, Aryana T; Rollin-Alamillo, Louise; Haddix, Meredith; Poortinga, Kathleen; Ibrahim, Mireille; Feregrino, Gustavo; Foo, Chelsea; Itano, Alison; Lee, Rebecca; Fisher, Rebecca; Jarashow, Claire; Balter, Sharon; Gounder, Prabhu",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762539/,316

Since then, new devices and techniques have been developed to improve the efficacy and safety of RDN procedures. Sham-controlled trials using second-generation RDN devices (radiofrequency- and ultrasound-based) have provided solid evidence for their BP-lowering efficacy with and without the use of concomitant antihypertensive medication. Moreover, the safety profile of RDN in several registries and clinical trials appears to be excellent.

Through an established academic-practice partnership, pre-licensure nursing students were able to fill this new Patient Services Aid role. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the students' experiences in this mutually beneficial innovative role. METHODS Electronic surveys and qualitative focus groups were used to evaluate the students' experiences. RESULTS A total of 34 students were employed at the health system as PSAs. Focus groups (n = 16) analysis showed that, while the role was not a substitute for academic clinical experiences, they did improve the students' confidence in the clinical setting and helped teach necessary non-technical skills. Students appreciated the ability to network with multiple disciplines while working as PSAs. CONCLUSIONS This role was developed to assist with immediate COVID-19 needs; however, this model of using pre-licensure students in non-clinical roles can improve students' non-technical skills and confidence in the clinical setting. The success of the activity was due to the strong relationships between the School of Nursing and health system. Other schools of nursing could benefit from developing collaborative partnerships with local healthcare systems.","Howard, Valerie; Hartman, Ann Michelle; Allen, Deborah H; Reynolds, Staci S",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020286/,316

This study assesses access to personal protective equipment (PPE), availability of adequate information about PPE use, self-reported ability to correctly wear and remove (donning and doffing) PPE, and risk perceptions associated with COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in Pakistan. Using a structured and validated questionnaire, an online survey was conducted from May 9 to June 5, 2020. Responses were received from 453 healthcare workers. Of these, 218 (48.12%) were doctors, 183 (40.40%) were nurses, and 52 (11.48%) were paramedical staff. Only 129 (28.48%) healthcare workers reported having adequate access to PPE at all times, whereas 156 (34.44%) never had access to PPE and 168 (37.09%) had access to PPE occasionally. Lack of access to PPE led the majority (71.74%) of healthcare workers to use coping strategies such as reuse of N95 and surgical masks. A total of 312 (68.87%) respondents believed that the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the work environment was high and the majority (62.69%) adopted precautionary measures at home to keep their families safe. A significantly high (n = 233, 51.43%, P = .03) number of respondents reported self-medicating. Of all the respondents, only 136 (30.02%) were tested for COVID-19 at least once, of which 32 (23.53%) ever tested positive. These findings suggest that healthcare workers in Pakistan had limited access to PPE. Adequate provision and training is vital to protect the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hakim, Muhammad; Khattak, Farhad Ali; Muhammad, Shahzad; Ismail, Muhammad; Ullah, Naeem; Atiq Orakzai, Muhammad; Ulislam, Siraj; Ul-Haq, Zia",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33175583/,316

It understands these interfaces as structuring elements of the process and relativizes the simplification strategies expressed in ""silver bullets"" - usually an industrial health product.

He received 50 Gray (Gy) of preoperative external beam radiation. Radical resection resulted in a 15 × 10 cm defect. Nine brachytherapy catheters were placed, and a pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was used in reconstruction. Final pathology confirmed myxofibrosarcoma, high grade. The tumor was <1 mm from 2 margins. A total of 17.5 Gy of brachytherapy was delivered to the surgical bed from postoperative days 7 to 9. The flap developed fat necrosis distally which eventually required surgical debridement on postoperative day 58. It subsequently healed well and maintained good function of the limb. The patient remains under surveillance without evidence of recurrence.","Lane, Jordan D; Pomahac, Bohdan; Raut, Chandrajit P; Baldini, Elizabeth H; Devlin, Phillip M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

STUDY DESIGN Experimental anatomic study. ANIMALS Cadaveric canine pelves (n = 8). METHODS Transverse plane computed tomographic images of cadaveric pelves with intact sacroiliac joints, mounted in a custom jig, were made (baseline) and again after DPO (20°, 25°, 30°) and TPO (20°) and pelvic angles measured in 6 transverse planes. Pelvic angles of the 3 DPO techniques were compared with TPO using concordance correlation to determine which DPO angle resulted in an acetabular ventroversion angle closest to TPO. RESULTS Mean ± SD AAs were 32.89 ± 2.23 (baseline), 47.39 ± 4.39 (20° DPO), 51.43 ± 5.06 (25° DPO), 54.75 ± 4.38 (30° DPO), and 50.20 ± 5.76 (20° TPO). Concordance correlations for the AA compared with 20° TPO were 0.027 (baseline), 0.721 (20° DPO), 0.902 (25° DPO), and 0.593 (30° DPO). A concordance correlation of ≥ 0.8 indicates good correlation.

We compared a single surgeon's experience transitioning from one technique to the other and examined the operative outcomes and EOR between microscopic versus endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. METHODS Retrospective data analysis of adult patients who were treated surgically for a pituitary adenoma between August 2005 and May 2015 by a single neurosurgeon, who was originally trained and practiced in the microscopic transsphenoidal approach. Patient demographics, perioperative conditions, tumor characteristics, operative times, volumetric EOR, postoperative outcome, and the endoscopic learning curve were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred and nine patients underwent microscopic transsphenoidal surgery and 275 patients underwent a fully endoscopic approach. The patient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Operative room time was significantly shorter in the endoscopic group than in the microscopic group (180.2 vs. 215.6 minutes; P < 0.001). The endoscopic and microscopic groups had similar volumetric EOR (85.1% vs. 82.8%; P = 0.371) as well as residual tumor volume (1.06 cm3 vs. 1.15 cm3; P = 0.765). The mean length of hospital stay was 2.4 days in the endoscopic group and 3.2 days in the microscopic group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS During the transition from the microscopic to the endoscopic approach, similar surgical outcomes and EOR were achieved in the 2 cohorts. In our experience, the endoscopic approach offers the advantage of shorter operative times and lengths of hospital stays after the surgeon has developed more experience with the technique.","Eseonu, Chikezie I; ReFaey, Karim; Rincon-Torroella, Jordina; Garcia, Oscar; Wand, Gary S; Salvatori, Roberto; Quinones-Hinojosa, Alfredo",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742515/,316

As a result, an extensive array of progressively more minimally invasive techniques now exists in the urologist's armamentarium, including smaller ('mini') incisions, laparoscopic hand-assisted surgery, as well as pure laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Theoretically, smaller incisions result in decreased pain and subsequently accelerated convalescence postoperatively. Most recently, innovative surgeons across multiple surgical specialties have pioneered the concept of eliminating incisions altogether and operating through natural orifices, which has been termed natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). The improved cosmesis associated with a pure NOTES approach is an attractive option for patients undergoing invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. NOTES has significant potential for use by urological surgeons, as evidenced by multiple studies demonstrating the feasibility of pure and hybrid NOTES procedures in cadaveric, animal and human subjects. The purpose of this paper is to review the rationale for NOTES in urological surgery, and to detail the current limitations of this new technique.","Granberg, Candace F; Gettman, Matthew T",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2010.09668.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883243/,316

137155,Ischemic Stroke After Treatment of Intraprocedural Thrombosis During Stent-Assisted Coiling and Flow Diversion.,2017,"BACKGROUND Optimization of factors affecting aerosol delivery during mechanical ventilation in the pediatric population is important. We hypothesized that increasing the tidal volume (V(T)), using a vibrating mesh nebulizer, and placing the nebulizer at the ventilator would increase lung dose/delivery efficiency. METHODS Continuous-output jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers loaded with albuterol (2.5 mg/3 mL) were compared when placed before the Y-piece and at the ventilator. The model consisted of a ventilator operated in pressure-regulated volume control ventilation mode at a breathing frequency of 20 breaths/min, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, FIO2 of 0.4, inspiratory time of 0.75 s, and bias flow of 0.5 L/min with a humidifier (37 ± 1.5°C) and an adult heated-wired circuit. V(T) values of 100, 150, 200, and 300 mL were studied. The circuit was connected in series to a 5.5-mm inner diameter endotracheal tube with a filter (lung dose) interposed between them. Delivery efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the nominal dose captured on the filter. Albuterol content was analyzed by spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS No differences in lung dose/delivery efficiency were found at different V(T) values for the jet nebulizer (both positions) and the vibrating mesh nebulizer (ventilator). Lung dose/delivery efficiency was higher (P < .02) at a VT of 100 mL compared with the other volumes tested. The vibrating mesh nebulizer had higher lung dose/delivery efficiency compared with the jet nebulizer only when placed before the Y-piece. Moving the nebulizers from before the Y-piece to the ventilator increased lung dose/delivery efficiency for all conditions tested except the vibrating mesh nebulizer at a V(T) of 100 mL (P = .36). CONCLUSIONS Optimization of inhaled drug delivery during pediatric mechanical ventilation should include careful selection of the type of delivery device and its placement in the ventilator circuit. Increasing V(T) during nebulization did not increase lung dose/delivery efficiency.","Berlinski, Ariel; Willis, J Randy",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25969513/,316

Oxytocin, a neuromodulating hormone, may influence these functions and could be valuable for the treatment of AN. OBJECTIVE The current study aimed at reviewing the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on attentional bias (AB) and emotion recognition (ER) in AN. METHODS A systematic literature review was done for free-text and the MeSH-terms: anorexia nervosa, feeding and eating disorders, and oxytocin. Six publications, reporting from 4 unique clinical trials, were included in this review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of IN-OT on AB towards food images and ER on healthy controls (HC) and patients with AN. RESULTS Overall, IN-OT did not influence AB towards food images (effect size = 0.20 [- 0.16, 0.57], p = 0.28) and had no effect on ER (effect size = - 0.01 [- 0.27, 0.26], p = 0.97) in patients with AN and healthy control (HC) subjects collectively. Assessing HC and AN separately in subgroup analyses did not show any significant effect on AB and ER in neither of the subgroups. All tests were done between 15 and 55 min post-administration of IN-OT, while peak concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has been determined to be at 75 min. CONCLUSION The current level of evidence is moderate showing no effect of IN-OT on AB or ER in AN. However, brain exposure may not have been sufficient which future studies with IN-OT need to ensure by considering dose and dose-to-task interval.","Hasselbalch, Katharina Collin; Lanng, Klara Rasmussen; Birkeland, Margrete; Sjögren, Magnus",Psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-020-05626-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809046/,316

Radical surgical resection by extra-pleural pneumonectomy combined with hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy has shown to improve patient survival and better microscopic tumour control. Anaesthetic management of this procedure is challenging due to the complex pathophysiological changes associated with prolonged duration of surgery, one- lung ventilation, haemodynamic instability due to major blood loss, temperature variations including heat loss during pneumonectomy and rapid rise in temperature during hyperthermic chemotherapy, cardiac arrhythmias due to exposure to heated chemotherapeutics, cisplatin toxicity and acid-base changes. Intra-operative management involves protective ventilation, regulation of temperature and haemodynamics along with prevention of complications associated with 'heated chemotherapeutics'.

137629,Could a Pragmatic Detection Strategy Be the Gateway for Effective Population Health for CKD?,2020-08-24,"Microtropia describes a primary ocular deviation of less than 10 prism diopters associated with harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence and reduced stereopsis. It is routinely accepted that children with microtropia are less likely to achieve equal vision following occlusion therapy than those with bifoveal fixation. The most commonly used methods of diagnosing a microtropia are the 4 diopter prism test (4∆PT) and assessment of ocular fixation. This study examines the agreement between the two tests. One hundred and twelve typically developing children without a manifest strabismus who were able to undertake a linear visual acuity test and had two or more lines of anisoacuity following refractive adaption to their full cycloplegic correction underwent assessment of the 4∆PT and ocular fixation along with their routine orthoptic examination. One hundred and twelve children (46 boys and 66 girls) attending the Orthoptic department who fitted the above criteria were included in the analysis. The mean age at examination was 6 years. 80.3% had anisometropia of at least 1.25 diopters. The 4∆PT indicated a microtropia in 74 cases, whereas assessment of fixation indicated a microtropia in 68 cases. In 88 cases (78.6%), the results of the two tests agreed. Analysis found only moderate agreement between the two tests (k = 0.540 (CI 0.379-0.700)). Logistic regression analysis comparing those children where the two tests agreed with those where they disagreed found no difference in the level of anisoacuity (p = 0.7823), degree of anisometropia (p = 0.9385), the vision in the worst eye (p = 0.5260), the refractive error in the ""worst"" eye (p = 0.865), or the age at the time of testing (p = 0.4485) between the two groups. When assessing for a microtropia, it was found that not all children who elicit a central suppression response on the 4∆PT are found to be fixing eccentrically and vice versa. This could potentially have implications for the treatment of their amblyopia. It is important not to rely on just one test at one time to make the diagnosis of microtropia. Rather, if one or other test indicates a microtropia the first time they are attempted, this should be reassessed regularly as treatment progresses and certainly before treatment is stopped and suboptimal visual acuity is accepted.","Garretty, Tess",Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2021.1914675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886409/,316

138055,Predictors of Mortality in Acute Ischemic Stroke Intervention: Analysis of the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke Registry.,2015,"Introduction In ischaemic stroke care, fast reperfusion is essential for disability free survival. It is unknown if bypassing thrombolysis centres in favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership) outweighs transport to the nearest thrombolysis centre for alteplase and then transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (drip-and-ship). We use conditional probability modelling to determine the impact of treatment times on transport decision-making for acute ischaemic stroke. Materials and methods Probability of good outcome was modelled using a previously published framework, data from the Irish National Stroke Register, and an endovascular thrombectomy registry at a tertiary referral centre in Ireland. Ireland was divided into 139 regions, transport times between each region and hospital were estimated using Google's Distance Matrix Application Program Interface. Results were mapped using ArcGIS 10.3. Results Using current treatment times, drip-and-ship rarely predicts best outcomes. However, if door to needle times are reduced to 30 min, drip-and-ship becomes more favourable; even more so if turnaround time (time from thrombolysis to departure for the endovascular thrombectomy centre) is also reduced. Reducing door to groin puncture times predicts better outcomes with the mothership model. Discussion This is the first case study modelling pre-hospital transport for ischaemic stroke utilising real treatment times in a defined geographic area. A moderate improvement in treatment times results in significant predicted changes to the optimisation of a national acute stroke patient transport strategy. Conclusions Modelling patient transport for system-level planning is sensitive to treatment times at both thrombolysis and thrombectomy centres and has important implications for the future planning of thrombectomy services.","Holodinsky, Jessalyn K; Patel, Alka B; Thornton, John; Kamal, Noreen; Jewett, Lauren R; Kelly, Peter J; Murphy, Sean; Collins, Ronan; Walsh, Thomas; Cronin, Simon; Power, Sarah; Brennan, Paul; O'hare, Alan; McCabe, Dominick Jh; Moynihan, Barry; Looby, Seamus; Wyse, Gerald; McCormack, Joan; Marsden, Paul; Harbison, Joseph; Hill, Michael D; Williams, David",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987318759362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008345/,316

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate PCT levels in severe COVID-19 patients. We searched Embase, ProQuest, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and ISI/Web of Science for studies that reported the level of PCT of patient with severe COVID-19. We included all studies regardless of design that reported the level of PCT in patients with severe COVID-19. We excluded articles not regarding COVID-19 or not reporting PCT level, studies not in severe patients, review articles, editorials or letters, expert opinions, comments, and animal studies.

139105,Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and renal artery stenting: an evolving therapeutic option.,2011,"Chronic disease is a growing concern for research, policy and clinical care. While the global burden of HIV for transgender populations has been comprehensively covered in recent systematic reviews, the same is not true for the burden of other chronic disease. The objective of this study was to review the literature on non-HIV chronic disease burden for transgender populations worldwide. A systematic review was conducted of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LGBT Life bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed scientific studies with non-HIV chronic disease prevalence data for transgender populations published any date up to February 15, 2019 without restriction on country or study design. A total of 93 studies and 665 datapoints were included in this review, comprising 48 distinct chronic disease outcomes in seven groups (cancer, cerebro/cardiovascular conditions, chronic liver and kidney disease, mental health and substance use conditions, metabolic and endocrine disorders, musculoskeletal and brain disorders, respiratory conditions, and unspecified and other conditions). The empirical literature on chronic disease among global transgender populations focuses on mental health morbidity, demonstrating an evidence gap on chronic physical health morbidity, particularly beyond that of sexual health. This review identified important gaps including in age-related conditions, inflammation-related disease and studies designed explicitly to investigate chronic disease burden among transgender populations. There is a need for high quality evidence in this area, including longitudinal population-based studies with appropriate comparison groups, and consistent measurement of both transgender status and chronic conditions.","Rich, Ashleigh J; Scheim, Ayden I; Koehoorn, Mieke; Poteat, Tonia",Preventive medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335828/,316

139468,Differences in the basilar artery bifurcation angle among patients who present with a ruptured aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery and patients with perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage: a retrospective cross-sectional study.,2013,"Introduction Recurrent hernias can be treated by laparoscopy without the need for mesh removal. However, shrinkage of the mesh following recurrence affects most of the patients, and leaving a partially floating and rigid foreign body could be discussed. Aim To compare the outcomes of patients regarding the removal of previous mesh during laparoscopic repair of recurrent abdominal wall hernias. Material and methods Patients who underwent laparoscopic repair for recurrent ventral hernias between August 2012 and March 2015 were included in the study. The patients with complete removal of the mesh were included in the MR group and the patients with partial removal or without removal of the previous mesh were included in the non-MR group. Patient characteristics and demographics, previous hernia repair, defect size, mesh size, operative time, mean hospital stay, complications, recurrences, numeric pain rating scale (NRS), early termination of analgesics and prolonged use of analgesics were compared. Results A total of 112 patients with a mean age of 53.2 and mean body mass index of 31.1 kg/m2 underwent laparoscopic repair. There were 47 patients in the MR group and 54 patients in the non-MR group. Operative time was shorter in the non-MR group (p < 0.05), whereas symptomatic seroma and NRS scores on postoperative day 10 and at the 6th week were higher in comparison with the MR group (p < 0.05). Conclusions Mesh removal during laparoscopic repair of recurrent ventral hernias has an association with the reduction of pain and symptomatic seroma. However, further prospective comparative studies are required to verify this view.","Sikar, Hasan Ediz; Çetin, Kenan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2019.85350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534565/,316

Methods: A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19. Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women with COVID-19. Results: (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type. No one has progressed to critical pneumonia. The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38.7±1.4) and (37.9±1.6) weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P> 0.05). Also, there wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all P>0.05). (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women with COVID-19 were collected. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative. There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all P>0.05). (3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7), the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). Conclusions: If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia. Preventive use of long-acting uterotonic agents could reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage during surgery. 2019-nCoV infection has not been found in neonates deliverd from pregnant women with COVID-19.","Zhang, L; Jiang, Y; Wei, M; Cheng, B H; Zhou, X C; Li, J; Tian, J H; Dong, L; Hu, R H",Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112141-20200218-00111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145714/,316

For example, in our randomized controlled trial of Take Charge!, a mentor-implemented and research-informed violence prevention program that partners with one-on-one community-based mentoring agencies, only 50% of intervention youth with fight-related injuries were successfully matched with a mentor. We examined the differences between matched (n = 49) and unmatched (n = 49) youth with regard to demographics, time from injury to study enrollment, perceived seriousness of injury, belief that future injury can be avoided, and household chaos. Youth who were successfully matched with a mentor were more likely to perceive the injury as very serious or somewhat serious compared with unmatched youth (95.9% vs. 79.6%, p = .028). All other factors were not significantly associated with successful mentor matching. Future violence prevention interventions should consider youth perceptions as a factor that may influence the completion of desired interventions.","Lennon, Tyler; Cheng, Tina; Lindstrom Johnson, Sarah; Jones, Vanya; Fein, Joel; Manning Ryan, Leticia",Journal of community psychology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411341/,316

The annualized stroke rate in the recent stenting and aggressive medical management for preventing stroke in intracranial stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial medical management arm was 12.2%. This trial was halted due to excessive periprocedural events in the stent arm. This stroke rate is still unacceptably, high and a treatment strategy is still needed. SAMMPRIS has no bearing on angioplasty alone. Angioplasty alone has always been our primary intervention for intracranial atherosclerosis and remains so to this day due to its relative simplicity, low complication rate, and efficacy. We have, however, made adjustments to our patient management regimen based on the results of SAMMPRIS. This paper outlines our current patient selection, procedural technique, and post-procedure management. The complications we have encountered while developing our technique are described along with how to avoid them and how to manage them. Our most recent results (since previous publications) are also discussed.","Connors, John J; Wojak, Joan C; Hoppe, Blaine H",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2014.00246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25505444/,316
139805,Laparoscopic management of the ovarian mass: a practical approach.,2009,"OBJECTIVE The study was designed to assess the use of newer sidestream microstream end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2) ) device in predicting blood carbon dioxide (PCO(2) ) measurements in very low birth weight (VLBW = birth weight <1,500 g) and non-VLBW NICU neonates. STUDY DESIGN Sidestream microstream ETCO(2) detectors were allowed time to calibrate and reach steady state prior to blood gas measurements. Blood CO(2) (PCO(2) ) and simultaneous ETCO(2) were recorded. Ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) was calculated using modified Bohr's equation. Correlation coefficient, estimates of difference, standard deviation, and 95% limits of agreement between ETCO(2) and PCO(2) concentrations were calculated. RESULTS Two hundred eighty-six paired samples were collected from 48 ventilated NICU patients. Average PCO(2) and ETCO(2) were 58.4 and 50.6 with a correlation of 0.76. Subgroup analysis showed a correlation of 0.73 in 204 paired blood from 34 VLBW infants and 0.82 in 82 paired samples from non-VLBW infants. Estimates of difference ± standard deviation between PCO(2) and ETCO(2) concentrations in these three groups, respectively (ALL, VLBW, and non-VLBW) were 7.84 ± 9.96, 8.2 ± 10.16, and 6.95 ± 9.45. The correlation coefficient significantly improved in the VLBW group to 0.86 with dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) <30% (0.86 vs. 0.42; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION ETCO(2) measurements using sidestream microstream technology in VLBW demonstrated that the correlation of ETCO(2) and PCO(2) was moderate, but the agreement was less than adequate (bias > 5 mmHg in all groups). The results improved with lower VD/VT, suggesting that sidestream capnography is more reliable in conditions of less severe lung disease.","Singh, Bindya S; Gilbert, Urquidez; Singh, Sharad; Govindaswami, Balaji",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.22593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22589000/,316

Herein, we share our two cases to demonstrate the feasibility of scarless transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy using conventional instruments in the management of unresectable peri-ampullary cancer. CASES AND METHODS Two 58-year-old patients (one male) underwent transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomies: The male and female patients were diagnosed with duodenal papillary carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, respectively. The hepatocystic junction was confirmed patent preoperatively in both patients. A 2-cm periumbilical incision was made for the placement of three trocars. Conventional rigid laparoscopic instruments were solely used throughout the procedure, and operative techniques were carried out in the same fashion as for conventional laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy. RESULTS The procedures were completed uneventfully in 190 and 155 min, respectively, with no complications, and the blood loss was estimated at 80 and 20 ml, respectively. Postoperative pain scores on postoperative day 1 were 4/10 and 3/10. The patients were discharged from the hospital on postoperative days 3 and 5 with resolving jaundice. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy appears to be a technically feasible alternative to standard laparoscopic procedure and can be performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments.","Tian, Yu; Wu, Shuo-Dong; Chen, Yong-Sheng; Chen, Chun-Chih",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-010-1236-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20499199/,316

140638,The 3-month post-atrial fibrillation ablation blanking period: time to redefine?,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Practitioner-level implementation interventions such as audit and feedback, communities of practice, and local opinion leaders have shown potential to change nurses' behaviour in clinical practice and improve patients' health. However, their effectiveness remains unclear. Moreover, we have a paucity of data regarding the use of theory in implementation studies with nurses, the causal processes-i.e. mechanisms of action-targeted by interventions to change nurses' behaviour in clinical practice, and the constituent components-i.e. behaviour change techniques-included in interventions. Thus, our objectives are threefold: (1) to examine the effectiveness of practitioner-level implementation interventions in changing nurses' behaviour in clinical practice; (2) to identify, in included studies, the type and degree of theory use, the mechanisms of action targeted by interventions and the behaviour change techniques constituting interventions and (3) to examine whether intervention effectiveness is associated with the use of theory or with specific mechanisms of action and behaviour change techniques. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review based on the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines. We will search six databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science) with no time limitation for experimental and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated practitioner-level implementation interventions aiming to change nurses' behaviour in clinical practice. We will also hand-search reference lists of included studies. We will perform screening, full-text review, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction independently with the Covidence systematic review software. We will assess the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro software. We will code included studies independently for theory use (Theory Coding Scheme), mechanisms of action (coding guidelines from Michie) and behaviour change techniques (Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1) with QSR International's NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Meta-analyses will be performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) software. Meta-regression analyses will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics software. DISCUSSION This review will inform knowledge users and researchers interested in designing, developing and evaluating implementation interventions to support nurses' behaviour change in clinical practice. Results will provide key insights regarding which causal processes-i.e. mechanisms of action-should be targeted by these interventions, and which constituent components-i.e. behaviour change techniques-should be included in these interventions to increase their effectiveness.

140799,Mechanical Recanalization for Acute Embolic Occlusion at the Origin of the Superior Mesenteric Artery.,2017,"Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients, and developing chemoresistance is a tremendous challenge to efficacy of GC treatment. The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1α signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage's infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid β-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer.","Yu, Shan; Li, Qian; Yu, Yiyi; Cui, Yuehong; Li, Wei; Liu, Tianshu; Liu, Fenglin","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-020-02598-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388677/,316

Interpretation of results generated by different platforms and prioritization for testing algorithms required cross-comparison. Objective - To compare the analytical sensitivity of three commercial SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays, selected samples were studied in parallel with Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, NxTAG CoV Extended Panel, and ID NOW COVID-19 assays. Design - A total of 8043 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed from March 22 to April 19, 2020, were included in this study. For all 1794 positive specimens detected by the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were manually tracked and plotted, to demonstrate the distribution of sample viral levels. Additionally, 50 and 63 low positive specimens (Ct values >32) as well as 50 and 61 consecutive positive specimens by the cobas assay were tested with NxTAG and ID NOW, respectively, to estimate their relative sensitivities. Results - Ct values of cobas SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were evenly distributed over ranges of 13.32-39.50 (mean: 25.06) and 13.60-42.49 (mean: 26.45) for ORF1 and E gene targets, respectively. NxTAG only reliably detected specimens with E gene Ct values lower than 33, and is estimated to detect 89.4% of positive specimens detected by cobas assay. ID NOW had performance variation independent of Ct value and is estimated to detect 83.5% of cobas positives. Conclusions - Clinical specimens exhibit a wide range of viral burden, with a significant portion at low levels. Analytical sensitivity of testing platforms is critical for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 and uniform care to patients.","Jin, Run; Pettengill, Matthew A; Hartnett, Nicole L; Auerbach, Herbert E; Peiper, Stephen C; Wang, Zixuan",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0283-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649229/,316
140949,Organisational support improves adherence to infection prevention and control guidelines.,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND In long-term neurological conditions, location of death is poorly understood but is seen as a marker of quality of dying. OBJECTIVE To examine individual, illness and environmental factors on place of death among people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in isolation or in combination and compare them with people without either condition. METHODS Retrospective, observational, comparative cohort study of 582 people with MS, 579 people with PD and 95 controls from UK Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's Disease Tissue Bank. A subset of people with MS and PD were selected for analysis of individual clinical encounters 2 years before death and further subset of all groups for analysis of impact of advance care planning (ACP) and recognition of dying. RESULTS People with MS died more often (50.8%) in hospital than those with PD (35.3%). Examining individual clinical encounters over 2 years (4931 encounters) identified increased contact with services 12 months before death (F(1, 58)=69.71, p<0.0001) but was not associated with non-hospital deaths (F(1, 58)=1.001, p=0.321). The presence of ACPs and recognition of dying were high among people with MS and PD and both associated with a non-hospital death. ACPs were more likely to prevent hospital deaths when initiated by general practitioners (GPs) compared with other professional groups (χ2=68.77, p=0.0007). CONCLUSIONS For people with MS and PD, ACPs contribute to reducing dying in hospital. ACPs appear to be most effective when facilitated by GPs underlining the importance of primary care involvement in delivering holistic care at the end of life.","Nicholas, Richard; Nicholas, Emma; Hannides, Mike; Gautam, Vishal; Friede, Tim; Koffman, Jonathan",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489324/,316
141133,Single Center Experience with the AngioVac Aspiration System.,2015,"METHODS In acute ischemic stroke, good outcome following successful recanalization is time dependent. In patients undergoing endovascular therapy at our institution, recanalization times with the Solitaire stent were retrospectively evaluated to assess for the presence of a learning curve in achieving rapid recanalization. METHODS We reviewed patients who presented to our stroke center and achieved successful recanalization with the Solitaire stent exclusively. Time intervals were calculated (CT to angiography arrival, angiography arrival to groin puncture, groin puncture to first deployment, and deployment to recanalization) from time stamped images and angiography records. Patients were divided into three sequential groups, with overall CT to recanalization time and subdivided time intervals compared. RESULTS 83 patients were treated with the Solitaire stent from May 2009 to February 2012. Recanalization (Thrombolyis in Cerebral Infarction score 2A) occurred in 75 (90.4%) patients. CT to recanalization demonstrated significant improvement over time, which was greatest between the first 25 and the most recent 25 cases (161-94 min; p<0.01). The maximal contribution to this was from improvements in first stent deployment to recanalization time (p=0.001 between the first and third groups), with modest contributions from moving patients from CT to the angiography suite faster (p=0.02 between the first and third groups) and from groin puncture to first stent deployment (p=0.02 between the first and third groups). CONCLUSIONS There is a learning curve involved in the efficient use of the Solitaire stent in endovascular acute stroke therapy. Along with improvements in patient transfer to angiography and improved efficiency with intracranial access, mastering this device contributed significantly towards reducing recanalization times.","Eesa, M; Burns, P A; Almekhlafi, M A; Menon, B K; Wong, J H; Mitha, A; Morrish, W; Demchuk, A M; Goyal, M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24151114/,316

141484,Early effect of intra-arterial treatment in ischemic stroke on aphasia recovery in MR CLEAN.,2016,"OBJECTIVE Determine if antibiotic prescribing patterns differ for in-person versus virtual clinic visits for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). METHODS All adult virtual clinical encounters from March-May 2020 with a principal diagnosis of ARS were reviewed for demographic data and the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription during the coronavirus shut down in Massachusetts. In-person clinical encounters from March-May 2019 were similarly examined as a control. The rate of antibiotic prescription was compared between virtual (2020) and in-person (2019) visits for ARS diagnoses. RESULTS There were 2,075 patients in March-May 2020 and 3,654 patients March-May 2019 who received an ARS principal diagnosis at their virtual and in-person outpatient visits, respectively. There was a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARS in 2020 (72.1%) versus 2019 (76.7%).The odds ratio for an antibiotic prescription for ARS was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.693-0.86; p < 0.001) for patients seen in the 2020 cohort versus the 2019 cohort. The compared rates for antibiotic prescribing for 2020 versus 2019 were not different in individual month-to-month comparisons. When stratified by otolaryngology providers there was no statistically significant difference of antibiotic prescriptions between the 2019 and 2020 cohort (p = 0.781). CONCLUSION During the massive transition to virtual visits for March-May 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic shut down in Massachusetts, the total rate of outpatient antibiotic prescribing for ARS was lower in the virtual visit environment compared to the traditional in-person visit. In this scenario, telemedicine did not result in an increase in antibiotic prescribing despite the lack of an in-person physical exam. This article is protected by copyright.

METHOD This prospective, quasi-randomized, single-centre trial focusing on postoperative pain included 49 patients undergoing elective surgery with either a conventional LC, or SPC using a surgical glove port. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and postoperative analgesic use as primary outcome measures. Total duration of operation, length of hospital stay, blood test results on the day after surgery and total port cost were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Twenty-five LCs and 24 SPCs were undertaken. The VAS score on day 1 after surgery was significantly less in the SPC group than in the LC group: median (range) 24 (12-38) versus 45 (33-57) mm (P = 0·002). Significantly fewer patients in the SPC group required analgesia (9 of 24 versus 19 of 25 in the LC group; P = 0·007). There were no significant differences in total duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and blood test results on the day after surgery. CONCLUSION Single-port surgery using a surgical glove port reduces postoperative pain compared with conventional LC.","Asakuma, M; Hayashi, M; Komeda, K; Shimizu, T; Hirokawa, F; Miyamoto, Y; Okuda, J; Tanigawa, N",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538340/,316
141786,Laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancies in unusual locations.,2014,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Most of the world's children and adolescents live in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) where mental health services are very limited. Here, we reviewed literature over the last 18 months describing the current landscape of child and adolescent mental health services and systems (CAMHSS) in LMICs, and present findings from systems strengthening research. RECENT FINDINGS The challenges in CAMHSS are well described with little change over the last two decades. Fortunately, research has started to move from 'mapping' towards systems 'strengthening'. Using the WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) framework, we reviewed recent CAMHSS innovations. Clinical care and human resource innovations focused on primary care with validation of screening tools, training and task-sharing for capacity-building. Intersectoral collaboration emerged as a priority domain for strengthening, alongside a theme around the importance of participatory research to inform policy reforms. The potential role of digital technology to strengthen CAMHSS was identified as an emerging theme. SUMMARY There is an urgent need to increase the priority of CAMHSS in LMICs. This will require innovations at multiple levels aimed at all CAMHSS domains, with active participation of all relevant local stakeholders to ensure the translation of research into policy and practice.","Simelane, Simphiwe R N; de Vries, Petrus J",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419969/,316

141932,The role of interleukin-18 in the diagnosis and monitoring of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome - a systematic review.,2020-10-31,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes that predispose individuals to different malignancies, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer. Current guidelines recommended testing for LS in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in relatives. Economic evaluations in support of such approach, however, are not available in Italy. We developed a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of LS screening from the perspective of the Italian National Health System. Three testing strategies: the sequencing of all MMR genes without prior tumor analysis (Strategy 1), a sequential IHC and MS-MLPA analysis (Strategy 2), and an age-targeted strategy with a revised Bethesda criteria assessment before IHC and methylation-specific MLPA for patients ≥ than 70 years old (Strategy 3) were analyzed and compared to the ""no testing"" strategy. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in relatives after colonoscopy, aspirin prophylaxis and an intensive gynecological surveillance were estimated through a Markov model. Assuming a CRC incidence rate of 0.09% and a share of patients affected by LS equal to 2.81%, the number of detected pathogenic variants among CRC cases ranges, in a given year, between 910 and 1167 depending on the testing strategy employed. The testing strategies investigated, provided one-time to the entire eligible population (CRC patients), were associated with an overall cost ranging between €1,753,059.93-€10,388,000.00. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the Markov model ranged from €941.24 /QALY to €1,681.93 /QALY, thus supporting that ""universal testing"" versus ""no testing"" is cost-effective, but not necessarily in comparison with age-targeted strategies. This is the first economic evaluation on different testing strategies for LS in Italy. The results might support the introduction of cost-effective recommendations for LS screening in Italy.","Pastorino, Roberta; Basile, Michele; Tognetto, Alessia; Di Marco, Marco; Grossi, Adriano; Lucci-Cordisco, Emanuela; Scaldaferri, Franco; De Censi, Andrea; Federici, Antonio; Villari, Paolo; Genuardi, Maurizio; Ricciardi, Walter; Boccia, Stefania",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609729/,316

We synthesized findings from 22 studies (3243 patients) narratively and, where possible, quantitatively. Nineteen studies assessed willingness to receive life-sustaining treatments (LSTs), six, the preferred place of care, and eight, preferences regarding shared decision-making processes. When unspecified, 21% of patients in four studies preferred any LST option. In three studies, fewer patients chose LST when faced with death and deteriorating health, and more when treatment promised life extension. In 13 studies, 67% and 48% of patients respectively were willing to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, but willingness decreased with deteriorating health. Further, 52% of patients from three studies wished to die at home. Seven studies showed that unless incapacitated, most patients prefer to decide on their EoL care themselves. High non-response rates meant RoB was high in most studies.

Here we use 18-year time series of canopy greenness derived from satellite imagery (NDVI) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on Spain's forests. Specifically, we analyzed how NDVI was influenced by the climatic water balance (i.e. Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI), using monthly time-series extracted from 3,100 pixels of forest, categorized into ten forest types. The forests increased in leaf area index by 0.01 per year on average (from 1.7 in 2000 to 1.9 in 2017) but there was enormous variation among years related to climatic water balance. Forest types varied in response to drought events: those dominated by drought-avoiding species showed strong covariance between greenness and SPEI, while those dominated by drought-tolerant species showed weak covariance. Native forests usually recovered more than 80% of greenness within the 18 months and the remainder within 5 years, but plantations of Eucalyptus were less resilient. Management to increase the resilience of forests-a key goal of forestry in the Mediterranean region-appears to have had a positive effect: canopy greenness within protected forests was more resilient to drought than within non-protected forests. In conclusion, many of Spain's successional forests have been resilient to drought over the past 18 years, from the perspective of space. Future studies will need to combine remote sensing with field-based analyses of physiological tolerances and mortality processes to understand how Mediterranean forests will respond to the rapid climate change predicted for this region in the coming decades.","Khoury, Sacha; Coomes, David A",Global change biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894633/,316
142833,Association of reperfusion success and emboli in new territories with long term mortality after mechanical thrombectomy.,2021-04-28,"Introduction Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DD) is an entity in which the ventricle fails to fill up properly due to impaired ventricular relaxation and/or decreased compliance. The diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction is based on a variety of parameters in doppler echocardiograpy. However, some parameters like interventricular septal thickness in diastole (IVSd), posterior wall thickness in diastole (PWd), left ventricular internal end diastolic and systolic diameters (LVIDD and LVISD) along with left atrial diameters (LAD) have yet to be evaluated for the diagnostic workup of DD. Methods A case control study was done in the cardiology department from patient records from 2016 to 2018. Patients were diagnosed as diastolic dysfunction grade II and above by doppler echocardiography. IVSd, PWd, LVIDD, LAD, LVISD were obtained through 2-D echocardiography. Results Patients with DD had greater LAD, IVSd and PWd and decreased LVIDD and LVISD as compared to control group. Overall, IVSD was the most significant predictor (OR 1.52 95%CI 1.35-1.71) of DD followed by PWd and LAD. Similarly, LAD, IVSd and PWd had higher sensitivity and specificity than LVIDD and LVIDS. Conclusion IVSd, LAD and PWd showed significant performance in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction and hence can be used as a screening and diagnostic tool in diastolic dysfunction of grade ll and above.","Hamza, Muhammad; Fatima, Mishal; Masood, Muhammad; Masood, Hafiz Umar; Tasleem, Ghazal; Ahmed, Hassaan; Nadir, Maha; Satti, Zubair",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394235/,316

Thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion strokes with minimal symptoms: an intention-to-treat analysis.,2017,"MOTIVATION High-throughput biological data, thanks to technological advances, have become cheaper to collect, leading to the availability of vast amounts of omic data of different types. In parallel, the in silico reconstruction and modelling of metabolic systems is now acknowledged as a key tool to complement experimental data on a large scale. The integration of these model- and data-driven information is therefore emerging as a new challenge in systems biology, with no clear guidance on how to better take advantage of the inherent multi-source and multi-omic nature of these data types while preserving mechanistic interpretation. RESULTS Here we investigate different regularisation techniques for high-dimensional data derived from the integration of gene expression profiles with metabolic flux data, extracted from strain-specific metabolic models, to improve cellular growth rate predictions. To this end, we propose ad-hoc extensions of previous regularisation frameworks including group, view-specific and principal component regularisation, and experimentally compare them using data from 1,143 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. We observe a divergence between methods in terms of regression accuracy and integration effectiveness based on the type of regularisation employed. In multi-omic regression tasks, when learning from experimental and model-generated omic data, our results demonstrate the competitiveness and ease of interpretation of multimodal regularised linear models compared to data-hungry methods based on neural networks.

The aim of this study was to define a panel of markers or examinations appropriate to characterize NE differentiation (NED). METHODS Forty-seven patients with CRPC underwent a systematic diagnostic attempt to characterize the NE phenotype using a plasma blood test for chromogranin A (CgA) and immunohistochemical staining of needle biopsy-obtained specimens (CgA, somatostatin receptor 2 [SSTR2], Ki-67, and androgen receptors). In a subgroup of 26 patients, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy using (111)In-DTPA-d-Phe octreotide (octreotide scintigraphy; Octreoscan, Covidien, Hazelwood, MO) was also performed. RESULTS NED was found in 85.1% of patients (if serum CgA, tissular CgA, and tissular SSTR2 were considered separately: 54%, 67%, and 58%, respectively). Only 15% of the 26-patient subgroup had an abnormal octreotide scintigraphy result. Although p-CgA and t-CgA were associated with more aggressive disease with a worse prognosis, patients with positive tissular SSTR2 staining had longer overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION This systematic approach to explore the NED in a quite homogeneous group of patients with CRPC seems reproducible and appropriate.

Results of the review, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, are reported to (1) summarize existing support for adolescent post-traumatic growth within available empirical literature, (2) discuss potential moderators of adolescent post-traumatic growth occurrence, and (3) review existing measures of post-traumatic growth. Evidence of adolescent post-traumatic growth was found within three studies with correlational designs and two studies with longitudinal designs.

However, recent mineralogical discoveries of POMs in mineral structures demonstrate their importance in geochemical systems. In total, 15 different types of POM nanoscale-size clusters in minerals are described herein, which occur in 42 different mineral species. The topological diversity of POM clusters in minerals is rather restricted compared to the multitude of moieties reported for synthetic compounds, but the lists of synthetic and natural POMs do not overlap completely. The metal-oxo clusters in the crystal structures of the vanarsite-group minerals ([As3+V4+2V5+10As5+6O51]7-), bouazzerite and whitecapsite ([M3+3Fe7(AsO4)9O8-;n(OH)n]), putnisite ([Cr3+8(OH)16(CO3)8]8-), and ewingite ([(UO2)24(CO3)30O4(OH)12(H2O)8]32-) contain metal-oxo clusters that have no close chemical or topological analogues in synthetic chemistry. The interesting feature of the POM cluster topologies in minerals is the presence of unusual coordination of metal atoms enforced by the topological restraints imposed upon the cluster geometry (the cubic coordination of Fe3+ and Ti4+ ions in arsmirandite and lehmannite, respectively, and the trigonal prismatic coordination of Fe3+ in bouazzerite and whitecapsite). Complexity analysis indicates that ewingite and morrisonite are the first and the second most structurally complex minerals known so far. The formation of nanoscale clusters can be viewed as one of the leading mechanisms of generating structural complexity in both minerals and synthetic inorganic crystalline compounds. The discovery of POM minerals is one of the specific landmarks of descriptive mineralogy and mineralogical crystallography of our time.","Krivovichev, Sergey V","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620007131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831280/,316

146278,Débridement of atheroma in the proximal clamp site under hypothermic circulatory arrest for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with severe atherosclerosis.,2017,"BACKGROUND The health impacts of ambient air pollution impose large costs on society. Although all people are exposed to air pollution, the older population (ie, those aged ≥60 years) tends to be disproportionally affected. As a result, there is growing concern about the health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. METHODS In this global analysis, we developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) to estimate the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution using Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age-specific and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) attributable to PM2·5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model and global estimates of exposure at 0·1° × 0·1° (about 11 km × 11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLLs within each age group into a health-related cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM2·5. Finally, we did a sensitivity test to analyse the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and concentration-response functions by age, cause, country, and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing power parity-adjusted US dollars. All simulations were done with R, version 3.6.0. FINDINGS Globally, in 2016, PM2·5 was estimated to have caused 8·42 million (95% UI 6·50-10·52) attributable deaths, which was associated with 163·68 million (116·03-219·44) YLLs. In 2016, the global economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution for the older population was US$2·40 trillion (1·89-2·93) accounting for 59% (59-60) of the cost for the total population ($4·09 trillion [3·19-5·05]). The economic cost per capita for the older population was $2739 (2160-3345) in 2016, which was 10 times that of the younger population (ie, those aged <60 years). By assessing the factors that contributed to economic costs, we found that increases in these factors changed the total economic cost by 77% for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 21% for population ageing, 16% for population growth, -41% for age-specific mortality, and -0·4% for PM2·5 exposure. INTERPRETATION The economic cost of ambient PM2·5 borne by the older population almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population ageing, and population growth. Compared with younger people, air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs among older people, even after accounting for their relatively shorter life expectancy and increased disability. As the world's population is ageing, the disproportionate health cost attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution potentially widens the health inequities for older people. Countries with severe air pollution and rapid ageing rates need to take immediate actions to improve air quality. In addition, strategies aimed at enhancing health-care services, especially targeting the older population, could be beneficial for reducing the health costs of ambient air pollution.

However, they mainly require external light excitation, which makes it difficult to fully integrate them on-chip. On the other hand, integrated photonics enables packing optical components densely on a chip, but it has limited free-space light controllability. Here, by dressing metasurfaces onto waveguides, we molded guided waves into any desired free-space modes to achieve complex free-space functions, such as out-of-plane beam deflection and focusing. This metasurface also breaks the degeneracy of clockwise- and counterclockwise-propagating whispering gallery modes in an active microring resonator, leading to on-chip direct orbital angular momentum lasing. Our study shows a viable route toward complete control of light across integrated photonics and free-space platforms and paves a way for creating multifunctional photonic integrated devices with agile access to free space, which enables a plethora of applications in communications, remote sensing, displays, etc.","Guo, Xuexue; Ding, Yimin; Chen, Xi; Duan, Yao; Ni, Xingjie",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb4142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832643/,316

He was extensively investigated throughout the course of illness. The only potential aetiological factor identified was a positive janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) mutation after screening on account of mildly elevated platelet count noted during his most recent admission. Bone marrow aspiration confirmed essential thrombocythaemia. He was started on hydroxycarbamide and has remained relatively symptom free since then.This case reiterates the known associations between thrombosis and JAK 2 mutation even without overt myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Concerns exist regarding B. pseudomallei use as a potential bio-threat agent causing persistent infections and typically manifesting as severe pneumonia capable of causing fatal bacteremia. Development of suitable therapeutics against melioidosis is complicated due to high degree of genetic and phenotypic variability among B. pseudomallei isolates and lack of data establishing commonly accepted strains for comparative studies. Further, the impact of strain variation on virulence, disease presentation, and mortality is not well understood. Therefore, this study evaluate and compare the virulence and disease progression of B. pseudomallei strains K96243 and HBPUB10303a, following aerosol challenge in a standardized BALB/c mouse model of infection. The natural history analysis of disease progression monitored conditions such as weight, body temperature, appearance, activity, bacteremia, organ and tissue colonization (pathological and histological analysis) and immunological responses. This study provides a detailed, direct comparison of infection with different B. pseudomallei strains and set up the basis for a standardized model useful to test different medical countermeasures against Burkholderia species. Further, this protocol serves as a guideline to standardize other bacterial aerosol models of infection or to define biomarkers of infectious processes caused by other intracellular pathogens.","Massey, Shane; Yeager, Linsey A; Blumentritt, Carla A; Vijayakumar, Sudhamathi; Sbrana, Elena; Peterson, Johnny W; Brasel, Trevor; LeDuc, James W; Endsley, Janice J; Torres, Alfredo G",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep04305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603493/,316

In this work, we present a novel processing framework to inject into the reconstruction problem basic prior knowledge about brain anatomy and its organization and evaluate its effectiveness using both simulated and real human brain data. Our results indicate that our proposed method dramatically increases the accuracy of the estimated brain networks and, thus, represents a major step forward for the study of connectivity.","Schiavi, Simona; Ocampo-Pineda, Mario; Barakovic, Muhamed; Petit, Laurent; Descoteaux, Maxime; Thiran, Jean-Philippe; Daducci, Alessandro",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba8245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789176/,316

An optimized two-phase solvent system composed of n-butanol-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:4:0.5:5, v/v) was selected. Trifluoroacetic acid (10 mmol/L) was added to the upper organic phase, used as the stationary phase. One liter of the aqueous lower phase was used as the mobile phase for 0-350 min, and then 10 mmol/L ammonia was added to remaining 1 L of the aqueous lower phase and used as the mobile phase for 350-600 min. In total, 493.2 mg of baicalin with 98.6% purity and 88.6 mg of wogonoside with 98.9% purity were obtained from 1.0 g of crude exact of S. baicalensis by countercurrent chromatography in a single run. The acid dissociation constant (pKa) and oil/water partition coefficient values of two components were measured to better understand the mechanism of separation. Results showed that pH-peak-focusing countercurrent chromatography with a polar solvent system added with trifluoroacetic acid could be an efficient method for large-scale isolation of organic acids, which are difficult to separate with conventional countercurrent chromatography due to their poor solubility in non-polar solvents.

METHODS Twenty-two participants were allocated 5% ibuprofen gel (A) and 0.025% capsaicin cream (B) in random sequence (AB or BA). Patients underwent up to 3 treatment cycles, each comprising one treatment for 4 weeks, an individualized washout period (maximum 4 weeks), then the other treatment for 4 weeks. Differential (ibuprofen or capsaicin) response was defined when change-from-baseline pain intensity scores (0-10 NRS) differed by ≥1 between treatments in ≥2 cycles within a participant. RESULTS A total of 104 treatment periods were aggregated. Mean pain reduction was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.8) on ibuprofen and 1.6 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.4) on capsaicin (P = 0.221). Of 22 participants, 4 (18%) had a greater response to ibuprofen, 9 (41%) to capsaicin, 4 (18%) had similar responses, and 5 (23%) were undetermined. CONCLUSION Irrespective of equal efficacy overall, 59% of people displayed a greater response to one treatment over the other.

DESIGN Three group, pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial from September 2018 to March 2020. SETTING 60 Swiss general practices. PARTICIPANTS One general practitioner per practice was included. General practitioners screen all patients with acute cough; patients with clinical pneumonia were included. INTERVENTIONS Randomisation in a 1:1:1 of general practitioners to either antibiotics guided by sequential procalcitonin and lung ultrasonography point-of-care tests (UltraPro; n=152), procalcitonin guided antibiotics (n=195), or usual care (n=122). MAIN OUTCOMES Primary outcome was proportion of patients in each group prescribed an antibiotic by day 28. Secondary outcomes included duration of restricted activities due to lower respiratory tract infection within 14 days. RESULTS 60 general practitioners included 469 patients (median age 53 years (interquartile range 38-66); 278 (59%) were female). Probability of antibiotic prescription at day 28 was lower in the procalcitonin group than in the usual care group (0.40 v 0.70, cluster corrected difference -0.26 (95% confidence interval -0.41 to -0.10)). No significant difference was seen between UltraPro and procalcitonin groups (0.41 v 0.40, -0.03 (-0.17 to 0.12)). The median number of days with restricted activities by day 14 was 4 days in the procalcitonin group and 3 days in the usual care group (difference 1 day (95% confidence interval -0.23 to 2.32); hazard ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.97)), which did not prove non-inferiority. CONCLUSIONS Compared with usual care, point-of-care procalcitonin led to a 26% absolute reduction in the probability of 28 day antibiotic prescription without affecting patients' safety. Point-of-care lung ultrasonography did not further reduce antibiotic prescription, although a potential added value cannot be excluded, owing to the wide confidence intervals.

Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19. RESULTS The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership. INTERPRETATION For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","Stall, Nathan M; Jones, Aaron; Brown, Kevin A; Rochon, Paula A; Costa, Andrew P",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699006/,316

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2016 and February 2017. Participants were students of the MsPC from 13 editions. An ad hoc survey comprising closed-end questions was provided. Variables such as sociodemographic and learning outcomes, based on Kirkpatrick's model, were included. RESULTS Respondents were 76.6% women, and 60% were between 30 and 50 years of age. Over half of participants were physicians (57.4%), with >15 years of experience (52%). 77% (n=152) reported previous work experience (PWE) in PC, and 23% (n=45) had no PWE. After completing the MsPC, 49% of those without PWE were hired to work in a PC unit, while 84,2% with PWE continued work in a PC-related position. 51.6% professionals with PWE were currently working in other PC areas, such as training or research. High scores were observed on expectations, training needs, motivation in professional practice, PD, applicability and satisfaction, in both groups. Data have shown statistically significant differences on the perceived value of the MsPC to obtain work in the PC field (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS This MsPC training programme improves educational outcomes, and promotes PD, regardless of PWE in PC. Interdisciplinary training for all professionals who care for PC individuals is required. To ensure the quality of education in PC programmes, a systematic process of continuous evaluation is needed.","Lasmarías, Cristina; Guanter, Lourdes; Turrillas, Pamela; Peñafiel, Judith; Gómez-Batiste, Xavier",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994188/,316

Part 1 - peripheral sensory nerve targeted treatments.,2020-08-17,"UNLABELLED Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores are a commonly used biological indicator to evaluate the disinfection of an enclosed space. In the present study, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas was applied to inactivate B. subtilis subsp. niger spores in an enclosed space. The effects of the ClO2 gas concentration (1-3 mg/l), relative humidity (RH, 30-70%) and exposure time (30-90 min) were investigated using a response surface methodology (RSM). A three-factor Box-Behnken experimental design was used. The obtained data were adequately fitted to a second-order polynomial model with an R2adj of 0.992. The ClO2 gas concentration, RH and exposure time all significantly (P<0.05) and positively correlated with the inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores. The interaction between the ClO2 gas concentration and RH as well as that between the exposure time and RH indicated significant and synergistic effects (P<0.05). The predictive model was validated by additional eight experiments and proven to be with good accuracy. Overall, this model established by the RSM could show the trend of the inactivation of spores, indicate the interactions between important factors, and provide a reference to determine effective conditions for the disinfection in different enclosed spaces by ClO2 gas. IMPLICATIONS The inactivation of indoor biological contaminants plays an important role in preventing the transmission of pathogens and ensuring human safety. The predictive model using response surface methodology indicates the influence and interaction of the main factors on the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores by ClO2 gas, and can predict a ClO2 gas treatment condition to achieve an effective sterilization of enclosed spaces. The results in this paper will provide a reference for the application of ClO2 gas treatments for indoor disinfection.","Wang, Tao; Qi, Jiancheng; Wu, Jinhui; Hao, Limei; Yi, Ying; Lin, Song; Zhang, Zongxing",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2016.1150365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853499/,316
150018,Effect of baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score on safety and efficacy of intra-arterial treatment: a subgroup analysis of a randomised phase 3 trial (MR CLEAN).,2016,"Neural oscillations in the alpha band (7-13 Hz) are commonly associated with disengagement of visual attention. However, recent studies have also associated alpha with processes of attentional control and stability. We addressed this issue in previous experiments by delivering transcranial alternating current stimulation at 10 Hz over posterior cortex during visual tasks (alpha tACS). As this stimulation can induce reliable increases in EEG alpha power, and given that performance on each of our visual tasks was negatively associated with alpha power, we assumed that alpha tACS would reliably impair visual performance. However, alpha tACS was instead found to prevent both deteriorations and improvements in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham & 50 Hz tACS. Alpha tACS therefore appeared to exert a stabilizing effect on visual attention. This hypothesis was tested in the current, pre-registered experiment by delivering alpha tACS during a task that required rapid switching of attention between motion, color, and auditory subtasks. We assumed that, if alpha tACS stabilizes visual attention, this stimulation should make it harder for people to switch between visual tasks, but should have little influence on transitions between auditory and visual subtasks. However, in contrast to this prediction, we observed no evidence of impairments in visuovisual vs. audiovisual switching during alpha vs. control tACS. Instead, we observed a trend-level reduction in visuoauditory switching accuracy during alpha tACS. Post-hoc analyses showed no effects of alpha tACS in response time variability, diffusion model parameters, or on performance of repeat trials. EEG analyses also showed no effects of alpha tACS on endogenous or stimulus-evoked alpha power. We discuss possible explanations for these results, as well as their broader implications for current efforts to study the roles of neural oscillations in cognition using tACS.","Clayton, Michael S; Yeung, Nick; Cohen Kadosh, Roi",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487500/,316

Its volume is proportional to the size of the preperitoneal dead space created after the reduction of the hernia. Attempts to reduce its incidence have included tacking the transversalis fascia (TF) to the pubic ramus or closed suction drainage of the preperitoneal space. Both of these techniques are not without problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a new alternate technique that must be safe and easily reproducible, using a widely available and inexpensive pre-tied suture loop (Endoloop(®) Ligature) for plication of the weakened TF. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia during a 33-month period and eligible for endoscopic TEP repair. A single surgeon performed all operations. Each of the M2 or M3 direct defects, according to the European Hernia Society (EHS), were systematically closed prior to the introduction of the prosthetic mesh and as follows: grasping and inversion of the attenuated TF at its apex, using a laparoscopic forceps and plication of the TF by placing a tight Endoloop of Polydioxanone (PDS) at its base. All meshes were secured with fibrin sealant only. Patients were reviewed in the clinic 2 and 6 weeks after the operation. Further follow-up was scheduled if it was deemed necessary. The primary post-operative outcome parameter was seroma formation; secondary outcome parameters included groin pain, surgical complications, and recurrence. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty hernia repairs were prospectively recorded during this period. All procedures were carried out endoscopically. Seventy-nine patients with 94 direct inguinal hernias were selected in a sequential manner. There were 75 males and four females, with a median age of 57 years. Of those, 55 were combined with an indirect inguinal defect. In total, Endoloops of PDS were used to close the weakened TF in 76 cases (30 M3, 44 M2, and two M1). Only one patient (1.3%) complained of a residual seroma formation, which was still clinically present at 3 months post-operatively, but was not symptomatic. There were only two minor post-operative complications, which occurred in the same patient and were not related to the Endoloop technique. Finally, no patient complained of chronic groin pain and there was no hernia recurrence after a median follow-up of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS The primary closure of direct inguinal hernia defects with a pre-tied suture loop during endoscopic TEP repair is safe, efficient, and very reliable for the prevention of post-operative seroma formation, without increasing the risk of developing chronic groin pain or hernia recurrence. This technique should be the preferred method over stapling of the TF or the insertion of a closed suction drainage device in such a situation.","Berney, C R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-011-0892-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22120101/,316

METHODS We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature. There are a lot of difficulties in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19.","Çınar, Tufan; Hayıroğlu, Mert İlker; Çiçek, Vedat; Uzun, Mehmet; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965356/,316

150537,Multiparametric MRI and CT models of infarct core and favorable penumbral imaging patterns in acute ischemic stroke.,2013,"OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) correction of metabolic acidosis on cardiopulmonary, laboratory, and cerebral, renal and splanchnic regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) in extremely premature neonates during the first postnatal week. STUDY DESIGN Observational cohort data were collected from 500 to 1250 g neonates who received NaHCO3 'half' corrections (0.3 * Weight (kg) * Base Deficit (mmol l(-1))) for presumed renal losses. RESULT Twelve subjects with normal blood pressure and heart rate received 17 NaHCO3 corrections. Mean (±s.d.) gestational age was 27±2 week and birth weight was 912±157 g. NaHCO3 corrections provided a mean (±s.d.) 4.5±1.0 ml kg(-1) fluid bolus, shifted mean (±s.d.) base deficit from 7.6±1.8 to 3.4±2.1 mmol l(-1) (P<0.05), and increased median (±s.d.) pH from 7.23±0.06 to 7.31±0.05 (P<0.05). No significant changes in blood pressure, pulse oximetry, PCO2, lactate, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or hematocrit were observed. Cerebral, renal and splanchnic rSO2 (74%, 66% and 44%, respectively, at baseline) and FTOE (0.21, 0.29 and 0.52, respectively, at baseline) were unchanged following NaHCO3 correction. CONCLUSION NaHCO3 infusions decreased base deficits and increased pH though produced no discernible effects or benefits on cardiopulmonary parameters including rSO2 and FTOE. These findings warrant further prospective evaluation in larger populations with more significant metabolic acidosis to determine the utility of tissue oxygenation monitoring in differentiating metabolic acidosis due to oxygen delivery/consumption imbalance versus renal bicarbonate losses.","Mintzer, J P; Parvez, B; Alpan, G; LaGamma, E F",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/jp.2015.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927273/,316

He was treated for an exacerbation of asthma with poor response to pharmacological therapy. Investigation of dysphonia via laryngoscopy identified a bilateral vocal cord palsy. Subsequently, the patient developed an episode of life-threatening stridor and hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring an emergency tracheostomy. Neurology input identified evidence of widespread muscle fasciculations on clinical examination. MRI of the brain and cervical spine were unremarkable. Electromyogram testing identified changes of acute denervation in several limbs consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND). Bilateral vocal cord palsy has been rarely reported in the literature as the heralding symptom resulting in the diagnosis of MND. In patients with a subacute onset of dysphonia, dyspnoea and stridor, MND should be a differential diagnosis.","Gordon, Brian; Joyce, Eimear; Counihan, Timothy J",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-241923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230044/,316
150981,Associations between Helicobacter pylori with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other metabolic conditions in Guatemala.,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND On March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a national lockdown to tackle the COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, including stay at home recommendations. The precise impact of COVID-19 scare and lockdown on emergency access for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still subject to debate. METHODS Data on all patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography at 9 hospitals in the greater area of Rome, Italy, between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, 9, 2020, were retrospectively collected. Incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), as well as corresponding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), was compared distinguishing two different 20-day time periods (before vs on or after March 10, 2020). RESULTS During the study period, 1,068 patients underwent coronary angiography, 142 (13%) with STEMI and 169 (16%) with NSTEMI. The average daily number of STEMI decreased from 4.3 before the lockdown to 2.9 after the lockdown (p=0.021). Similarly, the average daily number of NSTEMI changed from 5.0 to 3.5 (p=0.028). The average daily number of primary PCI changed from 4.2 to 2.9 (p=0.030), while the average daily number of PCI for NSTEMI changed from 3.5 to 2.5 (p=0.087). For STEMI patients, the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door time less than three hours) showed a significant increase after the lockdown (p=0.018), whereas door-to-balloon time did not change significantly from before to after the lockdown (p=0.609). CONCLUSIONS The present study, originally reporting on the trends in STEMI and NSTEMI in the Rome area, highlights that significant decreases in the incidence of both acute coronary syndromes occurred between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, together with increases in time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, luckily without changes in door-to-balloon time.","Gaspardone, Achille; Versaci, Francesco; Tomai, Fabrizio; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Sgueglia, Gregory A; Gioffré, Gaetano; Romagnoli, Enrico; Mancone, Massimo; Calcagno, Simone; Proietti, Igino; Sciahbasi, Alessandro; DI Pietro, Riccardo; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Mariano, Enrica; Romeo, Francesco",Minerva cardiology and angiology,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-5683.21.05516-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823575/,316

Several studies reported a decrease in the number of stroke admissions. There are no data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke admissions and stroke care in Maryland. METHODS A retrospective analysis of quality improvement data reported by stroke centers in the State of Maryland. The number of admissions for stroke, overall and by stroke subtype, between March 1 and September 30, 2020 (pandemic) were compared with the same time period in 2019 (prepandemic). Median last known well to hospital arrival time, the number of intravenous thrombolysis and thrombectomy were also compared. RESULTS During the initial 7 months of the pandemic, there were 6529 total admissions for stroke and transient ischemic attack, monthly mean 938 (95% CI, 837.1-1038.9) versus prepandemic 8003, monthly mean 1156.3 (CI, 1121.3-1191.2), P<0.001. A significant decrease was observed in intravenous thrombolysis treatments, pandemic 617, monthly mean 88.1 (80.7-95.6) versus prepandemic 805, monthly mean 115 (CI, 104.3-125.6), P<0.001; there was no significant decrease for thrombectomies. The pandemic decreased the probability of admissions for stroke and transient ischemic attack by 19%, for acute ischemic stroke by 20%, for the number of intravenous thrombolysis performed by 23%. There was no difference in the number of admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage, pandemic 199, monthly mean 28.4 (CI, 22.5-34.3) versus prepandemic 217, monthly mean 31 (CI, 23.9-38.1), respectively, P=0.507.

The WHO recommends newborn and infant hearing screening for all member states to facilitate early identification and intervention for children with PCEOHI. Ethical implications of newborn/infant hearing screening in low-income and middle-income countries should be considered. Although the Pacific Island region is estimated to have among the highest global burden of hearing loss, hearing health services are limited and virtually non-existent in Pacific Island countries. The aim of this brief report is to consider the ethical implications of implementing hospital-based universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) in Samoa. Based on well-acknowledged screening principles, this report found that the Samoan context does not satisfy the screening principles for such a programme, and that the implementation of UNHS would, therefore, be unethical. This conclusion was reached even after considering the hypothetical provision of necessary screening and diagnostic audiology equipment from external donors. We recommend that current efforts should be directed towards the wider professional community involved in the daily care of children with a permanent hearing loss. Given the high prevalence of paediatric ear disease in the Pacific Islander population, an interim ear and hearing programme could be considered at the community level. These strategies should provide the infrastructure and referral pathways required in the advent of UNHS in Samoa.","Kaspar, Annette; Driscoll, Carlie; Pifeleti, Sione; Faumuina, Penaia A",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33234548/,316

Our purpose was to assess to what extent such a system could decrease anesthesia workload in comparison to the use of a stand alone TCI system manually adjusted to fit the same BIS range of 40-60 % (TCI Manual). Patients scheduled for elective vascular or thoracic surgery were randomized to the TCI Loop or TCI Manual method for administering propofol and remifentanil during both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Assessment of workload was performed by an independent observer who quoted each time the physician looked at the BIS monitor. The number of propofol and remifentanil target modifications, the percentage of time of adequate anesthesia i.e. BIS in the range 40-60 and hemodynamic data were recorded. Eighteen patients per group were enrolled. Characteristics, duration of surgery and propofol-remifentanil consumption were similar between groups. However, the percentage of time in the BIS range 40-60 % was higher in the TCI Loop versus TCI Manual groups (94 % ± 12 vs. 74 % ± 19, p < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure was lower with TCI Manual (78 ± 6 vs. 88 ± 13 mmHg, p < 0.001). The number of times the anesthesiologist watched the controller or BIS monitor (p < 0.05) and the number of manual adjustments (p < 0.001) performed in each group was lower with TCI Loop group during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. An automated controller strikingly frees the anesthesiologist from manual intervention to adjust drug delivery.","Dussaussoy, Corinne; Peres, Marine; Jaoul, Virginie; Liu, Ngai; Chazot, Thierry; Picquet, Jean; Fischler, Marc; Beydon, Laurent",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-013-9453-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23494090/,316
151531,Erythrocyte-Rich Thrombus Is Associated with Reduced Number of Maneuvers and Procedure Time in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Undergoing Mechanical Thrombectomy.,2018,"Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 °C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial times1. However, fossil fuels continue to dominate the global energy system and a sharp decline in their use must be realized to keep the temperature increase below 1.5 °C (refs. 2-7). Here we use a global energy systems model8 to assess the amount of fossil fuels that would need to be left in the ground, regionally and globally, to allow for a 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5 °C. By 2050, we find that nearly 60 per cent of oil and fossil methane gas, and 90 per cent of coal must remain unextracted to keep within a 1.5 °C carbon budget. This is a large increase in the unextractable estimates for a 2 °C carbon budget9, particularly for oil, for which an additional 25 per cent of reserves must remain unextracted. Furthermore, we estimate that oil and gas production must decline globally by 3 per cent each year until 2050. This implies that most regions must reach peak production now or during the next decade, rendering many operational and planned fossil fuel projects unviable. We probably present an underestimate of the production changes required, because a greater than 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5 °C requires more carbon to stay in the ground and because of uncertainties around the timely deployment of negative emission technologies at scale.","Welsby, Dan; Price, James; Pye, Steve; Ekins, Paul",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03821-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497394/,316

We sought to demonstrate the reduction in hospital room utilization after implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS We included all minimally invasive reconstructive surgical procedures in this retrospective cohort study within a large managed care organization of 4.5 million members (2008-2018). We queried the system-wide medical record for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for all included procedures and patient perioperative data. Categorical variables were compared using χ2 test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS Of the 13,445 patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, 5,506 were discharged the same day, whereas 7,939 were discharged the next day. Over the 10-year period, patients without hysterectomy had outpatient surgery rates increase from 31.2% to 76.4% (+45.2%), whereas those with hysterectomy increased from 3% to 56.4% (+53.4%). Hospital room utilization decreased by 45,200 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures without hysterectomy and 53,400 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures with hysterectomy. When compared to 2008, in 2018 after more widespread adoption of outpatient elective surgery, for the 738 patients undergoing surgery without hysterectomy, 334 less room days were used, whereas 335 less room days were used among the 640 patients who had a surgical procedure with hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive procedures leads to a significant reduction in hospital room utilization. Same-day discharge decreases hospital resource utilization, therefore improving hospital access, which may be essential for the delivery of routine care during times of resource scarcity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Berger, Alexander A; Tan-Kim, Jasmine; Menefee, Shawn A",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000001044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651719/,316

Alterations in sterol metabolism or oxidation have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Unsaturated sterols are vulnerable to oxidation induced by singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species. This process yields reactive sterol oxidation products, including hydroperoxides, epoxides as well as aldehydes. These oxysterols, in particular those with high electrophilicity, can modify nucleophilic sites in biomolecules and affect many cellular functions. Here, we review the generation and measurement of reactive sterol oxidation products with emphasis on cholesterol hydroperoxides and aldehyde derivatives (electrophilic oxysterols) and their effects on protein modifications.","Miyamoto, Sayuri; Lima, Rodrigo S; Inague, Alex; Viviani, Lucas G",Free radical research,https://doi.org/10.1080/10715762.2021.1879387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494620/,316

We found HPgV in serum and cerebrospinal fluid from 3 patients who had encephalitis of unclear origin; that is, all the markers that had been tested were negative.

Samples were screened for HRSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Demographic and clinical information was recorded. A total of 38.14% (341/894) of samples were positive for HRSV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 60.4% of the selected 227 RSV strains were GA2, 34.4% were BA, 4.8% were GB2, and 0.4% were GB3. A total of 40.47% of all of the RSV-positive samples were coinfected with other respiratory viruses, and adenovirus was the most common additional respiratory virus. No statistical differences were found in the frequency of diagnosis and symptoms between the coinfection group and monoinfection group.

This development poses unique challenges for pancreas transplantation candidates as obese individuals are often denied access to transplant. The introduction of robotic approach to transplant has been shown to improve outcomes in obese patients. A single center retrospective review of pancreas transplant cases over a 4-year period ending December 2018 was performed. Patients undergoing robotic surgery were compared to their counterparts undergoing open transplant. 49 patients (10 robot, 39 open) received pancreas transplants over the study period. Mean age was 43.1±7.5 vs 42.8±9.7 yrs. There were no significant differences in demographics except body mass index (33.7±5.2 vs 27.1±6.6, p=0.005). Operative duration (7.6±1.6 vs 5.3±1.4, p<0.001), and warm ischemia times (45.5[IQR: 13.7] vs 33[7], P<0.001) were longer in the robotic arm. There were no wound complications in the robotic approach patients. Graft (100% vs 88%, p=0.37) and patient survival (100% vs 100%, p=0.72) after one year were similar. Our findings suggest that robotic pancreas is both safe and effective in obese diabetic patients, without added risk of wound complications.

For family physicians who use dermoscopy, there is higher sensitivity for melanoma detection than naked-eye examination. There is a shortage of dermoscopy training for primary care providers. The triage amalgamated dermoscopic algorithm (TADA) is designed for novice dermoscopists. While TADA can be taught in a short dermoscopy workshop, spaced review and blended learning strategies improve knowledge retention. Objectives This study determined the impact that the addition of a distance learning platform has on clinical dermoscopy use. Moreover, it evaluated dermoscopic image identification (knowledge retention) following the addition of distance learning via Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) to a traditional TADA dermoscopy workshop. Methods Primary care providers voluntarily attended a 120-minute TADA dermoscopy workshop. Participants completed pre-intervention, post-TADA, and post-ECHO tests of 30 dermoscopic images of benign and malignant skin lesions. A survey was also administered to analyze clinical dermoscopy use and prior dermoscopy training. Results Twenty-seven residents, faculty, and advanced practice providers participated in this longitudinal observational cohort study. Mean test scores (out of 30) for images of benign and malignant lesions improved from 20.29 pre-intervention to 24.62 post-TADA and 27.63 post-ECHO (P < .001). On average, participants attended 4 ECHO sessions (out of 7 total) and there was a positive correlation (r = 0.77) between the number of ECHOs attended and post-ECHO scores.

Here, we identified the role of an RNA-binding protein, CUG-BP Elav-like family member 6 (CELF6), in the TNBC development and paclitaxel (PTX) chemoresistance. METHODS Stable CELF6-overexpressing cell lines were established in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell proliferation was determined using cell counting, two-dimensional colony formation, and MTT assay. Meanwhile, cell migration and cell invasion were detected by Transwell assay. Furthermore, the downstream target gene of CELF6 was identified and the direct interaction was further determined by luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down. Additionally, the PTX resistant cell line was established to determine the role of CELF6 in PTX resistance. RESULTS CELF6 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell invasion. Mechanistically, Fructose-Bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) was identified as the target gene of CELF6 and stabilized by CELF6 via binding 3'UTR. CELF6 overexpression mediated inhibition in TNBC development was dependent on FBP1. Moreover, CELF6 overexpression increased the sensitivity to PTX treatment. CONCLUSION CELF6 functions as a tumor suppressor by upregulating FBP 1 expression via stabilizing its mRNA, and thereby inhibits TNBC progression.","Yang, Xiaowei; Zhao, Lu; Pei, Jing; Wang, Zhaorui; Zhang, Jingjie; Wang, Benzhong",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05753-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601971/,316

This frequently involves the calcaneum and is commonly associated with mid-foot fracture dislocations. The foot is at risk of both compartment syndrome and the development of fracture blisters after such injuries. The amount of energy transfer and the environment in which the injury was sustained also predispose patients to potential skin necrosis and deep infection. Decompression of the compartments is a part of accepted practice in civilian trauma to reduce the risk of complications associated with significant soft tissue swelling. The traditional methods of foot fasciotomy, however, are not without significant complications. We report a simple technique of dermal fenestration combined with the use of negative pressure wound therapy, which aims to preserve the skin integrity of the foot without resorting to formal fasciotomy.","Poon, Henrietta; Le Cocq, Heather; Mountain, Alistair J; Sargeant, Ian D",The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jfas.2015.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26443232/,316

155763,Prior antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke: Results from the MR CLEAN Registry.,2020-08-14,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. FXS is caused by functional loss of the Fragile X Protein (FXP), also known as Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). In humans and animal models, loss of FXP leads to sensory hypersensitivity, increased susceptibility to seizures and cortical hyperactivity. Several components of the GABAergic system, the major inhibitory system in the brain, are dysregulated in FXS, and thus modulation of GABAergic transmission was suggested and tested as a treatment strategy. However, so far, clinical trials using broad spectrum GABAA or GABAB receptor-specific agonists have not yielded broad improvement of FXS phenotypes in humans. Here, we tested a more selective strategy in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice using the experimental drug BAER-101, which is a selective GABAA α2/α3 agonist. Our results suggest that BAER-101 reduces hyperexcitability of cortical circuits, partially corrects increased frequency-specific baseline cortical EEG power, reduces susceptibility to audiogenic seizures and improves novel object memory. Other Fmr1 KO-specific phenotypes were not improved by the drug, such as increased hippocampal dendritic spine density, open field activity and marble burying. Overall, this work shows that BAER-101 improves select phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice and encourages further studies into the efficacy of GABAA-receptor subunit-selective agonists for the treatment of FXS.","Schaefer, Tori L; Ashworth, Amy A; Tiwari, Durgesh; Tomasek, Madison P; Parkins, Emma V; White, Angela R; Snider, Andrew; Davenport, Matthew H; Grainger, Lindsay M; Becker, Robert A; Robinson, Chandler K; Mukherjee, Rishav; Williams, Michael T; Gibson, Jay R; Huber, Kimberly M; Gross, Christina; Erickson, Craig A",Frontiers in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.678090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093287/,316

It was conducted as a retrospective study at 3 centers (2 in Brazil and 1 in Chile). TECHNIQUE The apex technique is performed by using a HEM/EEA-33 stapler. A pursestring suture is placed at the apex of the prolapse, on the 4 quadrants, independent of the distance to the dentate line. A second pursestring is then placed to define the band of rectal mucosa to be symmetrically resected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included width of the resected full-thickness rectal wall; the intensity of postoperative pain on a visual analog scale from 1 to 10; full mucosal prolapse and rectal intussusception assessed by physical examination, cinedefecography, or echodefecography; and change in the constipation scale. RESULTS Forty-five patients (30 women/15 men; mean age, 59.5 years) with rectal intussusception and full mucosal prolapse were included. The median operative time was 17 (range, 15-30) minutes. Bleeding after stapler fire requiring manual suture occurred in 3 patients (6.7%); 25 (55.6%) patients reported having no postoperative pain. Hospital stay was 24 hours. The mean width of the resected rectal wall was 5.9 (range, 5.0-7.5) cm. Stricture at the staple line was seen in 4 patients, of whom 1 required dilation under anesthesia. The median follow-up time was 120 (range, 90-120) days. A small residual prolapse was identified in 6 (13.3%) patients. Imaging demonstrated complete disappearance of rectal intussusception in all patients, and the mean postoperative constipation score decreased from 13 (range, 8-15) to 5 (range, 3-7). CONCLUSIONS The apex technique appears to be a safe, quickly performed, and low-cost method for the treatment of rectal intussusception. In this series, imaging examinations showed the disappearance of rectal intussusception, and a significant decrease in constipation score suggested improvement in functional outcomes.","Regadas, F Sergio P; Abedrapo, Mario; Cruz, Jose Vinicius; Murad Regadas, Sthela M; Regadas Filho, F Sergio P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25285701/,316

In the majority of cases, the cause is often a local one, which can be managed using simple local measures. However, poor management can lead to potentially fatal consequences. The aim of this paper is to update clinicians on the dental management of patients with acquired or congenital bleeding disorders, and on how to decide the most appropriate setting for safe dental care. Patient safety in the NHS is a national priority with ever greater measures being put into place to avoid patient harm.

It is vitally important for government health authorities and leaders to have reliable estimates of infected cases and deaths in order to apply the necessary measures with the resources at their disposal. OBJECTIVE Test the validity of the logistic regression and Gompertz curve to forecast peaks of confi rmed cases and deaths in Cuba, as well as total number of cases. METHODS An inferential, predictive study was conducted using lo-gistic and Gompertz growth curves, adjusted with the least squares method and informatics tools for analysis and prediction of growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Italy and Spain-countries that have passed the initial peak of infection rates-were studied, and it was inferred from the results of these countries that their models were ap-plicable to Cuba. This hypothesis was tested by applying goodness-of-fi t and signifi cance tests on its parameters.RESULTS Both models showed good fi t, low mean square errors, and all parameters were highly signifi cant. CONCLUSIONS The validity of models was confi rmed based on logis-tic regression and the Gompertz curve to forecast the dates of peak infections and deaths, as well as total number of cases in Cuba.

OBJECTIVE To assess the change in the utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) services during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN This was a cross-sectional quantitative study. RESULTS During the COVID-19 outbreak in Rwanda, the utilization of 15 MCH services in all four categories-antenatal care (ANC), deliveries, postnatal care (PNC) and vaccinations-significantly declined. The Northern and Western Provinces were affected the most, with significant decrease in respectively nine and 12 services. The Eastern Province showed no statistically significant utilization changes. Kigali was the only province with significant increase in the fourth PNC visits for babies and mothers, while the Southern Province showed significant increase in utilization of measles + rubella (MR) 1 vaccination. CONCLUSION Access and utilization of basic MCH services were considerably affected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Rwanda. This study highlighted the need for pre-emptive measures to avoid disruptions in MCH service delivery and routine health services during outbreaks. In order for the reductions in MCH service utilization to be reversed, targeted resources and active promotion of ANC, institutional deliveries and vaccinations need to be prioritized. Further studies on long-term impact and geographical variations are needed.","Wanyana, D; Wong, R; Hakizimana, D",Public health action,https://doi.org/10.5588/pha.20.0057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777716/,316

157842,Letter: possible association of PPI use and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis--authors' reply.,2015,"Purpose: The number of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer is increasing, and the impacts of therapy on their daily lives are not well understood. Adaptive functions are required for age-appropriate interactions and day to day functioning, but are reduced in AYA survivors. Work in other pediatric populations suggests that additional neurocognitive skills may influence adaptive function and, thus, quality of life and personal attainment of AYA cancer survivors. Methods: Retrospective medical records review examined neurocognitive data from 139 AYA survivors. Hierarchical linear regression examined age at diagnosis, use of central nervous system (CNS) radiation, verbal intelligence, processing speed, and executive function as predictors of adaptive functioning domains. Results: AYA survivors exhibited weaknesses in all domains of adaptive functioning compared to normative reference values (Cohen's d = 0.660-0.864), as well as in processing speed (Cohen's d = 0.791) and metacognitive executive functioning (Cohen's d = 0.817). Processing speed and executive function provided substantial improvements in prediction of adaptive functioning beyond that of age at diagnosis and use of CNS-directed radiation therapy. Taken together these variables explained 37.1% of variability in adaptive conceptual skills, 26.1% in adaptive social skills, and 27.1% of adaptive practical skills. Conclusions: Intelligence, processing speed, and executive function significantly contribute to adaptive function scores in AYA cancer survivors and impact domains that are important to self-sufficiency and quality of life. Attention to neurocognitive function in all AYA cancer survivors is recommended in addition to referral for neuropsychological evaluation and tailoring interventions to address executive and adaptive functioning.","Thornton, Clifton P; Ruble, Kathy; Jacobson, Lisa A",Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,https://doi.org/10.1089/jayao.2020.0059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668177/,316
158518,Clinical study on swallowing function of brainstem stroke by tDCS.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND Prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation depresses diaphragmatic efficiency. Assisted modes of ventilation should improve it. We assessed the impact of pressure support ventilation versus neurally adjusted ventilator assist on diaphragmatic efficiency. METHOD Patients previously ventilated with controlled mechanical ventilation for 72 hours or more were randomized to be ventilated for 48 hours with pressure support ventilation (n =12) or neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (n = 13). Neuro-ventilatory efficiency (tidal volume/diaphragmatic electrical activity) and neuro-mechanical efficiency (pressure generated against the occluded airways/diaphragmatic electrical activity) were measured during three spontaneous breathing trials (0, 24 and 48 hours). Breathing pattern, diaphragmatic electrical activity and pressure time product of the diaphragm were assessed every 4 hours. RESULTS In patients randomized to neurally adjusted ventilator assist, neuro-ventilatory efficiency increased from 27 ± 19 ml/μV at baseline to 62 ± 30 ml/μV at 48 hours (p <0.0001) and neuro-mechanical efficiency increased from 1 ± 0.6 to 2.6 ± 1.1 cmH2O/μV (p = 0.033). In patients randomized to pressure support ventilation, these did not change. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, neural inspiratory time, pressure time product of the diaphragm and variability of the breathing pattern were significantly higher in patients ventilated with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist. The asynchrony index was 9.48 [6.38- 21.73] in patients ventilated with pressure support ventilation and 5.39 [3.78- 8.36] in patients ventilated with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (p = 0.04).

158523,Direct common carotid artery puncture for acute thrombectomy against ischemic stroke.,2018,"BMP2 stimulates bone formation and signals preferably through BMP receptor (BMPR) 1A while GDF5 is rather a cartilage inducer and signals preferably through BMPR1B. Consequently, BMPR1A and BMPR1B are believed to be involved in bone and cartilage formation, respectively. However, their function is not yet fully clarified. In this study, GDF5 mutants with a decreased affinity for BMPR1A were generated. These mutants, GDF5 and BMP2 were tested for BMPR1A or BMPR1B dimerization with BMPR2 and for their chondrogenic, hypertrophic and osteogenic properties in chondrocytes, in the multipotent mesenchymal precursor cells C3H10T1/2, and the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2. Mutants with the lowest potency for BMPR1A/BMPR2 dimerization exhibited minimal chondrogenic and osteogenic activities indicating that BMPR1A is necessary for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. BMP2, GDF5 and the R399E mutant stimulated expression of chondrogenic and hypertrophy markers in C3H10T1/2 cells and chondrocytes. However, R399E which dimerized BMPR1B and BMPR2 more potently than GDF5 or BMP2, displayed reduced hypertrophic activity. Therefore, we postulate that stronger BMPR1B signaling, compared to BMPR1A signaling, prevent chondrocyte hypertrophy and act as a cartilage stabilizer during joint morphogenesis.","Mang, Tanja; Kleinschmidt-Doerr, Kerstin; Ploeger, Frank; Schoenemann, Andreas; Lindemann, Sven; Gigout, Anne",Journal of cell science,https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.246934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764110/,316

Results from a survey of Italian physicians and literature review.,2021-08-01,"PURPOSE Several surgical approaches have been used for varicocelectomy. We report single port varicocelectomy using SILS™ (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) multiple access port. CASE The greade III varicocele patient was 23 years old and placed in supine position. About 2 cm vertical skin incision was made in a crease just lateral to the umbilicus and SILS™ port was placed with three 5-mm trocars. Incision to posterior peritoneum from the point 3 cm superior to the internal inguinal was made by needle holder with a broken 15th blade tip. The testicular vessels were exposed. The lymphatic vessels and testicular artery were identified and separated from the testicular vein with flexible laparoscopic instruments and conventional rigid instruments. Three testicular veins were clipped with hemoclips (EndoClip , Autosuture, Norwalk, CT). Posterior peritoneum was repaired with 4-0 vicryl with one side of 5 mm Hem-o-lok clip (Weck Research,Triangle Park, NC). Than the distal end of suture site was also closed with Hem-o-lok. RESULTS The whole procedure was completed with no complication. The operative time was 85 minutes, and blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged 2 days after the operation. Left scrotal pain and vein engorgement was disappeared. CONCLUSIONS Our single port varicocelectomy method is a safe and effective alternative to conventional method.

159693,Automated Entire Thrombus Density Measurements for Robust and Comprehensive Thrombus Characterization in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke.,2016,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that both infected and susceptible people wear face masks to protect against COVID-19. METHODS We develop a dynamic disease model to assess the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19, during an initial outbreak and a later resurgence, as a function of mask effectiveness, coverage, intervention timing, and time horizon. We instantiate the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in New York, with sensitivity analyses on key natural history parameters. RESULTS During the initial epidemic outbreak, with no social distancing, only 100% coverage of masks with high effectiveness can reduce the effective reproductive number Re below 1. During a resurgence, with lowered transmission rates due to social distancing measures, masks with medium effectiveness at 80% coverage can reduce Re below 1 but cannot do so if individuals relax social distancing efforts. Full mask coverage could significantly improve outcomes during a resurgence: with social distancing, masks with at least medium effectiveness could reduce Re below 1 and avert almost all infections, even with intervention fatigue. For coverage levels below 100%, prioritizing masks that reduce the risk of an infected individual from spreading the infection rather than the risk of a susceptible individual from getting infected yields the greatest benefit. LIMITATIONS Data regarding COVID-19 transmission are uncertain, and empirical evidence on mask effectiveness is limited. Our analyses assume homogeneous mixing, providing an upper bound on mask effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Even moderately effective face masks can play a role in reducing the spread of COVID-19, particularly with full coverage, but should be combined with social distancing measures to reduce Re below 1.[Box: see text].","Rao, Isabelle J; Vallon, Jacqueline J; Brandeau, Margaret L",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211019029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041970/,316

RIDs can trigger nosocomial infections if not adequately prevented. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to rate the adequacy of healthcare workers (HCWs) and hospital settings on RID prevention using unannounced standardized patients (USP) in clinical settings of hospital gateways. METHODS Trained USPs visited 5 clinical settings: information desks, registration desks, two outpatient departments and the emergency departments in 10 hospitals across 3 cities of Inner Mongolia, China. USPs observed the hospital air ventilation and distance from the nearest hand-washing facilities to each clinical setting, then mimicked symptoms of either tuberculosis or influenza before observing the HCW's behavior. A total of 480 clinical-setting assessments were made by 19 USPs. RESULTS The overall adequacy of triage services was 86.7% and for prevention of the spread of airborne droplets was 83.5%. Almost all hospitals offered adequate air ventilation. Compared to the information desk, adequacy of triage and preventing the spread of airborne droplets by physicians in the three clinical departments was less likely to be adequate. Triage services for USPs simulating symptoms of influenza were 2.6 times more likely to be adequate than for those simulating symptoms of tuberculosis but there was no significant difference in the prevention of the spread of airborne droplets. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to improve respiratory infectious disease procedures in our study hospitals, especially in outpatient and emergency departments.","Xie, Yijing; McNeil, Edward B; Sriplung, Hutcha; Fan, Yancun; Zhao, Xingsheng; Chongsuvivatwong, Virasakdi",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2020.1776015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32459978/,316

A better understanding of the aneurysm-parent vessel complex relationship may aid our understanding of this disease and to optimize its treatment. The ability of volumetric flow rate (VFR) waveform to reflect the arterial compliance modifications is well known. By analyzing the VFR waveform and the pulsatility in the parent vessel, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that (1) intracranial aneurysms might disrupt the blood flow of the parent vessel and (2) the treatment by FDS might have measurable corrective effect on these changes. Ten patients followed for unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by FDS and ten healthy volunteers as control group were included in this study. Two-dimensional quantitative phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on each patient on the ICA artery upstream and downstream to the aneurysm, and on each volunteer at similar locations. The aneurysms altered significantly the parent vessel pulsatility and this effect was correlated to their volume. The aneurysms treatment by FDS allowed for the restoration of a normally modulated flow and pulsatility correction in the parent vessel.","Eker, Omer F; Boudjeltia, Karim Zouaoui; Jerez, Ricardo A Corredor; Le Bars, Emmanuelle; Sanchez, Mathieu; Bonafé, Alain; Costalat, Vincent; Courbebaisse, Guy",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2015.176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264871/,316

The promoter region of IL-32, which showed functional polymorphism, could regulate IL-32 expression. Although IL-32 rs28372698 polymorphism was related to a lot of inflammatory diseases, the association of IL-32 rs28372698 polymorphism with hepatic flare of chronic HBV infection was not been reported. In the present study, IL-32 rs28372698 polymorphism was genotyped in 104 chronic HBV carriers and 151 active chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The frequency of IL-32 T/T genotype in patients with active CHB was significantly higher than that in chronic HBV carriers. Furthermore, the frequency of the T allele at IL-32 rs28372698 in active CHB patients was also higher than that in chronic HBV carriers.

161391,Time-outcome relationship in acute large-vessel occlusion exists across all ages: subanalysis of RESCUE-Japan Registry 2.,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND Despite the growing interest in investigating social harms from drinking, little is known about drinkers' reports of these harms and their gender differences among Australian young adults at age 30. We aimed to examine gender differences of social harms from drinking as reported by drinkers. METHODS 2,200 young adults at age 30 with complete data on social harms from drinking were drawn from the 30-year follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy. Measures included percentages of 11 past-year drinkers' self-reported social harms stratified by gender. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between gender and each social harm, accounting for relevant confounding. RESULTS More than one in five young adults (22%) reported at least one social harm in the past year. Among binge drinkers, 44% reported at least one social harm. After adjustments for social roles and binge drinking, we found no gender differences on several self-reported social harms: friendship problems, people criticizing drinking, non-marital family problems, employment problems, and alcohol-fuelled fights. However, men were more likely to report spousal threats to leave, drink-driving legal problems and financial problems. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that young adults are still vulnerable to risky drinking at age 30 and the social harm resulting from drinking. Thus, alcohol prevention campaigns should target this age group and include women in their focus. Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol-related harms, such as screening in clinical settings for risky drinking and alcohol-related harms, followed by motivational behavior interventions, could be beneficial among these vulnerable groups.","Meque, Ivete; Salom, Caroline L; Betts, Kim S; Najman, Jake; Alati, Rosa",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1767324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633690/,316

161535,The recovery of an elderly woman with asthma and diabetes from COVID-19 infection: a case report.,2021-03-02,"PURPOSE In the interventional treatment of cerebral aneurysms, flow diverter (FD) stents have played a significant role for more than a decade. Many studies have shown good aneurysm occlusion rates and low complication profiles. However, feared complications include acute thrombotic vessel occlusion due to stenotic deformation of the FD during release, the so-called twisting. This work investigates the behavior of different stent types to causative torsion forces in a mechanical model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Torsion characterization equipment was custom built, and two different FD stents (Derivo, Acandis and P64, Phenox) with n = 3 were tested. One end of the FD was fixed while the other end was twisted while measuring the torsion force. RESULTS In torsional force vs. the twisting angle graph, a very sharp decrease and increase in force was recorded when the stent collapsed or reopened, respectively, making it possible to characterize for twisting. All six devices showed partial/complete collapse on torsion and showed significant delayed reopening on untwisting. Interestingly on repeated testing, the stent collapsed at earlier angles, probably due to microscopic material defects. Slight variations between stents of the same type suggest that more extensive data sets are needed. CONCLUSIONS We report a new method to characterize torsion for braided FD stents, which is reliable and reproducible. Additionally, the delayed reopening and the tendency to collapse at earlier angles on consequent testing maneuvers can be significant for clinical usage.","Velvaluri, Prasanth; Hensler, Johannes; Wodarg, Fritz; Jansen, Olav; Quandt, Eckhard",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00991-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491133/,316

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: The electronic databases CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Medline, and Embase (OvidSP) were systematically searched from 1st April, 1996 to 4th February, 2021. Eligibility criteria: The main inclusion criterion was that the study, using empirical quantitative methods, addressed the effectiveness of PACs. Data extraction and synthesis: Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened in duplicate by two authors. Risk of bias assessment, using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies, and data extraction were performed by one author and checked by the other author. Results were synthesised narratively owing to the heterogeneity of the included studies. Results: Seven prospective controlled studies were conducted. Most studies had a high risk of bias. Three studies reported a significant reduction in the length of the hospital stay, and two studies reported a significant reduction in cancellation of surgery for medical reasons when patients were seen in the PAC. In addition, the included studies presented mixed results regarding anxiety in patients. Conclusion: This systematic review demonstrated a reduction in the length of hospital stay and cancellation of surgery when the patients had been assessed in the PAC.

168209,What role for asbestos in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis? Findings from the IPF job exposures study,2021-03-12,"Using gravitational wave observations to search for deviations from general relativity in the strong-gravity regime has become an important research direction. Chern Simons (CS) gravity is one of the most frequently studied parity-violating models of strong gravity. It is known that the Kerr black-hole is not a solution for CS gravity. At the same time, the only rotating solution available in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating case most accurately known to quadratic order in spin. In this work, for the slow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear perturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to linear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter ($\alpha$) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies. After confirming the recent results of Wagle et al. (2021), we find an additional contribution to the eigenfrequency correction at the leading perturbative order of $\alpha^2$. Unlike Wagle et al., we also find corrections to frequencies in the polar sector. We compute these extra corrections by evaluating the expectation values of the perturbative potential on unperturbed QNM wavefunctions along a contour deformed into the complex-$r$ plane. For $\alpha=0.1 M^2$, we obtain the ratio of the imaginary parts of the dCS correction to the GR correction in the first QNM frequency (in the polar sector) to be $0.263$ implying significant change. For the $(2,2)-$mode, the dCS corrections make the imaginary part of the first QNM of the fundamental mode less negative, thereby decreasing the decay rate. Our results, along with future gravitational wave observations, can be used to test for dCS gravity and further constrain the CS coupling parameters.

Here, we examined associations between COVID-19-related stress and body image disturbance, as well as the potential mediating and moderating role of self-compassion. During the third lockdown in the United Kingdom, we asked an online sample of adults (N = 600) to complete measures of COVID-19-related stress, body image disturbance, and self-compassion. Mediation analysis showed that higher COVID-19-related stress was significantly associated with greater body image disturbance, and that this relationship was mediated by self-compassion. In contrast, self-compassion did not significantly moderate the effects of stress on body image disturbance. These results suggest that promoting greater self-compassion may be a viable means of mitigating adverse outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic on body image disturbance.","Swami, Viren Todd Jennifer Robinson Charlotte Furnham Adrian",Personality and Individual Differences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111130,316

Subsequently, the kernel TD (KTD) based unsupervised FE was applied to two synthetic examples as well as real data sets, and the findings were compared with those obtained previously using the TD-based unsupervised FE approaches. The KTD-based unsupervised FE outperformed or performed comparably with the TD-based unsupervised FE in large p small n situations, which are situations involving a limited number of samples with many variables (observations). Nevertheless, the KTD-based unsupervised FE outperformed the TD-based unsupervised FE in non large p small n situations. In general, although the use of the kernel trick can help the TD-based unsupervised FE gain more variations, a wider range of problems may also be encountered. Considering the outperformance or comparable performance of the KTD-based unsupervised FE compared to the TD-based unsupervised FE when applied to large p small n problems, it is expected that the KTD-based unsupervised FE can be applied in the genomic science domain, which involves many large p small n problems, and, in which, the TD-based unsupervised FE approach has been effectively applied.","Taguchi, Y-h.; Turki, Turki",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.333195,316

Retention is associated with increased symptom burden, low health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and high mortality. Improved clearance, using novel medium cut-off dialyzers, termed expanded dialysis (HDx) may be associated with improved subjective experience. We have previously developed a dynamic patient reported outcome measure (PROM) instrument, to allow iterative recording to better appreciate the overall burden of disease and assess the impact of therapy changes. Study Design Single-centre interventional pilot study Setting & Participants Twenty-eight patients established on maintenance HD - London, Ontario, Canada. Intervention Initial study consisting of two-week observation (baseline-conventional high-flux HD), followed by 12-weeks HDx. HR-QoL was assessed using dynamic PROM instrument thrice weekly (enabled in a dedicated app as the London Evaluation of Illness-LEVIL). Extension phase – two-week baseline with 24-weeks HDx and eight-week wash-out. Outcomes Principal aim was to establish if HDx therapy was associated with improved HR-QoL, evidence of dose dependant response and if effects were durable over time;utilizing LEVIL. Results Patients with lower LEVIL scores (&lt;70/100) at baseline showed improvement in overall HR-QoL after eight-weeks of therapy with similar carry-over effect. General wellbeing, energy and sleep quality were improved significantly as a consequence of HDx therapy. There were no detrimental effects of HDx detected in patients with higher baseline HR-QoL. Limitations Small non-randomized sample size. COVID-19 pandemic interfered with extension phase. Conclusions Dynamic PROM assessment effectively identified patients with lower HR-QoL and higher symptom burden, demonstrating durable time/dose-dependent improvements across a range of symptom domains. The use of this instrument may allow targeted selection of patients most likely to benefit from HDx therapy and assist in monitoring response and defining effect-size and treatment duration to allow optimal design of further definitive randomized controlled trials of this newly introduced technology.","Penny, Jarrin D.; Jarosz Mmasc, Patricia Salerno Fabio R.; Lemoine, Sandrine McIntyre Christopher W.",Kidney Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xkme.2021.05.010,316

177522,Anti-PF4 levels of patients with VITT do not reduce 4 months following AZD1222 vaccination,2021-08-23,"Background: Older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face unique challenges, especially when their support structure is disrupted, as happened during the Covid-19 lockdown. We evaluated the clinical and psychological impact of this imposed isolation on the older population with T1D. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with older adults with T1D who were part of an ongoing study, which was paused from March - August 2020. The interviews were performed between May - August 2020, and were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using content analysis to derive theme. A multidisciplinary team of 12 individuals coded the interviews to identify the themes and included geriatricians, endocrinologists, a nurse educator, infomaticists, an economist, a methodologist, and research assistants. Results: We have analyzed 12/35 interviews at this time;mean age 74±4 years, 50% female, 92% non-Hispanic white, mean duration of diabetes 37±18 years, and A1C 7.3±0.7%. Three main themes have emerged. The challenges related to diabetes care included fear of hypoglycemia, interruption in supply chain related to diabetes technology (insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) supplies), use of telehealth, diabetes-related distress, and adapting to new routines in self-care (diet and exercise). Challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic included fear of getting Covid-19 infection, and a lack of reliable information on pandemic. The challenges related to psychological well-being included a feeling of isolation, loneliness, inability to spend time with family and friends, lack of in-person communication, and lack of recreational activity. Conclusion: The results of this qualitative study help to understand critical areas of need when social support structures are unavailable to older adults with T1D. Our results will help develop intervention strategies to overcome barriers in maintaining support for this vulnerable population.","Munshi, Medha Slyne Christine Sifre Kayla Davis Dai'quann J.; Dewar, Rachel Sy Sarah M.; Atakov-Castillo, Astrid Michals Amy Haque Saira N.; Neuwahl, Simon Cummings Stirling Brown Stephen L.; Weinger, Katie Toschi Elena",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-572-p,316

Infected Patients experienced mild to severe symptoms, resulting in several fatalities due to a weak understanding of its pathogenesis, which is the same even to date. This cross-sectional study has been designed on four hundred and fifty-two symptomatic, mild-to-moderate, and severe/critical patients to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with their comorbidities and response to treatment. The mean age of studied patients was (58{+/-}14.42) years, and the overall male to female ratio was 61.7 to 38.2%, respectively. 27.3% of the patients had a history of exposure, 11.9% travel history, while for 60% of patients, the source of infection was unknown. The most prevalent signs and symptoms in ICU patients were dry coughs, myalgias, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal discomfort, and abnormal Chest X-ray (p<0.001), along with the high percentage of hypertension (p=0.007) and COPD (p=0.029) as leading comorbidities. Complete Blood Counts indicators were significantly increased in severe patients, while the Coagulation Profile and D-dimer values were significantly higher in mild-to-moderate (non-ICU) patients (p < 0.001). Serum Creatinine (1.22 umole L-1; p = 0.016) and LDH (619 umol L-1; p < 0.001) indicators were significantly high in non-ICU patients while, raised values of Total Bilirubin (0.91 umol L-1; p = 0.054), CRP (84.68 mg L-1; p = 0.001) and Ferritin (996.81 mg L-1; p < 0.001) were found in ICU patients. Drug Dexamethasone was the leading prescribed and administrated medicine to the COVID-19 patients, followed by Remdesivir, Meropenem, Heparin, and Tocilizumab, respectively. A characteristic pattern of Ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening were prominent in severely infected patients.

178008,How to organize an online conference -- Lessons learned from Cool Stars 20.5 (virtually cool),2021-05-18,"Because of the increased temporal and spatial resolutions of the sensors onboard recently launched satellites, satellite-based surface aerosol concentration, which is usually estimated from the aerosol optical depth (AOD), is expected to become a strategic tool for air quality studies in the future. By further exploring the relationships of aerosol concentrations and their optical properties using ground observations, the accuracies of these products can be improved. Here, we analyzed collocated observations of surface mass concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC), as well as columnar aerosol optical properties from a sky radiometer and aerosol extinction profiles obtained by multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS), during the 2019–2020 period. We focused the analyses on a daily scale, emphasizing the role of the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region. Generally, the correlation between the AOD of the fine fraction (i.e., fAOD) and the PM2.5 surface concentration was moderately strong, regardless of considerations of boundary layer humidity and altitude. In contrast, the fAOD of the partial column below 1 km, which was obtained by combining sky radiometer and MAX-DOAS retrievals, better reproduced the variability of the PM2.5 and resulted in a linear relationship. In the same manner, we demonstrated that the absorption AOD of the fine fraction (fAAOD) of the partial column was related to the variability of the BC concentration. Analogous analyses based on aerosol products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) confirmed these findings and highlighted the importance of the shape of the aerosol profile. Overall, our results indicated a remarkable consistency among the retrieved datasets, and between the datasets and MERRA-2 products. These results confirmed the well-known sensitivity to aerosol absorption in the UV spectral region;they also highlighted the efficacy of combined MAX-DOAS and sky radiometer observations.","Damiani, Alessandro Irie Hitoshi Yamaguchi Kodai Hossain Mohammed Syedul Hoque Nakayama Tomoki Matsumi Yutaka Kondo Yutaka Arlindo Da Silva",Remote Sensing,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13163163,316

First, we used molecular docking of human TMPRSS2 protein to predict the binding site of TMPRSS2, especially the TMPRSS2 link loops, in order to assess the effect TMPRSS2 SNPs. The latter lead to missense variants on the interaction between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV2 S protein. In a second step, we further refine our analysis by performing a structure-function analysis of the complexes using PyMol software, and finally by MD simulations to validate the as-obtained results. Our findings show that 17 SNPs among the 692 natural TMPRSS2 coding variants are in positions to influence the binding of TMPRSS2 with the viral S protein. All of them give more important interaction energy as assessed by docking. Among the 17 SNPs, four missense variants E389A, K392Q, T393S and Q438E lead to “directly increasing” the interaction affinity and 2 missense variants R470I and Y416C cause it “directly decreasing”. The R470I and Y416C present in African and American population, respectively. While the other 4 SNP variants (E389A; K392Q; T393S and Q438E) are present only in the European population, which could link the viral infection susceptibility to demographic, geographic and genetic factors.","Nouira, Fatma; Hamdi, Manel; Redissi, Alaeddine; Kouidhi, Soumaya; Charfeddine, Cherine; M’saad, Meriem; Cherif, Ameur; Messaoudi, Sabri; Aldulaijan, Sarah; Raouafi, Noureddine; Dhouib, Adnene; Mosbah, Amor",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462283,316

179124,Sickle Cell Pain: Intervention with Capsaicin Exposure (SPICE),2020,"We developed an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) of the poorly water-soluble molecule niclosamide that achieved more than a 2-fold increase in bioavailability. Notably, this niclosamide ASD formulation increased the apparent drug solubility about 60-fold relative to the crystalline material due to the generation of nanoparticles. Niclosamide is a weakly acidic drug, BCS class II, and a poor glass former with low bioavailability in vivo. Hot-melt extrusion is a high-throughput manufacturing method commonly used in the development of ASDs for increasing the apparent solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble compounds. We utilized the polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate (PVP–VA) to manufacture niclosamide ASDs by extrusion. Samples were analyzed based on their microscopic and macroscopic behavior and their intermolecular interactions, using DSC, XRD, NMR, FTIR, and DLS. The niclosamide ASD generated nanoparticles with a mean particle size of about 100 nm in FaSSIF media. In a side-by-side diffusion test, these nanoparticles produced a 4-fold increase in niclosamide diffusion. We successfully manufactured amorphous extrudates of the poor glass former niclosamide that showed remarkable in vitro dissolution and diffusion performance. These in vitro tests were translated to a rat model that also showed an increase in oral bioavailability.","Jara, Miguel O.; Warnken, Zachary N.; Williams, Robert O.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.424004,316
179390,Clinical features and management of pediatric patients presenting with new onset acute leukemia and concomitant COVID-19,2021,"Background: Shatavari has long been used as an Ayurvedic herb for women's health, but empirical evidence for its effectiveness has been lacking. Shatavari contains phytoestrogenic compounds that bind to the estradiol receptor, and may therefore benefit postmenopausal women since postmenopausal estradiol deficiency contributes to sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Methods: In a randomised double-blind trial, 20 postmenopausal women (68.5 {+/-} 6 y) ingested either placebo (N=10) or shatavari (N=10; 1000 mg/d, equivalent to 26,500 mg/d fresh weight shatavari) for 6 weeks. Handgrip and knee extensor strength were measured at baseline and at 6 weeks. Vastus lateralis (VL) biopsy samples were obtained. Data are presented and analysed (t test/Mann Whitney U) as difference scores (Week 6 - baseline, median {+/-} interquartile range). Results: Handgrip, (but not knee extensor) strength was improved by shatavari supplementation (shatavari +0.7 {+/-} 1.1 kg, placebo -0.4 {+/-} 1.3 kg; p=0.04). Myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation, a known marker of improved myosin contractile function, was increased in VL following shatavari supplementation (immunoblotting; placebo -0.08 {+/-} 0.5 a.u. shatavari +0.3 {+/-} 1 arbitrary units (a.u.); p=0.03). Shatavari increased phosphorylation of Aktser473 (Aktser473 (placebo -0.6 {+/-} 0.6 a.u. shatavari +0.2 {+/-} 1.3 a.u; p=0.03) in VL. Shatavari supplementation did not alter plasma markers of bone turnover (P1NP, {beta}-CTX) and stimulation of human osteoblasts with pooled sera (N=8 per condition) from placebo and shatavari supplementation conditions did not alter cytokine or metabolic markers of osteoblast activity. Conclusions: Shatavari may improve muscle function and contractility via myosin conformational change and warrants further investigation of its utility in conserving musculoskeletal function in postmenopausal women.

180186,Corticospinal neuroplasticity and sensorimotor recovery in rats treated by infusion of neurotrophin-3 into disabled forelimb muscles started 24 h after stroke,2018-07-11,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics around the world have created public health concern with the unavailability of effective drugs and vaccines. This emphasizes the need for molecular understanding of host-virus interactions for developing effective targeted antivirals. Microarray analysis was carried out using CHIKV strain (Prototype and Indian) infected Vero cells and two host isozymes, MK2 and MK3 were selected for further analysis. Gene silencing and drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3 in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation (a) inhibitor (CMPD1) treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role of MAPKAPKs during the late phase of CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness of this drug against CHIKV. Additionally, CMPD1 also inhibited HSV1 and SARS CoV2-19 infection in vitro. Taken together it can be proposed that MK2 and MK3 are crucial host factors for CHIKV infection and can be considered as key targets for developing effective anti-CHIKV strategies in future. Author summary Chikungunya virus has been a dreaded disease from the first time it occurred in 1952 Tanzania. Since then it has been affecting the different parts of the world at different time periods in large scale. It is typically transmitted to humans by bites of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Although, studies have been undertaken to combat the disease still there are no effective strategies like vaccines or antivirals against it. Therefore it is essential to understand the virus and host interaction to overcome this hurdle. In this study two host factors MK2 and MK3 have been taken into consideration to see how they regulate the multiplication of the virus. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of MK2 and MK3 restricted viral infection Further, it was observed that this is due to the blocking of lamellipodium formation by modifying the factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Besides, decreased disease score as well as better survivability was noticed in the in vivo experiments with mice. Therefore, MK2 and MK3 could be considered as the key targets for controlling CHIKV infection.","Mamidi, Prabhudutta; Nayak, Tapas Kumar; Kumar, Abhishek; Kumar, Sameer; Chatterjee, Sanchari; De, Saikat; Datey, Ankita; Laha, Eshna; Ray, Amrita; Chattopadhyay, Subhasis; Chattopadhyay, Soma",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445768,316

Over the last few decades, higher education institutions have tried to incorporate the use of technological devices to university teaching, by redesigning and optimizing the learning experiences through a mixed teaching model. In this context, the Flipped Classroom (FC) model is one of the pedagogical models that is revolutionizing the scope of education. However, there is still not enough evidence of its advantages and disadvantages in the university stage. Therefore, it is important to analyze the impact of the FC on the learning, satisfaction and interaction of the different agents of the university community. Due to the idiosyncrasy of the present study, an exclusively qualitative and longitudinal methodology was selected;thus, 266 interviews based on open questions were conducted throughout the last five years. The results show that students value the FC model positively and corroborate its great potential from academic, competence, personal and social perspectives. Nevertheless, a small group of students are still very critical about the model and would prefer to keep using a traditional methodology, mainly due to the lack of habit using active methodologies and establishing the learning commitment required by such methodologies.","Diaz, M.

183983,A multicenter pilot-randomized controlled trial of the feasibility of an augmented red blood cell transfusion strategy for patients treated with induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia or stem cell transplantation.,2008,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) vaccination is imperative for preventing disease transmission and combating the associated mortality. Vaccination in the setting of transplantation is a complex issue. Owing to the chronic immunocompromised state in a transplant recipient, the immunogenicity of the vaccines is expected to be attenuated. Immunizing pretransplant patients will also be a challenge, as chronic kidney disease is also an immunocompromised state causing a lower seroconversion rate. The protective immune response generated is also expected to fade earlier. Enumerable psychosocial barriers exist regarding vaccine acceptance and a tender bond between health care providers and patients is essential for the smooth conduct of the vaccination program. The tolerability and safety profile of different available vaccines are reassuring in the general population but more data are needed in transplant communities. In addition, the efficacy data of COVID-19 vaccines are derived from the general population and preliminary reports in transplant patients have shown weakened immune response to vaccination. As of May 2021, Indian government advisories have approved three vaccines: COVIDSHIELD, COVAXIN, and Sputnik. Hence, research on vaccine efficacy with different vaccine constituents, dosing, and intervals is necessary for an effective protocol for vaccination in transplantation. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

184227,"Glycerol kinase deficiency presenting with hypodipsia, osmotic diuresis and severe hypernatraemia.",2005,"In late December 2019, an epidemic of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was informed, and because of the quick diffusion of the infection in various regins of the world, the World Health Organization proclaimed an emergency. In this context, researchers are urged and encouraged to research in various fields, to stop the spread of this deadly virus. To this end, we propose a systematic review that addresses the techniques and methods of artificial intelligence in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. The main aim of the current systematic review was to highlight the gaps and challenges within the academic literature of the disease COVID-19, which included the characteristics of the data, machine learning algorithms applied to the diagnosis of COVID-19, and using natural language processing (NLP)to reveal clinical data for COVID-19 disease.Seven reliable databases were used, namely Web of Science, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, PubMed, springer and google scholar, to obtain studies related to the specific topic many filtering and surveying stages were conducted consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to screen the acquired 1115 papers.We identified the bottleneck in explaining data as one of the major barriers to machine learning and NLP approaches. Supervised machine learning has been explored as an active method for diagnosing COVID-19 disease. Future studies in this area will benefit from alternatives like increasing the volume of data, using intelligence swarms to obtain accurate features, and using unsupervised learning that does not require explanatory data. Thus, this research supported us to get a more practical comprehension of the gaps and provide possible solutions for filling these gaps. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Mahdi, A. Y.; Yuhaniz, S.

184719,Iodine Concentration and Optimization in Computed Tomography Angiography: Current Issues.,2016,"Background: In 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) published a set of 21 global development goals (DGs) that bring together workforce/education [W], practice [P], and science [S] in a transformative framework, defining an improved and more advanced pharmacy profession for the next decade. This paper aims to benchmark the context of the Lebanese pharmacy profession with the respective elements of the FIP DGs to optimise the previously suggested strategic plan. Methods: A group of pharmacy researchers with extensive academic, professional, and post-educational experience endeavoured to map the FIP DGs with the work produced in Lebanon, describing the current situation. The documents mapped were sought from published literature and white papers developed by academia and the Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon (OPL), the national pharmacists' association. Results: This study found that efforts are necessary to bridge the gap between the current situation of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon and optimal practice. In the short term, existing projects should be immediately implemented, e.g. pharmacy curricula reforms and accreditation, postgraduate training, recognising pharmacy specialities, organising the profession, and assessing advanced competencies. In parallel, related policies and regulations should be updated. Cultural changes, involving closer ties between education and practice, are required to reform the pharmacy profession. In the medium term, a national research strategy, including earlycareer scientists mentoring and assessment tools validation, is necessary. Digitalising the patient profile and medication safety reporting and updating the pharmacists' database through appropriate platforms are also essential steps toward modernising pharmacy. Conclusion: Authorities and stakeholders should combine and coordinate efforts to implement existing plans and develop necessary strategies for optimizing pharmacy education, workforce, practice, and research, which is expected to bridge the gap between the challenging current situation of the profession in Lebanon and its optimal future development, for the best of the pharmacist and the patient's health.","Sacre, H.; Akel, M.; Zeenny, R.; Hajj, A.; Hallit, S.; Salameh, P.",Pharmacy Education,https://doi.org/10.46542/pe.2021.211.105120,316

186322,Hyperacute Carotid Stent Thrombosis During Emergent Revascularization Treated with Intraarterial Eptifibatide After Systemic Administration of Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator.,2015,"OBJECTIVES: In late 2019, a novel respiratory disease was identified as it began to spread rapidly within China’s Hubei Province soon thereafter, being designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Unfortunately, trends in cases and rates of infection have been consistently misunderstood, particularly within the media, due to little, if any, statistical analysis of trends. Critical analysis of data is necessary to determine how to best manage local restrictions, particularly if there are resurgences of infection. As such, researchers have been calling for data-driven, statistical analysis of trends of disease to provide more context and validity for significant policy decisions. METHODS: This quantitative study sought to explore different statistical methods that can be used to evaluate trend data to improve decision-making and public information on the spread of COVID-19. Analyses were conducted using Spearman’s rho, Mann-Whitney U tests, Mann-Kendal tests, and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests with follow up Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin tests. RESULTS: The results indicated a mix of both surprising and expected findings. Variations among COVID case reporting for each day of the week were identified but not deemed significant. Spearman correlation data appeared to perform well in identifying monotonic trend while Mann-Kendal tests appeared to provide the most intelligible results. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides examples of statistical tools and procedures to more thoroughly examine trends in COVID-19 case rate data. It is advocated that such metrics be made available to health and policy stakeholders for potential use for public health decisions.","Ison, David",Int J Health Sci (Qassim),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475210/,316

The method employed six specially designed primers that recognized eight distinct regions of the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene for amplification of target sequences under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C for 1 h Amplification of RT-LAMP was monitored by addition of calcein before amplification. A positive reaction was confirmed by change from light-brown to yellow-green under visual detection. Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was validated by cross-reaction with different human coronaviruses, norovirus, influenza A virus, and influenza B virus. Sensitivity was evaluated by serial dilution of HCoV-NL63 RNA from 1.6 x 10(9) to 1.6 x 10(1) per reaction. The RT-LAMP assay could achieve 1,600 RNA copies per reaction with high specificity. Hence, our colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could be used for rapid detection of human coronavirus NL63.","Geng, Heyuan; Wang, Shengqiang; Xie, Xiaoqian; Xiao, Yu; Zhang, Ting; Tan, Wenjie; Su, Chuan",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27295884/,316

The virus subsequently spread worldwide, causing havoc to medical systems and paralyzing global economies. The first COVID-19 patient in Israel was diagnosed on 27 February 2020. OBJECTIVES To present our findings and experiences as the first and largest center for COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS The current analysis included all COVID-19 patients treated in Sheba Medical Center from February 2020 to April 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data gathered during their hospitalization are presented. RESULTS Our 162 patient cohort included mostly adult (mean age of 52 ± 20 years) males (65%). Patients classified as severe COVID-19 were significantly older and had higher prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes. They also had significantly higher white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and lactate dehydrogenase. Low folic acid blood levels were more common amongst severe patients (18.2 vs. 12.9 vs. 9.8, P = 0.014). The rate of immune compromised patients (12%) in our cohort was also higher than in the general population. The rate of deterioration from moderate to severe disease was high: 9% necessitated non-invasive oxygenation and 15% were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The mortality rate was 3.1. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients present a challenge for healthcare professionals and the whole medical system.

The objective was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, evolution and severity of COVID-19 in a third-level hospital, in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We conducted a retrospective cohort of 101 patients with COVID-19 from March 3 to June 21, 2020. The patients were divided according to the presence or absence of pneumonia and the severity of the disease. The median age was 42 years and 53% were women. The most common symptoms were fever 66% and cough 57%. Dyspnea and fever were associated with the presence of pneumonia. The most prevalent comorbidities were: hypertension 22%, obesity 18%, cardiovascular disease 7% and chronic respiratory disease 7%. The presence of any comorbidity and hypertension were more common in severe cases. The most frequent laboratory findings were: lymphopenia 55%, elevated D-dimer 38%, and thrombocytopenia 20%. In severe diseases, the level of C-reactive protein and D-dimer were higher. Twenty six patients had pneumonia and 24% were healthcare workers. For diagnosis, more than one reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample was needed in 24% of cases. A moderate-high value of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was more prevalent in severe than mild pneumonia (63% vs. 17%, p 0.032). A mortality of 5% was registered (95% CI 1-11%). The clinical characteristics, severity and prognosis were similar to those described worldwide. We highlight a high proportion of healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 positive, the false negative rate of the RT-PCR and the usefulness of the PSI to discriminate the severity of pneumonia.","Castro, Horacio M; Canale, Hernan L; Ferreyro, Bruno L; Prieto, Manuel A; Massimino, Brenda E; Funtowicz, Gabriel; Maritano Furcada, Joaquín",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481731/,316

192506,Detailed study of graft sinking and worsening of the fused segment angle in patients with cervical disease treated with the Williams-Isu method.,2011,"Arenaviruses share a common strategy for glycoprotein synthesis and processing in which a mannose-rich precursor glycoprotein, termed GP-C in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), is posttranslationally processed by oligosaccharide trimming and proteolytic cleavage to yield two structural glycoproteins, GP-1 and GP-2. Mapping the orientation and proteolytic cleavage site(s) in such polyproteins has traditionally required direct protein sequencing of one or more of the cleaved products. This technique requires rigorous purification of the products for sequencing and may be complicated by amino-terminal modifications which interfere with sequence analysis. We used an alternative approach in which synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences bracketing a potential protease cleavage site were used to raise antisera which define the boundaries of the cleaved products. We found that cleavage of LCMV GP-C to yield GP-1 and GP-2 occurs within a 9-amino-acid stretch of GP-C which contains a paired basic amino acid group -Arg-Arg-, corresponding to amino acids 262 to 263 in the LCMV GP-C sequence. By comparison with the predicted amino acid sequences of a second LCMV strain, LCMV-WE, as well as with the deduced amino acid sequences of the New World arenavirus Pichinde and the Old World virus Lassa, we observed similar conservation of paired basic and flanking amino acid sequences among these viruses.","Buchmeier, M J; Southern, P J; Parekh, B S; Wooddell, M K; Oldstone, M B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3546729/,316

193905,"A SINGLE NEGATIVE SARS-COV2 RT-PCR TEST DOES NOT EXCLUDE COVID-19 IN PATIENT WITH SEVERE ARDS, CASE STUDY.",2020,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, an enteropathogenic coronavirus of swine, is a potent inducer of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have shown that virus-infected fixed cells or viral suspensions were able to induce an early and strong IFN-alpha synthesis by naive lymphocytes. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral membrane glycoprotein M (29,000; formerly E1) were found to markedly inhibit virus-induced IFN production, thus assigning to M protein a potential effector role in this phenomenon (B. Charley and H. Laude, J. Virol. 62:8-11, 1988). The present report describes the selection and characterization of a collection of 125 mutant viruses which escaped complement-mediated neutralization by two IFN induction-blocking anti-M protein monoclonal antibodies. Two of these mutants, designated H92 and dm49-4, were found to exhibit a markedly reduced interferogenic activity. IFN synthesis by lymphocytes incubated with purified suspensions of these mutants was 30- to 300-fold lower than that of the parental virus. The transcription of IFN-alpha genes following induction by each mutant was decreased proportionally, as evidenced by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. The sequence of the M gene of 20 complement-mediated neutralization-resistant mutants, including the 2 defective mutants, was determined by direct sequencing of genome RNA. Thirteen distinct amino acid changes were predicted, all located at positions 6 to 22 from the N terminus of the mature M protein and within the putative ectodomain of the molecule. Two substitutions, Thr-17 to Ile and Ser-19 to Pro, were assumed to generate the defective phenotypes of mutants dm49-4 and H92, respectively. The alteration of an Asn-Ser-Thr sequence in dm49-4 virus led to the synthesis of an M protein devoid of a glycan side chain, which suggests a possible involvement of this structure in IFN induction. Overall, these data supported the view that an interferogenic determinant resides in the N-terminal, exposed part of the molecule and provided further evidence for the direct role of M protein in the induction of IFN-alpha by transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The acronym VIP (viral interferogenic protein) is proposed as a designation for this particular class of proteins.","Laude, H; Gelfi, J; Lavenant, L; Charley, B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1309909/,316

Methods The quasi-experimental study will consist of a series of six online research workshops conducted over Zoom for surgical residents across Pakistan. An online sign-up form will be circulated on social media to current surgical residents throughout Pakistan. Curricular content covered in the workshops will be developed in collaboration with experienced research faculty at the Departments of Surgery and Community Health Sciences at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Facilitators of the workshops will be current surgical residents with a solid track record of research involvement at the hospital. Improvement in research-related knowledge and skills will be assessed through pre- and post-tests for each workshop. A post-series feedback form will assess satisfaction with the organisation, content relevance, peer-teaching and online delivery of the workshops. Long-term research involvement and output will be assessed by follow-up surveys at 6 months and 1 year post-workshop. All data-collection will be done via Google Forms. For ethical purposes, informed consent will be taken from participants prior to enrolment; data will be collected using a unique identifier number to maintain anonymity; and the only incentive provided to participants will be a Certificate of Completion for the research workshop series. RESULTS We expect that surgical trainees participating in the series of six research workshops will demonstrate a highly significant percentage improvement (p<0.001) in the pre- and post-tests for each of the six core research competencies taught. On post-series feedback, we expect the majority of participants (>80%) to rate the overall organisation, effectiveness of online mode of instruction, and relevance to surgical training of the workshops as excellent/good. We also expect that most participants (>80%) would strongly agree/agree that peer-education is an effective model of teaching in research workshops. Finally, we expect statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in research involvement and output in terms of publications as assessed in the 6 months and 1year post-workshop follow-up surveys. CONCLUSIONS In light of the ever-growing need for academic surgeons in Pakistan, this research protocol details a comprehensive strategy for research capacity-building among surgical trainees across the country. By equipping trainees with the knowledge and skills to conduct high-quality research, virtual research workshops provide a novel, grassroots-level and sustainable solution for addressing the surgical research crisis in Pakistan.","Martins, Russell Seth; Ukrani, Ronika Devi; Raza Raja, Mohummad Hassan; Khan, Maria; Iftikhar, Haissan; Fatima, Syeda Sadia; Fatimi, Saulat Hasnain",JPMA.

Incorporation of inverted-cone-shaped lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the outer leaflet of target membranes has been shown previously to impair fusion mediated by class I viral fusion proteins, e.g., the influenza virus hemagglutinin. It has been suggested that these results provide evidence for the stalk-pore model of fusion, which involves a hemifusion intermediate (stalk) with highly bent outer membrane leaflets. Here, we investigated the effect of inverted-cone-shaped LPCs and the cone-shaped oleic acid (OA) on the membrane fusion activity of a virus with a class II fusion protein, the flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). This study included an analysis of lipid mixing, as well as of the steps preceding or accompanying fusion, i.e., binding to the target membrane and lipid-induced conformational changes in the fusion protein E. We show that the presence of LPC in the outer leaflet of target liposomes strongly inhibited TBEV-mediated fusion, whereas OA caused a very slight enhancement, consistent with a fusion mechanism involving a lipid stalk. However, LPC also impaired the low-pH-induced binding of a soluble form of the E protein to liposomes and its conversion into a trimeric postfusion structure that requires membrane binding at low pH. Because inhibition is already observed before the lipid-mixing step, it cannot be determined whether impairment of stalk formation is a contributing factor in the inhibition of fusion by LPC. These data emphasize, however, the importance of the composition of the target membrane in its interactions with the fusion peptide that are crucial for the initiation of fusion.","Stiasny, Karin; Heinz, Franz X",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15280462/,316

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the presentation and management of patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting with acute appendicitis to the emergency department of a large tertiary center during March and April 2020. Clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management were compared. RESULTS Seventy-four patients presented with acute appendicitis during the pandemic compared to 60 patients during the same time the year before. There were no significant differences in patient demographics: age (P = 0.65), gender (P = 0.73), smoking status (P = 0.48). During COVID-19 patients were more likely to complain of right lower quadrant pain (100% vs. 78.3%, P < 0.01). Rates of surgical treatment was similar (83.8% vs. 81.7%, P = 1); mean operative time was longer during COVID-19 (63 ± 23 vs. 52 ± 26 minutes, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in intra-operative findings including the presence of appendiceal perforation (16.3% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.8), abscess (6.1% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.73), or involvement of cecum or terminal ileum (14.28% vs. 19.63%, P = 1).

METHODS The effect of HFNC applied in the first imported MERS patient with complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to China was observed. The patient was admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital on May 28th, 2015, and the changes in various clinical parameters and their significance were analyzed. RESULTS A 43-year old male was admitted to negative pressure isolation intensive care unit with the complaint of back ache for 7 days and fever for 2 days. Vital signs and saturation of pulse oximetry (SpO2) were monitored continuously. After admission, ribavirin was given orally for 12 days and α-interferon was administered once on the first day. However, after 2-week anti-virus therapy, the virus test was positive. Ceftriaxone was given on the 4th day, and it was changed to meropenem on the 3rd day for 2 weeks. Immune globulin was given on the 4th day and continued for 1 week. Thymosin-α1 was given on the 8th day and continued for 2 weeks. According to his past history, methimazole had been given continuously for hyperthyroidism and other symptomatic treatment. Oxygen inhalation (6 L/min) was given immediately after admission, but the condition of patient worsened with the following symptoms: frequent cough and obvious shortness of breath. Moreover pleural effusion gradually increased as shown by X-ray. SPO2 was maintained only at about 0.91. Oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) decreased to 144 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). So oxygen inhalation via nasal cannula was changed to HFNC after 2 days. The parameters were set as follows: temperature 34 degrees C, flow rate 20 L/min, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.50. The flow was raised 5 L/min every 10 minutes, and was continued till the target value reached 60 L/min. FiO2 was modified according to SpO2 and PaO2/FiO2. FiO2 was set to 0.80 on the 5th day of admission. Shortness of breath of the patient was improved on the 7th day of admission after the application of HFNC. FiO2 was then decreased to 0.58 as PaO2/FiO2 rose. Then the flow was gradually decreased to 30 L/min. HFNC was reduced with continuous improvement in PaO2/FiO2. HFNC was changed to low flow oxygen inhalation nasal cannula (2-3 L/min) on the 20th day. Oxygen treatment was stopped on the 23rd day, and SpO2 was maintained at 0.98-1.00. Activities on bed were gradually increased. The patient was cured and discharged from hospital on June 26th. The patient showed good tolerance and high compliance during the treatment with HFNC. No nosocomial spread occurred during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS HFNC could improve respiratory function of the patient with MERS obviously, and complication ARDS was prevented. HFNC might reduce nosocomial spread.","Luo, Yufeng; Ou, Rong; Ling, Yun; Qin, Tiehe",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27132449/,316

201409,Same-day Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Placement and Discharge: Another Step Toward Outpatient Electrophysiology,2020,"A role for pulmonary endothelial cells in the orchestration of cytokine production and leukocyte recruitment during influenza virus infection, leading to severe lung damage, has been recently identified. As the mechanistic pathway for this ability is not fully known, we extended previous studies on influenza virus tropism in cultured human pulmonary endothelial cells. We found that a subset of avian influenza viruses, including potentially pandemic H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses, could infect human pulmonary endothelial cells (HULEC) with high efficiency compared to human H1N1 or H3N2 viruses. In HULEC, human influenza viruses were capable of binding to host cellular receptors, becoming internalized and initiating hemifusion but failing to uncoat the viral nucleocapsid and to replicate in host nuclei. Unlike numerous cell types, including epithelial cells, we found that pulmonary endothelial cells constitutively express a high level of the restriction protein IFITM3 in endosomal compartments. IFITM3 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) could partially rescue H1N1 virus infection in HULEC, suggesting IFITM3 proteins were involved in blocking human influenza virus infection in endothelial cells. In contrast, selected avian influenza viruses were able to escape IFITM3 restriction in endothelial cells, possibly by fusing in early endosomes at higher pH or by other, unknown mechanisms. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the human pulmonary endothelium possesses intrinsic immunity to human influenza viruses, in part due to the constitutive expression of IFITM3 proteins. Notably, certain avian influenza viruses have evolved to escape this restriction, possibly contributing to virus-induced pneumonia and severe lung disease in humans. IMPORTANCE Avian influenza viruses, including H5N1 and H7N9, have been associated with severe respiratory disease and fatal outcomes in humans. Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and progressive pulmonary endothelial damage are known to be present during severe human infections, the role of pulmonary endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of avian influenza virus infections is largely unknown. By comparing human seasonal influenza strains to avian influenza viruses, we provide greater insight into the interaction of influenza virus with human pulmonary endothelial cells. We show that human influenza virus infection is blocked during the early stages of virus entry, which is likely due to the relatively high expression of the host antiviral factors IFITMs (interferon-induced transmembrane proteins) located in membrane-bound compartments inside cells. Overall, this study provides a mechanism by which human endothelial cells limit replication of human influenza virus strains, whereas avian influenza viruses overcome these restriction factors in this cell type.","Sun, Xiangjie; Zeng, Hui; Kumar, Amrita; Belser, Jessica A; Maines, Taronna R; Tumpey, Terrence M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27707929/,316
201415,Paying close attention to diabetic patients with novel coronavirus infection/ 中华内分泌代谢杂志,2020,"The occurrence of life-threatening viral infections and the establishment of appropriate defense strategies exhibit major challenges to the disease management in our society. The unpredictable character of viral outbreaks will even be enhanced in the future due to human activities such as increasing international travel, deforestation, changes in social conditions, or influences induced by the climate change. The defense against these pathogenic agents requires preparedness, including successful drug design strategies. Viral proteases represent attractive targets for the design of anti-infective lead compounds, as in case that a viral mRNA encoding several types of proteins is recognized as a monocistronic template by the host-cell translation machinery, the presence of protease activities is required for processing the viral polyprotein precursor into structural or non-structural components essential for the formation of new virion particles. In addition, viral proteases can be involved in further processes relevant for viral replication. Numerous efforts have been made to develop potent small-molecule inhibitors of viral proteases, however, until now only a limited number reached the market. In the present contribution, functional aspects of the target proteases, their structural properties, drug design strategies, resulting inhibitors, and resistance management are reviewed and discussed by means of the four essential representative cases of HIV, HCV, SARS coronavirus, and the flaviviruses Dengue and West Nile virus.","Steuber, Holger; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20166951/,316

There is little experience using simulation-based medical education (SBME) programs that focus on human dignity issues in doctor-patient relationships. OBJECTIVES To describe and assess a SBME program aimed at improving physicians' competence in a dignifying approach when encountering adolescents and their parents. METHODS A total of 97 physicians participated in 8 one-day SMBE workshops that included 7 scenarios of typical adolescent health care dilemmas. These issues could be resolved if the physician used an appropriate dignifying approach toward the patient and the parents. Debriefing discussions were based on video recordings of the scenarios. The effect of the workshops on participants' approach to adolescent health care was assessed by a feedback questionnaire and on 5-point Likert score questionnaires administered before the workshop and 3 months after. RESULTS All participants completed both the pre-workshop and the feedback questionnaires and 41 (42%) completed the post-workshop questionnaire 3 months later. Practice and competence topics received significantly higher scores in post-workshop questionnaires (P < 0.001). A score of high to very high was given by 90% of physicians to the contribution of the workshop to participants understanding the dignifying approach, and by 70% to its influence on their communicative skills. CONCLUSIONS A one-day simulation-based workshop may improve physicians' communication skills and sense of competence in addressing adolescents' health care issues which require a dignifying approach toward both the adolescent patients and their parents. This dignity-focused methodology may be expanded to improve communication skills of physicians from various disciplines.","Hardoff, Daniel; Gefen, Assaf; Sagi, Doron; Ziv, Amitai",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28471581/,316

209960,Spontaneous pneumomediastinum unrelated to invasive ventilation in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): A case report,2021,"Background: Telehealth has been successfully implemented for the delivery of obstetrical care. However, little is known regarding the attitudes and acceptability of patients and providers in high-risk obstetrics and whether the implementation of a telehealth model improves access to care in nonrural settings. Objective: This study aimed to describe patient and provider attitudes toward telehealth for the delivery of high-risk obstetrical care in a large healthcare system with both urban and suburban settings and to determine whether the implementation of a telehealth model improves patient adherence to scheduled appointments in this patient population. Study Design: Two self-administered surveys were designed. The first survey was sent to all high-risk obstetrical patients who received a telehealth visit between March 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. The second survey was designed for providers who participated in these visits. We also compared the attended, cancelled, and no-show visit rates before (March 1 to May 30, 2019) and after (March 1 to May 30, 2020) the telehealth implementation and telehealth vs in-person visits in 2020. We reviewed scheduled high-risk prenatal care appointments, diabetes mellitus education sessions, and genetic counseling and Maternal-Fetal Medicine consultations. Results: A total of 91 patient surveys and 33 provider surveys were analyzed. Overall, 86.9% of patients were satisfied with the care they received and 78.3% would recommend telehealth visits to others. Notably, 87.8% of providers reported having a positive experience using telehealth, and 90.9% believed that telehealth improved patients' access to care. When comparing patient and provider preference regarding future obstetrical care after experiencing telehealth, 73.8% of patients desired a combination of in-person and telehealth visits during their pregnancy. However, a significantly higher rate of providers preferred in-person than telehealth visits (56% vs 23%, P=.024, respectively). When comparing visits between 2019 and 2020, there was a significantly lower rate of no-show appointments (8.49% vs 4.61%, P<.001), patient-cancelled appointments (7.06% vs 4.96%, P<.001), and patient same-day cancellations (2.30% vs 1.35%, P<.001) with the implementation of telehealth. There was also a significantly lower rate of patient-cancelled appointments (3.82% vs 5.44%, P=.021) and patient same-day cancellations (0.60% vs 1.65%, P=.002) with those receiving telehealth visits than in-person visits in 2020. Conclusion: The implementation of a telehealth model in high-risk obstetrics has the potential to improve access to high-risk obstetrical care, by reducing the rate of missed appointments. Both patients and providers surveyed expressed a high rate of satisfaction with telehealth visits and a desire to integrate telehealth into the traditional model of high-risk obstetrical care.","Jeganathan, Sumithra; Prasannan, Lakha; Blitz, Matthew J; Vohra, Nidhi; Rochelson, Burton; Meirowitz, Natalie",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,316

212218,Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Room for Multifaceted Interventions,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of COVID-19, numerous rumors emerged on the internet in China and caused confusion among the public. However, the characteristics of these rumors in different phases of the epidemic have not been studied in depth, and the official responses to the rumors have not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the rumor epidemic and official responses during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and to provide a scientific basis for effective information communication in future public health crises. METHODS: Data on internet rumors related to COVID-19 were collected via the Sina Weibo Official Account to Refute Rumors between January 20 and April 8, 2020, extracted, and analyzed. The data were divided into five periods according to the key events and disease epidemic. Different classifications of rumors were described and compared over the five periods. The trends of the epidemic and the focus of the public at different stages were plotted, and correlation analysis between the number of rumors and the number of COVID-19 cases was performed. The geographic distributions of the sources and refuters of the rumors were graphed, and analyses of the most frequently appearing words in the rumors were applied to reveal hotspots of the rumors. RESULTS: A total of 1943 rumors were retrieved. The median of the response interval between publication and debunking of the rumors was 1 day (IQR 1-2). Rumors in text format accounted for the majority of the 1943 rumors (n=1241, 63.9%); chat tools, particularly WeChat (n=1386, 71.3%), were the most common platform for initial publishing of the rumors (n=1412, 72.7%). In addition to text rumors, Weibo and web pages were more likely to be platforms for rumors released in multimedia formats or in a combination of formats, respectively. Local agencies played a large role in dispelling rumors among social media platforms (1537/1943, 79.1%). There were significant differences in the formats and origins of rumors over the five periods (P<.001). Hubei Province accounted for most of the country's confirmed rumors. Beijing and Wuhan City were the main centers for debunking of disinformation. The words most frequently included in the core messages of the rumors varied by period, indicating shifting in the public's concern. CONCLUSIONS: Chat tools, particularly WeChat, became the major sources of rumors during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, indicating a requirement to establish rumor monitoring and refuting mechanisms on these platforms. Moreover, targeted policy adjustments and timely release of official information are needed in different phases of the outbreak.","Chen, Bin; Chen, Xinyi; Pan, Jin; Liu, Kui; Xie, Bo; Wang, Wei; Peng, Ying; Wang, Fei; Li, Na; Jiang, Jianmin",J Med Internet Res,,316

METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey conducted in 2019 on an urban health sciences campus of a large, public northeastern university among health sciences graduate students. Food security status was assessed using the US Department of Agriculture validated 6-item short-form food security module. RESULTS: Of the 302 respondents (response rate, 8.8%), the mean age ± SD was 28.8 ± 7.30 years; 28.5% were food insecure. After adjusting for other covariates, receiving loans was independently associated with higher odds of being food insecure (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Universities may consider screening graduate students for food insecurity risk, especially those receiving student loans. Future research on this topic with graduate students and program administrators in other universities may help identify potential interventions. The impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on food insecurity among graduate students merit exploration to develop context-specific interventions.","Sackey, Joachim D; Pike, Kimberli; Rothpletz-Puglia, Pamela; Brody, Rebecca; Touger-Decker, Riva",J. nutr. educ. behav,,316

LC can be related to secondary sarcopenia due to protein metabolic disorders and energy metabolic disorders. LC is associated with profound alterations in gut microbiota and injuries at the different levels of defensive mechanisms of the intestinal barrier. Dysbiosis refers to a state in which the diversity of gut microbiota is decreased by decreasing the bacterial species and the number of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. The severe disturbance of intestinal barrier in LC can result in dysbiosis, several bacterial infections, LC-related complications, and sarcopenia.

We report the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term course of OCD. A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n = 240) who were on regular follow-up at a tertiary care specialty OCD clinic in India were assessed telephonically, about 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic (""pandemic"" cohort). Data from the medical records of an independent set of patients with OCD (n = 207) who were followed up during the same period, 1 year prior, was used for comparison (historical controls). The pandemic group and historical controls did not differ in the trajectories of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores (chi-square likelihood ratio test of the group × time interaction = 2.73, p = 0.255) and relapse rate (21% vs. 20%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.59; p = 0.535). Preexisting contamination symptoms and COVID-19-related health anxiety measured by the COVID-Threat Scale did not predict relapse. Only a small proportion of patients (6%) reported COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients with complete or partial mole diagnosed at our institution between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2020, were included. To verify whether there was an increase in the incidence of hydatidiform mole (HM) and deliveries in 2020, the incidences for each year from January 2010 to October 2020 were recorded. In addition, we identified all women who were diagnosed with HM from January to October 2020, and compared them with a control group who underwent uterine evacuation for missed abortion of a singleton pregnancy during the same period. We also documented the time taken to diagnose missed abortion or molar pregnancy to check if a delay in diagnosis can explain the increase in HM incidence. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy. A further increase occurred in 2020 (odds ratio = 2.071). The mean gestational age of the embryo at the time of diagnosis was smaller in the HM group than in the missed abortion group (6.3 ± 1.67-7.4 ± 2.4, one-sided P = 0.034), meaning that it took more time (days) to diagnose molar pregnancy than missed abortion (22.38 ± 10.32 vs. 15.83 ± 7.83 days, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because of the delay in receiving medical care.

Applying this algorithm to data from Greece, we extend it to the case of two subpopulations, namely, those consisting of individuals below and above 40 years of age. After supplementing the Greek data for deaths with the data for the number of individuals reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, we estimated the effect on deaths and infections in the case that the easing of the lockdown measures is different for these two subpopulations. We found that if the lockdown measures are partially eased only for the young subpopulation, then the effect on deaths and infections is small. However, if the easing is substantial for the older population, this effect may be catastrophic.","Fokas, A S; Cuevas-Maraver, J; Kevrekidis, P G",Sci Rep,,316

In particular, hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), tyrosol (Tyr), and the secoiridoids oleacein and oleocanthal play central roles as anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective and anti-cancer agents. These compounds cannot be easily obtained via chemical synthesis, and their isolation and purification from EVOO is cumbersome. Indeed, both processes involve the use of large volumes of organic solvents, hazardous reagents and several chromatographic steps. In this work we propose a novel optimized procedure for the green extraction, isolation and purification of HTyr, Tyr, oleacein and oleocanthal directly from EVOO, by using a Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NaDES) as an extracting phase, coupled with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. This purification method allows the total recovery of the four components as single pure compounds directly from EVOO, in a rapid, economic and ecologically sustainable way, which utilizes biocompatible reagents and strongly limits the use or generation of hazardous substances.","Francioso, Antonio; Federico, Rodolfo; Maggiore, Anna; Fontana, Mario; Boffi, Alberto; D039,; Erme, Maria; Mosca, Luciana",Molecules (Basel),,316

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we performed 24-hour ambulatory scalp EEGs on 43 cognitively normal elderly healthy controls (HC), 41 early-stage AD participants with no history or risk factors for epilepsy (AD-NoEp), and 15 early-stage AD participants with late-onset epilepsy related to AD (AD-Ep). Two epileptologists, blinded to diagnosis, visually reviewed all EEGs and annotated all potential epileptiform abnormalities. A panel of 9 epileptologists, blinded to diagnosis, was then surveyed to generate a consensus interpretation of epileptiform abnormalities in each EEG. RESULTS: Epileptiform abnormalities were seen in 53% of AD-Ep, 22% of AD-NoEp, and 4.7% of HC participants. Specific features of epileptiform discharges, including high frequency, robust morphology, right temporal location, and occurrence during wakefulness and REM, were associated with clinical seizures in AD. Multiple electrical biomarkers concordantly demonstrated a pattern of left temporal lobe hyperexcitability in early stages of AD, whereas clinical seizures in AD were often associated with bi-temporal hyperexcitability. Frequent small sharp spikes were specifically associated with epileptiform EEGs and thus identified as a potential biomarker of hyperexcitability in AD. CONCLUSION: Epileptiform abnormalities are common in AD, but not all equivalent. Specific features of epileptiform discharges are associated with clinical seizures in AD. Given the difficulty recognizing clinical seizures in AD, these EEG features could provide guidance on which AD patients are at high risk for clinical seizures.","Lam, Alice D; Sarkis, Rani A; Pellerin, Kyle R; Jing, Jin; Dworetzky, Barbara A; Hoch, Daniel B; Jacobs, Claire S; Lee, Jong Woo; Weisholtz, Daniel S; Zepeda, Rodrigo; Westover, M Brandon; Cole, Andrew J; Cash, Sydney S",Neurology,,316

227913,Association of endemic coronaviruses with nasopharyngeal metabolome and microbiota among infants with severe bronchiolitis: a prospective multicenter study,2020,"Viruses use cell machinery to replicate their genome and produce viral proteins. For this reason, several intracellular factors, including the redox state, might directly or indirectly affect the progression and outcome of viral infection. In physiological conditions, the redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant species is maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and it finely regulates several cell functions. Different viruses break this equilibrium and induce an oxidative stress that in turn facilitates specific steps of the virus lifecycle and activates an inflammatory response. In this context, many studies highlighted the importance of redox-sensitive pathways as novel cell-based targets for therapies aimed at blocking both viral replication and virus-induced inflammation. In the review, we discuss the most recent findings in this field. In particular, we describe the effects of natural or synthetic redox-modulating molecules in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus replication as well as inflammatory pathways. The importance of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 is also discussed. Most of the data reported here are on influenza virus infection. We believe that this approach could be usefully applied to fight other acute respiratory viral infections characterized by a strong inflammatory response, like COVID-19.","Checconi, Paola; De Angelis, Marta; Marcocci, Maria Elena; Fraternale, Alessandra; Magnani, Mauro; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Nencioni, Lucia",,,316

AREAS COVERED: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Toxicology Data Network-TOXLINE (inception to 8-July-2020), clinical trial registries, and product monographs for any clinical trials, observational studies or case reports examining AEs to ocrelizumab. Studies with/without a comparator drug or placebo were eligible. EXPERT OPINION: Seventy-eight records were included (4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 open-label trials, 29 observational studies, and 27 case reports). AEs affected 2756/4498 (61.3%) of ocrelizumab-exposed patients. The most common AEs were infections (n=1342, 39.2% of ocrelizumab-exposed patients) and infusion-related reactions (n=1391, 26.2%). Compared to beta-interferon, infections were more likely in ocrelizumab-exposed patients (Risk Ratio (RR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.01-1.19), including: herpes-related (RR=1.75; 95%CI:1.11-2.76), respiratory tract-related (RR=1.42; 95%CI:1.10-1.84 and RR=1.61; 95%CI:1.10-2.35), nasopharyngitis (RR=1.47; 95%CI:1.13-1.90), and rhinitis (RR=4.00; 95%CI:1.13-14.14). Infusion-related reactions (RR range: 1.57-4.42) were more common for ocrelizumab versus placebo or beta-interferon. From pooled analyses (three RCTs), the risk of 'any' serious AE did not differ significantly between the ocrelizumab and comparator groups. However, insufficient data were available to assess longer-term AEs, e.g., malignancy.","Ng, Huah Shin; Rosenbult, Constanza Luzon; Tremlett, Helen",Expert Opin Drug Saf,,316

In this paper, we propose a novel analysis based on the birth-death process with recursive full tracing. We estimated the numbers of undiagnosed symptomatic patients and the lower bound of the number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient before and after the declaration of the state of emergency in Hokkaido, Japan. The median of the estimated number of undiagnosed symptomatic patients per diagnosed patient decreased from 1.7 to 0.77 after the declaration, and the median of the estimated lower bound of the number of total infected individuals per diagnosed patient decreased from 4.2 to 2.4.

233887,Superinfections in patients treated with Teicoplanin as anti-SARSCoV2 agent,2020,"BACKGROUND: WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

METHODS: The objective of this study was to assess whether sex differences exist in physical activity and well-being since COVID-19 and to explore how barriers or facilitators to physical activity may explain these differences. Chi-square tests, independent t-tests and one-way ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate data provided by 1098 Canadians-215 men and 871 women. RESULTS: Women were significantly less physically active than men and reported more barriers and fewer facilitators to physical activity and experienced significantly more generalized anxiety than men. Women who were engaged in less physical activity due to COVID-19 reported significantly lower mental health scores, lower social, emotional and psychological well-being, and significantly higher generalized anxiety, while women who engaged in more physical activity had improved mental health scores. CONCLUSIONS: Given the challenges that women uniquely face due to restrictions, it is imperative to advocate and provide environmental opportunity and support for physical activity to reduce the mental duress women may be experiencing. Specific physical activity programming that is inclusive of lifestyle physical activity and can engage children is encouraged.","Nienhuis, Carl P; Lesser, Iris A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,316

234975,Ganciclovir Therapy for CMV Viremia in a Patient on VV ECMO With COVID-19 After Treatment With Tocilizumab,2021,"Cataphors precede their antecedents, so they cannot be fully interpreted until those antecedents are encountered. Some researchers propose that cataphors trigger an active search during incremental processing in which the parser predictively posits potential antecedents in upcoming syntactic positions (Kazanina et al., Journal of Memory and Language, 56[3], 384-409, 2007). One characteristic of active search is that it is persistent: If a prediction is disconfirmed in an earlier position, the parser should iteratively search later positions until the predicted element is found. Previous research has assumed, but not established, that antecedent search is persistent. In four experiments in English and Norwegian, we test this hypothesis. Two sentence completion experiments show a strong off-line preference for coreference between a fronted cataphor and the first available argument position (the main subject). When the main subject cannot be the antecedent, participants posit the antecedent in the next closest position: object position. Two self-paced reading studies demonstrate that comprehenders actively expect the antecedent of a fronted cataphor to appear in the main clause subject position, and then successively in object position if the subject does not match the cataphor in gender. Our results therefore support the claim that antecedent search is active and persistent.","Giskes, Anna; Kush, Dave",Mem. cogn,,316

In this paper, we introduce a novel method called CyclingNet for detecting cycling near misses from video streams generated by a mounted frontal camera on a bike regardless of the camera position, the conditions of the built, the visual conditions and without any restrictions on the riding behaviour. CyclingNet is a deep computer vision model based on convolutional structure embedded with self-attention bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks that aim to understand near misses from both sequential images of scenes and their optical flows. The model is trained on scenes of both safe rides and near misses. After 42 hours of training on a single GPU, the model shows high accuracy on the training, testing and validation sets. The model is intended to be used for generating information that can draw significant conclusions regarding cycling behaviour in cities and elsewhere, which could help planners and policy-makers to better understand the requirement of safety measures when designing infrastructure or drawing policies. As for future work, the model can be pipelined with other state-of-the-art classifiers and object detectors simultaneously to understand the causality of near misses based on factors related to interactions of road-users, the built and the natural environments.","Ibrahim, Mohamed R.; Haworth, James; Christie, Nicola; Cheng, Tao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00565v1.pdf,316

METHODS: A geographic information system was used to integrate, map, and analyze SARS-CoV-2 testing data reported by LAC DPH, and data from the American Community Survey. Structural determinants included race/ethnicity, poverty, insurance status, education, population and household density. We examined which factors were associated with positivity rates, using a 5% test positivity threshold, with spatial analysis and spatial regression. RESULTS: Between 1 March and 30 June 2020 there were 843,440 SARS-CoV-2 tests and 86,383 diagnoses reported, for an overall positivity rate of 10.2% within the study area. Communities with high proportions of Latino/a residents, those living below the federal poverty line and with high household densities had higher crude positivity rates. Age- adjusted diagnosis rates were significantly associated with the proportion of Latino/as, individuals living below the poverty line, population, and household density. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant local variations in test positivity within LAC and several socio-structural determinants contribute to ongoing disparities. Public health interventions, beyond shelter in place, are needed to address and target such disparities.","Vijayan, Tara; Shin, Michael; Adamson, Paul C; Harris, Christina; Seeman, Teresa; Norris, Keith C; Goodman-Meza, David",Clin. infect. dis,,316

This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health, leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Shift work, especially night shift work, has long been associated with several chronic health conditions. The mechanisms that drive these associations are not well understood; however, current literature suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms may cause downstream hormonal and immune effects that render night shift workers more susceptible to disease. First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit the production of melatonin, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work. These data suggest that further research is warranted and that high-risk occupations should be taken into consideration as public health policies are introduced and evolve.","Lim, Rachel K; Wambier, Carlos G; Goren, Andy",Med Hypotheses,,316

The aggressive behavior of this group of tumors justifies the need for a multidisciplinary team to assist in clinical decisions during the current pandemic. Brazil is now ranked #2 in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, and existing disparities in the treatment of neuro-oncology patients in Brazil will challenge the clinical and surgical decisions of this population, possibly affecting global survival. Objective: To search the literature about the management of glioblastomas during COVID-19 pandemic to guide surgical and clinical decisions in this population of patients in Brazil. Methods: We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. Results: When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered. Centers are advised to engage in telemedicine and to elaborate means to reduce local infection. Conclusion: Approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic will be challenging worldwide, but particularly in Brazil, where a significant inequality of healthcare exists.","Batistella, Gabriel Novaes de Rezende; Santos, Adrialdo José; Paiva Neto, Manoel Antonio de; Ferrigno, Robson; Camargo, Veridiana Pires de; Stavale, João Norberto; Maldaun, Marcos Vinicius Calfat",Arq. neuropsiquiatr,,316

Disease severity varies among individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with e.g. flu-like symptoms, dyspnoea, severe interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and generalized coagulopathy. Nitric oxide (NO), is a small signal molecule that impacts pleiotropic functions in human physiology, which can be involved in the significant effects of COVID-19 infection. NO is a neurotransmitter involved in the neural olfactory processes in the central nervous system, and some infected patients have reported anosmia as a symptom. Additionally, NO is a well-known vasodilator, important coagulation mediator, anti-microbial effector and inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication. Exhaled NO is strongly related to the type-2 inflammatory response found in asthma, which has been suggested to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several reports indicate that the use of inhaled NO has been an effective therapy during this pandemic since the ventilation-perfusion ratio in COVID-19 patients improved afterwards and they did not require mechanical ventilation.

Given its recent appearance, our current knowledge about the possible influence that this disease can exert on pregnancy is very limited. One of the unknowns to be solved is whether there is a vertical transmission of the infection during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, the possible presence of this germ in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid was investigated in four pregnant Caucasian patients affected by mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 during the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no laboratory evidence to suggest a possible passage of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected mother to the amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to expand the investigation of COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy to clarify the real influence that SARS-CoV-2 has on pregnant women and their offspring, as well as those factors that modulate the disease.","Hijona Elósegui, J J; Carballo García, A L; Fernández Risquez, A C; Bermúdez Quintana, M; Expósito Montes, J F",Rev. clin. esp.

After an extensive testing strategy during the initial few weeks in the early phase of the epidemic, the Italian Ministry of Health made its testing policy more stringent. In this study we assess the contribution of the testing policy to containing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. METHODS: The analysis is focused on the evolution of the epidemic and related health intervention in four regions where approximately 80% of the national death toll due to COVID-19 has occurred.The assumed under-estimation of asymptomatic cases has led us to make use of the number of deaths due to the epidemic to analyse the effectiveness of testing. The analysis is conducted through an autoregressive time-series approach where we use official data from the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: The results of the analysis confirm a negative relationship between the number of tests carried out and the progression of the epidemic. In particular, results reveal that the tests are particularly effective in breaking the chain of transmission when they are implemented at the early stages of the spread of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale testing policy is recommended as a critical contribution to effectively contain the epidemic. In addition, it is highly recommended to set up all necessary measures to enable the quick scale-up of testing capacity whenever required.","De Matteis, Alessandro; Turkmen Ceylan, Fethiye B; Adrianopoli, Marina; Ertek, Sibel",Eur. j. public health,,316
246349,Smoking and liver disease,2020,"Taiwan's response to the coronavirus disease pandemic received international recognition. Among various epidemic control measures, telemedicine services are provided for people under home quarantine. Although this service presents no policy, cost or equipment problems, the medical needs of people under home quarantine are diverse. Further, there are no clear guidelines regarding which specialists should be included in a multidisciplinary team. Moreover, many physicians are unwilling to participate in telemedicine, creating a big challenge for hospitals providing these services. Emergency physicians (EPs) have unique experiences in crisis management and can provide a number of effective public health measures. We advocate that EPs should be the first specialists to contact patients in a multidisciplinary team. Currently, there is a lack of literature on this subject, and Taiwan's epidemic control experience is used as an example to prove our viewpoint and provide recommendations for future EPs.","Chu, Chien-Ming; Wang, Tsung-Hsi; Lee, Hsin-Chung; Lin, Chaou-Shune; Feng, Cho-Chao",Emerg. med Australas,,316

252177,Therapeutic strategy of traditional Chinese medicine for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020,"This pandemic has been classified as a “psychological pandemic” that produces anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sleep disorders. As the mental health effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, continue to unfold, there are still large knowledge gaps about the variables that predispose individuals to, or protect individuals against the disease. However, there are few publications on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of citizens in Latin American countries. In this study, the effects that COVID-19 had on citizens of Peru have been described. For this, 1699 questionnaires, collected between 2 April and 2 September 2020, were analyzed. Descriptive, bivariate analysis was performed with odds ratio (OR) calculations and a data mining methodology. Sociodemographic variables (from the General Health Questionnaire), health conditions and perception, symptoms, and variables related to contact and preventive measures regarding COVID-19 were analyzed. As compared to other countries, less affectation of mental health and increased use of preventive measures were observed. It has been suggested that the country’s precarious health system and poverty rates prior to the pandemic may justify higher mortality figures in Peru than in other Latin American countries, despite prompt action for its containment and compliance with the protective measures. Psychological distress had a greater incidence in women, young people, people without a partner, and people without university studies. The most significant conditioning variables were self-perceived health status, headache or muscle pain over the past 14 days, level of studies, and age. The extensive use of preventive measures against COVID-19 is in line with the strict legislative measures taken, and this is, in turn, in line with other countries when looking at the lower effect on mental health, but contrary when focusing on the high lethality identified. The need to include the economy or availability and quality of healthcare in future studies arises, as well as the suitability to analyze the cause for differences between countries.","Ruiz-Frutos, Carlos Palomino-Baldeón Juan Carlos Ortega-Moreno Mónica Villavicencio-Guardia María del Carmen Dias Adriano Bernardes João Marcos Gómez-Salgado Juan",Healthcare,,316

To this end, they deploy many resources, e.g. receptors, downstream signaling molecules, time and energy. Here, we present a theory for the optimal design of a large class of sensing systems that need to detect time-varying signals, a receptor driving a push-pull network. The theory is based on the concept of the dynamic input-output relation, which describes the mapping between the current ligand concentration and the average receptor occupancy over the past integration time. This concept is used to develop the idea that the cell employs its push-pull network to estimate the receptor occupancy and then uses this estimate to infer the current ligand concentration by inverting the dynamic input-output relation. The theory reveals that the sensing error can be decomposed into two terms: the sampling error in the estimate of the receptor occupancy and the dynamical error that arises because the average ligand concentration over the past integration time may not reflect the current ligand concentration. The theory generalizes the design principle of optimal resource allocation previously identified for static signals, which states that in an optimally designed sensing system the three fundamental resource classes of receptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy are equally limiting so that no resource is wasted. However, in contrast to static signals, receptors and power cannot be traded freely against time to reach a desired sensing precision: there exists an optimal integration time that maximizes the sensing precision, which depends on the number of receptors, the receptor correlation time, and the correlation time and variance of the input signal. Applying our theory to the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli indicates that this bacterium has evolved to optimally sense shallow gradients.","Malaguti, G.; Wolde, P.

Yet the impact on mobility of different non-pharmaceutical countermeasures in the earlier stages of the pandemic is not well-understood. DESIGN: Trends were evaluated using Citymapper's mobility index covering 2nd to 26th March 2020, expressed as percentages of typical usage periods from 0% as the lowest and 100% as normal. China and India were not covered. Multivariate fixed effects models were used to estimate the association of policies restricting movement on mobility before and after their introduction. Policy restrictions were assessed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index as well as measures coding the timing and degree of school and workplace closures, transport restrictions, and cancellation of mass gatherings. SETTING: 41 cities worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Citymapper's mobility index. RESULTS: Mobility declined in all major cities throughout March. Larger declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with declines in mobility (r = - 0.75, p < 0.001). After adjusting for time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0% for school closures (95% CI: 4.36 to 15.7%), 15.0% for workplace closures (95% CI: 10.2 to 19.8%), 7.09% for cancelling public events (95% CI: 1.98 to 12.2%), 18.0% for closing public transport (95% CI: 6.74 to 29.2%), 13.3% for restricting internal movements (95% CI: 8.85 to 17.8%) and 5.30% for international travel controls (95% CI: 1.69 to 8.90). In contrast, as expected, there was no association between population mobility changes and fiscal or monetary measures or emergency healthcare investment. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the effect of public policy on mobility in the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19 transmission. By using Citymapper's mobility index, this work provides the first evidence about trends in mobility and the impacts of different policy interventions, suggesting that closure of public transport, workplaces and schools are particularly impactful.","Vannoni, Matia; McKee, Martin; Semenza, Jan C; Bonell, Chris; Stuckler, David",Global Health,,316

This study aimed to analyze how meteorological variables can affect the spread of local COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Nine spatial units were considered from a meteorological standpoint to characterize COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. The daily COVID-19 incidence and meteorological variable (e.g., mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) data from April 5 to September 20, 2020, were collected. The Spearman rank correlation, heat maps, and multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were employed to understand their association. The effect of meteorological variables on COVID-19 transmission was modeled using a lag period of 10 days. Results showed that mean temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed are substantially associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, daily precipitation is significantly associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19 incidence. The relative risks (RR) of mean temperature for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.222 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.214-1.232). For wind speed, the RR was 1.087 (95% CI, 1.083-1.090). For relative humidity, the RR was 1.027 (95% CI, 1.025-1.029). Overall, this study found the profound effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 incidence across selected nine areas in Bangladesh. This study is probably the first study to explore the impact of region-specific meteorological conditions on COVID-19 incidence in Bangladesh. Moreover, adjustments on the areal-aggregated and regional levels were made for three confounding factors, including lockdown, population density, and potential seasonal effects. The study's findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in high temperatures and humidity conditions, which contradicts many other countries' prior studies. The research outcomes will provide implications for future control and prevention measures in Bangladesh and other countries with similar climate conditions and population density.","Hridoy, Al-Ekram Elahee; Mohiman, Md Abdul; Tusher, Shekh Md Shajid Hasan; Nowraj, Sayed Ziaul Amin; Rahman, Mohammad Atiqur",Theor Appl Climatol,,316

Embedded industries and social communities want protection from expanding tech companies and the real estate developers who build for them. City council members, state legislators, and community organizations oppose the city government's attempts to satisfy Big Tech companies. While the city's density magnifies conflicts of interest over land-use and labor issues, the covid-19 pandemic raises serious questions about the city's ability to both oppose Big Tech and keep creating tech jobs.","Zukin, Sharon",Theory Soc,,316

The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.","Tai, Wanbo; He, Lei; Zhang, Xiujuan; Pu, Jing; Voronin, Denis; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying",Cell Mol Immunol,,316

To date, such a manipulation is realized mainly via spin-polarized current based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbital torque effect. However, this scheme is energy consuming and may produce massive Joule heating. To reduce energy dissipation and risk of heightened temperatures of skyrmion-based devices, an effective solution is to use electric field instead of current as stimulus. Here, we realize an electric-field manipulation of skyrmions in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectrical heterostructure at room temperature via an inverse magneto-mechanical effect. Intriguingly, such a manipulation is non-volatile and exhibits a multistate feature. Numerical simulations indicate that the electric-field manipulation of skyrmions originates from strain-mediated modification of effective magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

What was previously known and familiar seemingly disintegrated in the emergence of the unfamiliar experience of a global quarantine. While difficulties abounded across the discipline of nursing, these challenges created new opportunities for visioning anew in thinking beyond the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. A challenge is presented to nurse administrators and faculty charged with preparing the next generation of nurses to meet the challenges of an unknowable future by thinking beyond the traditional boundaries of classroom and clinic to co-create new ways of living the teaching-learning mission of nurse education programs.","Yancey, Nan Russell",Nurs Sci Q,,316
273972,A COVID-19 vaccine success? patients perception of Covid vaccination program,2021,"Perseverative cognition (PC), consisting of worry and rumination, has been consistently linked to a variety of poorer health outcomes, namely via the worsening of stress-induced health risk behaviours. However, research into PC and unhealthy food choice, a key health behaviour, still remains relatively unexplored. In the current pilot investigation, 284 participants were recruited to take part in an online food choice paradigm before completing the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI). As a reduced availability of unhealthy snacks has been shown to improve snack choice, participants were randomly allocated to either an even condition (a 3:3 ratio of &#8804;99 kcal and &#8805;199 kcal snacks) or an uneven condition (a 4:2 ratio in favour of &#8804;99 kcal snacks). It was hypothesized that higher levels of PC may predict greater instances of poorer snack choices across, or even within, this paradigm. Despite an increase availability of lower calorie snacks leading to a healthier snack choice, both state and trait PC measures did not significantly influence snack choice irrespective of this varying availability. Although, marginal trends were found for higher state PC and higher calorie crisp selections. The current pilot therefore adds to the growing literature advocating for the use of behavioural economic tactics to engender healthier food choices, yet further work is needed to unpick the mediating role of PC (and its components) in snack consumption paradigms.","Eschle, Timothy M; McCarrick, Dane",,,316

The avalanche of mobile Big Data makes it possible to study the spatial effects of the crisis with spatiotemporal detail at the national and global scales. However, the current crisis also highlights serious limitations in the readiness to take the advantage of mobile Big Data for social good, both within and beyond the interests of health sector. We propose two strategical pathways for the future use of mobile Big Data for societal impact assessment, addressing access to both raw mobile Big Data as well as aggregated data products. Both pathways require careful considerations of privacy issues, harmonized and transparent methodologies, and attention to the representativeness, reliability and continuity of data. The goal is to be better prepared to use mobile Big Data in future crises.","Poom, Age; Järv, Olle; Zook, Matthew; Toivonen, Tuuli",Big Data Soc.,,316

We evaluated two automated molecular test systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled specimens. METHODS: Pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were tested by Qiagen QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat) or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert), and the results were compared to that of standard RT-qPCR tests without pooling. RESULTS: In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n = 105) and 74.1%/100% (n = 260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n = 250) and 100%/99.5% (n = 200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool; n = 150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT ) from standard testing. RT-qPCR CT values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat and Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.85 to 0.99, p < 0.05). However, the CT values from Xpert were significantly stronger (p < 0.01, paired t test) than that of QIAstat in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, with mean differences of -4.3 ± 2.43 and -4.6 ± 2 for individual and pooled tests, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Xpert SARS-CoV-2 can be utilized for pooled sample testing for COVID-19 screening in low-prevalence settings providing significant cost savings and improving throughput without affecting test quality.","Al-Hail, Hamad; Mirza, Faheem; Al Hashemi, Alaa; Ahmad, Muneera Naseer; Iqbal, Muhammad; Tang, Patrick; Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet",J Clin Lab Anal,,316

We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample including 1100 participants. Data were collected online. Depression revealed a worsening pattern as quarantine sub-periods went by. Anxiety (both state and trait), just like suicidal risk, partially follow such a pattern, with mean scores increasing from the first to the second/third quarantine extensions, but then maintaining to the fourth extension. Predictors having protective effects on almost all the MHS indicators were: availability of current economic income (except for state-anxiety, without significant effect) and absence of suicide attempt history. Conversely, sex (woman), younger age, and mental disorder history had an increasing risk effect on all the MHS indicators. Overall, our findings indicate that quarantine have negative mental health impacts and that quarantine duration is a relevant aspect to be taken into account when measuring such an impact. More attention needs to be paid to vulnerable groups such as the young, women, and people with history of mental disorder.","López Steinmetz, Lorena Cecilia; Dutto Florio, María Agustina; Leyes, Candela Abigail; Fong, Shao Bing; Rigalli, Alfredo; Godoy, Juan Carlos",Psychol Health Med,,316

The involvement of T cell immunity in this exacerbation remains unclear. To identify predictive markers of COVID-19 progress and outcome, we analyzed peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19-associated ARDS patients and 35 mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, not requiring intensive care. Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-reactive T cells between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein-reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose the CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker.","Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hölzer, Bodo; Skrzypczyk, Sarah; Kohut, Eva; Kurek, Julia; Zapka, Jan; Wehler, Patrizia; Kaliszczyk, Sviatlana; Bajda, Sharon; Thieme, Constantin J; Roch, Toralf; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Kölsch, Uwe; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Tempfer, Clemens; Watzl, Carsten; Dolff, Sebastian; Dittmer, Ulf; Abou-El-Enein, Mohamed; Westhoff, Timm H; Witzke, Oliver; Stervbo, Ulrik; Babel, Nina",Mol Ther,,316

It has also negatively influenced people's general health and quality of life. The aim of the present study was to study the impact of social distancing on physical activity level, and the association between mood state (depression and anxiety level) or sex with actual physical activity levels, the change in physical activity caused by social distancing period, the adhesion level to social distancing, the adoption time of social distancing, family income and age. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire with personal, quarantine, physical activity, and mood state disorders information's was answered by 2140 Brazilians of both sex who were recruited through online advertising. RESULTS: The physical activity level adopted during the period of social distancing (3.5 ± 0.8) was lower than that the adopted prior to the pandemic period (2.9 ± 1.1, p < 0.001). Thirty percent of the participants presented symptoms of moderate/severe depression and 23.3% displayed moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. A greater presence of symptoms related to anxiety and depression were associated with low physical activity levels, low family monthly income, and younger age. A higher percentage of men who had no mood disorders was observed among those who were very active than among those less active. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on physical activity. Those who reduced their level of physical activity had the highest levels of mood disorders. Therefore, physical activity programs should be encouraged, while respecting the necessary social distancing to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.","Puccinelli, Paulo José; da Costa, Taline Santos; Seffrin, Aldo; de Lira, Claudio Andre Barbosa; Vancini, Rodrigo Luiz; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T; Knechtle, Beat; Rosemann, Thomas; Hill, Lee; Andrade, Marilia Santos",BMC Public Health,,316

Despite decades of research, an effective drug therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome remains elusive. The ideal pharmacotherapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome should demonstrate antiprotease activity and target injurious inflammatory pathways while maintaining host defense against infection. Furthermore, a drug with a reputable safety profile, low possibility of off-target effects, and well-known pharmacokinetics would be desirable. The endogenous 52-kd serine protease &#945;1-antitrypsin has the potential to be a novel treatment option for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The main function of &#945;1-antitrypsin is as an antiprotease, targeting neutrophil elastase in particular. However, studies have also highlighted the role of &#945;1-antitrypsin in the modulation of inflammation and bacterial clearance. In light of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the identification of a treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome is even more pertinent, and &#945;1-antitrypsin has been implicated in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hogan, Grace; Geoghegan, Pierce; Carroll, Tomás P; Clarke, Jennifer; McElvaney, Oisín F; McElvaney, Oliver J; McElvaney, Noel G; Curley, Gerard F",Anesthesiology,,316

Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms, some patients also have cardiological symptoms. Among patients with cardiological conditions2 they represent a group of higher risk and, in fact, they are a particularly vulnerable group, due to their higher risk of contagion and greater severity in case of acquiring the disease1 those with heart failure (HF), including heart transplant (CT) and ventricular assists, as well as patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). HF is the main chronic cardiovascular disease and patients in this group are the most vulnerable for the development of more serious clinical symptoms after suffering the infection, and to a greater extent cases with advanced HF3. In fact, HF is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-194. Likewise, transplant patients who require immunosuppressants to avoid graft rejection, constitute a population especially susceptible to infection and to develop more serious processes.

295974,Droplet and bone dust contamination from high-speed drilling during mastoidectomy,2021,"SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has emerged as a global threat to humankind and is rapidly spreading. The infectivity, pathogenesis and infection of this virus are dependent on the interaction of SARS-CoV2 spike protein with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes hACE-2. In the present study, we are reporting a de novo designed novel hybrid antiviral 'VTAR-01' molecule that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. A series of antiviral molecules were tested for binding at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. In silico screening, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, ascorbate, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine have strong interaction at the RBD-hACE2 interface. These four molecules were used for de novo fragment-based antiviral design. De novo designing, docking and MDS analysis identified a 'VTAR' hybrid molecule that has better interaction with this interface than all of the antivirals used to design it. We have further used retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis to design 100 variants of VTAR molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis, along with docking and MDS, identified that VTAR-01 interacts with the interface of the RBD-ACE2 complex. MDS analysis confirmed its interaction with the RBD-ACE2 interface by involving Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2, as well as Gln493 and Ser494 of RBD. Interaction of spike protein with ACE2 is essential for pathogenesis and infection of this virus; hence, this i n s ilico designed hybrid antiviral molecule (VTAR-01) that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 may be further developed to control the infection of SARS-CoV2.","Tiwari, Vishvanath",,,316

In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population. METHODS: The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization. RESULTS: The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.","Komenda, Martin; Bulhart, Vojtech; Karolyi, Matej; Jarkovský, Jirí; Muzík, Jan; Májek, Ondrej; Snajdrová, Lenka; Ruzicková, Petra; Rázová, Jarmila; Prymula, Roman; Macková, Barbora; Brezovský, Pavel; Marounek, Jan; Cerný, Vladimír; Dusek, Ladislav",J Med Internet Res,,316

Intervention programs with a multicomponent approach involving many health care settings and research have a pivotal role in developing additional strategies for addressing violence and to provide tailored interventions to victims. Prevention policy with a particular attention on healthy child and adolescent development is mandatory in the struggle against all forms of violence.","Mazza, M.; Marano, G.; Del Castillo, A.

298804,Evaluation of Childhood COVID-19 Cases: A Retrospective Analysis,2021,"COVID-19 is a pandemic with clinical and emotional implications, sometimes invisible to gastroenterologists. Although dying is part of life, the risk for some doctors may be greater. Specifically, gastroenterologists are affected by the fear of restarting medical check-ups and endoscopic procedures. Amid a sea of information –even with contradictions between different experts— following the guidelines of the Colombian Associations of the Digestive Tract could help reassure doctors and patients. Although the pathologies will continue to appear, the fear of the population to be infected can generate consequences such as delaying the treatment of digestive tract cancers. Physical self-care through protection strategies and the emotional care, are important to help our immune system.

This virus disseminated rapidly and reached to an unprecedented pandemic proportion in more than 213 nations with a large number of fatalities. The hypersecretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the main cause of mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19, therefore strategies that avert the cytokine storm may play a crucial role in abating the severity of COVID-19. This review highlights the minute details of SARS-CoV-2, its genomic organization, genomic variations within structural and non-structural proteins and viral progression mechanism in human beings. The approaches like antiviral strategies are discussed, including drugs that obstruct viral propagation and suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. This compilation emphasizes Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) based therapy alone or in combination with other therapeutics as an attractive curative approach for COVID-19 pandemic. The MSCs and its secretome, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have various capabilities, for instance, immunomodulation, regeneration, antimicrobial properties, potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and bare minimum chances of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immunomodulatory property of MSCs affects inflammatory state and regulates immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, as of now, there is no WHO-approved MSCs based therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.

302974,Air pollution in Africa,2020,"In the first quarter of the 21st century, we are already facing the third emergence of a coronavirus outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Comparative genomics can inform a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Previous strains of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been known to cause acute lung injuries in humans. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV with some modification in the S protein leading to their enhanced binding affinity toward the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human lung cells. This expert review examines the features of all three coronaviruses through a conceptual lens of comparative genomics. In particular, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 that enables its survival within the host is highlighted. Susceptibility of humans to coronavirus outbreaks in the 21st century calls for comparisons of the transmission history, hosts, reservoirs, and fatality rates of these viruses so that evidence-based and effective planetary health interventions can be devised to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks. Comparative genomics offers new insights on putative and novel viral targets with an eye to both therapeutic innovation and prevention. We conclude the expert review by (1) articulating the lessons learned so far, whereas the research is still being actively sought after in the field, and (2) the challenges and prospects in deciphering the linkages among multiomics biological variability and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Asrani, Purva; Hasan, Gulam Mustafa; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",OMICS,,316

Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19. We demonstrate the value of this approach, reporting on eight potential repurposing opportunities identified, and discuss how this approach could be incorporated into future studies.","Skelton, David J.; Alsobhe, Aoesha; Anastasi, Elisa; Atallah, Christian; Bird, Jasmine E.; Brown, Bradley; Didon, Dwayne; Gater, Phoenix; James, Katherine; Lennon, David D.; McLaughlin, James; Moreland, Pollyanna E.

305976,Personalized recovery of severe COVID19: Rehabilitation from the perspective of patient needs,2020,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 disease was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Cases in the United States began appearing in late January. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. By mid-March COVID-19 cases were spreading across the US with several hotspots appearing by April. Health officials point to the importance of surveillance of COVID-19 to better inform decision makers at various levels and efficiently manage distribution of human and technical resources to areas of need. The prospective space-time scan statistic has been used to help identify emerging COVID-19 disease clusters, but results from this approach can encounter strategic limitations imposed by constraints of the scanning window. This paper presents a different approach to COVID-19 surveillance based on a spatiotemporal event sequence (STES) similarity. In this STES based approach, adapted for this pandemic context we compute the similarity of evolving daily COVID-19 incidence rates by county and then cluster these sequences to identify counties with similarly trending COVID-19 case loads. We analyze four study periods and compare the sequence similarity-based clusters to prospective space-time scan statistic-based clusters. The sequence similarity-based clusters provide an alternate surveillance perspective by identifying locations that may not be spatially proximate but share a similar disease progression pattern. Results of the two approaches taken together can aid in tracking the progression of the pandemic to aid local or regional public health responses and policy actions taken to control or moderate the disease spread.","Xu, Fuyu; Beard, Kate",PLoS One,,316
305977,Personalized recovery of severe COVID19: Rehabilitation from the perspective of patient needs,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (&#8805;2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with &#8805;2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and &#8805;2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","McQueenie, Ross; Foster, Hamish M E; Jani, Bhautesh D; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Sattar, Naveed; Pell, Jill P; Ho, Frederick K; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Hastie, Claire E; Anderson, Jana; Mark, Patrick B; Sullivan, Michael; O039,; Donnell, Catherine A; Mair, Frances S; Nicholl, Barbara I",PLoS One,,316

We evaluated the association between RAAS inhibitor use and outcomes of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.15; p = 0.22). The rate of ventilator care was not significantly different between the two groups (4.4% vs. 4.1%; HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.60-1.79; p = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: RAAS inhibitor treatment did not appear to increase the mortality of Covid-19 patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, suggesting that they may be safely continued in Covid-19 patients.","Park, Jungchan; Lee, Seung-Hwa; You, Seng Chan; Kim, Jinseob; Yang, Kwangmo",PLoS One,,316

308194,Point-of-care testing for respiratory infections during and after COVID-19,2020,"Rationale Predictive models of mortality for COVID 19 related illness have yet to be sufficiently tested. We analyzed the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases to determine possible predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 related illness. Consideration was given to demographic information, pre-existing patient conditions and acute management. Methods We collected data from a convenience sampling of patients who received care at a multicenter healthcare system in southern California between March and August 2020. Data from this retrospective review of the electronic health record included demographics (age, gender, BMI and ethnicity), comorbidities (HTN, DM, CHF, chronic lung disease), lab values, certain medications (statins, antihypertensives, experimental therapies) and mortality risk by way of the updated Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), which includes 12 categories of comorbidity predicting 1-year mortality (Quan et al., 2011). Cases were grouped as expired vs. survived. Chi square (categorical) and t-tests (continuous) were performed to determine statistical significance and Pearson r (categorical) and eta (continuous) were performed to test strength of association. Logistic regression was performed to test a predictability model for variables with the highest degree of statistical significance and correlation with mortality. Results Of 5,559 cases reviewed, 139 cases had complete data available for analysis. Of the total sample, mean age was 61(+/-16.1) and 38.8% female. Thirtyseven (26.6%) patients expired and 102 (73.4%) patients survived. Four variables were found to have a statistically significant, yet mild association with mortality. These four variables included: Betablocker use (p = 0.028, r = 0.186), CHF (p = 0.018, r = 0.200), chronic lung disease (p = 0.011, r = 0.217) and CCI (p 0.03, r = 0.216). Two variables had statistically significant and strong correlations to mortality;Age (p = 0.004, r = 0.636) and CRP (p = 0.003, r = 0.937). CRP and age accounted for 73.4% predictive value of mortality in our model. Conclusions Our analysis contributes further understanding of predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. HTN and DM were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Use of beta blockers, CHF and chronic lung disease had mild degree of association with mortality. Age and CRP served as strong predictors of mortality in our model. This retrospective convenience sample study was not conducted by way of a powered investigation. Findings should be confirmed by way of a well powered investigation before inferring utility of the model.","Graham, J. K.; Failla, K.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,316

The aim of this research was to examine the influence of pre-pandemic sports participation and substance use and misuse (SUM) on PAL during the COVID­19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 661 high-school students from Bosnia and Herzegovina (aged 15-18 years, 292 females). The investigation included 2 testing waves: before the COVID­19 pandemic (baseline, January 2020) and during the COVID­19 lockdown (follow-up, April 2020). The variables included PAL as measured by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, sports factors, and SUM. RESULTS: Sports factors at baseline were positively correlated with PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Smoking tobacco negatively affected PALs at both baseline and follow-up. Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID­19 lockdown. The substance-specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted.

312208,Positive effects of COVID-19 control measures on influenza prevention,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged public health agencies globally. In order to effectively target government responses, it is critical to identify the individuals most at risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), developing severe clinical signs, and mortality. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to present the current status of scientific knowledge in these areas and describe the need for unified global approaches, moving forwards, as well as lessons learnt for future pandemics. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Global Health were searched to the end of April 2020, as well as the Web of Science. Search terms were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. Comparative studies of risk factors from any setting, population group and in any language were included. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers and extracted in duplicate into a standardised form. Data were extracted on risk factors for COVID-19 disease, severe disease, or death and were narratively and descriptively synthesised. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and thirty-eight papers were identified post-deduplication. Thirty-three met our inclusion criteria, of which 26 were from China. Six assessed the risk of contracting the disease, 20 the risk of having severe disease and ten the risk of dying. Age, gender and co-morbidities were commonly assessed as risk factors. The weight of evidence showed increasing age to be associated with severe disease and mortality, and general comorbidities with mortality. Only seven studies presented multivariable analyses and power was generally limited. A wide range of definitions were used for disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of literature generated in the short time since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 has been considerable. Many studies have sought to document the risk factors for COVID-19 disease, disease severity and mortality; age was the only risk factor based on robust studies and with a consistent body of evidence. Mechanistic studies are required to understand why age is such an important risk factor. At the start of pandemics, large, standardised, studies that use multivariable analyses are urgently needed so that the populations most at risk can be rapidly protected.

313808,"COVID-19: before stopping specific infection prevention and control measures, be sure to exclude the diagnosis",2020,"Although coronaviruses (CoVs) have long been predicted to cause zoonotic diseases and pandemics with high probability, the lack of effective anti-pan-CoVs drugs rapidly usable against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 actually prevented a promptly therapeutic intervention for COVID-19. Development of host-targeting antivirals could be an alternative strategy for the control of emerging CoVs infections, as they could be quickly repositioned from one pandemic event to another. To contribute to these pandemic preparedness efforts, here we report on the broad-spectrum CoVs antiviral activity of MEDS433, a new inhibitor of the human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH), a key cellular enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. MEDS433 inhibited the in vitro replication of hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E, as well as of SARS-CoV-2, at low nanomolar range. Notably, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MEDS433 against SARS-CoV-2 was also observed in kidney organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells. Then, the antiviral activity of MEDS433 was reversed by the addition of exogenous uridine or the product of hDHODH, the orotate, thus confirming hDHODH as the specific target of MEDS433 in hCoVs-infected cells. Taken together, these findings suggest MEDS433 as a potential candidate to develop novel drugs for COVID-19, as well as broad-spectrum antiviral agents exploitable for future CoVs threats.","Calistri, Arianna Luganini Anna Mognetti Barbara Elder Elizabeth Sibille Giulia Conciatori Valeria Del Vecchio Claudia Del Sainas Stefano Boschi Donatella Montserrat Nuria Mirazimi Ali Lolli Marco Lucio Gribaudo Giorgio Parolin Cristina",Microorganisms,,316
313809,"COVID-19: before stopping specific infection prevention and control measures, be sure to exclude the diagnosis",2020,"Despite deep learning (DL) success in classification problems, DL classifiers do not provide a sound mechanism to decide when to refrain from predicting. Recent works tried to control the overall prediction risk with classification with rejection options. However, existing works overlook the different significance of different classes. We introduce Set-classifier with Class-specific RIsk Bounds (SCRIB) to tackle this problem, assigning multiple labels to each example. Given the output of a black-box model on the validation set, SCRIB constructs a set-classifier that controls the class-specific prediction risks with a theoretical guarantee. The key idea is to reject when the set classifier returns more than one label. We validated SCRIB on several medical applications, including sleep staging on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, X-ray COVID image classification, and atrial fibrillation detection based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. SCRIB obtained desirable class-specific risks, which are 35\%-88\% closer to the target risks than baseline methods.","Lin, Zhen; Xiao, Cao; Glass, Lucas; Westover, M.

314746,Rooming-in for Well-term Infants Born to Asymptomatic Mothers with COVID-19: Correspondence,2021,"Nowadays, an increasing number of large cities, districts, and towns have tools for the Planning and Management of Green Infrastructures. All such tools seek a progression towards a future city model that is more resilient on an environmental, economic, and social level. To achieve this, emphasis is placed on the creation of a green infrastructure and, particularly, on improving urban biodiversity, urban forests, the value of natural areas in the urban environment, periurban agriculture, ecological connectivity, and accessibility. Moreover, the recent COVID19 health crisis has further highlighted that the city dweller's relationship with the environment requires a reconciliation with nature and rural life that goes beyond typical compartmentalization. The objective must be to emphasize the need to establish creative processes which, through micro-scale activities (landscaping), generate the articulation of visible actions on a territorial scale (landscape planning) in both the natural environment (environmental landscape planning) and the urban environment (town planning based on the landscape). This article analyzes the issue of the large towns in south-west Madrid, where there is a dramatic divide on the border between the city landscape and the surrounding natural or agricultural landscape, and where there is an increasing need to establish landscapes with a certain uniqueness and to classify them as protected periurban areas, nature reserves, or land for which use and management is regulated. It is therefore important to develop environmental quality standards to assess Green Infrastructures as a whole: the administrative processes, their design, construction, maintenance, and resilience. This research focuses upon how this change in the planning and management of green periurban areas improves the multifunctionality of periurban spaces along with the intrinsic quality of the landscape, and promotes the city's sustainability and resilience and improves governance. From the conclusions drawn, it should be noted that analysis, design, and action should be built on premises of sustainability and multifunctionality, and comply with the criteria for characterizing elements as green infrastructure. In the field of study, the characterization of the periurban area, and its subsequent assessment as a green infrastructure, provide the guidelines for action for devising an Open Space Strategy. This strategy constitutes a cross-disciplinary planning tool for local authorities when reading the landscape.","Fernandez-Pablos, E.; Verdu-Vazquez, A.; Lopez-Zaldivar, O.; Lozano-Diez, R.

The results also suggest that ASEAN banks are, with the implementation of DFI, likely to uphold the banking sector stability by reducing liquidity crisis and non-performing loans during and in the post-Covid-19 era. Therefore, accelerating digital finance in ASEAN countries is considered as one of the significant means for the banking sector stability that subsequently leads to economic and financial resilience even in the face of any crises.Originality/valuePrevailing studies have mostly investigated the association between financial inclusion and banking stability in different contexts. However, this study is unique to empirically investigate the association between DFI and the ASEAN banking stability.","Banna, Hasanul Alam Md Rabiul",Studies in Economics and Finance,,316

Support groups create a place for younger women diagnosed with breast cancer to give and receive mutual aid. To meet the needs of younger women with breast cancer, an online support group was created by the Adelphi NY Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program. A SPARC grant from the International Association of Social Work with Groups (IASWG) helped the program reduce technology barriers to the online group, and help the program promote the group to community partners. The author, in the role of the support group facilitator, created a comfortable and confidential group space by embracing the needs of the clients, including the need for a flexible virtual meeting space. The ongoing facilitation of the online group impacted the support services provided by the Adelphi NY Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program, encouraging additional psychoeducational groups to be developed, and contributing to expanding online group services to meet the specific needs of all program clients when the program was forced to transition to online services due to the COVID-19 crisis striking the local community.

The virus SARS-CoV-2 employs the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the RAAS (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) system, as a receptor for entry into the cells. Several classes of synthetic drugs are available for hypertension, rarely associated with severe or mild adverse effects. New natural compounds, such as peptides, might be useful to treat some hypertensive patients. The main feature of ACE inhibitory peptides is the location of the hydrophobic residue, usually Proline, at the C-terminus. Some already known bioactive peptides derived from marine resources have potential ACE inhibitory activity and can be considered therapeutic agents to treat hypertension. Peptides isolated from marine vertebrates, invertebrates, seaweeds, or sea microorganisms displayed important biological activities to treat hypertensive patients. Here, we reviewed the anti-hypertensive activities of bioactive molecules isolated/extracted from marine organisms and discussed the associated molecular mechanisms involved. We also examined ACE2 modulation in sight of SARS2-Cov infection prevention.","Festa, Marco; Sansone, Clementina; Brunet, Christophe; Crocetta, Fabio; Di Paola, Luisa; Lombardo, Michele; Bruno, Antonino; Noonan, Douglas M; Albini, Adriana",,,316

Initial reports suggest that depression and anxiety are elevated during COVID-19, but no prior study has explored changes at the within-person level. The current study explored changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before the pandemic to soon after it first peaked in Spring 2020 in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 451) living in Long Island, New York, an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. METHODS: Depression (Children's Depression Inventory) and anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Symptoms) were assessed between December 2014 and July 2019, and, along with COVID-19 experiences, symptoms were re-assessed between March 27th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Across participants and independent of age, there were increased generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. In females, there were also increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms. Multivariable linear regression indicated that greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression symptoms. Greater COVID-19 home confinement concerns were uniquely associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and decreased social anxiety symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults at an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. experienced increased depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly amongst females. School and home confinement concerns related to the pandemic were independently associated with changes in symptoms. Overall, this report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is having multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of youth.","Hawes, Mariah T; Szenczy, Aline K; Klein, Daniel N; Hajcak, Greg; Nelson, Brady D",Psychol Med,,316

321358,Patients with mild and general COVID-19 should be negative for at least 3 consecutive nucleic acid tests before discharged,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which pre-outbreak factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as pre-outbreak respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital and employment status and education level. METHODS: Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). RESULTS: About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] &#8804; .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11-3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34-2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02-4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels.","van der Velden, Peter G; Marchand, Miquelle; Cuelenaere, Boukje; Das, Marcel",PLoS One,,316

Drawing of blood, its storage and shipment from the clinical site to the test laboratory, and the subsequent isolation, cryopreservation and thawing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before the actual test is performed can introduce numerous variables that may jeopardize the results. Therefore, no T cell test is valid without assessing the functional fitness of the PBMC being utilized. This can only be accomplished through the inclusion of positive controls that actually evaluate the performance of the antigen-specific T cell and antigen presenting cell (APC) compartments. For Caucasians, CEF peptides have been commonly used to this extent. Moreover, CEF peptides only measure CD8 cell functionality. We introduce here universal CD8+ T cell positive controls without any racial bias, as well as positive controls for the CD4+ T cell and APC compartments. In summary, we offer new tools and strategies for the assessment of PBMC functional fitness required for reliable T cell immune monitoring.","Lehmann, Alexander A; Reche, Pedro A; Zhang, Ting; Suwansaard, Maneewan; Lehmann, Paul V",,,316

METHODS: Annually, 890 to 1441 individuals were followed and contacted weekly to report ARIs. Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. RESULTS: In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified during the 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children <5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range, 7 to 11 per 100 person-years). Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact. The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type. CONCLUSIONS: Coronaviruses are sharply seasonal. They appear, based on serial interval and secondary infection risk, to have similar transmission potential to influenza A(H3N2) in the same population.","Monto, Arnold S; DeJonge, Peter M; Callear, Amy P; Bazzi, Latifa A; Capriola, Skylar B; Malosh, Ryan E; Martin, Emily T; Petrie, Joshua G",J Infect Dis,,316

The median cycle threshold (CT ) value in the specimens that had concordant positive BinaxNOW antigen results was significantly lower than that of specimens that were discordant (CT of 17.6 versus 29.6; P < 0.001). In individuals with presumably high viral loads (CT of <23.0), a 95.8% positive agreement was observed between the RT-PCR assay and BinaxNOW. Due to the possibility of false-negative results, caution must be taken when utilizing rapid antigen testing for screening asymptomatic individuals.","Okoye, Nkemakonam C; Barker, Adam P; Curtis, Kenneth; Orlandi, Richard R; Snavely, Emily A; Wright, Cameron; Hanson, Kimberly E; Pearson, Lauren N",J. clin. microbiol,,316

We aim to study secondary attack rate (SAR) of COVID-19 in household contacts of pediatric index cases from Gujarat, Western Indian state. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, details of 2412 paediatric patients were collected from Government records. Through stratified random sampling 10% (n = 242) of the patients were selected for the study and were telephonically contacted for obtaining the details of household secondary infection; 72 pediatric index cases having 287 household contacts were included in the study. RESULTS: The SAR in household contacts of pediatric index cases was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.74-4%). Majority of the index cases were males (94.4%) with 66% of the patients being admitted at various hospitals and isolation facilities (45%); 37% were home quarantine. Of 72, 50 (74%) cases were aged between 12 and 18 years. The family size of the index cases causing secondary infection was comparatively larger than index cases without secondary household infection (6.75 ± 2.3 versus 4.9 ± 1.9; P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The household SAR from pediatric patients is low and is closely associated with the family size of the index cases. Hence, home quarantine should be advocated in smaller families with appropriate isolation facilities.","Shah, Komal; Kandre, Yogini; Mavalankar, Dileep",J. public health (Oxf),,316
329726,Kidney transplantation and the lockdown effect,2020,"The covid-19 pandemic led to rapid and large-scale government intervention in economies and societies. A common policy response to covid-19 outbreaks has been the lockdown or quarantine. Designed to slow the spread of the disease, lockdowns have unintended consequences for the environment. This article examines the impact of Colombia's lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombia's lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombia's regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research.","Amador-Jiménez, Mónica; Millner, Naomi; Palmer, Charles; Pennington, R Toby; Sileci, Lorenzo",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,316

332550,Cytokine storm associated coagulation complications in COVID-19 patients: Pathogenesis and Management,2021,"Seeking to examine the implications of social distancing, isolation and the silencing of public spaces brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic, I offer an interpretation of Kafka’s short story ‘The Silence of the Sirens’ contrasting it to the Homeric original. In Homer’s story, Odysseus resists the temptation of the Sirens’ deadly song by having himself tied to the mast of his ship, while his oarsmen, ears blocked with beeswax, sail quickly by. By contrast, in Kafka’s telling of the story, the Sirens fall silent. A solitary Odysseus, indifferent to them, sails by peacefully, his ears blocked, his ‘great eyes’ staring in the distance. Homer’s story has long been seen as a warning against the seductions of Siren voices like those of opportunist demagogues. Throughout the Odyssey, Odysseus himself offers a complex archetype of heroic leadership, navigating adroitly and prudently the dangers of stormy seas. Kafka’s character, by contrast, proposes a different archetype, one akin to the Stoics’ homo viator, the individual who sails through life’s adversities by accepting them and turning them into a source of inner strength and wisdom. In this way, Kafka offers two things: first, an insightful explanation of why silence and isolation can be deadly when they leaving us alone with our darkest fears and fantasies, and second, an archetype of hope that is attuned to our times on how to cope with pain and anxiety.","Gabriel, Yiannis",Leadership,,316

Material and methods: The frequency of ABO system antigens was compared in 73 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 52 clinically healthy donors. Infection severity was assessed by comparing the frequency of antigens by disease severity and mortality. Results: The risk of suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection increases in subjects with A vs. non-A antigen (OR = 1.45; 95 % CI: 1.061-1.921). Blood phenotype O reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 0.686; 95 % CI: 0.522-0.903). No differences were found regarding disease severity. In critically ill patients, the risk of mortality increased in subjects with A vs. non-A antigen (OR = 3.34; 95 % CI: 1.417-8.159).

335170,The laboratory tests and host immunity of COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness,2020,"ObjectiveA growing body of research evidence shows that individuals with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic including deterioration of OCD symptoms plus relapse from previously well-controlled OCD. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in a single case study of a patient with OCD consisting of contamination concerns. In addition, the effectiveness of providing Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) virtually is evaluated with regards to the treatment outcome in COVID-19 related OCD.Case reportThis study describes a 41-year-old, single, employed female with OCD consisting of concerns of contamination and infecting others thereby causing harm. The total duration of the disorder is 32 years with the most recent presentation being of three years duration. Relapse during the pandemic resulted in OCD symptoms being solely concerned with COVID-related contamination. The questionnaires routinely completed at the time of assessment and treatment were the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI);Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS);Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Clinical data were collated and analysed prior to and during the pandemic. Treatment consisted of ERP and was adapted for provision via a virtual platform. ERP involved exposure to a graded hierarchy of COVID-specific anxiety-provoking situations modified to take government guidelines into consideration.DiscussionPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic the patient's response to treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) including ERP indicated a 79% improvement in OCD symptoms on self -rated measures. The impact of the pandemic led to a significant 65% deterioration in OCD symptoms, regarding COVID-19 contamination concerns. Intervention with ERP resulted in 73% improvement over a three-month period. Measures of depression symptoms indicated an 80% improvement pre-COVID, with a 78% deterioration at relapse. Following treatment, the patient also showed a 65% improvement in depression symptoms. Improvements have been maintained at one month follow-up.ConclusionThe case study supports literature indicating the exacerbation of OCD symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with contamination fears and washing compulsions. The promising results support the use of ERP as an effective treatment for COVID-related OCD symptoms. It also validates the provision of CBT interventions virtually to ensure accessibility of treatment to OCD sufferers.","Sibanda-Mbanga, Josephine Govender Anusha",BJPsych Open,,316

The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I2 = 29.1%). Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus. Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.","Mantovani, Alessandro; Beatrice, Giorgia; Dalbeni, Andrea",Liver Int,,316
339416,Cocooned in Covid,2020,"We analyse motivations and perspectives of outdoor tourists and tourism stakeholders in the Islamic Republic of Iran. We use semi-structured qualitative interviews, and interpretivist grounded theory, with basic and axial coding and fine-scaled differential narrative analysis. We distinguish three principal tourist segments, seeking: exhilaration through adventure;enjoyment of nature;and escape from cultural restrictions and associated social surveillance. The nature and adventure segments behave as ecotourists, and gain improved eudaimonic wellbeing. Nature tourists gain psychological restoration through calm and tranquil nature contemplation. Adventure tourists gain psychological recharge through challenge and achievement. The escape segment, in contrast, aims for hedonic wellbeing, is heedless of its social and ecological impacts, and does not behave as ecotourists. It adopts an ecotourism disguise, to avoid being observed as it flouts expected cultural norms. It uses unauthorised and clandestine logistics providers, creating substantial management obstacles for authorised commercial outdoor tour providers. Temporary escape from social surveillance generates mental health gains as a psychological safety valve for the tourists concerned, but their behaviour imposes unsustainable costs on local communities, natural environment, nature and adventure tourists, and outdoor tourism operators. These costs reduce the net social economic gains achieved from the mental health benefits of outdoor tourism.","Akhoundogli, M.; Buckley, R.",Journal of Ecotourism,,316

It eventually became clear that those models, originally developed to serve other purposes, implied limitations at different stages of the analyses-disclosing loci, measuring their effects and providing additional parameters for adequate biological/medical interpretations. The present paper is aimed to ponder whether it is realistic and worth to try and further amend classical models of genetic effects or it proves more sensible to undertake alternative theoretical strategies instead. In order to further feed into that debate, mathematical developments for gene-environment interaction stemming from the classical models of genetic effects are here revised and brought up-to-date with the prospects present-day available data bestow, particularly in the context of precision medicine. Those developments strengthen the methodology required to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.","'Alvarez-Castro, Jos'e M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01628v1.pdf,316

341713,Convalescent plasma transfusion for COVID-19: Impact of neutralizing antibodies on respiratory outcomes,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Despite weight loss challenges in young adulthood, 17% of participants in the Study of Novel Approaches to Weight Gain Prevention (SNAP) weight gain prevention study lost &#8805; 5% of their body weight at 3 years. These ""weight losers"" (n = 88) were compared to ""weight maintainers"" (n = 143), who successfully prevented weight gains by staying within ± 2.5% of their baseline weight at 3 years. METHOD: Weight losers and maintainers (n = 231; 18-35 years old) were drawn from the SNAP randomized controlled trial (n = 599), which compared two weight gain prevention interventions with a control group. Participants completed anthropometric and psychosocial assessments at baseline, 4 months (end of face-to-face intervention), and 1, 2, and 3 years. RESULTS: Three-year weight losers had significantly greater weight losses than maintainers by 4 months, and weight trajectories continued to diverge. Three-year weight change group was not associated with treatment assignment. At pretreatment, weight losers were heavier, closer to their self-reported highest ever weight, and further away from their self-identified ideal weight. Across treatment, weight losers had greater dietary restraint and autonomous motivation, had lower disinhibition and self-identified ideal weight, and self-weighed more frequently than weight maintainers. CONCLUSIONS: Weight gain prevention messaging may be sufficient to initiate weight loss in a subset of young adults who are heavier and closer to their highest weight at baseline. Psychological and behavioral characteristics more consistent with weight loss may explain differences in weight outcomes between losers and maintainers at 3 years. Future studies may consider the effects of weight gain prevention versus weight loss messaging in tailoring weight control interventions for young adults.

DESIGN: Ecological study. SETTING: Continental France administrative areas (départements; henceforth counties). The study period, from 18 March to 30 May 2020, corresponds to the main first outbreak period in France. POPULATION: COVID-19-linked in-hospital deaths. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital deaths and demographics (population, human density, male sex and population percentage >59 years old) were obtained from national and centralised public databases. County weather indexes were calculated by the French National Meteorological Agency. METHODS: In this observational ecological study, the relationship between in-hospital COVID-19-related mortality and climate zones in continental French counties were analysed, by comparing the cumulative in-hospital death tolls in France by county to other factors (population density, climate, age and sex). The study period lasted from 18 March to 30 May 2020. A multivariate linear-regression analysis of in-hospital mortality included climate zones, population density, population >59 years old and percentages of males as potential predictors. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Weather indicators and population density were factors independently associated with the COVID-19 death toll. Colder counties had significantly higher mortality rates (p<0.00001). Percentages of males and population >59 years old in counties did not affect COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Many parameters influence COVID-19 outbreak-severity indicators. Population density is a strong factor but its exact importance is difficult to discern.

344320,"Practical and Ethical Nurse-Led Infection Control: Lessons from the Past, Moving Toward the Future",2020,"PURPOSE: Since its discovery in December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, causing the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) pandemic. As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. RESULTS: Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The recent literature provides evidence that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, recommending caution to pregnant women and couples planning natural pregnancy or assisted reproduction.","Khalili, Mohammad Ali; Leisegang, Kristian; Majzoub, Ahmad; Finelli, Renata; Panner Selvam, Manesh Kumar; Henkel, Ralf; Mojgan, Moshrefi; Agarwal, Ashok",World J Mens Health,,316

345022,Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Interstitial Lung Disease: Emerging Clues from Pharmacovigilance,2020,"Within the recent pandemic, scientists and clinicians are engaged in seeking new technology to stop or slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.","Dairi, Abdelkader; Harrou, Fouzi; Zeroual, Abdelhafid; Hittawe, Mohamad Mazen; Sun, Ying",J Biomed Inform,,316

METHODS: Forty patients who attended for intravitreal injections were divided in those with less (<4h) and more (>4h) than 4 hours of mask use. Each group was divided depending on the application or not of povidone-iodine in the periocular area (PA) of the mask. Bacterial load was studied on PA and mouth area (MA) samples. RESULTS: The bacterial load in the PA was higher in the >4h group compared with the <4h group (13.2 vs 48.75 Colony Forming Units/µL; p=0.03). The contamination in the PA significantly decreased after applying povidone-iodine in the >4h group (p=0.01). The use or not of povidone-iodine was strongly correlated to a positive culture (OR=9.0, p=0.00. CI 1.63-49.44). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical face masks worn for more than 4 hours presents higher contamination in the PA than those with less use. Bacterial load in the PA is reduced with povidone-iodine on masks used for more than 4 hours. This contamination should be considered in the asepsis protocol of intravitreal injections.","Marin-Nieto, Juan; Reino-Perez, Carmen; Santillana-Cernuda, Genoveva; Díaz-Bernal, José Manuel; Luque-Aranda, Rafael; García-Basterra, Ignacio",Retina,,316

In the current study, HSPA5 has been found to be expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and significantly increased in 14 of 31 types of cancer tissues. In lung cancer, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were 253-fold increase than that of ACE2. Meanwhile, in both malignant tumors and matched normal samples across almost all cancer types, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were much higher than those of ACE2. Higher expression of HSPA5 significantly decreased patient overall survival (OS) in 7 types of cancers. Moreover, systematic analyses found that 7.15% of 5,068 COVID-19 cases have malignant cancer coincidental situations, and the rate of severe events of COVID-19 patients with cancers present a higher trend than that for all COVID-19 patients, showing a significant difference (33.33% vs 16.09%, p<0.01). Collectively, these data imply that the tissues with high HSPA5 expression, not low ACE2 expression, are susceptible to be invaded by SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, this study not only indicates the clinical significance of HSPA5 in COVID-19 disease and cancers, but also provides potential clues for further medical treatments and managements of COVID-19 patients.","Fu, Jiewen; Wei, Chunli; He, Jiayue; Zhang, Lianmei; Zhou, Ju; Balaji, Kyathegowdanadoddi Srinivasa; Shen, Shiyi; Peng, Jiangzhou; Sharma, Amrish; Fu, Junjiang",Int J Biol Sci,,316

When assessing the similarity between data points, one can build various distance measures using subsets of these features. Using the fewest features but still retaining sufficient information about the system is crucial in many statistical learning approaches, particularly when data are sparse. We introduce a statistical test that can assess the relative information retained when using two different distance measures, and determine if they are equivalent, independent, or if one is more informative than the other. This in turn allows finding the most informative distance measure out of a pool of candidates. The approach is applied to find the most relevant policy variables for controlling the Covid-19 epidemic and to find compact yet informative representations of atomic structures, but its potential applications are wide ranging in many branches of science.","Glielmo, Aldo; Zeni, Claudio; Cheng, Bingqing; Csanyi, Gabor; Laio, Alessandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.15079v1.pdf,316

However, owing to the low specificity of CT findings, differential diagnosis is essential. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 include ground-glass opacifications and consolidations with predominant distribution in bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural parts of the lung. These imaging findings are non-specific and may resemble other lung conditions, including ultrasonic humidifier lung, which is a condition that develops on inhaling aerosols generated by ultrasonic humidifiers. We present two patients with initial symptoms similar to COVID-19. CT examination revealed centrilobular nodules and consolidations with upper lobe-predominant distribution, although atypical for COVID-19, but key findings for ultrasonic humidifier lung. Therefore, ultrasonic humidifier lung could be a differential diagnosis for COVID-19 in dry environments. Characteristic CT findings and a history of ultrasonic humidifier use are critical to the final diagnosis.","Ro, Shosei Imai Ryosuke Kitamura Atsushi Jinta Torahiko Nishimura Naoki",Respirology Case Reports,,316

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on neuroimaging utilisation at an academic medical centre in the United States caused by this shutdown. METHODS: Exam volumes from 1 February 2020 to 11 August 2020 were calculated based on patient location, including outpatient, inpatient and emergency, as well as modality type, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. 13 March 2020 was designated as the beginning of the shutdown period for the radiology department and 1 May 2020 was designated as the reopening date. The scan volumes during the pre-shutdown, shutdown and post-shutdown periods were compared using t-tests. RESULTS: Overall, neuroimaging scan volumes declined significantly by 41% during the shutdown period and returned to 98% of the pre-shutdown period levels after the shutdown, with an estimated 3231 missed scans. Outpatient scan volumes were more greatly affected than inpatient scan volumes, while emergency scan volumes declined the least during the shutdown. In addition, the magnetic resonance imaging scan volumes declined to a greater degree than the computed tomography scan volumes during the shutdown. CONCLUSION: The shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial but transient impact on neuroimaging utilisation overall, with variable magnitude depending on patient location and modality type.","Ginat, Daniel Thomas; Kenniff, James",Neuroradiol J,,316

STD emerge early in the course of the disease, seem to be more common in SARS-CoV-2 infection than in other upper respiratory tract infections, and could in some cases persist for long after resolution of respiratory symptoms. Current evidence suggests that STD probably result from a loss of function of olfactory sensory neurons and taste buds, mainly caused by infection, inflammation, and subsequent dysfunction of supporting non-neuronal cells in the mucosa. However, the possible occurrence of other mechanisms leading to chemosensory dysfunction has also been hypothesized, and contrasting data have been reported regarding the direct infection of sensory neurons by SARS-CoV-2. In this mini-review, we summarize the currently available literature on pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of STD in COVID-19 and discuss possible future directions of research on this topic.","Mastrangelo, Andrea; Bonato, Matteo; Cinque, Paola",Neurosci Lett,,316

Communications about prognostication and goals of care are commonly initiated by physicians. Adolescents and young and middle-age adults with complex chronic or terminal illness often are not provided with timely, clear, complete information or palliative care support. Early palliative care for chronically ill patients facilitates discussions of prognostication and goals of care, in addition to providing symptom management. Such discussions do not diminish hope but rather allow patients to adjust hope to attain an optimal quality of life. Nurses can become active, confident advocates for patients with terminal illness of any age, and they are well positioned to assess patients and engage in goals of care and end-of-life conversations. It is especially important that palliative care nurses promote and maintain these early and comprehensive discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic because this population is at a high risk of complications from the coronavirus.","Koch, Amie; Mantzouris, Stephen",J Hosp Palliat Nurs,,316

369839,COVID-19 and Alcohol Misuse: A Case Report,2021,"In this paper, we studied the in silico interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptor with two bioactive compounds, i.e., nicotine and caffeine, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.","Mohammadi, Saeedeh; Heidarizadeh, Mohammad; Entesari, Mehrnaz; Esmailpour, Ayoub; Esmailpour, Mohammad; Moradi, Rasoul; Sakhaee, Nader; Doustkhah, Esmail",,,316

370823,Association Between ABO Blood Group System and COVID-19 Susceptibility in Wuhan,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Medical institutions are using barrier enclosure devices during intubation procedures and other aerosol-generating medical procedures without evidence of their effectiveness or usability, potentially compromising patient care, and provider safety. Our objective was to determine the degree of protection offered by these devices and explore other usability factors for two popular barrier systems. METHODS: A simulated trial comparing an intubation box, a frame and plastic tarp system, and unprotected intubation was performed in an academic emergency department. Ten emergency physicians were recruited to participate. Our primary outcome was the degree of contamination from secretions measured by average surface area exposed to phosphorescent material. Secondary outcomes included: laryngoscopy time and time to barrier application, unsuccessful intubation attempts, and usability ratings for each system. Descriptive statistics were reported for all variables of interest and a linear mixed model was used to analyze contamination and laryngoscopy time. Usability was captured through electronic questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Contamination was more prevalent with the box, compared to the frame and tarp, and no device, however, this did not achieve statistical significance (13.2% versus 8.1% versus 12.2%, P = 0.17). A barrier system delayed intubation when compared to using no system (no system = 24.4 s [95% CI 17.3-27.5], frame = 54.4 s [95% CI 13.8-95.0], box = 33.8 s [95% CI 21.4-46.1], P = 0.02). In assessing usability, 30% of users preferred the use of a box barrier, 40% of users preferred the frame, and 30% would not use either in future intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to no barrier protection, an intubation box enclosure offers limited additional protection. A frame and tarp system reduces exposure at the expense of visibility and operator comfort. Finally, barrier systems do not appear to have a clinically significant impact on airway management.","Ben-Yakov, Maxim; Price, Courtney; Dharamsi, Alia; Tawadrous, Davy; Choi, Joseph M",Ann.

These manifestations range from headache and dizziness to altered mental status and consciousness, anosmia, ageusia, sensory disturbances, and stroke. The mechanisms by which the neurological symptoms arise are not yet determined but may either proceed as an indirect consequence of systemic hyperinflammation or result from the direct invasion of the virus to neural and glial cells. The neural invasion can explain both the retrograde pathway of encephalitis and the early manifestation of anosmia by invading the olfactory bulb. Moreover, in the case of attacking the brain stem, it may take part in the early apnea manifestation reported by patients. Additionally, neurotropism of the virus could be the cause of acute hemorrhagic encephalitis. Hyperinflammation can have acute and prolonged effects in the nervous system, such as acute demyelination and predisposition to multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory state contributes to hypercoagulation, which in turn could result in cerebrovascular injuries in COVID-19 patients. This chapter would discuss that the neurologic manifestations of the COVID-19 are to be looked at as a multifactorial entangled phenomenon.","Delavari, Farnaz; Varzaneh, Farnaz Najmi; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,316

Although not completely understood, SARS-CoV-2 may have the same means of transmission. Preventive social measures aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread could impact transmission of other respiratory viruses as well. The aim of this study is to report the detection of RSV and influenza during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic in a heavily affected community. Methods: Prospective study with pediatric and adult populations seeking care for COVID-19-like symptoms during the fall and winter of 2020 at two hospitals in Southern Brazil. RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was performed for all participants. Results: 1435 suspected COVID-19 participants (1137 adults, and 298 children). were included between May and August. Median age was 37.7 years (IQR = 29.6-47.7), and 4.92 years (IQR = 1.96-9.53), for the adult and child cohorts, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 469 (32.7%) while influenza and RSV were not detected at all. Conclusions: Measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely exerted a huge impact in the spread of alternate respiratory pathogens. These findings contribute to the knowledge about the dynamics of virus spread. Further, it may be considered for guiding therapeutic choices for these other viruses.","Varela, Fernanda Hammes; Scotta, Marcelo Comerlato; Polese-Bonatto, Márcia; Sartor, Ivaine Tais Sauthier; Ferreira, Charles Francisco; Fernandes, Ingrid Rodrigues; Zavaglia, Gabriela Oliveira; de Almeida, Walquiria Aparecida Ferreira; Arakaki-Sanchez, Denise; Pinto, Leonardo Araújo; Nader Bastos, Gisele Alsina; Nasi, Luiz Antônio; Falavigna, Maicon; Pitrez, Paulo Márcio; Stein, Renato T",J Glob Health,,316

Physical distancing measures, for instance, may affect sexual health, impacting access to HIV prevention supplies and changing sexual behaviour, as well as mental health, increasing feelings of unsafety and weakening community support ties. These effects can be worsened among socially marginalised groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). Brazil is among the countries most affected by COVID-19 in the world, where control measures have been inconsistently implemented. We aim to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual and mental health of adolescent and adult MSM and TGW in Brazil. METHODS: Convergent mixed-method prospective cohort study, nested in two ongoing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) cohorts in Brazil, named PrEP1519 and Combina. Participants will be invited to answer, at baseline and after 6 months, a questionnaire about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual behaviour, HIV prevention and mental health. Data on HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STI) will be collected as part of routine follow-up from the cohorts. Main outcome measures (HIV infection, STI and depression symptoms) will be observed within 12 months after baseline. Sample size is estimated at 426 participants. Complementarily, 50 participants will be invited to in-depth interviews through video calls or interactive voice response, and 20 will be invited to chronicle their lives during the pandemic through digital diaries. Triangulation will be done across qualitative methods and with the quantitative data.

Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19.","Ouyang, Lichen; Gong, Jie",Med Hypotheses,,316

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the systemic ableism that is embedded within American culture, particularly through health care bias and discrimination. In turn, this creates further marginalization during diagnosis, triage, and treatment of the novel coronavirus. Multiple states have filed complaints against state triage protocols that suggest an abled life is more worthy than a life with a disability. Although many of these protocols have been updated and replaced, generalized triage statements fail to address health care bias that is embedded within the American system. In addition to the existing solutions, proposed solutions to addressing health care bias include integrating social workers into the emergency management process and the overall disaster management field. To combat bias and ableism across the health care system, a social justice perspective that highlights discrimination, inequalities, and inequities in overall individual care must be adopted.","Felt, Ashley Brooke; Mitcham, Dionne; Hathcock, Morgan; Swienton, Raymond; Harris, Curtis",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,316

METHODS: OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection were extracted from the hospital discharge, causes of death and infectious diseases registries in individuals who participated in the FinnGen study (n=260 405). Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine association. Comorbidities for either COVID-19 or OSA were selected as covariates. We performed a meta-analysis with previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 445 individuals with COVID-19, and 38 (8.5%) of them with OSA of whom 19 out of 91 (20.9%) were hospitalised. OSA associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation independent from age, sex, BMI and comorbidities (p-unadjusted=5.13×10-5, OR-adjusted=2.93 (95% CI 1.02 to 8.39), p-adjusted=0.045). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.25). A meta-analysis of OSA and severe COVID-19 showed association across 15 835 COVID-19 positive controls, and n=1294 patients with OSA with severe COVID-19 (OR=2.37 (95% 1.14 to 4.95), p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Risk for contracting COVID-19 was the same for patients with OSA and those without OSA. In contrast, among COVID-19 positive patients, OSA was associated with higher risk for hospitalisation. Our findings are in line with earlier works and suggest OSA as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19.","Strausz, Satu; Kiiskinen, Tuomo; Broberg, Martin; Ruotsalainen, Sanni; Koskela, Jukka; Bachour, Adel; Palotie, Aarno; Palotie, Tuula; Ripatti, Samuli; Ollila, Hanna M",,,316

However, knowledge on the relationship between long-term maintained healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still sparse. We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9,677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5,194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5,194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (3 < MDS &#8804; 6) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34-0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS > 6) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS &#8804; 3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, better adherence to the Mediterranean diet may be associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. Our results are applicable only to persons who are not health professionals.","Perez-Araluce, R; Martinez-Gonzalez, M A; Fernández-Lázaro, C I; Bes-Rastrollo, M; Gea, A; Carlos, S",Clin. nutr.

380341,Change in Allergy Practice during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Single incision plus one port left-side approach (SILS+1/L) totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) is an emerging technique for the treatment of gastric cancer. Reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy has a number of potential advantages for patients compared with conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy: relieving postoperative pain, shortening hospital stay and offering a better cosmetic outcome. Nevertheless, there are no previous reports on the use of SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut Roux-en-Y (uncut R-Y) reconstruction. AIM: To investigate the initial feasibility of SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut Roux-en-Y digestive tract reconstruction (uncut R-Y reconstruction) to treat distal gastric cancer. METHODS: A total of 21 patients who underwent SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut R-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer were enrolled. All patients were treated at The Second Hospital of Shandong University. Reconstructions were performed intracorporeally with 60 mm endoscopic linear stapler and 45 mm no-knife stapler. The clinicopathological characteristics, surgical details, postoperative short-term outcomes, postoperative follow-up upper gastrointestinal radiography findings and endoscopy results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: All SILS+1/L operations were performed by SILS+1/L TLDG successfully. The patient population included 13 men and 8 women with a mean age of 48.2 years (ranged from 40 years to 70 years) and median body mass index of 22.8 kg/m2. There were no conversions to open laparotomy, and no other port was placed. The mean operation time was 146 min (ranged 130-180 min), and the estimated mean blood loss was 54 mL (ranged 20-110 mL). The mean duration to flatus and discharge was 2.3 (ranged 1-3.5) and 7.3 (ranged 6-9) d, respectively. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 42 (ranged 30-47). Two patients experienced mild postoperative complications, including surgical site infection (wound at the navel incision) and mild postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade A). Follow-up upper gastrointestinal radiography and endoscopy were carried out at 3 mo postoperatively. No patients experienced moderate or severe food stasis, alkaline gastritis or bile reflux during the follow-up period. No recanalization of the biliopancreatic limb was found. CONCLUSION: SILS+1/L TLDG with uncut R-Y reconstruction could be safely performed as a reduced port surgery.","Zhou, Wei; Dong, Chang-Zheng; Zang, Yi-Feng; Xue, Ying; Zhou, Xing-Guo; Wang, Yu; Ding, Yin-Lu",World J Gastroenterol,,316

In the population-based study, 8,476 of 231,601 (3.7%) residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; however, the occurrence was significantly lower among patients with IBD (62 of the 2,486 patients=2.5%, p<0.01) and other IMIDs (531 of 16,492 patients=3.2%, p<0.01) as compared to patients without IMIDs. CONCLUSION: Patients with IMIDs, including IBD, had a significantly lower susceptibility to COVID-19 than patients without IMIDs and neither immunosuppressive therapies nor IBD activity were associated with the disease course of COVID-19.","Attauabi, Mohamed; Poulsen, Anja; Theede, Klaus; Pedersen, Natalia; Larsen, Lone; Jess, Tine; Rosager Hansen, Malte; Kajbæk Verner-Andersen, Marianne; V Haderslev, Kent; Berg Lødrup, Anders; Molazahi, Akbar; Neumann, Anders; Wase, Abdel; Seidelin, Jakob Benedict; Burisch, Johan",J. crohns. colitis,,316

Leveraging short-term surrogates in real-world data (RWD) can guide policymakers evaluating new treatments. In this paper, we develop novel estimators for the proportion of treatment effect (PTE) on the true outcome explained by a surrogate in RWD settings. We propose inverse probability weighted and doubly robust (DR) estimators of an optimal transformation of the surrogate and PTE by semi-nonparametrically modeling the relationship between the true outcome and surrogate given baseline covariates. We show that our estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and the DR estimator is consistent when either the propensity score model or outcome regression model is correctly specified. We compare our proposed estimators to existing estimators and show a reduction in bias and gains in efficiency through simulations. We illustrate the utility of our method in obtaining an interpretable PTE by conducting a cross-trial comparison of two biologic therapies for ulcerative colitis.","Han, Larry; Wang, Xuan; Cai, Tianxi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05513v1.pdf,316

Selected biomolecules that are the most commonly chosen as molecular modelling objects in this field are presented. In most of the reviewed works, ligand docking using solely force field methods was performed, employing various molecular targets involved in metabolism and action of estrogens. Other molecular modelling methods such as molecular dynamics and combined quantum mechanics with molecular mechanics have also been successfully used to predict the properties of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Among published works, a great number also focused on the application of different types of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to examine estrogen's structures and activities. Although the interactions between estrogens and xenoestrogens with various proteins are the most commonly studied, other aspects such as penetration of estrogens through lipid bilayers or their ability to adsorb on different materials are also explored using theoretical calculations. Apart from molecular mechanics and statistical methods, quantum mechanics calculations are also employed in the studies of estrogens and xenoestrogens. Their applications include computation of spectroscopic properties, both vibrational and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and also in quantum molecular dynamics simulations and crystal structure prediction. The main aim of this review is to present the great potential and versatility of various molecular modelling methods in the studies on estrogens and xenoestrogens.","Mazurek, Anna Helena; Szeleszczuk, Lukasz; Simonson, Thomas; Pisklak, Dariusz Maciej",,,316

Methods: This is a single-center clinical trial of COVID-19 patients at NYU Winthrop Hospital from March 31 to April 28, 2020. Patients in this trial received hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2.0 atmospheres of pressure in monoplace hyperbaric chambers for 90 minutes daily for a maximum of five total treatments. Controls were identified using propensity score matching among COVID-19 patients admitted during the same time period. Using competing-risks survival regression, we analyzed our primary outcome of inpatient mortality and secondary outcome of mechanical ventilation. Results: We treated 20 COVID-19 patients with hyperbaric oxygen. Ages ranged from 30 to 79 years with an oxygen requirement ranging from 2 to 15 liters on hospital days 0 to 14. Of these 20 patients, two (10%) were intubated and died, and none remain hospitalized. Among 60 propensity-matched controls based on age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, troponin, D-dimer, hospital day, and oxygen requirement, 18 (30%) were intubated, 13 (22%) have died, and three (5%) remain hospitalized (with one still requiring mechanical ventilation). Assuming no further deaths among controls, we estimate that the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios were 0.37 for inpatient mortality (p=0.14) and 0.26 for mechanical ventilation (p=0.046). Conclusion: Though limited by its study design, our results demonstrate the safety of hyperbaric oxygen among COVID-19 patients and strongly suggests the need for a well-designed, multicenter randomized control trial.","Gorenstein, Scott A; Castellano, Michael L; Slone, Eric S; Gillette, Brian; Liu, Helen; Alsamarraie, Cindy; Jacobson, Alan M; Wall, Stephen P; Adhikari, Samrachana; Swartz, Jordan L; McMullen, Jenica J S; Osorio, Marcela; Koziatek, Christian A; Lee, David C",Undersea Hyperb Med,,316

We retrospectively examined significant factors associated with disease severity in symptomatic COVID-19 patients (COVID-Pts) admitted to our institution between February 20 and April 30, 2020. METHODS: All patients were diagnosed based on the genetic detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Information on the initial symptoms, laboratory data, and computed tomography (CT) images at hospitalization were collected from the patients' records. COVID-Pts were categorized as those with critical or severe illness (Pts-CSI) or those with moderate or mild illness (Pt-MMI). All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS: Data from 61 patients (16 Pt-CSI, 45 Pt-MMI), including 58 Japanese and three East Asians, were analyzed. Pt-CSI were significantly older and had hypertension or diabetes than Pt-MMI (P < 0.001, 0.014 and < 0.001, respectively). Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in Pt-CSI than in Pt-MMI (P < 0.001), whereas the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein level were significantly higher in Pt-CSI than in Pt-MMI (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the CT images of 60 patients, bilateral lung lesions were more frequently observed in Pt-CSI than in Pt-MMI (P = 0.013). Among the 16 Pt-CSI, 15 received antiviral therapy, 12 received tocilizumab, five underwent methylprednisolone treatment, six received mechanical ventilation, and one died.

386704,Contrasting evidence for corticosteroid treatment for coronavirus-induced cytokine storm,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 spread rapidly in Brazil despite the country's well established health and social protection systems. Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). METHODS: From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged &#8805;60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. FINDINGS: The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. INTERPRETATION: In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly. FUNDING: None.

The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality. This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries. Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome. During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic. Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative. China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic. Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients. Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data. Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients. In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means. Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward.","Shinde, Rajesh S; Naik, Mekhala D; Shinde, Shital R; Bhandare, Manish S; Chaudhari, Vikram A; Shrikhande, Shailesh V; Dcruz, Anil K",Indian J Surg Oncol,,316

Nevertheless, there are limited data on its feasibility, safety, and physiologic effects. The objective of our study was to assess the tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: This historical cohort study was performed across four hospitals in Calgary, Canada. Included patients had suspected COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation, and underwent awake prone positioning. The duration, frequency, tolerability, and adverse events from prone positioning were recorded. Respiratory parameters were assessed before, during, and after prone positioning. The primary outcome was the tolerability and safety of prone positioning. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (n = 12 ICU, n = 5 hospital ward) were included between April and May 2020. The median (range) number of prone positioning days was 1 (1-7) and the median number of sessions was 2 (1-6) per day. The duration of prone positioning was 75 (30-480) min, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 91% (84-95) supine and 98% (92-100) prone. Limitations to prone position duration were pain/general discomfort (47%) and delirium (6%); 47% of patients had no limitations. Seven patients (41%) required intubation and two patients (12%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, prone positioning non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia was safe; however, many patients did not tolerate prolonged durations. Although patients had improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in the prone position, many still required intubation. Future studies are required to determine methods to improve the tolerability of awake prone positioning and whether there is an impact on clinical outcomes.","Solverson, Kevin; Weatherald, Jason; Parhar, Ken Kuljit S",Can. j. anaesth,,316

394652,Primary and secondary diseases of the perinephric space: an approach to imaging diagnosis with emphasis on MRI,2020,"Twitter has been heavily used as an important channel for communicating and discussing about events in real-time. In such major events, many uninformative tweets are also published rapidly by many users, making it hard to follow the events. In this paper, we address this problem by investigating machine learning methods for automatically identifying informative tweets among those that are relevant to a target event. We examine both traditional approaches with a rich set of handcrafted features and state of the art approaches with automatically learned features. We further propose a hybrid model that leverages both the handcrafted features and the automatically learned ones. Our experiments on several large datasets of real-world events show that the latter approaches significantly outperform the former and our proposed model performs the best, suggesting highly effective mechanisms for tracking mass events.","Joao, Renato Stoffalette",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05656v1.pdf,316

395289,"""You Have to Die Not to Come to Work"": A Mixed Methods Study of Attitudes and Behaviors regarding Presenteeism, Absenteeism and Influenza Vaccination among Healthcare Personnel with Respiratory Illness in Israel, 2016-2019",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created a situation with an urgent need to produce a virtual system for the 2019-2020 pediatric anesthesiology fellowship cycle. With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviews, and applicants were exposed to a wide array of variability in the process-all while under the stress of interviewing for fellowship positions. AIMS: The aim of this survey-based study was to obtain input from applicants to help guide program decisions about ""best practice"" for the future for both pediatric anesthesiology and other graduate medical education matches. METHODS: A 28-question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors for distribution of the survey link to all recently matched applicants. Incoming fellows who were accepted outside of the match process were also invited to respond. RESULTS: Fifty respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 30% based on the 167 matched fellowship positions nationwide (50/167). A majority of the respondents reported they felt virtual interviews allowed them to learn the following things equally as well compared with a traditional interview about fellowship programs: salary and benefits, available academic opportunities, available clinical opportunities, clinical schedule of the fellowship, mentorship opportunities, clinical experience and training of the fellowship, and expected work-life balance during fellowship. Respondents report that the most important factors in making their rank list were perceived goodness of fit, desired geographic location, and perception of program leadership. Additionally, respondents ranked the types of information and interactions that they found most helpful to make decisions. All respondents reported the benefit of cost savings compared to a traditional application cycle, with the most commonly reported estimated savings being $3,000-$5,000 per respondent. CONCLUSIONS: These results allow recommendations for ""best practices"" for virtual interviews to include programs providing an electronic packet of information prior to the interview day, providing dedicated time for applicants to interact with current fellows, providing applicants an understanding of the city/region of the location of the program, and offering a completely optional postinterview visit, when possible. Based on the results of this survey, we recommend that programs continue to offer virtual interviews as a penalty-free option for applicants, even when in-person interviews may be feasible.","DiGiusto, Matthew; Lupa, Maria Concetta; Corridore, Marco; Sivak, Erica L; Lockman, Justin L",Paediatr. anaesth,,316

401288,Management of gastrointestinal tuberculosis during COVID pandemic: Lessons for posterity,2020,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases worldwide; its global burden has increased rapidly over the past decade, enough to be considered a public health emergency in many countries. Diabetic foot disease and, particularly diabetic foot ulceration, is the major complication of DM: through a skin damage of the foot, with a loss of epithelial tissue, it can deepen to muscles and bones and lead to the amputation of the lower limbs. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with diabetes, manifests like a diffuse macroangiopathic multi-segmental involvement of the lower limb vessels, also connected to a damage of collateral circulation; it may also display characteristic microaneurysms and tortuosity in distal arteries. As validation method, Bold-MRI is used. The diabetic foot should be handled with a multidisciplinary team approach, as its management requires systemic and localized treatments, pain control, monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. CBCT is an emerging medical imaging technique with the original feature of divergent radiation, forming a cone, in contrast with the spiral slicing of conventional CT, and has become increasingly important in treatment planning and diagnosis: from small anatomical areas, such as implantology, to the world of interventional radiology, with a wide range of applications: as guidance for biopsies or ablation treatments. The aim of this project is to evaluate the usefulness of perfusion CBCT imaging, obtained during endovascular revascularization, for intraprocedural evaluation of endovascular treatment in patients with diabetic foot.","Gurgitano, Martina; Signorelli, Giulia; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; Liguori, Alessandro; Pandolfi, Marco; Granata, Giuseppe; Arrichiello, Antonio; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta Biomed,,316

METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 64 patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 were retrospectively selected and divided into a stable group and a progressive group according to the data obtained from the ongoing treatment process. Imaging features from whole-lung images from baseline computed tomography (CT) scans were extracted and dimensionality reduction was performed. Support vector machines were used to construct radiomics signatures and to compare differences between the 2 groups. We also compared the differences of signature scores in the clinical, laboratory, and CT image feature subgroups and finally analyzed the correlation between the radiomics features of the constructed signature and the other features including clinical, laboratory, and CT imaging features. RESULTS: The signature has a good classification effect for the stable group and the progressive group, with area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.833, 80.95%, and 74.42%, respectively. Signature score differences in laboratory and CT imaging features between subgroups were not statistically significant (P>0.05); cough was negatively correlated with GLCM Entropy_angle 90_offset4 (r=-0.578), but was positively correlated with ShortRunEmphhasis_AllDirect_offset4_SD (r=0.454); C-reactive protein was positively correlated with Cluster Prominence_ AllDirect_offset 4_ SD (r=0.47). CONCLUSION: The radiomics signature of the whole lung based on machine learning may reveal the changes of lung microstructure in the early stage and help to indicate the progression of the disease.","Fu, Liping; Li, Yongchou; Cheng, Aiping; Pang, PeiPei; Shu, Zhenyu",J. thorac imaging,,316
402286,Successful treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia with cerebral sinus venous thrombosis following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination,2021,"The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

PURPOSE: This study examined 159 counties within Georgia to identify community characteristics associated with county-level COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates. METHODS: Data from the 2020 County Health Rankings, the 2010 US Census, and the Georgia Department of Public Health COVID-19 Daily Status Report were linked using county Federal Information Processing Standard codes and evaluated through multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: The percentages of children in poverty, severe housing problems, and people not proficient in the English language were significant predictors associated with increases in case, hospitalization, and death rates. Diabetic prevalence was significantly associated with increases in the hospitalization and death rates; in contrast, the percentages of people with excessive drinking and female were inversely associated with hospitalization and death rates. Other independent variables showing an association with death rate included the percentages of people reporting fair or poor health and American Indian/Alaska Native. IMPLICATION: Local authorities' proper allocation of resources and plans to address community social determinants of health are essential to mitigate disease transmission and reduce hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19, especially among vulnerable groups.","Nguyen, Tran Ha; Shah, Gulzar H; Schwind, Jessica S; Richmond, Holly L",J Public Health Manag Pract,,316
403926,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, antimalarial, age and gender relation to COVID-19 spread and mortality",2020,"At the end of January 2020, a novel betacoronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, progressively spread in Italy. Patients with cancer are considered more prone to infections because of the immunosuppressive status due to both malignancy and anticancer treatments. From the first Italian government restrictions (23rd February), Modena Cancer Center adopted practical health vigilance recommendations to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus without overlooking cancer management. From 23rd February to 31st March 2020, 1257 patients on active anticancer treatment for oncological or haematological malignancies attended our institution. All the staff activities were rescheduled following our practical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guideline. During this period, we have tallied 9 cases of COVID-19 infection (0.71%) in patients with cancer and 3 cases (1.66%) in health workers. The mortality rate of our patients with cancer was 22%, consistent with the data reported in the literature. In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection. The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.","Omarini, Claudia; Maur, Michela; Luppi, Gabriele; Narni, Franco; Luppi, Mario; Dominici, Massimo; Longo, Giuseppe; Piacentini, Federico",Eur J Cancer,,316

As of September 2020, infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world, affected more than 31.5 million people, and caused more than 970,000 deaths worldwide. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that mainly targets the lungs, it is currently well established that it is a multifactorial disease that affects other extra-pulmonary systems and strongly associated with a detrimental inflammatory response. Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 causes perturbation in the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathways; this disruption could lead to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA including mid-chain HETEs and terminal HETE (20-HETE) and the anti-inflammatory metabolites such as EETs and subterminal HETEs. Therefore, we propose novel therapeutic strategies to modulate the level of endogenous anti-inflammatory metabolites of AA and induce the patient's endogenous resolution mechanisms that will ameliorate the virus-associated systemic inflammation and enhance the primary outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Also, we propose that using nanoencapsulation of AA and its associated metabolites will contribute to the development of safer and more efficacious treatments for the management of COVID-19.","Shoieb, Sherif M; El-Ghiaty, Mahmoud A; El-Kadi, Ayman O S",Emergent Mater,,316
404923,Liver injury during highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), a novel coronavirus, originated as an epidemic respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 eventually spread to almost all countries and has now been declared a global pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation. A plethora of research has explored the dynamics of different clinical entities related to SARS-COV-2, in particular, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. A large scale of patients have been reported to have developed pulmonary embolism without any other standard triggers or risk factors, leading to speculation that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism. In addition to the development of thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism, COVID-19 has also been reported to have triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); however, it is unclear whether pulmonary embolism was due to COVID-19-induced thrombosis or a result of coagulopathy secondary to DIC. We describe a unique case of a COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in a patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism along with an overt DIC. Following diagnosis, the challenge was to identify the appropriate treatment modality for this unique situation. The patient was treated with anticoagulants and steroids along with blood products. The patient's condition markedly improved and was clinically stable on discharge.","Siddiqui, Saquib Navid; Jayasekhar, Roland; Tshering, Sonam; Jugjali, Ranjana; Shanmugavadivel, Devipangaj; Jawed, Asheer; Rahman, Mohammed Mostafizur",Int J Infect Dis,,316

This prospective cross-sectional study explored the inflammatory profiles and clinical recovery of COVID-19 patients at 3 months post-discharge. METHODS: COVID-19 patients discharged from four hospitals in Wuhan, recovered asymptomatic patients (APs) from an isolation hotel, and uninfected healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Viral nucleic acid and antibody detection, laboratory examination, computed tomography, pulmonary function assessment, multiplex cytokine assay, and flow cytometry were performed. RESULTS: The 72 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched participants included 19 severe/critical patients (SPs), 20 mild/moderate patients (MPs), 16 APs, and 17 HCs. At 3 months after discharge, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors related to vascular injury/repair in recovered COVID-19 patients had not returned to those of the HCs, especially among recovered SPs compared to recovered MPs and APs. These cytokines were significantly correlated with impaired pulmonary function and chest CT abnormalities. However, levels of immune cells had returned to nearly normal levels and were not significantly correlated with abnormal clinical features. CONCLUSION: Vascular injury, inflammation, and chemotaxis persisted in COVID-19 patients and were correlated with abnormal clinical features 3 months after discharge, especially in recovered SPs.","Zhou, Mei; Yin, Zhengrong; Xu, Juanjuan; Wang, Sufei; Liao, Tingting; Wang, Kai; Li, Yumei; Yang, Fan; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Guanghai; Zhang, Jianchu; Yang, Jin",J. infect. dis,,316

410999,Models of Integration of Specialized Palliative Care with Oncology,2021,"BACKGROUND: Interprofessional primary care (IPC) teams provide comprehensive and coordinated care and are ideally equipped to support those populations most at risk of adverse health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, including older adults, and patients with chronic physical and mental health conditions. There has been little focus on the experiences of healthcare teams and no studies have examined IPC practice during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the study was to describe the state of interprofessional health provider practice within IPC teams during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Observational cross-sectional design. A web-based survey was deployed to IPC providers working in team-based primary care clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada. The survey included 26 close-ended and six open-ended questions. Close-ended questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Content analysis was used to analyze the open-ended questions. RESULTS: 445 surveys were included in the final analysis. Service delivery shifted from in-person care (77% pre-COVID-19) to telephone (76.5% during the COVID-19 pandemic). Less than half of the respondents (40%) reported receiving any training for virtual delivery. Wait times to access team members were reported to have decreased. There has also been a shift in what IPC providers report as the most commonly seen conditions, with increases in visits related to mental health concerns, acute infections (including COVID-19), social isolation, and resource navigation. Respondents also reported a reduction in healthcare provision for multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: IPC teams are rapidly shifting their practice to supporting their patients during the pandemic. A surge in mental health issues has been seen and is expected to continue to increase in response to COVID-19. Understanding early experiences can help plan for future pandemic waves.","Donnelly, Catherine; Ashcroft, Rachelle; Bobbette, Nicole; Mills, Christine; Mofina, Amanda; Tran, Todd; Vader, Kyle; Williams, Ashley; Gill, Sandeep; Miller, Jordan",BMC Fam Pract,,316

Concerns from 1491 informants were analyzed, 34% of women and 30% of men (p = 0.05) provided concerns. Respondents with higher educational level reported concerns more often (86% vs. 83%, p = 0.022). The qualitative analysis revealed five themes-society, health, social activities, personal economy and duration-and 13 sub-themes, mostly related to the themes ""society"" and ""health"" (724 and 704, respectively). Empathy for others was prominent, for society (nationally and globally), but also concerns related to infecting others and family members at risk for developing serious illness if infected. The responses to the open-ended question yielded additional information, beyond the information obtained from questions with pre-categorized response options, especially related to concerns about society and health. Themes arising from the qualitative analysis shed light on what are important concerns for people during the pandemic and this may serve as targeted measures for the authorities.","Skogstad, L.; Schou-Bredal, I.; Bonsaksen, T.; Heir, T.; Ekeberg, O.; Grimholt, T.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,316
414471,Dynamics of CD4 T Cell and Antibody Responses in COVID-19 Patients With Different Disease Severity,2020,"This study examined the association between dynamic angiopoietin-2 assessment and COVID-19 short- and long-term clinical course. We included consecutive hospitalized patients from 1 February to 31 May 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 Italian tertiary referral centers (derivation cohort, n = 187 patients; validation cohort, n = 62 patients). Serum biomarker levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissue from 9 patients was stained for angiopoietin-2, Tie2, CD68, and CD34. Cox model was used to identify risk factors for mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess the accuracy of 3- and 10-day angiopoietin-2 for in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition, respectively. Three-day angiopoietin-2 increase of at least twofold from baseline was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-24.19; P = .004) with AUROC = 0.845 (95% CI, 0.725-0.940). Ten-day angiopoietin-2 of at least twofold from baseline was instead significantly associated with nonresolving pulmonary condition by multivariate analysis (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.34-11.77; P &#8804; .0001) with AUROC = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.919-1.000). Patients with persistent elevation of 10-day angiopoietin-2 levels showed severe reticular interstitial thickening and fibrous changes on follow-up computed tomography scans. Angiopoietin-2 and Tie2 were diffusely colocalized in small-vessel endothelia and alveolar new vessels and macrophages. Angiopoietin-2 course is strongly associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Angiopoietin-2 may be an early and useful predictor of COVID-19 clinical course, and it could be a relevant part of disease pathogenesis. Angiopoietin-2 blockade may be a COVID-19 treatment option.","Villa, Erica; Critelli, Rosina; Lasagni, Simone; Melegari, Alessandra; Curatolo, Angela; Celsa, Ciro; Romagnoli, Dante; Melegari, Gabriele; Pivetti, Alessandra; Di Marco, Lorenza; Casari, Federico; Arioli, Dimitriy; Turrini, Fabrizio; Zuccaro, Valentina; Cassaniti, Irene; Riefolo, Mattia; de Santis, Elena; Bernabucci, Veronica; Bianchini, Marcello; Lei, Barbara; De Maria, Nicola; Carulli, Lucia; Schepis, Filippo; Gozzi, Chiara; Malaguti, Silvio; Del Buono, Mariagrazia; Brugioni, Lucio; Torricelli, Pietro; Trenti, Tommaso; Pinelli, Giovanni; Bertellini, Elisabetta; Bruno, Raffaele; Cammà, Calogero; d039,; Errico, Antonia",Blood Adv,,316

In this study, we interrogated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the country by deploying a nationwide open-access online survey, two months before the rollout of the national vaccination program. The Health Belief Model (HBM) posits that people are likely to adopt disease prevention behaviors and to accept medical interventions like vaccines if there is sufficient motivation and cues to action. A majority of our 7,193 respondents (62.5%) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Moreover, multivariable analysis revealed that HBM constructs were associated with vaccination intention in the Philippines. Perceptions of high susceptibility, high severity, and significant benefits were all good predictors for vaccination intent. We also found that external cues to action were important. Large majorities of our respondents would only receive the COVID-19 vaccines after many others had received it (72.8%) or after politicians had received it (68.2%).

We aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 on respondents with self-reported IBS. METHODS: We conducted an anonymized survey from May to June 2020 in 33 countries. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on personal hygiene and social distancing as well as psychological impact of COVID-19 were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences in well-being and compliance to social distancing measures between respondents with and without self-reported IBS. Factors associated with improvement or worsening of IBS symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 2704 respondents, 2024 (74.9%) did not have IBS, 305 (11.3%) had self-reported IBS, and 374 (13.8%) did not know what IBS was. Self-reported IBS respondents reported significantly worse emotional, social, and psychological well-being compared with non-IBS respondents and were less compliant to social distancing measures (28.2% vs 35.3%, P = 0.029); 61.6% reported no change, 26.6% reported improvement, and 11.8% reported worsening IBS symptoms. Higher proportion of respondents with no change in IBS symptoms were willing to practice social distancing indefinitely versus those who deteriorated (74.9% vs 51.4%, P = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, willingness to continue social distancing for another 2-3 weeks (vs longer period) was significantly associated with higher odds of worsening IBS. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that self-reported IBS respondents had worse well-being and compliance to social distancing measures than non-IBS respondents. Future research will focus on occupational stress and dietary changes during COVID-19 that may influence IBS.","Quek, Sabrina Xin Zi; Loo, Evelyn Xiu Ling; Demutska, Alla; Chua, Chun En; Kew, Guan Sen; Wong, Scott; Lau, Hui Xing; Low, En Xian Sarah; Loh, Tze Liang; Lung, Ooi Shien; Hung, Emily C W; Rahman, M Masudur; Ghoshal, Uday C; Wong, Sunny H; Cheung, Cynthia K Y; Syam, Ari F; Tan, Niandi; Xiao, Yinglian; Liu, Jin-Song; Lu, Fang; Chen, Chien-Lin; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Maralit, Ruter M; Kim, Yong-Sung; Oshima, Tadayuki; Miwa, Hiroto; Pang, Junxiong; Siah, Kewin Tien Ho",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,316

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and three adults (106 men and 97 women), aged 18 to 59 years, participated in the study. Participants filled the questionnaires 1-2 weeks after the start of the lockdown and 3-4 weeks after the first measurement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Complaints of sleep and daytime functioning difficulties during the period of self-isolation are common in 19-30% and depend not so much on the level and content of anxiety, but on its dysfunctional level that interferes with everyday activities (ß=0.17-0.27, p<0.05, &#916;R2=2.8-7.4%). Complaints of sleep are more often comorbid with complaints of pain (r=0.43) than with complaints of affective symptoms (r=0.33), and complaints of poor daytime functioning are more common among younger people and students (F=3.48, p<0.05, Î·2=0.05); 14.8-24.6% report improvement in sleep and daytime functioning during lockdown. Regardless of the presence of anxiety, more frequent monitoring of information about the coronavirus is associated with complaints of sleep (ß=0.15, p<0.05, &#916;R2=2.0%), while general negative emotions- with complaints of daytime functioning and affective symptoms (ß=0.19-0.22, p<0.01, &#916;R2=3.4-4.1%).

Advanced age and a number of chronic diseases have been investigated as risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Likewise, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been proposed as a potential risk factor for COVID-19, however, the possible relationship between HIV and COVID-19 has remained difficult to fully elucidate due to a paucity of data. We describe a case series of 11 patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION Between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020, 11 patients with HIV were admitted for COVID-19at an underserved community hospital in Brooklyn, NY. . Patients ranged from 39 to 78 years of age. Seven patients were men and four patients were women. Seven patients were African American and four patients were Hispanic. All 11 patients possessed HIV RNA viral loads less than 40 copies/ml. The mean CD4 count was 556 cells/ml (range 171-1123 cells/ml). Nine patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation;five of the six patients died. Two of these five patients were not on ART, prior to admission and two of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome during their hospital course. The mean length of stay was 10.9 days (range 2-21 days). Three of the six survivors were readmitted within 30 days for CHF exacerbation, bacterial pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. All three patients recovered without complications. At six-month follow-up, no mortalities were reported among the six surviving patients. DISCUSSION This case series presents a unique sample of African American and Hispanic patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. This is the first case series to report long term outcomes among minority population. The high mortality rate in this case series (45%) is also notable in comparison to prior research. This elevated mortality rate may reflect an increased burden of comorbidities in HIV patients. Further research is required to reveal if ART therapy reduces risk of poor outcomes, and if so, which regimen may confer protection against COVID-19.","Kirupakaran, J.; Valentine, D.; Idowu, A.

In order to improve the efficiency and performance of E-business structure, a web server log must be well utilized to have the ability to trace and record infinite user transactions. This paper proposes an event stream mechanism based on formula patterns to enhance business processes and record all user activities in a structured log file. Each user activity is recorded with a set of tracing parameters that can predict the behavior of the user in business operations. The experimental results are conducted by applying clustering-based classification algorithms on two different datasets;namely, Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention and Instacart Market Basket Analysis. The clustering process is used to group related objects into the same cluster, then the classification process measures the predicted classes of clustered objects.

We performed a retrospective review of 23 patients with intractable haematospermia who were diagnosed with seminal vesicle haematocele and/or calculi by transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TSV). Patients' demographics, disease durations, operative times, and MRI and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) results were recorded. McNemar's test was used to compare the positive diagnostic rates of MRI and TRUS. All patients had undergone preoperative seminal vesicle MRI and TRUS to identify the aetiology of the haematospermia. The average age and disease duration were 39.3 years and 24.1 months, respectively. The mean operative time was 81.1 min. The positive result rates for MRI and TRUS were 95.7% (22/23) and 39.1% (9/23), respectively. Compared with TRUS, MRI had a significantly higher preoperative positive diagnostic rate (p < 0.01). These results suggest that MRI should be considered as a method for diagnosing intractable haematospermia in patients when TRUS findings are negative or inconclusive.","Han, Hu; Lei, Hong-En; Zhang, Xiao-Dong; Tian, Long",Andrologia,,316

However, there are few reports about the clinical follow-up of discharged patients.Objectives: To describe the follow-up of patients with COVID-19 in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang, China.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 4-week follow-ups in patients with COVID-19, including computed tomographic (CT) chest scanning, blood testing, and oropharyngeal-swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid. The chest CT scans and blood tests were performed on the last day before discharge and 2 weeks and 4 weeks after discharge. The oropharyngeal-swab tests were performed at both 1 week and 2 weeks after discharge. Fifty-one patients with common COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. All the CT and clinical data were collected between January 23 and March 28, 2020.Results: Compared with the abnormalities found on the the last CT scans before discharge, the abnormalities in the lungs at the first and second follow-ups after discharge had been gradually absorbed. The cases with focal ground-glass opacity were reduced from 17.7% to 9.8% of cases. The cases with multiple ground-glass opacities decreased from 80.4% to 23.5%. The cases with consolidation were reduced from 49.0% to 2.0%. The cases with interlobular septal thickening were reduced from 80.4% to 35.3%. The cases with subpleural lines were reduced from 29.4% to 7.8%. The cases with irregular lines were reduced from 41.2% to 15.7%. The lung lesions of 25.5% patients were shown to be fully absorbed on the first CT scans after discharge, and the rate of lung recovery increased to 64.7% after the second follow-up. Nucleic-acid test results became recurrently positive in 17.6% of discharged patients, of whom only 33.3% complained of clinical symptoms. There were no differences in the characteristics of the last CT scans before discharge between the patients with recurrently positive test results and the patients with negative test results. The lung damage was fully absorbed in 55.6% of discharged patients with recurrence of positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid.Conclusions: The lung damage due to COVID-19 could be reversible for patients with common COVID-19. A few cases showed recurring positive results of nucleic-acid tests after discharge.","Liu, Chenbin; Ye, Ling; Xia, Ruike; Zheng, Xudong; Yuan, Cuiyun; Wang, Zhenguo; Lin, Ruiwu; Shi, Deen; Gao, Yuantong; Yao, Junpu; Sun, Qingfeng; Wang, Xiaoyang; Jin, Meiling",Ann Am Thorac Soc,,316

METHODS: Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. RESULTS: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (&#961; = -0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype. CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types.","Zhang, Xiaoli; Cai, Huan; Hu, Jianhua; Lian, Jiangshan; Gu, Jueqing; Zhang, Shanyan; Ye, Chanyuan; Lu, Yingfeng; Jin, Ciliang; Yu, Guodong; Jia, Hongyu; Zhang, Yimin; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Yida",Int J Infect Dis,,316

However, there are discrepancies in existing guidelines and a lack of consensus among ophthalmic communities. This review aims to identify general consensus and provides recommendation of PPE for most common ophthalmological scenarios. With a global shortage of PPE, extended use and reuse strategies are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, guidelines and resources were selected, based on a three-tier process. The first-tier resources were from international infection control organizations. The second-tier resources were from ophthalmological professional associations and colleges. The third-tier resources involved a PubMed search using the keywords 'COVID-19; coronavirus; personal protective equipment' performed on 1 May 2020. Non-English guidelines and literatures were excluded. SUMMARY: On the basis of our methodology, we included a total of 30 documents, including 5 resources from tier 1, 14 resources from tier 2 and 15 from tier 3. Different levels of protection are necessary. Whenever performing an aerosol generating procedure, maximum protection should be ensured, this includes FFP3 respirator, fluid resistant gown, goggles or face-shield and disposable gloves. Similar protection should be used for handling COVID-19-positive/suspected case but the use of FFP2 respirator is acceptable. During routine outpatient clinic in cases of negative triage, it is recommended to use ASTM III surgical mask, plastic apron, disposable gloves and eye protection with goggles or face-shield. Lastly, patients should be encouraged to wear surgical masks whenever possible.","Tang, Samuela W K; Romano, Mario Rosario; Wong, Daniel H T; Montericcio, Alessio; Yip, Nelson K F; Montalbano, Clara; Raimondi, Raffaele; Li, Kenneth K W",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,,316
434484,Pathogenic gene expression of epicardial adipose tissue in patients with coronary artery disease,2020,"PURPOSE: Transesophageal echocardiography is an aerosol-generating procedure, and exercise stress testing is a potentially aerosol-generating activity. Concern has been raised about heightened risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among health care personnel participating in these procedures. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of past coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in echocardiography and stress laboratory staff. METHODS: All staff who worked in the echocardiography and stress laboratories of one high-traffic urban hospital from March 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, were asked to voluntarily participate. Those willing to participate were consented, and past COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test (ARCHITECT, Abbott Laboratories) from June 15, 2020, to July 3, 2020. Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record, and self-reported symptoms were documented with a participant survey. RESULTS: A total of 43 staff members (86.0% of 50 total laboratory staff) participated. A majority of participants were less than 40 years old (69.8%), were White (86.0%), and were women (79.1%);mean body mass index was 24.9 ± 4.7 kg/m(2). Of the 43 staff members tested for past COVID-19 infection, 3 (7.0%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody result. There were no unique features in the 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects;of these, 2 had known prior COVID-19 infection and 1 was asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides clinical data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in echocardiography and stress laboratory staff who regularly participate in a variety of procedures that are or may be aerosol-generating.","Jain, R.; Kroboth, S.; Ignatowski, D.; Khandheria, B.

The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications.

DESIGN: An observational descriptive study which included hospitalised suspected, or probable cases of hopitalised COVID-19 patients, conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Ciputra Hospital, Mitra Keluarga Depok Hospital and Mitra Keluarga Kelapa Gading Hospital, Indonesia. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were obtained. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. RESULTS: We analysed 136 subjects as part of this study. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 manifesation in this study was typical of hospitalised patients, with 25% classified as mild cases, 14.7% in severe condition and 12.5% of subjects classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome. When compared with nasopharyngeal swab as the standard specimen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the sensitivity and specificity of the anal swab was 36.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 97.8% and 16.5 %, respectively. The performance of the anal swab remained similar when only the subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (n=92, 67.6%) was analysed (sensitivity 40% and specificity 91.7%). Out of all the subjects included in analysis, 67.6% had gastrointestinal symptoms. Similarly, 73.3% of patients in the anal swab-positive group had gastrointestinal symptoms. The two most common gastrointestinal symptoms in the subjects' population were nausea and anorexia. CONCLUSION: Anal swab specimen has low sensitivity (36.7%) but high specificity (93.8%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR. Only one additional positive result was found by anal swab among the nasopharyngeal swab-negative group. Anal swab may not be needed as an additional test at the beginning of a patient's diagnostic investigation and nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR remains as the standard diagnostic test for COVID-19.","Abdullah, Murdani; Sudrajat, Dedy Gunawanjati; Muzellina, Virly Nanda; Kurniawan, Juferdy; Rizka, Aulia; Utari, Amanda Pitarini; Pribadi, Rabbinu Rangga; Idrus, Muhammad Firhat; Yusra, Yusra; Meilany, Sofy; Surandy, Andry; Shatri, Hamzah; Rinaldi, Ikhwan; Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono; Renaldi, Kaka",,,316

441370,The impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on newly acute myeloid leukemia patients: Single-centre comparative study between 2019 and 2020 cohorts in Madrid,2021,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with or develop cerebrovascular disease during the course of hospitalization. Whereas ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients has been well described, data on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and August 14, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify eligible studies. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies describing ICH in 148 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-0.9), with low levels of inter-study heterogeneity observed (I2 = 33.6%, Cochran's Q = 12.05, p = 0.149). Most of the patients were elderly male patients (65.8%) with comorbidities, the most common being systemic hypertension (54%). Hemorrhage involving multiple cranial compartments was reported in 9.5% of cases. Single compartments were involved in the rest, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) being the most common variety (62.6%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) the least common (1.4%). Half of these patients were on some form of anticoagulation. Overall, the mortality rate in the COVID-19 patients with ICH was about 48.6%. CONCLUSION: Although relatively uncommon among COVID-19 patients, ICH is associated with a high mortality rate. Early identification of patients at risk of developing ICH, particularly with comorbid conditions and on anticoagulant therapy, may be important to improve outcomes.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Sehmi, Prabjot; Ominde, Beryl; Bundi, Paul; Mislani, Musa; Ngure, Brian; Olabu, Beda; Ogeng039,; o, Julius A",Neurol. sci,,316

This study aims to investigate the effect of prolonged use of NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on IOP. Since SNP has a short biological half-life, a nanoparticle drug delivery system (mesoporous silica nanoparticles) has been used to deliver SNP to the target tissues (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal). We find that the sustained use of NO donor initially reduced IOP followed, surprisingly, by IOP elevation, which could not recover by drug withdraw but could be reversed by the antioxidant MnTMPyP application. The IOP elevation and normalization coincide with increased and reduced protein nitration in the mouse conventional outflow tissue. These findings suggest that the prolonged use of NO donor SNP may be problematic as it can cause outflow tissue damage by protein nitration. MnTMPyP is protective of the nitrative damage which could be considered to be co-applied with NO donors.","Hu, Chunchun; Zhang, Yu; Song, Maomao; Deng, Yonghui; Sun, Xinghuai; Lei, Yuan",Exp Eye Res,,316
442874,Postinfectious Interstitial Pneumonia After COVID-19 Infection,2021,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. A deep learning-based CT diagnosis system was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the healthy with an AUC of 0.99, recall (sensitivity) of 0.93, and precision of 0.96. When integrating three types of CT images, our model achieved a recall of 0.93 with precision of 0.86 for discriminating COVID-19 patients from others. Moreover, our model could extract main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is visually helpful for assisted diagnoses by doctors.

Despite telehealth's existence, there was no prior need to fully realize its potential. Recently, technological innovations in orthopaedic surgery have assisted in making this modality more useful. However, it is important to continually educate the medical community regarding these technologies and their interplay to improve patient care. Therefore, our purpose is to provide information on telehealth by assessing: (1) steps the hospital/system are taking to reduce COVID-19 exposure for teams and patients;(2) new technologies allowing for the optimization of patient safety;and (3) use of telehealth for postoperative follow up. We will demonstrate that telehealth and its associated strategies can be used effectively to decrease COVID-19 exposure risks for both medical staff and patients during these rapidly changing and uncertain times.","Chen, Z.; Tarazi, J.

However, little is known about the physiological responses of this species to environmental extremes under field conditions. This study aimed to establish the efficacy of surgically implanted thermal radio transmitters and data loggers to measure the body temperature of free-ranging koalas across a range of environmental conditions and ambient temperatures. Five free-ranging koalas in southeast Queensland were implanted with thermal transmitters and data loggers waxed together as a single package. Body temperatures were recorded for variable periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. Diurnal rhythms in body temperature were detected irrespective of season. The long-term diurnal body temperature peak for all koalas occurred between 16:00 and 17:00 h and body temperature was 36.7-36.9 °C, the long-term nadir occurred between 07:00 and 08:00 h and body temperature was 35.4-35.7 °C. Koala body temperatures as low as 34.2 °C and as high as 39.0 °C were recorded. Thermolability became apparent when ambient temperatures were outside the deduced thermal neutral zone for koalas (14.5-24.5 °C): heat was accumulated during the day and dissipated during the cool of the night. While this study is the first to report on body temperature of free-ranging koalas in their normal behavioural context, further investigations are necessary to determine the physiological boundaries of the thermal niche for this species, in order to better equip models that will more accurately predict the impacts of climate change on koalas.","Adam, D; Johnston, S D; Beard, L; Nicolson, V; Gaughan, J B; Lisle, A T; FitzGibbon, S; Barth, B J; Gillett, A; Grigg, G; Ellis, W",Int. j. biometeorol,,316

METHODS: A retrospective single-center study was conducted on consecutive patients aged &#8805;65 years who developed severe COVID-19 between 03 March and 01 May 2020 and were treated with corticosteroids at various doses (methylprednisolone 0.5mg/kg/12h to 250mg/24h), either alone (CS group) or associated with intravenous tocilizumab (400-600mg, one to three doses) (CS-TCZ group). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality by day +14, whereas secondary outcomes included mortality by day +28 and clinical improvement (discharge and/or a &#8805;2 point decrease on a 6-point ordinal scale) by day +14. Propensity score (PS)-based adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were applied. RESULTS: Totals of 181 and 80 patients were included in the CS and CS-TCZ groups, respectively. All-cause 14-day mortality was lower in the CS-TCZ group, both in the PS-adjusted (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.68; P=0.002) and IPTW-weighted models (odds ratio [OR]: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21-0.68; P=0.001). This protective effect was also observed for 28-day mortality (PS-adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21-0.72; P=0.003). Clinical improvement by day +14 was higher in the CS-TCZ group with IPTW analysis only (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.49-3.41; P<0.001). The occurrence of secondary infection was similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of corticosteroids and TCZ was associated with better outcomes among patients aged &#8805;65 years with severe COVID-19.","López-Medrano, Francisco; Pérez-Jacoiste Asín, María Asunción; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Carretero, Octavio; Lalueza, Antonio; Maestro de la Calle, Guillermo; Caro, José Manuel; de la Calle, Cristina; Catalán, Mercedes; García-García, Rocío; Martínez-López, Joaquín; Origüen, Julia; Ripoll, Mar; San Juan, Rafael; Trujillo, Hernando; Sevillano, Ángel; Gutiérrez, Eduardo; de Miguel, Borja; Aguilar, Fernando; Gómez, Carlos; Silva, José Tiago; García-Ruiz de Morales, Daniel; Saro-Buendía, Miguel; Marrero-Sánchez, Ángel; Chiara-Graciani, Guillermo; Bueno, Héctor; Paz-Artal, Estela; Lumbreras, Carlos; Pablos, José L; Aguado, José María",Int J Infect Dis,,316
453112,Analytical Sensitivity of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag CARD,2020,"Alterations in the functional organization of motor cortex and interictal motor deficits are observed in people with epilepsy. While seizures in the rat lead to more cortical area devoted to simple cortical forelimb movement representations (motor maps) assessed using short-duration intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), the effect of seizures on complex movements derived with long-duration ICMS is unknown. Further, the relationship between motor map expression and motor impairment is not well understood. We used long-duration ICMS in the rat to test the hypothesis that repeated seizure activity (cortical kindling) increases the extent of overlapping cortical representation where multiple forelimb movements are evoked to stimulation. Cortical kindling (n = 7) significantly expanded (100%) forelimb motor maps characterized by a proportional increase in both complex and simple movement representation areas, and significantly increased (285%) overlapping forelimb representation compared to sham-kindled controls (n = 5). In a second experiment, motor maps were derived with long-duration ICMS under acute cortical application of bicuculline (n = 6) to reduce intracortical inhibition or saline control (n = 10). Bicuculline also significantly expanded forelimb motor maps (108%) but without increasing representational overlap. Moreover, expanded map areas in bicuculline rats evoked qualitatively distinct forelimb movements to long-duration, but not short-duration (n = 5), ICMS that were truncated. Our evidence indicates that motor map expansion following repeated experimental seizures is associated with reduced segregation between cortical movement representations that is not entirely due to reduced cortical inhibition but may contribute to interictal motor deficits in some individuals with epilepsy.","Brown, Andrew R; Coughlin, Gerard M; Teskey, G Campbell",Neuroscience,,316

On February 28, 2020, the World Health Organization adjusted the risk of spread and impact of COVID-19 to “very high” at the global level. Studies have mainly focused on the etiology, epidemiology, and treatment of COVID-19 to limit further spread and the negative impact of the disease, while less attention has been devoted to the follow-up and reexamination of patients who recovered from COVID-19 or were released from quarantine. CASE SUMMARY This study reports two cases where patients who had negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and met the criteria for discharge subsequently had positive RT-PCR test results. The clinical manifestations and computed tomography (CT) findings of these patients were examined. The conversion of RT-PCR test results in these two patients may be related to false-negative and false-positive outcomes of the test. CT images helped track improvement of pulmonary lesions. CONCLUSION The timing of discharge of COVID-19 patients should be determined by comprehensive analysis of CT images and RT-PCR test results. © The Author(s) 2021.

457013,Biosafety measures for preventing infection from COVID-19 in clinical laboratories: IFCC Taskforce Recommendations,2020,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the prevalence of acute stress disorder and subsequent effects on career planning among healthcare students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1158 healthcare students across five medical universities in February 2020. Acute stress disorder was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire. Further data regarding COVID-19 knowledge, individual behaviours, occupational choices, and career planning were collected. Based on the results of the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire, the students were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups for acute stress disorder. The correlation between acute stress disorder and the impact on career planning was analysed. The high-risk group comprised 143 (12.3%) participants, while 1015 (87.7%) participants were in the low-risk group. Two factors increased the risk of acute stress disorder in the students, including 'I think the pandemic is far away from me' (B: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.60-7.87) and 'Physical contact with confirmed or suspected cases' (B: 2.49, 95%CI: 3.42-42.44). Those who obtained pandemic information from official media sources indicated a lower risk of acute stress disorder (B: -0.24, 95%CI: 0.49-1.26). The high-risk group was more likely to quit the medical profession after graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause acute stress disorder among healthcare students and affect their career planning. Universities and relevant departments should provide more information and moral support for these students.","Zhang, Luping; Qi, Hongbo; Wang, Longqiong; Wang, Fulan; Huang, Jin; Li, Feifei; Zhang, Zhiwei",Int J Ment Health Nurs,,316

460259,COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance: Parallel and Interacting Health Emergencies,2020,"The lack of therapies for moderate COVID-19 syndrome prompted us to use a standardized polyphenolic green tea extract rich in catechins during the lockdown due to the pandemic in Italy (Autumn 2020). Catechins are powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents that are safe for human use. While awaiting hospitalization, 10 swab-positive patients, symptomatic for SARS-COV-2, were treated for 15 days at home with two sessions of inhalation plus three capsules per day (total catechins: 840 mg;total EGCG: 595 mg). All patients recovered fully and had no symptoms at a median of 9 days, with a range of 7–15 days. Seven switched to a negative SARS-COV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test at a median of 9 days, with a range of 6–13 days. Among the 3 patients still swab-positive, one had a strong decrease of infection down to a “very low” SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid load at 5 days. All patients exited quarantine at the end of therapy because they were free of symptoms. Inflammation markers α-1 anti-trypsin, C-reactive protein and eosinophils had significantly decreased. The IL-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased in 7 out of 10 patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the efficacy of green tea catechin against COVID-19 syndrome. These results may open new perspectives in the fight against the disease.","Bettuzzi, Saverio Gabba Luigi Cataldo Simona",COVID,,316
461894,Efficacy and safety of favipiravir in a complex therapy of mild to moderate COVID-19,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic is highly contagious and has spread rapidly across the globe. To date there have been no specific treatment options available for this life-threatening disease. During this medical emergency, target-based drug repositioning/repurposing with a continuous monitoring and recording of results is an effective method for the treatment and drug discovery. This review summarizes the recent findings on COVID-19, its genomic organization, molecular evolution through phylogenetic analysis and has recapitulated the drug targets by analyzing the viral molecular machinery as drug targets and repurposing of most frequently used drugs worldwide and their therapeutic applications in COVID-19. Data from solidarity trials have shown that the treatment with Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir had no effect in reducing the mortality rate and also had adverse side effects. Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Ribavirin might be a safer therapeutic option for COVID-19. Recent clinical trial has revealed that dexamethasone and convalescent plasma treatment can reduce mortality in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.","Raj, C T Dhanya; Kandaswamy, Dinesh Kumar; Danduga, Ravi Chandra Sekhara Reddy; Rajasabapathy, Raju; James, Rathinam Arthur",Arch. microbiol,,316

Methods like emotion analysis are now in the standard toolkit of computational social scientists but typically rely on third-person annotation with unknown validity. As an alternative, this paper introduces online emotion induction techniques from experimental behavioural research as a method for text-based emotion analysis. Text data were collected from participants who were randomly allocated to a happy, neutral or sad condition. The findings support the mood induction procedure. We then examined how well lexicon approaches can retrieve the induced emotion. All approaches resulted in statistical differences between the true emotion conditions. Overall, only up to one-third of the variance in emotion was captured by text-based measurements. Pretrained classifiers performed poorly on detecting true emotions. The paper concludes with limitations and suggestions for future research.","Kleinberg, Bennett",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08952v1.pdf,316
463096,Methotrexate and rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease,2020,"CONTEXT: People bereaved from COVID-19 report higher levels of grief than people bereaved from natural causes. The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high-quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. METHODS: A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. RESULTS: Most participants' scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. CONCLUSION: People bereaved because of COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress. Attention to identifying and treating functional impairment may be important in facilitating grieving persons' full participation in social and economic life during and after the pandemic.","Breen, Lauren J; Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",J. pain symptom manage,,316
463717,COVID-19 - a set of symptoms or a systemic pathology? Clinical lecture. Part 1. Details of multiple organ damage,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) received an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. CCP with a signal-to-cutoff ratio of &#8805;12 using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (OVSARS2IgG) is permitted to be labeled ""high titer"". Little is known about the relationship between OVSARS2IgG ratio and neutralizing capacity of plasma/sera against genuine SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: 981 samples from 196 repeat CCP donors 0-119 days post initial donation (DPID) were analyzed. Neutralizing capacity was assessed for 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) reduction of infectious virus using the gold standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subset of 91 donations were evaluated by OVSARS2IgG and compared to PRNT titers for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: 32.7%/79.5% (PRNT90/PRNT50) of donations met a 1:80 titer initially but only 14.0%/48.8% (PRNT90/PRNT50) met this cut-off &#8805;85 DPID. Correlation of OVSARS2IgG results to neutralizing capacity allowed extrapolation to CCP therapy results. CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios equivalent to a therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of &#8805;1:640 (PRNT50) and/or &#8805;1:80 (PRNT90). Specificity and positive predictive value of the OVSARS2IgG for qualifying highly neutralizing CCP was optimal using ratios significantly greater than the FDA cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: This information provides a basis for refining the recommended properties of CCP used to treat COVID-19.","Girardin, Roxie C; Dupuis, Alan P; Payne, Anne F; Sullivan, Timothy J; Strauss, Donna; Parker, Monica M; McDonough, Kathleen A",J. infect. dis,,316

464413,"A Fully Distributed, Privacy Respecting Approach for Back-tracking of Potentially Infectious Contacts",2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds are increasingly reported in critical ill patients with respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Typically, these critical illness-associated microbleeds involve the juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. Recently, this pattern was reported in patients with respiratory failure, suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we listed patients from March 11, 2020 to September 2, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, critical illness and cerebral microbleeds. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed databases on critical illness-associated microbleeds and cerebral microbleeds described in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On 279 COVID-19 admissions, two cases of cerebral microbleeds were detected in critical ill patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Based on review of existing literature critical illness-associated microbleeds tend to predominate in subcortical white matter and corpus callosum. Cerebral microbleeds in patients with COVID-19 tend to follow similar patterns as reported in critical illness-associated microbleeds. Hence, one patient with typical critical illness-associated microbleeds and COVID-19 is reported. However, a new pattern of widespread cortico-juxtacortical microbleeds, predominantly in the anterior vascular territory with relative sparing of deep gray matter, corpus callosum and infratentorial structures is documented in a second case. The possible etiologies of these microbleeds include hypoxia, hemorrhagic diathesis, brain endothelial erythrophagocytosis and/or cytokinopathies. An association with COVID-19 remains to be determined. CONCLUSION: Further systematic investigation of microbleed patterns in patients with neurological impairment and COVID-19 is necessary.","Toeback, Jonas; Depoortere, Sofie Dr; Vermassen, Joris; Vereecke, Elke Lh; Van Driessche, Veroniek; Hemelsoet, Dimitri M",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,316

Applying serology screening tests could enlighten the view with regards to disease prevalence in dialysis wards.Methods: We subjected 328 end-stage renal disease patients to maintenance hemodialysis. After dividing patients into suspicious and non-suspicious groups for COVID-19 infection based on their clinical manifestation, they were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG screening against nucleoprotein (NP), spike protein (SP), and receptor-binding domain (RBD), utilizing our recently developed ELISA tests.Results: We found that approximately 10.1% of asymptomatically tested cases were antibody positive. Although IgG positivity showed a higher prevalence than IgM across all three virus antigen subunits, there were no significant differences among mentioned immunoglobulins of the studied groups. The most prevalent antibody was from the IgG subtype against virus nucleoprotein (NP), while the lowest prevalence was attributed to receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgM.Conclusion: High seropositive rate among asymptomatic end-stage renal disease patients, as a sample of high-risk population, reflected the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody screening for disease containment.","Etemadi, Jalal; Bordbar, Shima; Soltani-Zangbar, Mohammad Sadegh; Hajivalili, Mahsa; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Motavalli, Roza; Mahmoodpoor, Ata; Shahmohammadi-Farid, Sima; Abedi Azar, Sima; Niknafs, Bahram; Roshangar, Leila; Babaloo, Zohreh; Ahmadian Heris, Javad; Hosseini, Maryam; Shareghi-Oskoue, Oldouz; Parhizkar, Forough; Khosroshahi, Hamid Tayebi; Yousefi, Mehdi",Immunol Invest,,316

468409,The renin-angiotensin system - a therapeutic target in COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in Western Europe. METHODS: Data (official statistics) on the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the start of the outbreak (before any confinement rules were declared) were retrieved in the 15 largest countries in Western Europe, allowing us to estimate the exponential growth rate of the disease. The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. RESULTS: Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.6). CONCLUSIONS: The value of R0 for COVID-19 in Western Europe appears to be significantly lower than that in China. The proportion of immune persons in the European population required to stop the outbreak could thus be closer to 50% than to 70%.","Locatelli, Isabella; Trächsel, Bastien; Rousson, Valentin",PLoS One,,316

Three human clinical trials with low risk of bias suggest that oral quercetin may have a beneficial effect on the incidence and duration of respiratory tract infections in certain populations; however, further research is needed. Verdict: Current evidence on the efficacy of quercetin supplementation in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 is insufficient for its clinical recommendation at this time. Quercetin exhibits both immunomodulatory and antimicrobial effects in preclinical studies; however, only three human clinical trials, each with a low risk of bias rating, were identified in this rapid review. One study reported a decrease in incidence of upper respiratory tract infections following a competitive athletic event.

The aim of this study is to achieve insight into coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents in the Netherlands, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the experienced quality of surgical training, and the influence on Burn-out and Work Engagement compared with the non-coronavirus disease 2019 period in January 2020. METHODS: In this study, we have conducted 2 digital surveys immediately before and 2 months after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We surveyed a validated Dutch questionnaire 'Utrecht Burn-out Scale,' derived from the Maslach Burn-out Inventory, and also collected the 'Utrecht Work Engagement Scale' measuring work engagement. Additionally, we describe the coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents, the impact on how they experienced the quality of their surgical training, and the influence on 'Burn-out and Work Engagement' compared with the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 period for surgical residents in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In January 2020, a total of 317 residents completed the online survey, and in April 2020, a total of 313 residents completed the online survey. Of the responders, 48.6%, in April, participated in coronavirus disease-care in both the coronavirus disease ward as well as the coronavirus disease intensive care unit. Residents experienced that the coronavirus disease 2019 influenced their surgical training in 85.2% of responders. In only 5% of the residents did the pandemic not affect the exposure to surgical training in the operating theater. More burn-out symptoms were noted amongst coronavirus disease ward deployed residents versus no coronavirus disease ward deployment, (16.0% vs 7.6%, P = .06). The Work-Engagement questionnaire showed a significantly lower work engagement score of 4.2 for residents who were deployed in a coronavirus disease-care intensive care unit versus a score of 4.6 for residents scheduled in a coronavirus disease ward (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant impact of the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Dutch surgical trainee program, with a major redistribution of residents with a decrease of surgical exposure and education. We emphasize the need for adequate guidance of all surgical residents and potentially lengthening the surgical training program.","Poelmann, Floris B; Koëter, Tijmen; Steinkamp, Pieter J; Vriens, Menno R; Verhoeven, Bas; Kruijff, Schelto",Surgery (St. Louis),,316

All routine, non-essential medical services and procedures were ramped down and workers deemed non-essential were directed to work remotely from home to reduce the number of people at hospital premises and preserve much needed personal protective equipment that were in short supply at the outset of the pandemic. The laboratories did not remain unscathed and were under immense pressure to maintain workplace safety while being operational and provide best patient care with limited resources.

474998,Comment on: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia onset in a 3-year-old child with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected people in many countries worldwide. Discovering an effective treatment for this disease, particularly in severe cases, has become the subject of intense scientific investigation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. Fifty-nine patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatments were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received IVIg (human)-four vials daily for 3 days (in addition to initial treatment), while the other group received a placebo. Patients' demographic, clinical, and select laboratory test results, as well as the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, were recorded. RESULTS: Among total study subjects, 30 patients received IVIg and 29 patients received a placebo. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between the two groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg group compared to the control group (6 [20.0%] vs. 14 [48.3%], respectively; P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that administration of IVIg did indeed have a significant impact on mortality rate (aOR = 0.003 [95% CI: 0.001-0.815]; P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the administration of IVIg in patients with severe COVID-19 infection who did not respond to initial treatment could improve their clinical outcome and significantly reduce mortality rate. Further multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are nonetheless required to confirm the appropriateness of this medication as a standard treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: A study protocol was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.IRCT.ir ), number IRCT20200501047259N1 .

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of CLD, the incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the outcomes of patients with and without underlying CLD/elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases from 1 December 2019 to 24 April 2020 was done. We included studies reporting underlying CLD or elevated liver chemistries and patient outcomes in COVID-19. RESULTS: 107 articles (n = 20 874 patients) were included for the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of underlying CLD was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) among the 15 407 COVID-19 patients. The pooled incidence of elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19 was 23.1% (19.3-27.3) at initial presentation. Additionally, 24.4% (13.5-40) developed elevated liver chemistries during the illness. The pooled incidence of drug-induced liver injury was 25.4% (14.2-41.4). The pooled prevalence of CLD among 1587 severely infected patients was 3.9% (3%-5.2%). The odds of developing severe COVID-19 in CLD patients was 0.81 (0.31-2.09; P = 0.67) compared to non-CLD patients. COVID-19 patients with elevated liver chemistries had increased risk of mortality (OR-3.46 [2.42-4.95, P < 0.001]) and severe disease (OR-2.87 [95% CI, 2.29-3.6, P < 0.001]) compared to patients without elevated liver chemistries. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated liver chemistries are common at presentation and during COVID-19. The severity of elevated liver chemistries correlates with the outcome of COVID-19. The presence of CLD does not alter the outcome of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to analyse the outcomes of compensated and decompensated liver disease.","Kulkarni, Anand V; Kumar, Pramod; Tevethia, Harsh Vardhan; Premkumar, Madhumita; Arab, Juan Pablo; Candia, Roberto; Talukdar, Rupjyoti; Sharma, Mithun; Qi, Xiaolong; Rao, Padaki Nagaraja; Reddy, Duvvuru Nageshwar",Aliment Pharmacol Ther,,316

Here we generated single-cell atlases of 24 lung, 16 kidney, 16 liver and 19 heart autopsy tissue samples and spatial atlases of 14 lung samples from donors who died of COVID-19. Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodelling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of fibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells, which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in heart tissue from donors with COVID-19, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 genome-wide association studies.

480260,COVID-19: Review and hematologic impact,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Huizhou City utilized its experience with the SARS and MERS breakouts to establish a reperfusion treatment program for AIS patients. METHOD: This is a retrospective study on 8 certified stroke hospitals in Huizhou City from January 2020 to May 2020. We analyzed the number of AIS patients with reperfusion therapy, stroke type (anterior/posterior circulation stroke), modes of transport to hospital, NIHSS score, onset to door time (ODT), door to needle time (DNT), and door to puncture time (DPT). The analysis was compared with baseline data from the same time period in 2019. RESULT: In 2020, the number of AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy decreased (315 vs. 377), NIHSS score increased [8 (4, 15) vs. 7 [ (1, 2)], P = 0.024], ODT increased [126 (67.5, 210.0) vs. 120.0 (64.0, 179.0), P = 0.032], and DNT decreased [40 (32.5, 55) vs. 48 (36, 59), P = 0.003]. DPT did not change. Seventy percent of AIS patients indicated self-visit as their main mode of transport to the hospital. In both periods, mild stroke patients were more likely to self-visit than utilize emergency systems [2019: 152 (57.6%) vs. 20 (45.6%), P = 0.034; 2020: 123 (56.9%) vs. 5 (14.7%), P < 0.001]. The NIHSS score for self-visiting patients was lower for patients who utilized the ambulance system in both years [self-visit: 6.00 (3.00, 12.00), ambulance: 14.00 (9.00, 19.00), P < 0.001]. The volume of reperfusion patients was lower in 2020; however, the decrease was only significant (P = 0.028) in February 2020. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the number of AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy significantly decreased when compared to the same period in 2019. The patients' condition increased severity, ODT increased, and the DNT decreased. DPT was not significant for self-visiting and ambulance patients. Moderate to severe stroke patients were more likely to utilize ambulance services.","Luo, Weiliang; Li, Jiming; Li, Zhuqin; Luo, Xuanwen; Chen, Minrui; Cai, Chunsheng",Neurol Sci,,316

480788,Trust in telemedicine from IBD outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Importance: The efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Objective: To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200â¯000 IU of vitamin D3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. Results: Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL). Median (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P = .59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P = .62). The difference between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P = .43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P = .30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P = .09). Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased after a single dose of vitamin D3 vs placebo (44.4 ng/mL vs 19.8 ng/mL; difference, 24.1 ng/mL [95% CI, 19.5-28.7]; P < .001). There were no adverse events, but an episode of vomiting was associated with the intervention.

481058,Adoption of Multi-society Guidelines Facilitates Value-Based Reduction in Screening and Surveillance Colonoscopy Volume During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The ""obesity paradox"" suggests that higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with better survival values in metastatic melanoma patients, especially those receiving targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Higher BMI is also associated with higher incidences of treatment-related adverse events. This study assesses whether body mass index is associated with survival outcomes and adverse events in metastatic melanoma patients with systemic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentric retrospective study, conducted from March 1, 2013 to April 29, 2019, enrolled adults with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma from the French multicentric prospective cohort-MelBase (NCT02828202). Patients with first-line chemotherapy and targeted and immune therapy were included. Underweight people and those with metastatic mucosal or ocular melanoma were excluded. Body mass index was categorized using the World Health Organization criteria. Co-primary outcomes included the association between body mass index and progression-free survival and overall survival, stratified by treatment type, sex and age. Secondary endpoints were the association of body mass index with overall response and treatment-related adverse events. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Totally, 1,214 patients were analyzed. Their median age was 66.0 years (range, 53-75). Male predominance was observed (n = 738 [61%]). Most patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (63%), followed by targeted therapy (32%), and had stage M1c disease (60.5%). Obese patients represented 22% of the cohort. The median follow-up duration was 13.5 months (range, 6.0-27.5). In the pooled analysis, no positive or negative association between body mass index and progression-free survival (p = 0.88)/overall survival (p = 0.25) was observed, regardless of treatment type, sex, and age. These results were nonsignificant in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The objective response rate, according to body mass index category, did not differ significantly regardless of age. Treatment-related adverse events were not associated with body mass index. CONCLUSION: The observed lack of an association between body mass index and survival demonstrates that body mass index is not a valuable marker of systemic treatment-related outcomes in metastatic melanoma. Future approaches might focus on the whole-body distribution.","Di Filippo, Y; Dalle, S; Mortier, L; Dereure, O; Dalac, S; Dutriaux, C; Leccia, M-T; Legoupil, D; Saiag, P; Brunet-Possenti, F; Arnnault, J-P; Maubec, E; Granel-Brocard, F; De Quatrebarbes, J; Aubin, F; Lesimple, T; Beylot-Barry, M; Stoebner, P-E; Dupuy, A; Stephan, A; Grob, J-J; Lefevre, W; Oriano, B; Allayous, C; Lebbé, C; Montaudié, H",Ann. oncol,,316

METHODS: A survey form was sent to 424 residents in the School of Stomatology, Wuhan University (WHUSS) in September 2020. The form included 23 questions on demographics, study situation of residents during the COVID-19 outbreak, effect of COVID-19 on graduates, and status of residents who returned to clinic training. RESULTS: A total of 361 (85%) survey forms were collected. Over 70% of respondents felt anxious during Wuhan lockdown. Most respondents continued studying (94%) mainly through free online resources (79%). The majority reported improvement in didactic knowledge (80%), but the respondents' perceptions of their clinical skills, especially those in Wuhan, did not change (41%) or worsened (40%) (p < 0.05). Most graduates (88%) reported having found jobs or continued study. Among the 209 responders who returned to clinical training, 52% felt no concern about COVID-19 infection, 89% thought they were equipped with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and 57% indicated that they received sufficient knowledge for preventing COVID-19 in clinic. Most respondents agreed that the way to gain the knowledge for preventing COVID-19 in clinic was training at dental school (93%). CONCLUSION: Although online study has been appreciated by residents, concern about clinical skill learning in the COVID-19 hardest-hit area has arisen. Most graduates felt that the impact of COVID-19 on their immediate postgraduation career was limited. Teaching about infection control in dental schools seemed effective to develop a positive attitude for residents after they returned to clinical training.","Zhao, Dan; Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tao; Du, Mingyu; Yang, Qian; Li, Zhiyong; Fouad, Ashraf F",J. dent. educ,,316

This study's aim was to assess the impact of a healthy retail intervention on fruits and vegetables (FV) sales, as well as total sales, in tribally owned convenience stores where grocery stores are scarce. METHOD: We analyzed weekly sales data over the first 6 months of a healthy retail intervention. We assessed the proportion of sales from two FV baskets. The FV basket included all fresh, canned, and dried FV sold at stores; while the fruits, vegetables, and salads (FVS) basket included all FV items as well as all salads sold. We compared mean weekly sales rates in intervention and control stores over the 6-month period using generalized estimating equations models to account for repeated measures. RESULTS: Mean weekly FV basket sales rates were higher in intervention stores than control stores in both Nations. Mean weekly FVS baskets sales were significantly higher in intervention stores than control stores in one Nation and were higher, but not statistically significant, in intervention stores in the other Nation. Total sales remained steady throughout the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The THRIVE (Tribal Health and Resilience in Vulnerable Environments) intervention increased FV sales without negatively affecting total sales. Policy and Practice Implications. Healthy retail interventions in tribal convenience stores, where many Native Americans living in rural areas shop due to scarcity of grocery stores, could improve diet-related disparities without reducing total sales.","Williams, Mary B; Wang, Wenyu; Taniguchi, Tori; Salvatore, Alicia L; Groover, William K; Wetherill, Mariana; Love, Charlotte; Cannady, Tamela; Grammar, Mandy; Standridge, Joy; Fox, Jill; Jernigan, Valarie Blue Bird",Health Promot Pract,,316
484871,The assessment of serum ACE activity in COVID-19 and its association with clinical features and severity of the disease,2021,"Eliciting durable and protective T cell-mediated immunity in the respiratory mucosa remains a significant challenge. Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based cationic pathogen-like particles (PLPs) loaded with TLR agonists mimic biophysical properties of microbes and hence, simulate pathogen-pattern recognition receptor interactions to safely and effectively stimulate innate immune responses. We generated micro particle PLPs loaded with TLR4 (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, GLA) or TLR9 (CpG) agonists, and formulated them with and without a mucosal delivery enhancing carbomer-based nanoemulsion adjuvant (ADJ). These adjuvants delivered intranasally to mice elicited high numbers of influenza nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8+ and CD4+ effector and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in lungs and airways. PLPs delivering TLR4 versus TLR9 agonists drove phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of effector and memory T cells. While PLPs loaded with CpG or GLA provided immunity, combining the adjuvanticity of PLP-GLA and ADJ markedly enhanced the development of airway and lung TRMs and CD4 and CD8 T cell-dependent immunity to influenza virus. Further, balanced CD8 (Tc1/Tc17) and CD4 (Th1/Th17) recall responses were linked to effective influenza virus control. These studies provide mechanistic insights into vaccine-induced pulmonary T cell immunity and pave the way for the development of a universal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Toy, Randall; Lee, Woojong; Pradhan, Pallab; Vogel, Gabriela; Marinaik, Chandranaik B; Larsen, Autumn; Gates, Daisy; Luu, Tracy; Pandey, Bhawana; Kawaoka, Yoshihoro; Roy, Krishnendu; Suresh, M",Front Immunol,,316

One such reported sequelae of COVID-19 is sexual dysfunction in males even after recovery from the disease. Various mechanisms have been proposed regarding the erectile dysfunction a patient suffers after COVID-19. Most important is the hypothesis of endothelial dysregulation, subclinical hypogonadism, psychosocial misery, and pulmonary impairment contributing to erectile dysfunction.

Ultrasound can be a useful contribution in arthroscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The main aim of the present study was to assess equivalence between endoscopic and external ultrasound for shoulder exploration. Secondary objectives comprised qualitative assessment of endoscopic ultrasound images and comparative assessment of acquisition time between the two techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anatomic non-inferiority study was conducted on 6 shoulders from 3 subjects with a mean age of 84 years. After ultrasound examination by a radiologist specializing in osteoarticular imaging, shoulder arthroscopy was performed by a single specialized surgeon, using an ultrasound endoscope. Number of visualized structures and image quality were assessed by independent observers. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 structures of interest (91%) were visualizable on endoscopic ultrasound, versus 4 (36%) on external ultrasound (p<0.05). Mean endoscopic acquisition time was 9.5±6.3minutes [range, 5;22]. In the 11 structures, image quality was better on endoscopic than external ultrasound, except for the acromioclavicular joint, where quality was better on external ultrasound, and the lateral side of the rotator cuff, where quality was equivalent. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated equivalence between endoscopic and external ultrasound for shoulder exploration.

485362,"Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: ""When You Come Out of the Storm, You Won't Be the Same Person Who Walked in""",2020,"I construct a dynamic social-network model of the COVID-19 epidemic which embeds the SIR epidemiological model onto a graph of person-to-person interactions. The standard SIR framework assumes uniform mixing of infectious persons in the population. This abstracts from important elements of realism and locality: (i) people are more likely to interact with members of their social networks and (ii) health and economic policies can affect differentially the rate of viral transmission via a person's social network vs. the population as a whole. The proposed network-augmented (NSIR) model allows the evaluation, via simulations, of (i) health and economic policies and outcomes for all or subset of the population: lockdown/distancing, herd immunity, testing, contact tracing; (ii) behavioral responses and/or imposing or lifting policies at specific times or conditional on observed states. I find that viral transmission over a network-connected population can proceed slower and reach lower peak than transmission via uniform mixing. Network connections introduce uncertainty and path dependence in the epidemic dynamics, with a significant role for bridge links and superspreaders. Testing and contact tracing are more effective in the network model. If lifted early, distancing policies mostly shift the infection peak into the future, with associated economic costs. Delayed or intermittent interventions or endogenous behavioral responses generate a multi-peaked infection curve, a form of 'curve flattening', but may have costlier economic consequences by prolonging the epidemic duration.","Karaivanov, Alexander",PLoS One,,316

486773,COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome and diagnostic principles: an old and new Issue,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a screening tool designed to identify detained people at increased risk for COVID-19 mortality, the COVID-19 Inmate Risk Appraisal (CIRA). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with a representative sample (development) and a case-control sample (validation). SETTING: The two largest Swiss prisons. PARTICIPANTS: (1) Development sample: all male persons detained in P&ouml;schwies, Zurich (n = 365); (2) Validation sample: case-control sample of male persons detained in Champ-Dollon, Geneva (n = 192, matching 1:3 for participants at risk for severe course of COVID-19 and participants without risk factors). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CIRA combined seven risk factors identified by the World Health Organization and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health as predictive of severe COVID-19 to derive an absolute risk increase in mortality rate: Age &ge;60 years, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, immunodeficiency and cancer. RESULTS: Based on the development sample, we proposed a three-level classification: average (&lt;3.7), elevated (3.7-5.7) and high (&gt;5.7) risk. In the validation sample, the CIRA identified all individuals identified as vulnerable by national recommendations (having at least one risk factor). The category &ldquo;elevated risk&rdquo; maximised sensitivity (1) and specificity (0.97). The CIRA had even higher capacity in discriminating individuals vulnerable according to clinical evaluation (a four-level risk categorisation based on a consensus of medical staff). The category &ldquo;elevated risk&rdquo; maximised sensitivity and specificity (both 1). When considering the individuals classified as extremely high risk by medical staff, the category &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; had a high discriminatory capacity (sensitivity =0.89, specificity =0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The CIRA scores have a high discriminative ability and will be important in custodial settings to support decisions and prioritise actions using a standardised valid assessment method. However, as knowledge on risk factors for COVID-19 mortality is still limited, the CIRA may be considered preliminary. Underlying data will be updated regularly on the website (http://www.prison-research.com), where the CIRA algorithm is freely available.","Gonçalves, Leonel Cunha; Baggio, Stéphanie; Weber, Michael; Gétaz, Laurent; Wolff, Hans; Singh, Jay; Naegeli, Andreas; Rossegger, Astrid; Endrass, Jérôme",Swiss Med Wkly,,316

Based on the model, the virus successfully infected the mouse lung 2 days after transfection. Viral RNA/protein, innate immune cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, and pathological changes in the infected lungs were observed after infection. Further studies indicated that neutrophils were the first and most abundant leukocytes to infiltrate the infected lungs after viral infection. In addition, using infected CXCL5-knockout mice, chemokine CXCL5 was responsible for neutrophil recruitment. CXCL5 knockout decreased lung inflammation without diminishing viral clearance, suggesting a potential target for controlling pneumonia.","Liang, Yan; Li, Heng; Li, Jing; Yang, Ze-Ning; Li, Jia-Li; Zheng, Hui-Wen; Chen, Yan-Li; Shi, Hai-Jing; Guo, Lei; Liu, Long-Ding",Zool Res,,316

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","Ye, X-T; Luo, Y-L; Xia, S-C; Sun, Q-F; Ding, J-G; Zhou, Y; Chen, W; Wang, X-F; Zhang, W-W; Du, W-J; Ruan, Z-W; Hong, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,316

Due to lack of knowledge of the epidemiological cycle and absence of any type of vaccine or medications, the Government issued various non-pharmacological measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers applied the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental epidemiology process model to identifying the effect of different governments intervention methods enforced to mollify the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we aim to provide a modified SIRD model for COVID-19 spread prediction. We have analyzed the data of the Northern and Southern states of India from January 30, 2020, to October 24, 2020 using the proposed SIRD model and existing SIRD model. We have made the predictions with reasonable assumptions based on real data, considering that the precise course of an epidemic is highly dependent on how and when quarantine, isolation, and precautionary measures were imposed. The proposed method gives better approximation values of new cases, R0 (Reproductive Number), daily deaths, daily infectious, transmission rate, and recovered individuals.Through the analysis of the reported results, the proposed SIRD model can be an effective method for investigating the effect of government interventions on COVID-19 associated transmission and mortality rate at the time of epidemic.","Shringi, Sakshi; Sharma, Harish; Rathie, Pushpa Narayan; Bansal, Jagdish Chand; Nagar, Atulya",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,316

Case Series and Study Design: COLchicine versus ruxolitinib and secukinumab in open prospective randomIzed trial (COLORIT)],2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the professional practice of all healthcare workers, including radiographers. In the pandemic, clinical practice of radiographers was centred mostly on chest imaging of COVID-19 patients and radiotherapy treatment care delivery to those with cancer. This study aimed to assess the radiographers' perspective on the impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing and imaging service delivery in Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of practising radiographers in Ghana was conducted online from March 26th to May 6th, 2020. A previously validated questionnaire that sought information regarding demographics, general perspectives on personal and professional impact of the pandemic was used as the research instrument. Data obtained was analysed using Microsoft Excel® 2016. RESULTS: A response rate of 57.3% (134/234) was obtained. Of the respondents, 75.4% (n = 101) reported to have started experiencing high levels of workplace-related stress after the outbreak. Three-quarters (n = 98, 73.1%) of respondents reported limited access to any form of psychosocial support systems at work during the study period. Half (n = 67, 50%) of the respondents reported a decline in general workload during the study period while only a minority (n = 18, 13.4%) reported an increase in workload due to COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: This national survey indicated that majority of the workforce started experiencing coronavirus-specific workplace-related stress after the outbreak. Albeit speculative, low patient confidence and fear of contracting the COVID-19 infection on hospital attendance contributed to the decline in general workload during the study period. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In order to mitigate the burden of workplace-related stress on frontline workers, including radiographers, and in keeping to standard practices for staff mental wellbeing and patient safety, institutional support structures are necessary in similar future pandemics.","Akudjedu, T N; Botwe, B O; Wuni, A-R; Mishio, N A",,,316

Burnout in health care professionals results from a chronic negative work experience, leading to job dissatisfaction and, ultimately, poor patient outcomes. Symptoms and prevalence of burnout can be alleviated by implementing individual-focused strategies and minor modifications in work environments, job demands, and responsibilities. Currently, risk for burnout is increasing as COVID-19 challenges health care systems in which advanced practice nurses and other health care professionals struggle continuously to deliver high-quality patient care. In this article, the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 are considered and an overview is provided of burnout phenomenon, its causal factors, and its consequences.

This article explores whether this phenomenon is characteristic of pandemics or not. Since the emergence of population-based sciences in the 17th century, we can observe close temporal correlations between the plague and the discovery of population thinking, cholera and population-based group comparisons, tuberculosis and the formalization of cohort studies, the 1918 Great Influenza and the creation of an academic epidemiologic counterpart to the public health service, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the formalization of causal inference concepts. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have promoted the widespread understanding of population thinking both with respect to ways of flattening an epidemic curve and the societal bases of health inequities. If the latter proves true, it will support my hypothesis that pandemics did accelerate profound changes in epidemiologic methods and concepts.","Morabia, Alfredo",J Clin Epidemiol,,316

By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 350000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the upper tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.","Beare, Brendan K.; Toda, Alexis Akira",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12772v1.pdf,316

510967,Timing of national lockdown and mortality in COVID-19: the Italian experience. (Special Issue: Coronavirus (COVID-19) collection.),2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.","Cheng, Cecilia; Lau, Yan-Ching; Luk, Jeremy W",J Med Internet Res,,316

Forty women were included in the study, 20 patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls. The mean disease duration in patients was 13.0 (5.0-25.0) years, with medium to high disease activity despite ongoing treatment with low-dose prednisolone and methotrexate. There were no differences between the investigated groups regarding the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The concentration of phosphatidylserine-positive (PS+) EVs; platelet (CD42a+), leucocyte (CD45+), monocyte (CD14+), and endothelial (CD144+)-derived EVs; and EVs-expressing tissue factor (CD142+), P-selectin (CD62P+), and E-selectin (CD62E+) were determined by flow cytometry analysis. Overall hemostasis potential (OHP) was assessed to follow the hemostatic disturbances, including the parameters for overall coagulation potential (OCP) and overall fibrinolytic potential (OFP). Fibrin clot turbidity was measured together with clot lysis time, and scanning electron microscopy was performed. Increased concentrations of PS+, CD42a+, CD142+, CD45+, CD14+, and CD62P+ EVs were found in plasma from patients with RA compared to healthy controls, and the concentrations of PS+, CD42a+, CD14+, and CD62P+ EVs were positively correlated with the inflammatory parameters in RA patients. Positive correlations were also found between the levels of PS+ and CD42a+ EVs and OCP as well as between the levels of PS+, CD42a+, and CD62P+EVs and OHP.

In Study 1 (N = 663), constructive patriotism was positively associated with support for internal measures (e.g., raising awareness about health practices). Glorification was negatively linked to support for such measures and positively connected to support for external measures (e.g., closing the borders). In Study 2 (N = 522), constructive patriots showed greater compliance with hygiene and social distance practices. In Study 3 (N = 633), the attribution of responsibility for fighting the crisis to the state and particularly to individuals underlined the link between constructive patriotism and compliance with health practices. Additionally, constructive patriotism was linked to support for international collaboration. Study 4 (N = 1,051), conducted on a representative sample, further corroborated these findings.

Many authors highlighted the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) in management of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study aims to analyze the performance of LUS in the early identification of COVID-19 patients in ED during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We prospectively collected consecutive adult patients admitted to a first-level ED in Powered by Editorial Manager® and ProduXion Manager® from Aries Systems Corporation Florence with history or symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 that underwent LUS during the ED management. LUS findings were categorized in 6 discrete main etiological patterns. ""A"", ""Cardiogenic B"" and ""Typical C"" patterns were referred as non-COVID-19-suggestive, while ""Atypical"" B or C patterns, ""Multiple Consolidations"" pattern and ""ARDS"" pattern were referred as COVID-19-suggestive. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From 12 March to 12 May 2020, 360 patients were enrolled. COVID-19 suggestive LUS findings were significantly associated with final COVID-19 diagnosis (86% in COVID-19 vs 29% in non-COVID-19, p < 0.001). The presence in ED of at least one in positive swab OR a COVID-19-suggestive LUS showed a sensitivity of 97% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%. In patients with known SARS-CoV-2 exposition in the last 14 days, a COVID-19-suggestive pattern at LUS had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% for COVID-19 diagnosis. Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is a valuable tool for diagnostic stratification during COVID-19 outbreaks. LUS can help physicians in identifying false-negative RT-PCR, improving its diagnostic sensitivity in ED.","Bianchi, Simone; Savinelli, Caterina; Paolucci, Elisa; Pelagatti, Lorenzo; Sibona, Erica; Fersini, Natalia; Buggea, Michele; Tozzi, Camilla; Allescia, Germana; Paolini, Diana; Lanigra, Michele",Intern. emerg. med,,316

519999,COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness in a United Kingdom Tertiary and Quaternary Children's Hospital: Tales of the Unexpected,2020,"During spring 2020, the world was shocked at the imminent global spread of SARS-CoV-2, resorting to measures such as domestic confinement. This meant the reconfiguration of life in an unusual space;the home. However, not all households experienced it in the same way;many of them were vulnerable. A general increase in energy consumption and discomfort in many cases, led these families to suffer the ravages of confinement. This study analyzes the energy and comfort situation for the Madrid (Spain) population, according to the configuration of the homes, the characteristics of the dwellings, the vulnerability index by district, and energy poverty (measured with the 10% threshold of energy expenditure of home incomes). The results show a greater exposure, in confinement, of vulnerable and energy-poor households to scenarios of discomfort in the home, to which they could not respond, while energy consumption inevitably increased. Driven by need, energy-poor homes applied certain saving strategies, mainly resorting to thermal adaptation with clothing. This study shows the risk these households experienced in the face of an extreme situation, and invites reflection on preventive and containment measures that aim to avoid harming the disadvantaged in the future;harm that would also entail serious consequences on the health of their cohabitants.","Cuerdo-Vilches, Teresa Navas-Martín Miguel Ángel Oteiza Ignacio",Sustainability,,316

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The Ottawa Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who gave birth at The Ottawa Hospital and were >20 days post partum between 17 March and 16 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Perinatal IPV was defined as regular controlling behaviours or act-based forms of emotional/physical/sexual abuse in the 12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and/or post partum. Log-binomial multivariable regression models were used to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs to identify potential risk factors for IPV: maternal age, postpartum depression, parity, increase in partner substance use and household income. RESULTS: Among 216 participants, the median maternal age was 33 years (IQR: 30-36). In total, 52 (24.07%) reported some form of perinatal IPV, 37 (17.13%) reported regular controlling behaviour and 9 (4.17%) reported both. Household income below the municipal median was the strongest risk factor for perinatal IPV (aRR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.87 to 5.59). There was no apparent association between maternal age (aRR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.04), postpartum depression (aRR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.07), nulliparity (aRR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.97) or increases in partner substance use (aRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.25) with IPV. CONCLUSION: One in four individuals in this study experienced perinatal IPV. Household income was the strongest risk factor, and surprisingly, many hypothesised risk factors (eg, mental health, partner substance use, etc) were not significantly associated with perinatal IPV in this sample. This highlights the challenges in both measuring IPV and identifying individuals exposed to perinatal IPV during the high stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Muldoon, Katherine A; Denize, Kathryn M; Talarico, Robert; Boisvert, Carlie; Frank, Olivia; Harvey, Alysha L J; Rennicks White, Ruth; Fell, Deshayne B; O039,; Hare-Gordon, Meagan Ann; Guo, Yanfang; Murphy, Malia S Q; Corsi, Daniel J; Sampsel, Kari; Wen, Shi Wu; Walker, Mark C; El-Chaar, Darine",BMJ Open,,316

With more than 2 billion downloads, it was the most downloaded app of 2020. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is currently found on TikTok via the hashtag #CAMHS. The aim of this study was to explore how CAMHS is represented on TikTok through reviewing the hashtags associated with CAMHS and exploring the themes of videos with the #CAMHS hashtag.MethodThe Tik Tok app was downloaded and a search for the hashtags which featured the word #CAMHS was undertaken. A thematic analysis of the top 100 most popular uploaded videos featuring the #CAMHS was conducted. The number of likes, views and shares of the videos featuring each theme was recorded.ResultVideos with the hashtag #CAMHS had 203.9 million views, followed by: #camhsmeme(s) totalling 43.1 million views, #camhsjokes with 21.4 million views and #camhskids, 12.5 million views. The top 100 most popular videos represented 24% of total viewed videos with the hashtag #CAMHS.The most popular recurrent themes associated with the hashtag #CAMHS in our sample were: raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management (40% of videos), reference to self-harm (27% of videos) and negative perception of CAMHS (27% of videos).Raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management had the most likes (3,694,700) and views (17,435,900). This was followed by videos with themes of reference to self-harm (3,006,300 likes and 14,382,700 views). The most shared themes were: reference to suicide (shared 56,763 times) and videos which portrayed a theme of negative perception of CAMHS (40,628 shares). Videos with themes of a negative perception of CAMHS also garnered 1,762,500 likes and 8,666,900 views.ConclusionCAMHS is actively represented on TikTok through freely accessible unregulated videos. Videos with themes of raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management can potentially allow young people to share their experiences. Nonetheless, popular hashtags such as #CAMHSmemes and #CAMHSjokes, as well as videos featuring themes of negative perception of CAMHS, could potentially undermine the reputation of CAMHS to existing and future service users. The content of these videos should be taken seriously by CAMHS clinicians as it can potentially provide an insight into service users’ experiences of CAMHS on a scale that has not been observed before. Presently these videos are not screened or modulated by the NHS CAMHS service.","Chadee, Preetisha Evans Sacha",BJPsych Open,,316

523667,Integrative role of traditional and modern technologies to combat COVID-19,2020,"To date, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have been exploited in numerous different contexts while continuously pushing boundaries in terms of improved sensitivity, specificity, portability and reusability. The latter has attracted attention as a viable alternative to disposable biosensors, also offering prospects for rapid screening of biomolecules or biomolecular interactions. In this context here, we developed an approach to successfully regenerate a fiber-optic (FO)-SPR surface when utilizing cobalt (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) surface chemistry. To achieve this, we tested multiple regeneration conditions that can disrupt the NTA chelate on a surface fully saturated with His6-tagged antibody fragments (scFv-33H1F7) over ten regeneration cycles. The best surface regeneration was obtained when combining 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM imidazole and 0.5% SDS at pH 8.0 for 1 min with shaking at 150 rpm followed by washing with 0.5 M NaOH for 3 min. The true versatility of the established approach was proven by regenerating the NTA surface for ten cycles with three other model system bioreceptors, different in their size and structure: His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment (receptor binding domain, RBD), a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and protein origami carrying 4 RFPs (Tet12SN-RRRR). Enabling the removal of His6-tagged bioreceptors from NTA surfaces in a fast and cost-effective manner can have broad applications, spanning from the development of biosensors and various biopharmaceutical analyses to the synthesis of novel biomaterials.","Qu, Jia-Huan; Leirs, Karen; Escudero, Remei; Strmsek, Ziga; Jerala, Roman; Spasic, Dragana; Lammertyn, Jeroen",,,316

It is an enveloped virus with positive—sense single—stranded RNA. Patients with COVID-19 are usually present with symptoms of fever, dry cough, myalgia, dysgeusia, nausea, diarrhoea, hyposmia and later it progresses into pneumonia. Dentists are at potential risk because they are in consistent exposure of blood and saliva, so they should have knowledge of COVID-19 infection, transmission & prevention for proper infection control practices. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge and perception of DHPs toward COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among practicing dental professionals in Lucknow city (U.P) India. A total of 302 Dental Health Practitioners (DHPs) participated in the study. Knowledge was assessed using self-administered, structured questionnaire. The questions were administered online through Google Forms by sending link to the registered Dentist through E-mail. RESULTS: A total of 350 DHPs were participated in the study, among which 302 DHPs has given complete responses and was included in the analysis. Simple linear regression showed a significant relationship between knowledge with age of dentist (p < 0.001), qualification as MDS (p = 0.025), practice as private (p < 0.001), experience between 5 and 10 years (p = 0.009), and experienced more than 10 years(p = 0.006). Correct answers in each sections of questionnaire were defined an internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach`s alpha. CONCLUSION: Despite having high standard of knowledge, practices and perceptions DHPs around the world are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective field due to COVID-19 impact. DHPs are advised to follow the guidelines for clinical recommendations given by health authorities like WHO, CDC, ADA and IDA.","Arif, Khushboo; malhotra, Sitanshu; Mohammad, Shadab; Farooqui, Sana; Harayan, Manu; Singh, Pallavi; Saleem, Mohd",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12663-021-01554-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177189/,316

These developments underscore the urgent need for new classes of anti-fungal drugs and, therefore, the identification of new targets. Phosphoinositide signaling does not immediately appear to offer attractive targets due to its evolutionary conservation across the Eukaryota. However, recent evidence argues otherwise. Herein, we discuss the evidence identifying Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) as unexplored portals through which phosphoinositide signaling in virulent fungi can be chemically disrupted with exquisite selectivity. Recent identification of lead compounds that target fungal Sec14 proteins, derived from several distinct chemical scaffolds, reveals exciting inroads into the rational design of next generation Sec14 inhibitors. Development of appropriately refined next generation Sec14-directed inhibitors promises to expand the chemical weaponry available for deployment in the shifting field of engagement between fungal pathogens and their human hosts.","Khan, Danish; Nile, Aaron H.; Tripathi, Ashutosh; Bankaitis, Vytas A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201733/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136754,316
591336,One-year Fibrosis-4 index helps identify minimal HCC risk in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B patients with antiviral treatment,2021-02-05,"Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is recognized as a major pathogenic mechanism that underlies the association between CKD and obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and diabetes, through interaction between resident and/or circulating immune cells with parenchymal cells. Thus, considerable interest exists in approaches that target inflammation as a strategy to manage CKD. The initial phase of the inflammatory response to injury or metabolic dysfunction reflects the release of pro-inflammatory mediators including peptides, lipids and cytokines, and the recruitment of leukocytes. In self-limiting inflammation, the evolving inflammatory response is coupled to distinct processes that promote the resolution of inflammation and restore homeostasis. The discovery of endogenously generated lipid mediators — specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators and branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids — which promote the resolution of inflammation and attenuate the microvascular and macrovascular complications of obesity and diabetes mellitus highlights novel opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention through the targeting of pro-resolution, rather than anti-inflammatory pathways.","Brennan, Eoin; Kantharidis, Phillip; Cooper, Mark E.; Godson, Catherine",Nat Rev Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-021-00454-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282342/,316

In this context, it has become mandatory to design age-selective measures aimed at achieving an optimal balance between protecting public health and maintaining a viable economic activity. METHODS: We programmed a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed (SEIR) model in order to introduce epidemiologically relevant age classes into the outbreak-dynamics analysis. The model was fitted to the official death toll and calculated age distribution of deaths in Wuhan using a constrained linear least-squares algorithm. Subsequently, we used synthetic location-specific and age-structured contact matrices to quantify the effect of age-selective interventions both on mortality and on economic activity in Wuhan. For this purpose, we simulated four different scenarios ranging from an absence of measures to age-selective interventions with stronger physical-distancing measures for older individuals. RESULTS: An age-selective strategy could reduce the death toll by >30% compared with the non-selective measures applied during Wuhan’s lockdown for the same workforce. Moreover, an alternative age-selective strategy could allow a 5-fold increase in the population working on site without a detrimental impact on the death toll compared with the Wuhan scenario. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that age-selective-distancing measures focused on the older population could have achieved a better balance between COVID-19 mortality and economic activity during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. However, the implications of this need to be interpreted along with considerations of the practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks of such a strategy.","Ortega-Quijano, Daniel; Ortega-Quijano, Noe",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709095/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab043,316

METHODS: The triage process used to resume medical activities for gynecologic patients at the Wuhan Union Hospital after a 76‐day lockdown of the city is described, and its effectiveness in preventing COVID‐19 nosocomial transmission is shown. RESULTS: Nonemergency patients were pretriaged based on their contact history and body temperature at an outpatient clinic, and negative COVID‐19 screening test results were required for admission to the buffering rooms at the gynecologic department. The buffering lasted at least 3 days for symptom monitoring, and a second round of COVID‐19 testing was required before patients could be transferred to the regular gynecologic wards. For patients who needed emergency surgery, the first screening was completed at the isolation wards after surgery, followed by buffering at the gynecologic department. We received 19 298 outpatient visits, admitted 326 patients, and performed 223 operations in the first 2 months after the lockdown was lifted. No COVID‐19 cases occurred in the hospitalized patients, while the proportion of potentially high‐risk patients with cancer and severe anemia was increased in comparison to that observed during the same period in 2019 and the first 2 months of 2020 before the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an effective triage system with buffering at two levels to guarantee safe and timely treatment for non‐COVID‐19 gynecologic patients in the postlockdown phase.","Dong, Weihong; Gao, Rui; Cai, Jing; Yang, Shouhua; Guo, Jianfeng; Zhao, Jing; Wang, Zehua; Cai, Liqiong",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322966/,316
594151,The mechanisms and clinical application of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lianhua-Qingwen capsule,2021-08-09,"Rapid rates of land use and land cover change (LULCC) in eastern Africa and limited instances of genuinely equal partnerships involving scientists, communities and decision makers challenge the development of robust pathways toward future environmental and socioeconomic sustainability. We use a participatory modelling tool, Kesho, to assess the biophysical, socioeconomic, cultural and governance factors that influenced past (1959–1999) and present (2000–2018) LULCC in northern Tanzania and to simulate four scenarios of land cover change to the year 2030. Simulations of the scenarios used spatial modelling to integrate stakeholders’ perceptions of future environmental change with social and environmental data on recent trends in LULCC. From stakeholders’ perspectives, between 1959 and 2018, LULCC was influenced by climate variability, availability of natural resources, agriculture expansion, urbanization, tourism growth and legislation governing land access and natural resource management. Among other socio-environmental-political LULCC drivers, the stakeholders envisioned that from 2018 to 2030 LULCC will largely be influenced by land health, natural and economic capital, and political will in implementing land use plans and policies. The projected scenarios suggest that by 2030 agricultural land will have expanded by 8–20% under different scenarios and herbaceous vegetation and forest land cover will be reduced by 2.5–5% and 10–19% respectively. Stakeholder discussions further identified desirable futures in 2030 as those with improved infrastructure, restored degraded landscapes, effective wildlife conservation, and better farming techniques. The undesirable futures in 2030 were those characterized by land degradation, poverty, and cultural loss. Insights from our work identify the implications of future LULCC scenarios on wildlife and cultural conservation and in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets by 2030. The Kesho approach capitalizes on knowledge exchanges among diverse stakeholders, and in the process promotes social learning, provides a sense of ownership of outputs generated, democratizes scientific understanding, and improves the quality and relevance of the outputs.","Kariuki, Rebecca W.; Munishi, Linus K.; Courtney-Mustaphi, Colin J.; Capitani, Claudia; Shoemaker, Anna; Lane, Paul J.; Marchant, Rob",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577608/,316

594485,Measuring accuracy of the neutralizing activity of COVID-19 convalescent plasma,2021,"Mathematical and epidemiological simulation plays a pivotal role in predicting, anticipating, and controlling present and future epidemics. To better understand and model the dynamics of a specific infection, researchers need to consider the influence of many variables ranging from micro-host–pathogen interactions to host-to-host encounters, and the prevailing cultural, social, economic, and local customs worldwide. As reported by the WHO, a novel corona virus (COVID-19) is identified as the etiological virus through Wuhan pneumonia for unknown etiology with Chinese administration on Jan 7, 2020. This virus is designated as an unsympathetic SARS-Cov-2 by International Commission for Taxonomy of Viruses on Feb 11, 2020. The main aim is to enlarge a phase based mathematical modelling to specify the transferability of this disease. It is developed Reservoir-individuals spreading set of connections modelling for imitating the prospective broadcast as of the infectivity foundation in the direction of the person infectivity. In view of the fact that, the Reservoir has set of connections to rigid to see the sights obviously as well as communal anxieties are concentrating on top of the spreading starting reservoir to individuals. The subsequent generation matrix methodology is endorsed towards compute the fundamental reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) through the RP modelling to measure the transferability by the COVID-19. The values of [Formula: see text] are estimated from reservoir to human being as well as starting individual to individual, that is to say, the accepted quantity of less important diseases this consequence from presenting a solitary contaminated personality addicted to differently susceptible inhabitants. The present model demonstrated that the spreading of COVID-19 is superior to the Middle-East pulmonary infirmity during the Middle-East nationals, analogous to harsh sensitive pulmonary infirmity, but inferior than Middle-East pulmonary infirmity within the Republic of Korea. It can also extend this study to some other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Germany etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has become the leading societal concern.

Inadequate knowledge and incorrect attitudes among HCWs can directly influence practices and lead to delayed diagnosis, poor infection control practices, and spread of disease. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic among the frontline healthcare workers (F-HCWs) working at a tertiary care hospital situated in Eastern Uttar Pradesh and to identify the factors significantly associated with KAP. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 260 health care providers across eastern Uttar Pradesh including Basti city during December 2020. Data was collected using a self-primed pretested questionnaire from the FHCWs working at a tertiary care hospital of eastern Uttar Pradesh. In this survey, a convenience sampling method was adopted. 12 items on knowledge, 10 items on attitude, and 5 items on practices related to COVID-19. The other variables consisted of 4 items on socio-demographic attributes, P-value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed to assess the attitude and practices in relation to knowledge. Results: Of the total 260 study population, 228 were interviewed online, 32 were self-administered. Knowledge and attitude of the nursing staff were highest but practice score was best for residents. Among different age groups knowledge, attitude and practices scores were highest for 35-45, 45-60 and 25-35 age groups respectively.

Compared with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there is an issue of high observer variation in the interpretation of echocardiograms. Therefore, AI can help minimize the observer variation and provide accurate diagnosis in the field of echocardiography. In this review, we summarize the necessity for automated diagnosis in the echocardiographic field, and discuss the results of AI application to echocardiography and future perspectives. Currently, there are two roles for AI in cardiovascular imaging. One is the automation of tasks performed by humans, such as image segmentation, measurement of cardiac structural and functional parameters. The other is the discovery of clinically important insights. Most reported applications were focused on the automation of tasks. Moreover, algorithms that can obtain cardiac measurements are also being reported. In the next stage, AI can be expected to expand and enrich existing knowledge. With the continual evolution of technology, cardiologists should become well versed in this new knowledge of AI and be able to harness it as a tool. AI can be incorporated into everyday clinical practice and become a valuable aid for many healthcare professionals dealing with cardiovascular diseases.

PURPOSE: Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy is used in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia to lower the risk of infections. IVIG and subcutaneous IVIG (SCIG) therapy have been to shown to be safe and effective when administered as clinic-based infusions. Concern from both patients and providers for increased transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus to immunosuppressed patients with scheduled medical visits and procedures made it necessary for us to reassess our process of how we manage patient care in general and chronic clinic infusions in particular. Here we describe our experience of transitioning patients from clinic-based to home based IVIG and/or SCIG infusions to decrease the risk of COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: Criteria were developed to identify high-risk immunosuppressed patients who would be appropriate candidates for potential conversion to home based IVIG infusions. Data were collected via chart review, and cost analysis was performed using Medicare Part B reimbursement data. A patient outcome questionnaire was developed for administration through follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 45 patients met criteria for home-based infusion, with 27 patients (60%) agreeing to home-based infusion. Posttransition patient outcomes assessment, conducted in 26 patients (96%), demonstrated good patient understanding of the home-based infusion process. No infusion-related complications were reported, and 24 patients (92%) had no concerns about receiving future IVIG and/or SCIG doses at home. No patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. Clinic infusion visits decreased by 26.6 visits per month, resulting in a total of 106 hours of additional available infusion chair time per month and associated cost savings of $12,877. CONCLUSION: Transition of clinic based to home based IVIG/SCIG infusion can be successfully done to decrease potential exposure during a pandemic in a high-risk immunosuppressed population, with no impact on patient satisfaction, adherence, or efficacy. The home-based infusion initiative was associated with a reduction in costs to patients and an increase in available chair time in the infusion clinic.","Perreault, Sarah; Schiffer, Molly; Clinchy-Jarmoszko, Virginia; Bocchetta, Nicole; Barbarotta, Lisa; Abdelghany, Osama; Foss, Francine; Huntington, Scott; Seropian, Stuart; Isufi, Iris",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617630/,316

We argue that the global risks from toxic pollution and climate change are highly correlated and should be jointly analyzed in order to inform and better target efforts to reduce or mitigate both risks. We provide such analysis for 176 countries and found a strong (r(s) = -0.798;95%CI -0.852, -0.727) and significant (p<0.0001) relationship between the distribution of climate risk and toxic pollution. We also found that inequities in pollution production, economic status, and institutional readiness are interconnected and exacerbate risk for countries already in the highest risk categories for both toxic and non-toxic (greenhouse gas) pollution. The findings have policy implications, including the use of the proposed Target assessment to decide where best to address toxic and non-toxic pollution simultaneously, based on the need to minimize human suffering and maximize return on effort.","Marcantonio, Richard; Javeline, Debra; Field, Sean; Fuentes, Agustin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288922/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254060,316

One way to understand this is by linking data sets from clinical and national audits, national registries and other National Health Service (NHS) encounter data. However, getting to the point of having linked national data sets is challenging. OBJECTIVE: We describe our experience of the data application and linkage process for our study ‘LAUNCHES QI’, and the time, processes and resource requirements involved. To help others planning similar projects, we highlight challenges encountered and advice for applications in the current system as well as suggestions for system improvements. FINDINGS: The study set up for LAUNCHES QI began in March 2018, and the process through to data acquisition took 2.5 years. Several challenges were encountered, including the amount of information required (often duplicate information in different formats across applications), lack of clarity on processes, resource constraints that limit an audit’s capacity to fulfil requests and the unexpected amount of time required from the study team. It is incredibly difficult to estimate the resources needed ahead of time, and yet necessary to do so as early on as funding applications. Early decisions can have a significant impact during latter stages and be hard to change, yet it is difficult to get specific information at the beginning of the process. CONCLUSIONS: The current system is incredibly complex, arduous and slow, stifling innovation and delaying scientific progress. NHS data can inform and improve health services and we believe there is an ethical responsibility to use it to do so. Streamlining the number of applications required for accessing data for health services research and providing clarity to data controllers could facilitate the maintenance of stringent governance, while accelerating scientific studies and progress, leading to swifter application of findings and improvements in healthcare.","Taylor, Julie A; Crowe, Sonya; Espuny Pujol, Ferran; Franklin, Rodney C; Feltbower, Richard G; Norman, Lee J; Doidge, James; Gould, Doug William; Pagel, Christina",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413101/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047575,316

Moreover, for the first time, a result in which a fast and complete elimination of SARS‐CoV‐2 (the virus causes COVID‐19) within only 1 s is achieved by the nearly whole industry‐chain‐covered product. These results advance the promising potential in UVC‐LED disinfection particularly in the shadow of COVID‐19.","Liu, Shangfeng; Luo, Wei; Li, Dan; Yuan, Ye; Tong, Wei; Kang, Junjie; Wang, Yixin; Li, Duo; Rong, Xin; Wang, Tao; Chen, Zhaoying; Li, Yongde; Wang, Houjin; Wang, Weiyun; Hoo, Jason; Yan, Long; Guo, Shiping; Shen, Bo; Cong, Zhe; Wang, Xinqiang",Adv Funct Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349747/; https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202008452,316
598766,Legionnaires' disease mimicking swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia during the “herald wave” of the pandemic,2010-05-10,"Acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating illness induced by systemic inflammation e.g., sepsis or local lung inflammation e.g., COVID-19 mediated severe pneumonia, has an unacceptably high mortality and has no effective therapy. ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)(34). Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y(32), within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y(32), preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y(32). As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.","Wang, Ting; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Gross, Christine; Sun, Xutong; Lu, Qing; Wang, Hui; Wu, Xiaomin; Kangath, Archana; Tang, Haiyang; Aggarwal, Saurabh; Black, Stephen M.",Redox Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101794; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221323172030999X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248422/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221323172030999X?v=s5,316

This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. Methods : We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. Results : Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. Conclusion : COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Basu, Arindam; Kuziemsky, Craig; de Araújo Novaes, Magdala; Kleber, Araujo; Sales, Fernando; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb; Flórez-Arango, José F.; Gogia, Shashi B.; Ho, Kendall; Hunter, Inga; Iyengar, Sriram; John, Oommen; John, Sheila; Kulatunga, Gumindu; Rajput, Vije Kumar; Ranatunga, Prasad; Udayasankaran, Jai Ganesh",Yearb Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882598/; https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726484,316

Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors’ expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.","Tripathi, Satyendra C; Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Creighton, Chad J.; Patil, Ashlesh",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.184663,316

Five patients underwent oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs for real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Direct SARS-CoV-2 release during normal breathing was also investigated by RT-PCR in air samples collected using a microbiological sampler. Viral RNA was detected in air at 1 cm from the mouth of patients whose oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In contrast, the viral RNA was not identified in the exhaled air from patients with oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs that tested negative.

601181,Atypical skin manifestations during immune checkpoint blockage in COVID19-infected lung cancer patients,2020-07-09,"INTRODUCTION: Although factors such as age, sex, diabetes, obesity and changes in certain laboratory investigations are important prognostic factors in COVID‐19 infection, these may not apply to all ethnic/racial groups. We hypothesized differences in routine biochemistry and haematology indices in Caucasian and a combined group of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) patients who tested positive for COVID‐19 who died, compared to survivors. METHODS: We tested our hypothesis in 445 patients (229 Caucasian, 216 BAME) admitted to secondary care with proven COVID‐19 infection, in whom standard routine laboratory indices were collected on admission. RESULTS: After 28 weeks, 190 (42.7%) had died within 28 days of COVID diagnosis (97 Caucasians [42.4%], 93 BAMEs [43.1%], P = .923). A general linear model analysis found the ethnicity interaction with mortality to be significant for fibrinogen, ferritin and HbA(1)c (after controlling for age). In a multivariate analysis, a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 7.4 and a urea/albumin ratio > 0.28 increased the odds of death for both the Caucasian and the BAME group. Additional factors increasing the odds ratio in the BAME group included age >60 years and being diabetic. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and urea/albumin ratio are simple metrics that predict death to aid clinicians in determining the prognosis of COVID‐19 and help provide early intensive intervention to reduce mortality. In the BAME groups, intensive monitoring even at younger age and those with diabetes may also help reduce COVID‐19 associated mortality.","Marwah, Mandeep; Marwah, Sukhjinder; Blann, Andrew; Morrissey, Hana; Ball, Patrick; Wandroo, Farooq A.",Int J Lab Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939271/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13538,316

601699,Self-reported Impact of Respirator Use on Healthcare Worker Ability to Perform Patient Care,2020-06-11,"Respiratory viruses infections caused by influenza viruses, human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronaviruses are an eminent threat for public health. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines available for hPIV, RSV and coronaviruses, and the available seasonal influenza vaccines have considerable limitations. With regard to pandemic preparedness, it is important that procedures are in place to respond rapidly and produce tailor made vaccines against these respiratory viruses on short notice. Moreover, especially for influenza there is great need for the development of a universal vaccine that induces broad protective immunity against influenza viruses of various subtypes. Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient viral vector that holds great promise as a vaccine platform. MVA can encode one or more foreign antigens and thus functions as a multivalent vaccine. The vector can be used at biosafety level 1, has intrinsic adjuvant capacities and induces humoral and cellular immune responses. However, there are some practical and regulatory issues that need to be addressed in order to develop MVA-based vaccines on short notice at the verge of a pandemic. In this review, we discuss promising novel influenza virus vaccine targets and the use of MVA for vaccine development against various respiratory viruses.","Altenburg, Arwen F.; Kreijtz, Joost H. C.

From 2020, patients at risk are also older adults, who, though negative for the SARS-Cov-2 infection, suffer with a fatigue syndrome due to home restriction/quarantine. Besides eventual psycological managements, it could be useful to offer to these patients a rehabilitation workouts easy to learn and to independently repeat at home (Full-Body In-Bed Gym). Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation (FES), we suggest for this fatigue syndrome a 10–20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that may recover from muscle weakness the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day activities. Leg muscles could be trained also by an adjunctive neuro-muscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in frail old persons. Many of the exercises could be performed in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), thus hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. Full-Body in-Bed Gym is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-ventilation rehabilitation training performed by patients after heavy surgery. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine of Full-Body in-Bed Gym, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow to major body muscles. Continued regularly, Full-Body in-Bed Gym may help maintaining independence of frail people, including those suffering with the fatigue syndrome related to the restrictions/quarantine imposed to the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carraro, Ugo; Marcante, Andrea; Ravara, Barbara; Albertin, Giovanna; Maccarone, Maria Chiara; Piccione, Francesco; Kern, Helmut; Masiero, Stefano",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01885-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047931/,316

602797,Wound bed preparation: an overview,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk. METHODS: In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase‐Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM‐1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP‐2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission. The majority (n = 51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n = 37, 65%), whereas stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30‐day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n = 9 (17%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with COVID‐19 admitted to the ICU develop AKI. The functional deficit is often low urinary volume, and initial levels of biomarkers are generally increased without clear relation to final AKI stage.","Luther, Tomas; Bülow‐Anderberg, Sara; Larsson, Anders; Rubertsson, Sten; Lipcsey, Miklos; Frithiof, Robert; Hultström, Michael",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190222/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13746,316

We pooled data on occupational surveillance of 10,654 HCW who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in six Italian centers. Information was available on demographics, job title, department of employment, source of exposure, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and COVID-19-related symptoms. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings. The prevalence of infection varied across centers and ranged from 3.0% to 22.0%, being strongly correlated with that of the respective areas. Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men. Fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, together with anosmia and ageusia. No differences in the risk of infection were detected between job titles, or working in a COVID-19 designated department. Reported contact with a patient inside or outside the workplace was a risk factor. Use of a mask was strongly protective against risk of infection as was use of gloves. The use of a mask by the source of exposure (patient or colleague) had an independent effect in reducing infection risk.","Boffetta, P.; Violante, F.; Durando, P.; De Palma, G.; Pira, E.; Vimercati, L.; Cristaudo, A.; Icardi, G.; Sala, E.; Coggiola, M.; Tafuri, S.; Gattini, V.; Apostoli, P.; Spatari, G.; workers, Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.20158717; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.29.20158717v1?rss=1,316

The immune responses and clinical features of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been fully described. Thus, in this study, we compare the seroprevalence and define the correlation between symptoms and serological results in the first COVID-19 cluster in the city of Konjic, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of the total number, 93% of RT-PCR positive participants had positive IgG serology and 75% of them developed symptoms of COVID-19. We found that there was no significant alteration in specific IgG (p = 0.504) antibody levels during the 1-year period after COVID-19. Our results indicate that symptomatic COVID-19 patients have a higher rate of seroconversion (p < 0.01). The IgG seroconversion was correlated with high fever (p = 0.002) and headache (p = 0.007), suggesting that these symptoms could be considered as indicators of a better immune response.

604701,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on developmental care practices for infants born preterm,2020-11-30,"Abstract Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), the single most important etiologic agent of common colds, are small viruses composed of an icosahedral protein shell that encapsidates a single, positive RNA strand. Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating.","Bella, Jordi; Rossmann, Michael G",Pharmaceutica Acta Helvetiae,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031686599000564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10812972/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031686599000564,316
605391,COVID‐19 convalescent plasma donor recruitment experience from the perspective of a hospital transfusion medicine service,2021-06-13,"Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to construct chimeric cDNAs that encode the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (G) linked to the cytoplasmic domain of either the immunoglobulin mu membrane heavy chain, the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus, or the small glycoprotein (p23) of infectious bronchitis virus. Biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these hybrid genes were correctly expressed in eukaryotic cells and that the hybrid proteins were transported to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport to the Golgi complex of G protein with an immunoglobulin mu membrane cytoplasmic domain was approximately sixfold slower than G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain. However, this rate was virtually identical to the rate of transport of micron heavy chain molecules measured in the B cell line WEHI 231. The rate of transport of G protein with a hemagglutinin cytoplasmic domain was threefold slower than wild type G protein and G protein with a p23 cytoplasmic domain, which were transported at similar rates. The combined results underscore the importance of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain for efficient transport of G protein to the cell surface. Also, normal cytoplasmic domains from other transmembrane glycoproteins can substitute for the G protein cytoplasmic domain in transport of G protein to the plasma membrane. The method of constructing precise hybrid proteins described here will be useful in defining functions of specific domains of viral and cellular integral membrane proteins.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3011809/,316

Those with central obesity had lower antibody (Ab) titers compared with those with no central obesity [1426(1436)vs1971(1819), p=0.04]; smokers had a blunted response compared to non-smokers [1099(1350)vs1921(1375), p=0.007], as well as hypertensive vs normotensive [650+/-1192vs1911(1364), p=0.001] and dyslipidemic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534(972)vs 1872(1406), p=0.005]. Multivariate analysis showed that higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension and longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation were associated with lower Ab titers, independent of BMI, age and gender. The association between waist circumference and Ab titers was lost when controlling for body fat, suggesting that visceral accumulation may explain this result. Conclusions It is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS CoV-2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID-19. However, neutralizing abs correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2, and the finding that central obesity, hypertension and smoking are associated with a blunted response warrants further attention. Our findings must lead to a vigilant approach, as these subjects could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.","Watanabe, M.; Balena, A.; Tuccinardi, D.; Tozzi, R.; Risi, R.; Masi, D.; Caputi, A.; Rossetti, R.; Spoltore, M.

Since there has been a lack of investigation in the literature, the primary psychosocial stressor that this review focuses on is loneliness. As such, and in an attempt to help establish a theoretical framework regarding how loneliness may impact ME/CFS, loneliness is comprehensively reviewed, and its relation to chronic illness is described. We conclude by discussing a variety of coping strategies that may be employed by ME/CFS individuals to address their loneliness. Future directions and ways with which the literature may investigate loneliness and ME/CFS are discussed.","Boulazreg, Samir; Rokach, Ami",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092097/,316

However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was an 87.9% higher probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% higher probability of being admitted, a 101.7% higher probability of intubation and a 20.8% higher probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone. Also, both diseases had higher COVID-19 pneumonia rates, intubation rates and case-fatality rates compared to the overall population.","Leon-Abarca, Juan Alonso; Memon, Roha Saeed; Rehan, Bahar; Iftikhar, Maimoona; Chatterjee, Antara",Acta Biomed,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525210/,316

Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are promising tools for large-scale screenings due to timely results and feasibility for on-site testing. Nonetheless, the diagnostic performance of RADT in detecting infectious individuals is not yet fully determined. In this study, RT-qPCR and virus culture of RT-qPCR-positive samples were used to evaluate and compare the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test in detecting SARS-CoV-2-infected and possibly infectious individuals. To this end, two combined oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at a routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic center. A total of 2,028 samples were tested, and 118 virus cultures were inoculated. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 210 samples by RT-qPCR, representing a positive rate of 10.36%. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test yielded a positive result in 92 (4.54%) samples resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.86 and 99.89%, respectively. For adjusted C(T) values of <20 (n = 14), <25 (n = 57), and <30 (n = 88), the RADT reached sensitivities of 100, 98.25, and 88.64%, respectively. All 29 culture-positive samples were detected by the RADT. Although the overall sensitivity was low, the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test reliably detected patients with high RNA loads. In addition, negative RADT results fully corresponded with the lack of viral cultivability in Vero E6 cells. These results indicate that RADT can be a valuable tool for the detection of individuals with high RNA loads that are likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2.","Korenkov, Michael; Poopalasingam, Nareshkumar; Madler, Matthias; Vanshylla, Kanika; Eggeling, Ralf; Wirtz, Maike; Fish, Irina; Dewald, Felix; Gieselmann, Lutz; Lehmann, Clara; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Gruell, Henning; Pfeifer, Nico; Heger, Eva; Klein, Florian",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213977/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00896-21,316

This process is essential for the viral life cycle. Therefore, 3CL(Pro) is a promising target to develop antiviral drugs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Traditional enzymatic assays for the identification of 3CL(Pro) inhibitors rely on peptide-based colorimetric or fluorogenic substrates. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has limit or delay access to these substrates, especially for researchers in developing countries attempting to screen natural product libraries. We explored the use of the fluorescent probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) as an alternative assay for inhibitor identification. Fluorescence enhancement upon binding of ANS to 3CL(Pro) was observed, and this interaction was competitive with a peptide substrate. The utility of ANS-based competitive binding assay to identify 3CL(Pro) inhibitors was demonstrated with the flavonoid natural products baicalein and rutin. The molecular nature of ANS and rutin interaction with 3CL(Pro) was explored with molecular modeling. Our results suggested that ANS could be employed in a competitive binding assay to facilitate the identification of novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds.","Deetanya, Peerapon; Hengphasatporn, Kowit; Wilasluck, Patcharin; Shigeta, Yasuteru; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada; Wangkanont, Kittikhun",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.05.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109016/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021002415?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021002415,316
611516,Estimation of the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 using proportional meta-analysis of nationwide contact tracing data in Taiwan,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever and coronavirus disease 2019 have now begun to overlap within tropical and subtropical regions. This is due to the high prevalence of dengue fever in these regions and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic situation. The similarity of symptoms between the two diseases can confuse diagnoses, but coinfection can also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of patients with dengue and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 coinfection. The first case is that of a 24-year-old Hispanic woman with acute fever, odynophagia, and diarrhea, without respiratory symptoms and with positive molecular tests for both dengue and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The second case is that of a 59-year-old Hispanic male patient with fever and respiratory symptoms of 2 weeks duration, negative molecular tests, and positive serological tests for both viruses. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of both viral infections can help elucidate diagnoses and prognoses. CONCLUSIONS: Severe dengue infection is common in young adults, while coronavirus disease 2019 is generally asymptomatic. In older people, the severity of dengue fever will depend on their comorbidities or the infectious serotype, but coronavirus disease 2019 is consistently more severe in this group. The accurate diagnosis of both infections can better guide clinical management, as well as public health actions in transmission control, now especially important during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Agudelo Rojas, Olga Lucia; Tello-Cajiao, María Elena; Rosso, Fernando",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461977/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-02973-5,316
612197,The Role of Genetic Sex and Mitochondria in Response to COVID-19 Infection,2020-06-19,"From the 1918 influenza pandemic (H1N1) until the recent 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, no efficient diagnostic tools have been developed for sensitive identification of viral pathogens. Rigorous, early, and accurate detection of viral pathogens is not only linked to preventing transmission but also to timely treatment and monitoring of drug resistance. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the gold standard method for microbiology and virology testing, suffers from both false-negative and false-positive results arising from the detection limit, contamination of samples/templates, exponential DNA amplification, and variation of viral ribonucleic acid sequences within a single individual during the course of the infection. Rapid, sensitive, and label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 can provide a first line of defense against the current pandemic. A promising technique is non-linear coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, which has the ability to capture rich spatiotemporal structural and functional information at a high acquisition speed in a label-free manner from a biological system. Raman scattering is a process in which the distinctive spectral signatures associated with light-sample interaction provide information on the chemical composition of the sample. In this prospective, we briefly discuss the development and future prospects of CARS for real-time multiplexed label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens.","Tabish, Tanveer A.; Narayan, Roger J.; Edirisinghe, Mohan",MRS Commun,https://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2020.81; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398237/,316
612709,"A primer on using mathematics to understand COVID-19 dynamics: Modeling, analysis and simulations",2020-11-30,"COVID-19 is caused by a hitherto nonexistent pathogen, hence the immune response to the disease is currently unknown. Studies conducted over the past few weeks have found that the antibody titre levels in the blood plasma of infected patients decrease over time, as is common for acute viral infections. Fully documented reinfection cases from Hong Kong, India, Belgium and USA, as well as credible to anecdotal evidence of second-time cases from other countries, bring into sharp focus the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. Here we use mathematical modeling to answer this question, constructing a novel delay differential equation model which is tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given time interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection. We find possible solutions exhibiting large number of waves of disease in the first situation and two to three waves in the second situation. Interestingly however, these multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures. For sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the short-lived immunity. Our results cast insight into the potential spreading dynamics of the disease and might also be useful for analysing the spread after a vaccine is invented, and mass vaccination programs initiated.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

In this research, we focus on digital contact tracing and automated triage for hospitals. We conducted an online survey in Flanders (N = 1708) to investigate the perceived appropriateness of these systems based on the Contextual Integrity framework, as developed by Nissenbaum [1]. For digital contact tracing, significant differences were found between the appropriateness of using various types of data for different goals. Precise individual location data (i.e. GPS) was considered to be least appropriate and much less appropriate than proximity data (i.e. Bluetooth) or coarser location data (i.e. GSM). Goals for digital contact tracing with a high individual impact were considered to be less appropriate than goals with a low individual or societal impact. In addition, the data showed that respondents would find the usage of digital contact tracing to be less appropriate after the pandemic, underlining the temporality of this technological solution. For automated triage, the results indicated that gender is perceived to be significantly less appropriate than the other types of data, including age, to determine the priority of treatment.","Martens, Marijn; De Wolf, Ralf; Vadendriessche, Karel; Evens, Tom; De Marez, Lieven",Technol Soc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566203/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160791X21002232; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21002232,316

Design A multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinded clinical outcome assessment. Participants were randomised to receive a dental check-up at six-monthly, 24-monthly or risk-based recall intervals. A two-strata trial design was used, with participants randomised within the 24-month stratum if the recruiting dentist considered them clinically suitable. Participants ineligible for 24-month recall were randomised to a risk-based or six-month recall interval. Setting UK primary dental care. Participants Practices providing NHS care and adults who had received regular dental check-ups. Main outcome measures The percentage of sites with gingival bleeding on probing, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), cost-effectiveness. Results In total, 2,372 participants were recruited from 51 dental practices. Of those, 648 were eligible for the 24-month recall stratum and 1,724 participants were ineligible. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the mean percentage of sites with gingival bleeding on probing between intervention arms in any comparison. For those eligible for 24-month recall stratum: the 24-month versus six-month group had an adjusted mean difference of -0.91%, 95% CI (-5.02%, 3.20%); the 24-month group versus risk-based group had an adjusted mean difference of 0.07%, 95% CI (-3.99%, 4.12%). For the overall sample, the risk-based versus six-month adjusted mean difference was 0.78%, 95% CI (-1.17%, 2.72%). There was no evidence of a difference in OHRQoL (0-56 scale, higher score for poorer OHRQoL) between intervention arms in any comparison. For the overall sample, the risk-based versus six-month effect size was -0.35, 95% CI (-1.02, 0.32). There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful difference between the groups in any comparison in either eligibility stratum for any of the secondary clinical or patient-reported outcomes. Conclusion Over a four-year period, we found no evidence of a difference in oral health for participants allocated to a six-month or a risk-based recall interval, nor between a 24-month, six-month or risk-based recall interval for participants eligible for a 24-month recall. However, patients greatly value and are willing to pay for frequent dental check-ups.

The lack of effective treatment strategy and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat to human health. An extremely high infection rate and multi-organ secondary infection within a short period of time makes this virus more deadly and challenging for therapeutic interventions. Despite high sequence similarity and utilization of common host-cell receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. Structure-based sequence comparison of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 illustrate three divergent loop regions in SARS-CoV-2, which is reminiscent of MERS-CoV sialoside binding pockets. Comparative binding analysis with host sialosides revealed conformational flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 divergent loop regions to accommodate diverse glycan-rich sialosides. These key differences with SARS-CoV and similarity with MERS-CoV suggest an evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein reciprocal interaction with host surface sialosides to infect host cells with wide tissue tropism.","Awasthi, Mayanka; Gulati, Sahil; Sarkar, Debi P.; Tiwari, Swasti; Kateriya, Suneel; Ranjan, Peeyush; Verma, Santosh Kumar",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12090909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825063/,316

The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed. Some novel SARS-CoV-2 variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by these vaccines. Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection from severe COVID-19.

The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be credited to open science, industry partnerships, harmonization of clinical trials, and the altruism of study participants. The manufacturing and distribution of the emergency use–authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are ongoing challenges. What remains now is to ensure broad and equitable global vaccination against COVID-19.","Golob, Jonathan L.; Lugogo, Njira; Lauring, Adam S.; Lok, Anna S.",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.149187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822773/,316
617830,Increased monocyte count and red cell distribution width as prognostic biomarkers in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND Cancer survivors frequently report a range of unmet psychological and supportive care needs; these often continue after treatment has finished and are predictive of psychological distress and poor health-related quality of life. Web-based interventions demonstrate good efficacy in addressing these concerns and are more accessible than face-to-face interventions. Finding My Way (FMW) is a web-based, psycho-educational, and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for cancer survivors developed in Australia. Previous trials have demonstrated that FMW is acceptable, highly adhered to, and effective in reducing the impact of distress on quality of life while leading to cost savings through health resource use reduction. OBJECTIVE This study aims to adapt the Australian FMW website for a UK cancer care context and then undertake a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of FMW UK against a treatment-as-usual waitlist control. METHODS To an extent, our trial design replicates the existing Australian randomized controlled trial of FMW. Following a comprehensive adaptation of the web resource, we will recruit 294 participants (147 per study arm) from across clinical sites in North West England and North Wales. Participants will have been diagnosed with cancer of any type in the last 6 months, have received anticancer treatment with curative intent, be aged ≥16 years, be proficient in English, and have access to the internet and an active email address. Participants will be identified and recruited through the National Institute for Health Research clinical research network. Measures of distress, quality of life, and health economic outcomes will be collected using a self-report web-based questionnaire at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and both 3- and 6-month follow-up. Quantitative data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat mixed model repeated measures analysis. Embedded semistructured qualitative interviews will probe engagement with, and experiences of using, FMW UK and suggestions for future improvements. RESULTS The website adaptation work was completed in January 2021. A panel of cancer survivors and health care professionals provided feedback on the test version of FMW UK. Feedback was positive overall, although minor updates were made to website navigation, inclusivity, terminology, and the wording of the Improving Communication and Sexuality and Intimacy content. Recruitment for the clinical trial commenced in April 2021. We aim to report on findings from mid-2023. CONCLUSIONS Replication studies are an important aspect of the scientific process, particularly in psychological and clinical trial literature, especially in different geographical settings. Before replicating the FMW trial in the UK setting, content updating was required. If FMW UK now replicates Australian findings, we will have identified a novel and cost-effective method of psychosocial care delivery for cancer survivors in the United Kingdom.

One underrecognized effect of the pandemic is the decline of mental health in our communities. Studies have shown that pandemic-related stress is associated with increased depression and anxiety. In addition to worsening mental health, COVID-19 infection has been shown to have neurological manifestations. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with a history of major depressive disorder and alcohol use with no recent history of infection or vaccination who presented with hand and foot paresthesias over the past six weeks, 30 lb weight loss, dysphoric mood, and acutely progressive ambulatory dysfunction over the past two weeks, for which she required assistance to ambulate. Psychiatric evaluation was significant for depressive symptoms. On neurologic examination, she had decreased deep tendon reflexes and ataxic, jerky gait. She was found to be positive for COVID-19. Labs and findings demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation which suggests presumptive diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, prompting treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin for five days. She was noted to be deficient in zinc, folate, copper, and borderline B-12, as well as mild hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia likely secondary to depression-induced loss of appetite and alcohol use disorder. Guillain-Barre is a severe and debilitating outcome that must be considered when evaluating neuromuscular weakness in the setting of COVID-19, even in asymptomatic patients. Our case highlights the multifactorial intersection between Guillain-Barre syndrome, COVID-19, and concomitant mental health and alcohol use disorder.","Mokhashi, Nikita; Narla, Gowtham; Marchionni, Christine",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927956/,316

620057,Perimyocarditis in Adolescents After Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine,2021-07-28,"In December 2019, WHO was informed with several unknown pneumonia cases and later it was found as highly contagious, transmittable and pathogenic viral infection. The novel coronavirus (nCoV-19) was firstly reported from Wuhan city in China. COVID-19 has raised the concern of the world since its emergence from China. The WHO has declared an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Till now 6,057,853 confirmed cases with 371,166 deaths have been reported from approximately 213 countries of the world. The aim of this study is to discuss all the aspects related to recently discovered novel coronavirus. The article, therefore, provides a comprehensive study on the genomic, epidemiological, social, clinical and environmental aspects of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 receptor as a ligand to bind and transmit its genome just like the SARS-CoV. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are very non-specific and include fever, sore throat, wheezing, rales, headache and rhinorrhoea with round-glass pulmonary opacifications shadowing in X-ray. Many antiviral drugs show efficacy but only in mild to moderate infection levels. Though efforts on development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been started earlier as soon as the pandemic was emerged, till date no effective drug or vaccine has been validated with significant efficacy against the disease; therefore, there is a dire need to design effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple vaccine candidates are still in evaluation and exploratory stages on different clinical models with potential results on different animals and human models. mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Ad5-nCoV, INO-4800, LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC are the most advanced and potential drug candidates against COVID-19. Recent studies have revealed any attractive vaccine candidates as promising therapeutic agents based on different strategies of vaccines. Here, the rationale of this review was also to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of the virus and summarize the updated potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Mahrosh, Hafiza Salaha; Mustafa, Ghulam",Environ Dev Sustain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01224-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551672/,316

621284,Calf Clinical Model of Cryptosporidiosis for Efficacy Evaluation of Therapeutics,2019-08-27,"BACKGROUND: An epidemic of COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. The ordinary medical services were hindered. However, the emergency cases, including aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), still required timely intervention. Thus, it provoked challenges to the routine management protocol. In this study, we summarized our experience in the emergency management of aSAH (Beijing Tiantan Protocol, BTP) in Beijing, China. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and imaging data of consecutive emergency aSAH patients who underwent craniotomy clipping during the COVID-19 epidemic season were reviewed and compared with the retrospective period last year. Subgroup analysis was further performed to assess the outcomes of different screening results and several detailed protocols. Neurological outcomes were evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: A total of 127 aSAH were referred to our emergency department, and 42 (33.1%) underwent craniotomy clipping between January 20, 2020, and March 25, 2020. The incidence of preoperative hospitalized adverse events and the perioperative outcomes were similar (− 0.1, 95% CI − 1.0 to 0.8, P = 0.779) to the retrospective period last year (January 2019–March 2019). After the propensity score matching (PSM), there were still no statistical differences in prognostic parameters between the two groups. Eight (19.0%) of the 42 individuals were initially screened as preliminary undetermined COVID-19 cases, in which 2 of them underwent craniotomy clipping in the negative pressure operating room (OR). The prognosis of patients with varied COVID-19 screening results was similar (F(2, 39) = 0.393, P = 0.678). Since February 28, 12 cases (28.6%) received COVID-19 nucleic acid testing (NAT) upon admission, and all showed negative. The false-negative rate was 0.0%. The preoperative hospitalized adverse events and postoperative prognosis were still similar between patients with and without COVID-19 NAT (− 0.3, 95% CI − 1.4 to 0.9, P = 0.653). CONCLUSIONS: Our emergency surgery management protocol (BTP) is reliable for scheduling emergency aneurysm craniotomy clipping in non-major epidemic areas.","Chen, Yu; Chen, Xiaolin; Ma, Li; Deng, Xiaofeng; Li, Zelin; Ye, Xun; Wang, Hao; Kang, Shuai; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Rong; Zhang, Dong; Cao, Yong; Zhao, Yuanli; Wang, Shuo; Zhao, Jizong",Chin Neurosurg J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349249/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41016-020-00217-x,316

Primary safety endpoint: Decrease in haemoglobin of 2 g/dl or more; Transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells; Bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal]; Bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); Bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention. Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Each of these events will be analysed as a binary outcome and as a time-to-event one. Secondary safety endpoint: 1. Any bleeding compromising hemodynamic. 2. Spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, or 100 cm2 if there was a traumatic cause. 3. Intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography. 4.

Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Each of these events will be analysed as a binary outcome and as a time-to-event one. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation (with a 1:1 randomisation ratio) will be centrally performed by using a secure, web-based system, which will be developed by the Methodological and Statistical Unit at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Modena. Randomisation stratified by 4 factors: 1) Gender (M/F); 2) Age (<75/≥75 years); 3) BMI (<30/≥30); 4) Comorbidities (0-1/>2) with random variable block sizes will be generated by STATA software. The web-based system will guarantee the allocation concealment. Blinding (masking) The study is conceived as open-label: patients and all health-care personnel involved in the study will be aware of the assigned group. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that LMWH administered at high doses versus low doses will significantly reduce the risk of clinical worsening. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.

623072,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia-Induced Humoral Immunosuppression: A Systematic Review,2020-11-02,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the current world health concern, presenting a public health dilemma with ascending morbidity and mortality rates exceeding any previous viral spread, without a standard effective treatment yet. SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinguished with multiple epidemiological and pathological features, one of them being the elevated levels of cytokine release, which in turn trigger an aberrant uncontrolled response known as “cytokine storm”. This phenomenon contributes to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure, which is considered a major contributor to COVID-19-associated fatality rates. Taking into account that the vast majority of the COVID-19 cases are aggravated by the respiratory and multiorgan failure triggered by the sustained release of cytokines, implementing therapeutics that alleviate or diminish the upregulated inflammatory response would provide a therapeutic advantage to COVID-19 patients. Indeed, dexamethasone, a widely available and inexpensive corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory effects, has shown a great promise in reducing mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we have critically compared the clinical impact of several potential therapeutic agents that could block or interfere with the cytokine storm, such as IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, mast cell targeting agents, and corticosteroids. This work focused on highlighting and contrasting the current success and limitations towards the involvement of these agents in future treatment protocols.","Abdin, Shifaa M.; Elgendy, Sara M.; Alyammahi, Shatha K.; Alhamad, Dima W.; Omar, Hany A.",Life Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520308055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663575/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520308055; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118054,316
623227,Identification of a Novel HIF-1α-α(M)β(2) Integrin-NET Axis in Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease,2020-10-15,"Abstract Dual infections of pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) followed by a second common respiratory virus, either porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SIV), were studied. The aim was to determine if dual infections, as compared to single virus infections, result in enhanced clinical manifestations. It was also examined if PRRSV replication affects replication of PRCV or SIV in the respiratory tract. Groups of conventional 10 week old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-only (3 pigs), PRCV-only (4 pigs) or SIV-only (4 pigs). Dual inoculations with PRRSV-PRCV (4 pigs) and PRRSV-SIV (3 groups of 4, 4 and 5 pigs) were performed at a 3 day interval. A group of uninoculated control pigs (8 pigs) was included. The infection with PRRSV-only induced a transient fever (40.2°C) at 2 DPI, but no respiratory signs. The PRCV-only infection remained subclinical. The SIV-only infection resulted in a one day fever (40.1°C) with moderate tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Mean weight gain in the virus-inoculated groups was retarded compared with the control group. The PRRSV-PRCV infection induced a 9 day lasting fever (peak 40.9°C) with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and productive coughing. The PRRSV-SIV infection resulted in fever and respiratory signs in all 3 groups. Clinical signs, however, were more pronounced in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Pigs of group 1 showed fever during 10 days (peak 41.4°C), tachypnoea, marked dyspnoea with abdominal breathing, and a productive cough. Pigs of groups 2 and 3 had fever for 5 and 3 days (peaks 40.6 and 40.3°C) respectively and mild respiratory disorders. Mean weight gain during 14 DPI of the 2nd virus was 5.9 kg in the PRRSV-PRCV group and 4.0, 6.8 and 6.7 kg in PRRSV-SIV groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean weight gain during the corresponding period in the PRRSV-only group was 8.6 kg. It was concluded that dual infections with viruses causes more severe disease and growth retardation than single PRRSV infection. PRCV excretion curves were similar in single and dual virus inoculated groups. Excretion of SIV was delayed by 2 days in the dual inoculated pigs. Thus, replication of the second virus is not (PRCV) or only slightly (SIV) affected by a prior infection with PRRSV.","Van Reeth, Kristien; Nauwynck, Hans; Pensaert, Maurice",Veterinary Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359500145X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359500145X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9054128/,316
623295,"Examining the inclusion of patients and their family members in infection prevention and control policies and guidelines across Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea",2020-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic valve disease (RVD) is the most common cause of cardiovascular death in low-middle income nations. Surgical aortic valve (AV) interventions for RVD, especially in children, have proven problematic with graft failure, relapse, and poor compliance with anticoagulation. A novel technique involving neocuspidization of the aortic annulus using autologous pericardium to construct new AV leaflets (the Ozaki procedure) has shown promising outcomes in children with congenital AV disease; however, there are no previous recorded cases using this technique in children with RVD. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 15-year-old male presenting with exertional angina and dyspnoea with a background of previous rheumatic fever. Echocardiography had shown a regurgitant tricuspid AV, left ventricular dilatation with mitral valve leaflet tethering. The patient underwent the Ozaki procedure for his AV regurgitation and was discharged following an uneventful post-operative recovery. The patient had full resolution of symptoms following the procedure and remains well 3 years following his operation. DISCUSSION: This case highlights that good outcomes with the Ozaki procedure in RVD are possible 3-years post-operatively and should prompt future studies to evaluate the procedure as a surgical option for paediatric patients in this clinical context. Additionally, the Ozaki procedure may also provide a cost-effective surgical technique requiring minimal additional operative resources and reduced follow-up demand, which would be critical in low-resource clinical settings where RVD is prevalent.","Asif, Ashar; Benedetto, Umberto; Ofoe, Victor; Caputo, Massimo",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34263116/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab170,316
623749,A Research on the Results of Viral Nucleic Acid Tests and CT Imaging Variation of Patients with COVID-19,2020-05-12,"The present study aimed to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress response in reaction to the COVID-19, including posttraumatic-stress-disorder-like symptoms (PTSD-like symptoms) and depressive symptoms, among patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness. The socio-demographic and psychological correlates of PTSD-like symptoms were also examined. A total of 193 participants were recruited. More than 45% of the respondents reported significant PTSD-like symptoms related to the COVID-19; this group of patients also had a high level of pandemic-related depressive symptoms. High level of PTSD-like symptoms were predicted by rumination on concerns about the outbreak of COVID-19 and feeling of social isolation. They were also associated with hypervigilance to cues related to the pandemic. Our results suggested that the pandemic had taken a psychological toll on people living with psychiatric illness. Further research is needed to understand the development and mechanism of traumatic stress reaction in response to a prolonged infectious disease outbreak among this vulnerable population. Clinical attention is also called to mitigate the psychiatric sequalae of the pandemic in this vulnerable group of people.","Ting, Travis C.M.; Wong, Agatha W.S.; Liu, W.S.; Leung, Flora L.T.; Ng, Michael T.",Psychiatry Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178121003620?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178121003620; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198215/,316

However, owing to debates regarding the distinction between Esports and video gaming and the potential negative effects of engaging in Esports, its development in Hong Kong is still in its infancy. Therefore, this qualitative study investigated the perceptions and attitudes of teenagers and young adults toward Esports development and engagement, using the theory of planned behavior. Twenty-five teenagers and young adults (male = 24, female =1) participated in this study, with their ages ranging from 15 to 29 years. Our results revealed the views of Hong Kong teenagers and young adults on the beneficial and deleterious outcomes (goal setting and achievement, physical health, socialization and teamwork, psychological benefits, academics and time distribution, physical strain, negative social image, and perception toward sport participation), subjective norms (parents, peers, teachers, and modeling effect), and barriers and facilitators (balance between academics and Esports, capability, career prospects and future reality, psychological benefits, and peer encouragement and support) of participating in Esports. Additionally, the results of this qualitative study may contribute toward a deeper understanding of Hong Kong Esports players to develop a theory of planned behavior construct for capturing the beliefs and perceptions of Hong Kong teenagers toward Esports.","Wong, Ming Yu Claudia; Chung, Pak-Kwong; Ou, Kailing; Leung, Ka-Man",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.650000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305718/,316

METHODS 1377 patients with RMD who received two-dose SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccination between 16 December 2020 and April 15, 2021 completed questionnaires detailing local and systemic reactions experienced within 7 days of each vaccine dose (D1, D2), and one month after D2 detailing flare of RMD. Associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and flare requiring treatment were evaluated using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS 11 percent reported flare requiring treatment; there were no reports of severe flares. Flare was associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (IRR 2.09, p=0.02), flare in the six months preceding vaccination (IRR 2.36, p<0.001) and use of combination immunomodulatory therapy (IRR 1.95, p<0.001). The most frequently reported local and systemic reactions included injection site pain (D1 87%, D2 86%) and fatigue (D1 60%, D2 80%); reactogenicity increased after D2, particularly for systemic reactions. No allergic reactions or SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses were reported. CONCLUSION Flare of underlying RMD following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was uncommon. There were no reports of severe flare. Local and systemic reactions typically did not interfere with daily activity.

Despite these intensive research efforts, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation in many countries present substantial obstacles to achieving sufficient coverage and community immunity. Here, we report the findings of a survey regarding the likelihood of COVID‐19 vaccine acceptance in a sample of physicians in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous web‐based survey was prepared and sent to medical doctors randomly selected from seven parts of Turkey via a text message sent to their mobile phones. Demographic data were collected, including sex (male or female), medical specialty, age, professional experience, COVID‐19 history, knowledge of COVID‐19 vaccines and behaviours related to vaccines against COVID‐19 and other diseases. The survey was conducted over a 1‐week period in December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,557 medical doctors responded to the survey. A total of 1,065 (68.4%) respondents were considering COVID‐19 vaccination, 374 (24%) were undecided and 118 (7.6%) did not want to be vaccinated. As a result of multivariate analysis, the male gender, absence of history of COVID‐19 infection, and having sufficient information about the vaccine were determined as predictive factors for willingness to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Although trials tend to focus on the efficacy of vaccines, the results of this study indicated that the most important factor affecting the preference for a given vaccine among Turkish physicians is safety.","Civelek, Burak; Yazici, Ozan; Ozdemir, Nuriye; Karacin, Cengiz; Surel, Aziz Ahmet",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037294/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14399,316

Health Canada, for example, through their online database, has facilitated the process of reporting side effects relating to drugs and medical devices. However, several patients and health care professionals still fail to voluntarily report adverse events. For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, apathy, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an ADR. In the current COVID-19 Crisis, it is especially important for health care providers to be diligent about reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), since misinformation propagated by the media is causing patients to misuse certain medications. We need to shift the current thought process about ADR reporting in order to encourage a positive reporting culture by patients and health care providers.","Elbeddini, Ali; Yeats, Aniko; Lee, Stephanie",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-020-00219-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454982/,316

This study aims to assess the socio-economic burden of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy through the estimation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and productivity loss. The observational study was based on data from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million. This evaluation does not consider other economic aspects related to lockdown, quarantine of contacts, healthcare direct costs etc. The burden of disease methodology is functional metric for steering choices of health policy and allowing the government to be accountable for the utilization of resources.","Nurchis, Mario Cesare; Pascucci, Domenico; Sapienza, Martina; Villani, Leonardo; D’Ambrosio, Floriana; Castrini, Francesco; Specchia, Maria Lucia; Laurenti, Patrizia; Damiani, Gianfranco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32545827/,316

625274,Intergovernmental Relations in the UK: Time for a Radical Overhaul?,2020-06-14,"PURPOSE: The high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the need for multiple studies identifying the molecular mechanisms that facilitate the viral entry and propagation. Currently the potential extra-respiratory transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. METHODS: Using single-cell RNA Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets and immunohistochemical analysis, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the embryonic, fetal and adult human ocular surface. RESULTS: The co-expression of ACE2 receptor and entry protease TMPRSS2 was detected in the human adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium, but not in the embryonic and fetal ocular surface up to 21 post conception weeks. These expression patterns were corroborated by the single cell ATAC-Seq data, which revealed a permissive chromatin in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 loci in the adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium. Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was strongly detected in the superficial limbal, corneal and conjunctival epithelium, implicating these as target entry cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface. Strikingly, we also identified the key pro-inflammatory signals TNF, NFKβ and IFNG as upstream regulators of the transcriptional profile of ACE2(+)TMPRSS2(+) cells in the superficial conjunctival epithelium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilise inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression to enhance infection in ocular surface. CONCLUSIONS: Together our data indicate that the human ocular surface epithelium provides an additional entry portal for SARS-CoV-2, which may exploit inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry factors to enhance infection.","Collin, Joseph; Queen, Rachel; Zerti, Darin; Dorgau, Birthe; Georgiou, Maria; Djidrovski, Ivo; Hussain, Rafiqul; Coxhead, Jonathan M.; Joseph, Agatha; Rooney, Paul; Lisgo, Steven; Figueiredo, Francisco; Armstrong, Lyle; Lako, Majlinda",Ocul Surf,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtos.2020.05.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542012420300975?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542012420300975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502616/,316

Patients diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are subject to a higher risk for worse outcomes from COVID-19, due to the high prevalence of coexistent comorbidities. Additionally, treatment with positive airway treatment devices (PAP) can also be challenging because of the greater transfer of PAP-induced droplets and aerosol. In this context, sleep medicine practices are entering a new era and need to adapt rapidly in these circumstances, so as to provide the best care for patients with SDB.

626218,Systemic inflammation as fuel for acute liver injury in COVID-19,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare aims to promote good health and yet demonstrably contributes to climate change, which is purported to be ‘the biggest global health threat of the 21st century’. This is happening now, with healthcare as an industry representing 4.4% of global carbon dioxide emissions. MAIN BODY: Climate change promotes health deficits from many angles; however, primarily it is the use of fossil fuels which increases atmospheric carbon dioxide (also nitrous oxide, and methane). These greenhouse gases prevent the earth from cooling, resulting in the higher temperatures and rising sea levels, which then cause ‘wild weather’ patterns, including floods, storms, and droughts. Particular vulnerability is afforded to those already health compromised (older people, pregnant women, children, wider health co-morbidities) as well as populations closer to equatorial zones, which encompasses many low-and-middle-income-countries. The paradox here, is that poorer nations by spending less on healthcare, have lower carbon emissions from health-related activity, and yet will suffer most from global warming effects, with scant resources to off-set the increasing health care needs. Global recognition has forged the Paris agreement, the United Nations sustainable developments goals, and the World Health Organisation climate change action plan. It is agreed that most healthcare impact comes from consumption of energy and resources, and the production of greenhouse gases into the environment. Many professional associations of medicine and allied health professionals are advocating for their members to lead on environmental sustainability; the Australian Podiatry Association is incorporating climate change into its strategic direction. CONCLUSION: Podiatrists, as allied health professionals, have wide community engagement, and hence, can model positive environmental practices, which may be effective in changing wider community behaviours, as occurred last century when doctors stopped smoking. As foot health consumers, our patients are increasingly likely to expect more sustainable practices and products, including ‘green footwear’ options. Green Podiatry, as a part of sustainable healthcare, directs us to be responsible energy and product consumers, and reduce our workplace emissions.","Evans, Angela Margaret",J Foot Ankle Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-021-00483-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130735/,316
626978,Low Levels of Mannan-Binding Lectin or Ficolins Are Not Associated with an Increased Risk of Cytomegalovirus Disease in HIV-Infected Patients,2013-01-04,"BACKGROUND: Challenges in the clinical differentiation of viral and/or bacterial respiratory infection lead to the misappropriation of antibiotics and increased healthcare costs. A tool to facilitate rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) differentiation is needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, single center, blinded, observational clinical trial was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from December 2012 to August 2013 to determine the accuracy of a POC immunoassay to identify a clinically significant immune response to viral and/or bacterial infection. Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. A venous blood sample was collected. An ELISA was used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology. In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific. However, the pattern of results in a rapid immunoassay provides a sensitive and specific method to differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections. This diagnostic information may help reduce antibiotic misuse and resistance and lower healthcare costs.","Sambursky, Robert; Shapiro, Nathan",Eur Clin Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26672961/; https://doi.org/10.3402/ecrj.v2.28245,316

However, the function of OAS1 within microglia was not known. Using genotyping from 1313 individuals with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease and 1234 control individuals, we confirm the OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease. The same OAS1 locus has been recently associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, linking risk for both diseases. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1131454(A) and rs4766676(T) are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and rs10735079(A) and rs6489867(T) are associated with severe COVID-19, where the risk alleles are linked with decreased OAS1 expression. Analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data of myeloid cells from Alzheimer’s disease and COVID-19 patients, we identify co-expression networks containing interferon (IFN)-responsive genes, including OAS1, which are significantly upregulated with age and both diseases. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia with lowered OAS1 expression, we show exaggerated production of TNF-α with IFN-γ stimulation, indicating OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of myeloid cells. Collectively, our data support a link between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and susceptibility to critical illness with COVID-19 centred on OAS1, a finding with potential implications for future treatments of Alzheimer’s disease and COVID-19, and development of biomarkers to track disease progression.","Magusali, Naciye; Graham, Andrew C; Piers, Thomas M; Panichnantakul, Pantila; Yaman, Umran; Shoai, Maryam; Reynolds, Regina H; Botia, Juan A; Brookes, Keeley J; Guetta-Baranes, Tamar; Bellou, Eftychia; Bayram, Sevinc; Sokolova, Dimitra; Ryten, Mina; Sala Frigerio, Carlo; Escott-Price, Valentina; Morgan, Kevin; Pocock, Jennifer M; Hardy, John; Salih, Dervis A",Brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34619763/; https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab337,316

Therefore, the question arose whether these effects also occur when a fear stimulus, like the COVID-19 pandemic, affects otherwise healthy adolescents. Boredom is closely linked to symptoms of fear and anxiety, but the connection between PA, boredom and fear is partly unclear. METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted that involved 122 students. Participants were 13–19 years old (M(age) = 15.83, SD = 1.73). The survey was available online from April 27th to May 3rd, 2020. At this time, schools in Germany had already been closed for 6 weeks. A self-report questionnaire was used to measure physical activity, boredom, and fear of COVID-19. A multiple linear regression model was conducted. RESULTS: The reported fear of COVID-19 significantly correlates with total PA, quantity of strenuous PA, and boredom. Furthermore, a significant regression equation was found. The variables boredom, PA, and age contribute significantly to predicting the fear of COVID-19 [R(2) = 0.127, F(3,118) = 6.876, p < 0.000], among adolescents. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there is an association between PA, boredom and the quarantine experience of adolescents.

630832,Severe COVID-19 virus reactivation following treatment for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus is an evidence-based intervention. The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT. AIMS: This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression. METHODS: A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken. RESULTS: Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group. CONCLUSION: Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this.","Beukes, Eldré W.; Andersson, Gerhard; Fagelson, Marc A.; Manchaiah, Vinaya",Internet Interv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040997/,316

Design This was a qualitative study of cross-sectional design. Rehabilitation practitioners completed semi-structured interviews via Zoom. Transcribed interviews were analyzed for themes. Setting With the onset of COVID-19, rehabilitation practitioners quickly adapted and started offering telerehabilitation services where they interacted directly with the client and evaluate, diagnose, and treat their condition virtually. These services differed from prior methods of telehealth, where healthcare practitioners delivered care from one healthcare facility to another. Practitioners from both public and private clinics shifted their services to virtual platforms quickly to provide continued care to patients needing acute and prolonged rehabilitation care. Participants Twenty-four rehabilitation practitioners were recruited to participate in the study (14 physiotherapists, 4 occupational therapists, 2 speech language pathologists, 1 psychologist, 1 kinesiologist, 1 social worker, 1 orthopedic surgeon) from rural and urban clinics as well as private and publicly funded practices. Inclusion criteria required practitioners to have transitioned to telerehabilitation, either through video conferencing or telephone. Interventions N/A. Main Outcome Measures N/A. Results The overarching theme which emerged from the data was providing continued access to care. Rehabilitation practitioners quickly transitioned to using the telephone or video conferencing platforms such as Zoom to connect with clients. Multiple subthemes emerged allowing for a better understanding of the transition to telerehabilitation during COVID-19. Barriers to offering telerehabilitation services included adequate access to technology (computer, laptop, tablet) and IT support for the client and sufficient internet bandwidth. Limited availability of validated virtual assessments made the transition difficult for practitioners. However, many benefits emerged such as easier scheduling of interdisciplinary meetings, increased client accountability, better access to group programming, and decreased travel times to clinics. Conclusions Although there were challenges, especially surrounding technology, the switch to telerehabilitation had many benefits and could be a viable method of delivering care that goes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

631334,Survival and outcomes after lung transplantation for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases,2021-03-23,"The immunostimulatory effects of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN) in certain base contexts have been extensively studied in man and mice. One major action is their ability to trigger production of massive amounts of interferon-α (IFN-α) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), also referred to as natural IFN-α/β producing cells (NIPC). The present study using porcine PBMC activated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA revealed a considerable variation in the IFN-α production in response to various CpG-ODN constructs. Several phosphodiester ODNs, such as 5′ TTTTCAATTCGAAGATGAAT 3′ (ODN H), and the plasmid pcDNA3 all required pre-incubation with lipofectin in order to induce IFN-α. Intact unmethylated CpGs were also important, because methylation or substitution of the cytosines and CpG-inversion strongly reduced the IFN-α induction by single- or double-stranded forms of ODN H. Certain CpG-ODNs that contained flanking phosphorothioate or phosphodiester poly-G sequences were potent inducers of IFN-α without pre-incubation with lipofectin, for instance the ODN 2216 (5′ GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGGG 3′). While poly-G sequences have been suggested to increase uptake of ODNs by cells, they did not obviate the need for lipofectin when added to the ODN H. However, they resulted in up to five-fold increases of the IFN-α levels caused by ODN H upon lipofection, indicating other enhancing effects of poly-G sequences on the induction of IFN-α. The identity of the IFN-α producing cells (IPC) stimulated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA was studied by means of flow cytometry using combined staining for intracellular IFN-α and surface markers. Approximately 1–3 IPC/10(3) PBMC were detected, compared to only 3 IPC/10(4) PBMC stimulated by Aujeszky’s disease virus. The IPC frequencies were confirmed by detection of IFN-α mRNA positive cells by in situ hybridisation. The IPC induced by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA had a similar phenotype, expressing CD2 and CD4 and intermediate levels of MHC class II and the myeloid marker SWC3, but not the markers of T and B cells or monocytes (CD3, CD21 and CD14). Consequently, porcine IPC that respond to CpG-DNA seem to correspond to the PDC/NIPC.","Domeika, Kristina; Magnusson, Mattias; Eloranta, Maija-Leena; Fuxler, Lisbeth; Alm, Gunnar V.; Fossum, Caroline",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704001333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15261695/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704001333,316
631455,Is traditional Chinese medicine useful in the treatment of SARS?,2003-08-07,"Abstract A plaque mutant was isolated from Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/c cells persistently infected with a mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-S. While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32°, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39°, and at 32°, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39° of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39°. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques. Protease appears to play an important role in MHV-induced cell fusion in general.","Yoshikura, H.; Tejima, S.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682281901781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6267795/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682281901781,316

Methods: A survey was conducted among private healthcare workers to ascertain their views on the potential resources that can be accessed from the private sector and methods to do the same. Results: There were 213 respondents, 80% of them being doctors. Nearly half (47.4%) felt that the contribution from the private medical sector has been suboptimal. Areas suggested for improved contributions by the private sector related to patient care (71.8%) and provision of equipment (62.4%), with fewer expectations (39.9%) on the research front. Another area of deemed support was maintaining continuity of care for non-COVID patients using virtual consultation services (77.4%), tele-consultation being the preferred option (60%). 58.2% felt that the Government had not involved the private sector adequately; and 45.1% felt they should be part of policy-making. Conclusion: A streamlined pathway to facilitate the private sector to join hands with the public sector for a national cause is the need of the hour. Through our study, we have identified gaps in the current contribution by the private sector and identified areas in which they could contribute, by their own admission.","Davalbhakta, Samira; Sharma, Supriya; Gupta, Shefali; Agarwal, Vishwesh; Pandey, Gaurav; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Naik, Bijaya Nanda; Goel, Ashish; Gupta, Latika; Agarwal, Vikas",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194971/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.571419,316

METHODS In this study, 511 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Information about 31 deceased and 480 recovered COVID-19 patients was obtained from the hospital information management system and analyzed retrospectively. Whether there was a correlation between coagulation parameters between the mortal and nonmortal patients was analyzed. Descriptive analyses on general characteristics of the study population were performed. Visual (probability plots and histograms) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test) were used to test the normal distribution. Analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software package. RESULTS Out of 511 patients, 219 (42.9%) were females and 292 (57.1%) were males. There was no statistically significant difference between males and females in terms of mortality (p=0.521). In total, the median age was 67 (22). The median age was 74 (13) in the nonsurvivor group and 67 (22) in the survivor group, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.007). The D-dimer, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, neutrophil, and lymphocyte median age values with p-values, in the recovered and deceased patient groups were: 1070 (2129), 1990 (7513) μg FEU/L, p=0.005; 12.6 (2.10), 13.3 (2.1), p=0.014; 1.17 (0.21), 1.22 (0.19), p=0.028; 5.51 (6.15), 8.54 (7.05), p=0.001; and 0.99 (0.96), 0.64 (0.84), p=0.037, respectively, with statistically significant differences.

We investigated how strongly inflammatory biomarkers (FeNO, eosinophils, neutrophils, and cytokines in nasal lavage fluid) and lung function parameters change upon rhinovirus 16 infection, in order to explore their potential use for infection detection. To this end, within a longitudinal cohort study, healthy and mildly asthmatic volunteers were experimentally inoculated with rhinovirus 16, and time series of these parameters/biomarkers were systematically recorded and compared between the pre- and post-infection phases of the study, which lasted two months and one month, respectively. We found that the parameters’/biomarkers’ ability to discriminate between the infected and the uninfected state varied over the observation time period. Consistently over time, the concentration of cytokines, in nasal lavage fluid, showed moderate to very good discrimination performance, thereby qualifying for disease progression monitoring, whereas lung function and FeNO, while quickly and non-invasively measurable using cheap portable devices (e.g., at airports), performed poorly.","Sinha, Anirban; Lutter, René; Dekker, Tamara; Dierdorp, Barbara; J.

Little is known about how liking expression is linked and regulated by personality traits and communication motives. Following a preliminary survey (n = 168) about the usage of the like function on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform, we conducted an online study (n = 183) to map the Big-Five personality traits and five communication motives to the frequency (likelihood) of liking expression. The results showed that each user had, on average, 385 WeChat friends and spent 2.2 hours and used the liking function 1.1 times each day on WeChat. The personality trait conscientiousness was negatively related to the liking expression (β = −0.505, p < 0.05). In contrast, agreeableness promoted the expression of liking directly (β = 0.153, p < 0.05) and indirectly via two communication motives, enjoyment (a: β = 0.377, p < 0.01; b: β = 0.433, p < 0.001) and passing time (c: β = 0.578, p < 0.05; d: β = 0.523, p < 0.001).

False information and variations in interpretations about the pandemic and mitigation interventions/strategies continue to spread at a faster pace than the relevant scientific evidence. The WHO has called for a fight against this infodemic, describing it as the most contagious aspect of the pandemic. In this era of rapid information exchange, public health measures, and state interventions to control the pandemic, a contextual understanding of how information is communicated and shared is important for uncovering possible reasons for action or inaction by the general public. With the Lebanese state scrambling to implement and enforce different measures to control and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, adherence by the general public is not uniform. In this paper, we refer to social science and risk communication theory to discuss how the political, economic and social contexts in the country, and not only the content of the messages that people receive from officials, affect how they interpret and act on information. We highlight how this has played out in Lebanon and identify societal aspects of importance in a low-middle income country fraught with social, economic and political inequalities which continue to undermine the efforts to contain the spread. Implications to inform state response in the context of low-middle income countries are also discussed.","Makhoul, Jihad; Kabakian-Khasholian, Tamar; Chaiban, Lea",Glob Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975920984178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472532/,316

636256,Transient CD4-cell-depletion therapy for HIV/AIDS cure,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus is entrenched in poultry in Asia and Africa and continues to infect humans zoonotically causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. There is evidence that the virus may sometimes spread beyond respiratory tract to cause disseminated infection. The primary target cell for HPAI H5N1 virus in human lung is the alveolar epithelial cell. Alveolar epithelium and its adjacent lung microvascular endothelium form host barriers to the initiation of infection and dissemination of influenza H5N1 infection in humans. These are polarized cells and the polarity of influenza virus entry and egress as well as the secretion of cytokines and chemokines from the virus infected cells are likely to be central to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. AIM: To study influenza A (H5N1) virus replication and host innate immune responses in polarized primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells and its relevance to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. METHODS: We use an in vitro model of polarized primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells grown in transwell culture inserts to compare infection with influenza A subtype H1N1 and H5N1 viruses via the apical or basolateral surfaces. RESULTS: We demonstrate that both influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses efficiently infect alveolar epithelial cells from both apical and basolateral surface of the epithelium but release of newly formed virus is mainly from the apical side of the epithelium. In contrast, influenza H5N1 virus, but not H1N1 virus, efficiently infected polarized microvascular endothelial cells from both apical and basolateral aspects. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how H5N1 virus may infect the lung from systemic circulation. Epidemiological evidence has implicated ingestion of virus-contaminated foods as the source of infection in some instances and our data suggests that viremia, secondary to, for example, gastro-intestinal infection, can potentially lead to infection of the lung. HPAI H5N1 virus was a more potent inducer of cytokines (e.g. IP-10, RANTES, IL-6) in comparison to H1N1 virus in alveolar epithelial cells, and these virus-induced chemokines were secreted onto both the apical and basolateral aspects of the polarized alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSION: The predilection of viruses for different routes of entry and egress from the infected cell is important in understanding the pathogenesis of influenza H5N1 infection and may help unravel the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.","Chan, Michael CW; Chan, Renee WY; Yu, Wendy CL; Ho, Carol CC; Chui, WH; Lo, CK; Yuen, Kit M; Guan, Yi; Nicholls, John M; Peiris, JS Malik",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19874627/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-102,316

Whilst a community action approach is advocated, what the public know and understand about advance care planning is unknown. AIM: To assess public awareness, knowledge and attitudes towards advance care planning and identify strategies to raise awareness within a public health framework. DESIGN: Sequential mixed methods comprising a cross-sectional survey and focus group/interviews. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A random representative sample of adults from one region of the United Kingdom (n = 1201; response rate 56%) completed a face-to-face survey. Twenty-five participants consented to an additional focus group/interview held in a secure accessible location or via telephone. RESULTS: Most participants (78.7%) acknowledged the benefits of advance care planning conversations, however, two thirds did not want to think about advance care planning or find out more at present. Respondents were reluctant to broach advance care planning as it was linked to end of life care and funeral plans, and they did not wish to cause distress to their loved one. Respondents trusted their family to respect their wishes and they considered having an advance care plan in place would be of assistance in the future. Top-down leadership, normalisation, and increased education were identified as potential approaches to overcome barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Advance care planning was recognised as important despite limited awareness, lack of knowledge and misperceptions. Whilst a community action approach to enhance understanding and engagement was supported, a ‘one size fits all’ approach will not work; rather bespoke targeting is required with educational and media messaging aligned.","McIlfatrick, Sonja; Slater, Paul; Bamidele, Olufikayo; Muldrew, Deborah; Beck, Esther; Hasson, Felicity",Palliat Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211015838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000901/,316

Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. The Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.22%, far higher than those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicentre retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 584 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes was performed. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analysed as a risk factor. Results In this study, 27.4% of cases presented a mild course, 42.1% a moderate one and for 30.5% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63). Almost 60 % (59.8%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19, and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a better prognosis. The angiotensin II receptor blocker use was associated with a more severe course. Conclusions Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and the clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for the hampering of immune system effectors. The adaptive immunity would become exhausted and a strong but ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used by hypertensive patients have a protective effect in regards to COVID-19 severity in our series. Conversely, patients on angiotensin II receptor blockers showed a severer disease.","Jurado, Aurora; Martín, María C; Abad-Molina, Cristina; Orduña, Antonio; Martínez, Alba; Ocaña, Esther; Yarce, Oscar; Navas, Ana M; Trujillo, Antonio; Fernández, Luis; Vergara, Esther; Rodríguez, Beatriz; Quirant, Bibiana; Martínez-Cáceres, Eva; Hernández, Manuel; Perurena-Prieto, Janire; Gil, Juana; Cantenys, Sergi; González-Martínez, Gema; Martínez-Saavedra, María T; Rojo, Ricardo; Marco, Francisco M; Mora, Sergio; Ontañón, Jesús; López-Hoyos, Marcos; Ocejo-Vinyals, Gonzalo; Melero, Josefa; Aguilar, Marta; Almeida, Delia; Medina, Silvia; Vegas, María C; Jiménez, Yesenia; Prada, Álvaro; Monzón, David; Boix, Francisco; Cunill, Vanesa; Molina, Juan",Immunity & ageing : I & A,https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12979-020-00194-w; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00194-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802142/,316

There are many point mutations among SARS-CoV genome sequences. Previous studies suggested that the mutations are correlated closely with the SARS epidemic. It was found that the bases of six nucleotide positions (nt9404, nt9479, nt19838, nt21721, nt22222 and nt27827) with high-mutation rate have an important relationship with the SARS epidemic. For viral detection as well as genotyping, a universal microarray system was developed that combines RT-PCR and ligase detection reaction (LDR). The Zip Codes attached covalently to a slide remain constant and their complementary Zip Codes (cZip Codes) can be used for tagging target sequence, making the microarrays universal. The discriminating oligonucleotides contain on the 5′ end “cZip Codes” that are used to direct LDR product to specific Zip Codes attached covalently to a slide. Since Zip Codes have no homology to either the target sequence or to other sequences in the genomes of both human host and SARS-CoV, there was no false signal due to mismatch hybridizations. 20 samples assayed with the universal microarray were confirmed by DNA sequencing, demonstrating that this microarray system is a promising diagnostic tool for detection and genotyping of the SARS-CoV.","Long, Wei-Hong; Xiao, Hua-Sheng; Gu, Xiao-Mei; Zhang, Qing-Hua; Yang, Hong-Jun; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Liu, Jian-Hua",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093404001624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093404001624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15350733/,316
637342,Identification of Barriers to Access Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Health Care System of Mexico: Results From a National Survey Among Endovascular Neurologists,2021-02-09,"Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases endangering the health of humans, especially young children and the elderly. Although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza, frequent mutations in viral surface antigens, low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly, slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines. Adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines; however, no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the United States. In this study, we found that a novel adjuvant, rOv-ASP-1, co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation, substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model. rOv-ASP-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine, allowing antigen-sparring by 10-fold. The rOv-ASP-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger Th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum. Importantly, rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 is an effective adjuvant that: 1) accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine; 2) allows for antigen sparing; and 3) augments a Th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain.","Jiang, Jiu; Fisher, Erin M.; Hensley, Scott E.; Lustigman, Sara; Murasko, Donna M.; Shen, Hao",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.03.046; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14004150; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4080630?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681229/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14004150,316
637858,Lymphopenia and neutrophilia in SARS are related to the prevailing serum cortisol,2004-05-17,"The indiscriminate consumption of antimalarials against coronavirus disease-2019 emphasizes the longstanding clinical weapons of medicines. In this work, we conducted a review on the antitumor mechanisms of aminoquinolines, focusing on the responses and differences of tumor histological tissues and toxicity related to pharmacokinetics. This well-defined analysis shows similar mechanistic forms triggered by aminoquinolines in different histological tumor tissues and under coexposure conditions, although different pharmacological potencies also occur. These molecules are lysosomotropic amines that increase the antiproliferative action of chemotherapeutic agents, mainly by cell cycle arrest, histone acetylation, physiological changes in tyrosine kinase metabolism, inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, cyclin D1, E2F1, angiogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, triggering of ATM-ATR/p53/p21 signaling, apoptosis, and presentation of tumor peptides. Their chemo/radiotherapy sensitization effects may be an adjuvant option against solid tumors, since 4-aminoquinolines induce lysosomal-mediated programmed cytotoxicity of cancer cells and accumulation of key markers, predominantly, LAMP1, p62/SQSTM1, LC3 members, GAPDH, beclin-1/Atg6, α-synuclein, and granules of lipofuscin. Adverse effects are dose-dependent, though most common with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, amodiaquine, and other aminoquinolines are gastrointestinal changes, blurred vision ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, QTc prolongation, severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness, and retinopathy, and they are more common with chloroquine than with hydroxychloroquine and amodiaquine due to pharmacokinetic features. Additionally, psychological/neurological effects were also detected during acute or chronic use, but aminoquinolines do not cross the placenta easily and low quantity is found in breast milk despite their long mean residence times, which depends on the coexistence of hepatic diseases (cancer-related or not), first pass metabolism, and comedications. The low cost and availability on the world market have converted aminoquinolines into “star drugs” for pharmaceutical repurposing, but a continuous pharmacovigilance is necessary because these antimalarials have multiple modes of action/unwanted targets, relatively narrow therapeutic windows, recurrent adverse effects, and related poisoning self-treatment. Therefore, their use must obey strict rules, ethical and medical prescriptions, and clinical and laboratory monitoring.","Ferreira, Paulo Michel Pinheiro; Ferreira, José Roberto de Oliveira; de Sousa, Rayran Walter Ramos; Bezerra, Daniel Pereira; Militão, Gardenia Carmen Gadelha",J Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527050/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/3569349,316

Treatment will be with either 1 g/day of n-3 LCPUFA (694 mg DHA and 397 mg EPA) or placebo capsules, which are a corn/soy oil blend and are identical in size and colour. The primary outcome measure is the Inmate Behavioural Observation Scale (IBOS): an objective measure of aggressive behaviour. Secondary outcome measures include questionnaires (including aggression, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, depression/anxiety/stress scales), engagement in programmes, recidivism and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention assessments include the IBOS, questionnaires and blood to measure the levels of n-3 LCPUFA. DISCUSSION: To conclusively test the potential that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intakes can improve rates of prisoner aggression and associated mental health and violence-related social system management costs, we propose an adequately powered multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, examining the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on aggressive behaviour in adult male prisoners. If successful, this study will inform prisoner policy with respect to nutrition and by inference contribute to a broader community approach to preventative mental health practices.

Secondarily it aims to summarize methods to minimize potential risk to operating room staff. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Continuing operative practice during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic places the health of operating theatre staff at potential risk. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through inhaled droplets and aerosol particles, thus posing an inhalation threat even at considerable distance. Surgical energy devices generate an aerosol of biological particular matter during use. The risk to healthcare staff through use of surgical energy devices is unknown. METHODS: This review was conducted utilizing a rapid review methodology to enable efficient generation and dissemination of information useful for concurrent clinical practice. RESULTS: There are conflicting stances on the use of energy devices and laparoscopy by different surgical governing bodies and societies. There is no definitive evidence that aerosol generated by energy devices may carry active SARS-CoV2 virus. However, investigations of other viruses have demonstrated aerosolization through energy devise use. Measures to reduce potential transmission include appropriate personal protective equipment, evacuation and filtration of surgical plume, limiting energy device use if appropriate, and adjusting endoscopic and laparoscopic practice (low CO(2) pressures, evacuation through ultrafiltration systems). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV2 through aerosolized surgical smoke associated with energy device use is not fully understood, however transmission is biologically plausible. Caution and appropriate measures to reduce risk to healthcare staff should be implemented when considering intraoperative use of energy devices.","Zakka, Kimberley; Erridge, Simon; Chidambaram, Swathikan; Beatty, Jasmine Winter; Kynoch, Michael; Kinross, James; Purkayastha, Sanjay",Ann Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32541232/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004112,316

639238,Outrunning Burnout in a GI Fellowship Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-09,"OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.","Peeri, Noah C; Shrestha, Nistha; Rahman, Md Siddikur; Zaki, Rafdzah; Tan, Zhengqi; Bibi, Saana; Baghbanzadeh, Mahdi; Aghamohammadi, Nasrin; Zhang, Wenyi; Haque, Ubydul",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086938/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa033,316

Gene transfer into mammalian cells may be effected either by infection with virus that carries the recombinant gene of interest, or by direct transfer of plasmid DNA. This chapter discusses the molecular architecture of non-viral vectors for high-level protein production. Virus-based vectors for gene therapy, protein production, vaccine development and other applications are summarized in a table and described.","Makrides, Savvas C.",New Comprehensive Biochemistry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167730603380020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167730603380020,316
640348,Letter: prevalence and patterns of gastrointestinal symptoms in a large Western cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019—authors' reply,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The application of prone positioning with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in non-intubation patients is increasing gradually, applying prone positioning for more high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) patients. This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and tolerance of prone positioning combined with non-invasive respiratory support in patients with AHRF or ARDS. METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (prospective or retrospective cohort studies, RCTs and case series) published in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2020. We included studies that compared prone and supine positioning with non-invasive respiratory support in awake patients with AHRF or ARDS. The meta-analyses used random effects models. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies fulfilled selection criteria and included 243 patients. The aggregated intubation rate and mortality rate were 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26–0.42, I(2) = 25%], 4% (95% CI: 0.01–0.07, I(2) = 0%), respectively, and the intolerance rate was 7% (95% CI: 0.01–0.12, I(2) = 5%). Prone positioning increased PaO(2)/FiO(2) [mean difference (MD) = 47.89, 95% CI: 28.12–67.66; p < 0.00001, I(2) = 67%] and SpO(2) (MD = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.35–7.80, p = 0.005, I(2) = 97%), whereas it reduced respiratory rate (MD = −5.01, 95% CI: −8.49 to −1.52, p = 0.005, I(2) = 85%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the intubation rate of shorter duration prone (⩽5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 34% and 21%, respectively; and the mortality rate of shorter duration prone (⩽5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 6% and 0%, respectively. PaO(2)/FiO(2) and SpO(2) were significantly improved in COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning could improve the oxygenation and reduce respiratory rate in both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients with non-intubated AHRF or ARDS.

METHODS: A case series of hospitalized COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients between February 24th through April 24th, 2020, from two hospitals in Oman. Analyses were performed using univariate statistics. RESULTS: The cohort included 63 patients with an overall mean age of 48 ± 16 years and 84% (n = 53) were males. A total of 38% (n = 24) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty one percent (n = 32) of patients had at least one co-morbidity with diabetes mellitus (DM) (32%; n = 20) and hypertension (32%; n = 20) as the most common co-morbidities followed by chronic heart and renal diseases (12.8%; n = 8). The most common presenting symptoms at onset of illness were fever (84%; n = 53), cough (75%; n = 47) and shortness of breaths (59%; n = 37). All except two patients (97%; n = 61) were treated with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, while the three most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone (79%; n = 50), azithromycin (71%; n = 45), and the piperacillin/tazobactam combination (49%; n = 31). A total of 59% (n = 37), 49% (n = 31) and 24% (n = 15) of the patients were on lopinavir/ritonavir, interferons, or steroids, respectively. Mortality was documented in (8%; n = 5) of the patients while 68% (n = 43) of the study cohort recovered. Mortality was associated with those that were admitted to ICU (19% vs 0; p = 0.009), mechanically ventilated (31% vs 0; p = 0.001), had DM (20% vs 2.3%; p = 0.032), older (62 vs 47 years; p = 0.045), had high total bilirubin (43% vs 2.3%; p = 0.007) and those with high C-reactive protein (186 vs 90 mg/dL; p = 0.009) and low corrected calcium (15% vs 0%; p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: ICU admission, those on mechanical ventilation, the elderly, those with high total bilirubin and low corrected calcium were associated with high mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Khamis, Faryal; Al-Zakwani, Ibrahim; Al Naamani, Hamed; Al Lawati, Sultan; Pandak, Nenad; Omar, Muna Ba; Al Bahrani, Maher; Bulushi, Zakaryia AL; Al Khalili, Huda; Al Salmi, Issa; Al Ismaili, Ruwaida; Al Awaidy, Salah T.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546437/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120304962; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120304962,316

Access to food is also an important marker of how well a society distributes its wealth, reflecting the state of political accountability, economic redistribution, and the society’s level of commitment to uphold the right to food. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the interconnected weaknesses of our food, social and economic systems and offers lessons for building more just and resilient food systems. We focus on three lessons learned anew in the pandemic: (1) food insecurity both reflects and reinforces inequity, (2) food workers are essential yet treated as sacrificial, and (3) racialized migrant food workers face unique forms of inequity. These lessons – chosen for their ethical salience, global relevance, and political urgency – show how interconnected inequities revealed by the pandemic are undermining resilience. We conclude with specific policy recommendations for redress, both within and beyond food systems. This will not be the final global pandemic, nor is it the only shock that regions are currently experiencing. COVID-19 is an opening to think about how societies might center justice and equity in efforts to build back better. Governments should take this opportunity to invest in structural changes to reduce persistent inequities in food access due to poverty, health outcomes, decent work and overall wellbeing, especially for racialized communities and migrants.","Klassen, Susanna; Murphy, Sophia",World Dev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X2030231X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834385/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2030231X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105104,316
643881,"First Case of Candida auris Colonization in a Preterm, Extremely Low-Birth-Weight Newborn after Vaginal Delivery",2021-08-10,"A ‘shadow pandemic’ of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) has emerged secondary to strict public health measures containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Many countries have implemented policies to allow the free movement of DVA survivors in attempts to minimise their exposure to abusive environments. Although these policies are well received, as a result there is a possibility of increased COVID-19 transmission within this vulnerable group who are not currently prioritised for vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to compare the risk of developing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in women (aged over 16 years) exposed to DVA against age-sex-matched unexposed controls, following adjustment for known COVID-19 risk factors. A population-based retrospective open cohort study was undertaken between the 31 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 using ‘The Health Improvement Network’ database. We identified 10,462 eligible women exposed to DVA who were matched to 41,467 similarly aged unexposed women. Following adjustment for key covariates, women exposed to DVA were at an increased risk (aHR 1.57; 95% CI 1.29–1.90) of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 compared to unexposed women. These findings support previous calls for positive policy action improving DVA surveillance and prioritising survivors for COVID-19 vaccination.

Thus, the goal of this study is to better characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic compared with normal subjects using genomic expression analyses. Microarray analyses were performed with AM isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage. Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) normalization and Smyth's moderated t test were used to select differentially expressed genes. Fifty differentially expressed genes were identified. Nineteen have been classified in categories linked to stress or immune responses and among them; nine are part of the heat shock protein (HSP) family. Difference of expression for three (HSPD1, PRNP, SERPINH1) of the five selected genes were validated using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the protein level of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), the protein encoded by HSPD1, and showed difference in AM protein level between allergic asthmatic and control subjects. In summary, this study suggests that HSP gene family, particularly HSP60, is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma. These results also support the involvement of AM immune functions in the development of an allergic asthmatic response.","Madore, Anne-Marie; Perron, Stéphanie; Turmel, Véronique; Laviolette, Michel; Bissonnette, Élyse Y.; Laprise, Catherine",Hum Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885909006363; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885909006363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19913588/,316

In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena.

Although numerous studies have utilized wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, the methods used were developed and/or standardized for other pathogens. This study evaluates multiple methods for concentration and recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and seeded human coronavirus OC43 from municipal primary wastewater and/or sludge from the Greater Seattle Area (March–July 2020). Methods evaluated include the bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS), with and without Vertrel™ extraction, skimmed milk flocculation, with and without Vertrel™ extraction, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultrafiltration, and sludge extraction. Total RNA was extracted from wastewater concentrates and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 with RT-qPCR. Skimmed milk flocculation without Vertrel™ extraction performed consistently over time and between treatment plants in Seattle-area wastewater with the lowest average OC43 C(q) value and smallest variability (24.3; 95% CI: 23.8–24.9), most frequent SARS-CoV-2 detection (48.8% of sampling events), and highest average OC43 percent recovery (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.2–11.9%). Skimmed milk flocculation is also beneficial because it is feasible in low-resource settings. While the BMFS had the highest average volume assayed of 11.9 mL (95% CI: 10.7–13.1 mL), the average OC43 percent recovery was low (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4–1.0%). Ultrafiltration and PEG precipitation had low average OC43 percent recoveries of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5–1.6%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3–5.1%), respectively. The slopes and efficiency for the SARS-CoV-2 standard curves were not consistent over time, confirming the need to include a standard curve each run rather than using a single curve for multiple plates.

647930,What Psychological Factors Make Individuals Believe They Are Infected by Coronavirus 2019?,2021-04-22,"In utero Zika virus (ZIKV; family Flaviviridae) infection causes a distinct pattern of birth defects and disabilities in the developing fetus and neonate that has been termed congenital zika syndrome (CZS). Over 8,000 children were affected by the 2016 to 2017 ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, many of whom developed CZS as a result of in utero exposure. To date, there is no consensus about how ZIKV causes CZS; animal models, however, are providing mechanistic insights. Using nonhuman primates, immunocompromised mice, immunocompetent mice, and other animal models (e.g., pigs, sheep, guinea pigs, and hamsters), studies are showing that maternal immunological responses, placental infection and inflammation, as well as viral genetic factors play significant roles in predicting the downstream consequences of in utero ZIKV infection on the development of CZS in offspring. There are thousands of children suffering from adverse consequences of CZS. Therefore, the animal models developed to study ZIKV-induced adverse outcomes in offspring could provide mechanistic insights into how other viruses, including influenza and hepatitis C viruses, impact placental viability and fetal growth to cause long-term adverse outcomes in an effort to identify therapeutic treatments.","Narasimhan, Harish; Chudnovets, Anna; Burd, Irina; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091001/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008707,316

649301,Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage in a Patient Receiving Bevacizumab for Lung Cancer,2014-10-31,"Double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses are often described as evolving through long-term codivergent associations with their hosts, a pattern that is expected to be associated with low rates of nucleotide substitution. However, the hypothesis of codivergence between dsDNA viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for dsDNA viruses are based upon this assumption. It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human dsDNA viruses, including variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that although the VARV genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 × 10(−5) substitutions/site/year and hence approaching that of many RNA viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other dsDNA viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these dsDNA viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many dsDNA viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some dsDNA viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of RNA viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.","Firth, Cadhla; Kitchen, Andrew; Shapiro, Beth; Suchard, Marc A.; Holmes, Edward C.; Rambaut, Andrew",Molecular Biology and Evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq088; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/27/9/2038/13642808/msq088.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363828/,316

Several trials have demonstrated improved glycemic control (compared with placebo) and a decrease in glucose variability with a clinically relevant increase of time in range. In addition, weight loss and decreased systolic blood pressure are observed. The magnitude of the effects observed depends on the type of SGLTi, the dose administrated, and the duration of observation in the studies. As seen in T2DM, there was an increase in the risk of urogenital mycotic infections, but no increase in the risk of severe hypoglycemia. However, concerns arose regarding an increase in incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. Mitigation strategies, including careful patient selection, extensive education of patients and (para)medical personnel, adequate insulin dose titration, and the adoption of a ketone-centered approach, are suggested. In different areas of the world, SGLTi are approved for use in T1DM with restrictions concerning patient selection and SGLTi dose. Real-world data on the effect of introduction of SGLTi in people with T1DM will yield insight on the robustness of glycemic effects over time, and allow us to determine whether the positive risk–benefit profile observed in clinical trials can be translated to the real world.","Janssens, Birgit; Caerels, Simon; Mathieu, Chantal",Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1177/2042018820938545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782777/,316

Recent data on the rate of airway infections and factors influencing their spread in refugee reception centers is scarce. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of de-identified medical records with a focus on respiratory infections in underage refugees was conducted at two large German refugee reception centers. Results: In total, medical data from n = 10,431 refugees over an observational period of n = 819 days was analyzed. Among pediatric patients (n = 4289), 55.3% presented at least once to the on-site medical ward with an acute respiratory infection or signs thereof. In 38.4% of pediatric consultations, acute airway infections or signs thereof were present. Airway infections spiked during colder months and were significantly more prevalent amongst preschool and resettled children. Their frequency displayed a positive correlation with the number of refugees housed at the reception centers. Conclusions: We show that respiratory infections are a leading cause for morbidity in young refugees and that their rate is influenced age, season, status, and residential density. This illustrates the need to protect refugee children from contracting airway infections which may also reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the current pandemic.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Hillermann, Nele; Dopfer, Christian; Jablonka, Alexandra; Friede, Tim; Simmenroth, Anne; Wetzke, Martin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962038/,316
651658,Less Is More During COVID 19,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues. Although immunisation coverage is reported administratively across the world, no similarly robust monitoring system exists for vaccine confidence. In this study, vaccine confidence was mapped across 149 countries between 2015 and 2019. METHODS: In this large-scale retrospective data-driven analysis, we examined global trends in vaccine confidence using data from 290 surveys done between September, 2015, and December, 2019, across 149 countries, and including 284 381 individuals. We used a Bayesian multinomial logit Gaussian process model to produce estimates of public perceptions towards the safety, importance, and effectiveness of vaccines. Associations between vaccine uptake and a large range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were determined using univariate Bayesian logistic regressions. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% Bayesian highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty. FINDINGS: Between November, 2015, and December, 2019, we estimate that confidence in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines fell in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Korea. We found significant increases in respondents strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe between 2015 and 2019 in six countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Serbia. We find signs that confidence has improved between 2018 and 2019 in some EU member states, including Finland, France, Ireland, and Italy, with recent losses detected in Poland. Confidence in the importance of vaccines (rather than in their safety or effectiveness) had the strongest univariate association with vaccine uptake compared with other determinants considered. When a link was found between individuals' religious beliefs and uptake, findings indicated that minority religious groups tended to have lower probabilities of uptake. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study of global vaccine confidence to date, allowing for cross-country comparisons and changes over time. Our findings highlight the importance of regular monitoring to detect emerging trends to prompt interventions to build and sustain vaccine confidence.

Measures were put in place to address air pressures, airflow direction, aerosol generation, and the safe utilisation of existing scanning rooms and work lists for interventional procedures. Results Three hundred and thirty-one patients (164 at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and 167 at Royal Orthopaedic Hospital) underwent image-guided procedures at both sites in the CT and US rooms. At the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, 40% of all procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. These consisted of 47 CT biopsies, seven CT radiofrequency ablations (RFAs), and 12 US biopsies. At the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, 86% of all procedures were performed under local anaesthetic, with no general anaesthetic procedures. These consisted of 61 CT biopsies and 83 US biopsies. All 256 patients having procedures in the CT room had no post-procedural complications or COVID-19-related symptoms and morbidity on follow-up. Conclusion By adopting a pragmatic approach with meticulous planning, a limited, but fully functional image-guided interventional list can be run without any adverse patient outcomes.","Rajakulasingam, R.; Dasilva, E.

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study recruited 192 doctors, at Wad Medani teaching hospital, Sudan. A questionnaire-based on SPIKES protocol was distributed among 10 departments in our hospital. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Microsoft excel. RESULTS: There were (n = 101, 52.6%) females and (n = 91, 47.4%) males among the participants. 95.3% have been involved in breaking bad news, but only 56.3 received education and training about this issue. 43% admitted bad experience in breaking bad news, while 65.6% mentioned that bad news should be delivered directly to patients. The majority (>90%) agreed training is needed in the area of breaking bad news. Usual adherence to the SPIKES protocol was reported in a range of 35–79%, sometimes adherence was reported in a range of 20–44% while never adherence was reported in a range of zero–13.5%. Consultants, registrars, obstetrician and gynecologists and surgeons achieved high scores in breaking bad news. Training is an important factor in achieving high score in SPIKES protocol. The unadjusted effect of background factors on SPIKES score, showed that only training has significant impact on protocol adherence (P = 0.034, unadjusted; and P = 0.038 adjusted). CONCLUSION: Large number of Sudanese doctors will try to adhere to SPIKES protocol.

Due to the long passage through the nasal cavity, there is a risk of injury with subsequent epistaxis. METHODS: We describe the course of disease of two female patients who suffered from massive epistaxis requiring intervention after an externally performed nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: After nasal tamponade, one patient underwent clipping of the sphenopalatine artery under general anesthesia. The other patient suffered from nasal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock requiring transfusion. She was intubated and admitted to our hospital. CONCLUSION: The nasopharyngeal swab for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to life-threatening complications in rare cases. Considering that daily more than 5 million corona tests are being carried out worldwide as part of the current pandemic, complications should not be neglected. It is necessary that the person performing the swab has a detailed understanding of the anatomy involved. Alternative test methods were further assessed with regard to their sensitivity.

Coronaviruses found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2 include RaTG13 derived from bat and two clusters (PCoV-GD and PCoV-GX) of coronaviruses identified in pangolin. Here, we studied the infectivity and antigenicity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and the three related coronaviruses. Compared with the other three viruses, RaTG13 showed almost no infectivity to a variety of cell lines. The two pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 showed similar infectious activity. However, in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cell lines, the pangolin coronaviruses presented even higher infectivity. The striking difference between the SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin coronaviruses is that the latter can infect porcine cells, which could be partially attributed to an amino acid difference at the position of 498 of the spike protein. The infection by SARS-CoV-2 was mainly mediated by Furin and TMPRSS2, while PCoV-GD and PCoV-GX mainly depend on Cathepsin L. Extensive cross-neutralization was found between SARS-CoV-2 and PCoV-GD. However, almost no cross-neutralization was observed between PCoV-GX and SARS-CoV-2 or PCoV-GD.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HFNC therapy in patients with COPD and type II respiratory failure, to provide evidence to the clinical COPD management. METHODS: We searched Cochrane et al. databases up to Dec 31, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of HFNC therapy in patients with COPD and type II respiratory failure. Two researchers independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and evaluated the quality of the literature and extracted data. We used Revman5.3 software for statistical analysis of collected data. RESULTS: A total of 6 RCTs involving 525 COPD and type II respiratory failure patients. Meta-analyses indicated that compared with NIV, HFNC could significantly reduce PaCO(2) level (MD = − 2.64, 95% CI (− 3.12 to − 2.15)), length of hospital stay ((MD = – 1.19, 95 CI (− 2.23 to − 0.05)), the incidence of nasal facial skin breakdown ((OR = 0.11, 95% CI (0.03–0.41)).

METHODS: Retrospective study from January 2003 through December 2009 was carried out. Every child in the PICU with a laboratory-confirmed influenza or parainfluenza infection was included. RESULTS: 18 influenza (influenza A = 13 and influenza B = 5) and 17 parainfluenza admissions were identified over the 7-year period. Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 9) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. The median age of children admitted with influenza was higher than parainfluenza (4.5 vs 1.7 years, p = 0.044). Admissions associated with proven influenza and parainfluenza infections accounted for 2% of PICU annual admissions. There was only one death in 2003. 51% of these patients required ventilatory support, 45% received systemic corticosteroids, and 91% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Bacterial co-infections were identified in 25% of these patients. The incidence of influenza admissions had not increased significantly in 2009 (H1N1 pandemic) when compared with 2003 (SARS epidemic) (p = 0.3). There were only two PICU cases of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 and both survived. The annual incidence of severe PICU cases of influenza and parainfluenza were 0.94 and 0.88 per 100,000 children per annum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic H1N1, influenza and parainfluenza viruses may be associated with significant childhood morbidity and PICU admissions.","Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Ting Fan; Cheung, Kam Lau; Ng, Pak Cheung; Chan, Paul Kay Sheung",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20882437/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-010-0197-8,316

DESIGN: Observational study using a time-series analysis. Natural experiment in a big city. SETTING: Population of the city of Buenos Aires and the integrated health reporting system records of positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 tests. PARTICIPANTS: Records from the Argentine Integrated Health Reporting System for all persons with suspected and RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between 31 January and 14 July 2020. OUTCOMES: To estimate the effects of living in a slum on the standardised incidence rate of COVID-19, corrected Poisson regression models were used. Additionally, the impact of socioeconomic status was performed using an ecological analysis at the community level. RESULTS: A total of 114 052 people were tested for symptoms related with COVID-19. Of these, 39 039 (34.2%) were RT-PCR positive. The incidence rates for COVID-19 towards the end of the 20th week were 160 (155 to 165) per 100 000 people among the inhabitants who did not reside in the slums (n=2 841 997) and 708 (674 to 642) among slums dwellers (n=233 749). Compared with the better-off socioeconomic quintile (1.00), there was a linear gradient on incidence rates: 1.36 (1.25 to 1.46), 1.61 (1.49 to 1.74), 1.86 (1.72 to 2.01), 2.94 (2.74 to 3.16) from Q2 to Q5, respectively. Slum dwellers were associated with an incidence rate of 14.3 (13.4 to 15.4). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of the epidemic is socially conditioned. Slum dwellers are at a much higher risk than the rest of the community. Slum dwellers should not be considered just another risk category but an entirely different reality that requires policies tailored to their needs.","Macchia, Alejandro; Ferrante, Daniel; Battistella, Gabriel; Mariani, Javier; González Bernaldo de Quirós, Fernán",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472790/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044592,316

Therefore, there is a great demand for mechanical ventilators to address this issue. In this work, we propose a low-cost, portable, yet high-performance design for a volume-controlled mechanical ventilator. We are employing pneumatic artificial muscles, such as air cylinders, in the reverse mode of operation to achieve mechanical ventilation. The current design of the device can operate in two modes: controlled mode and assisted mode. Unlike most ICU ventilators, our device does not need a high-pressure air pipeline to operate. With the current design, mechanical ventilation for respiration rate ranging from 10 b/min to 30 b/min with a tidal volume range of 150 mL to 1000 mL and I:E ratio of 1:1 to 1:5 can be performed. We achieved a total cost of less $400 USD to make one device. We estimate the device to cost less than $250 USD when produced in larger volumes.","Mirvakili, Seyed M; Sim, Douglas; Langer, Robert",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107342,316

All-atom molecular dynamics simulations are combined with deep mutational scanning and analysis of the residue interaction networks to investigate conformational landscapes and energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states of the D614G mutant. The results of conformational dynamics and analysis of collective motions demonstrated that the D614 site plays a key regulatory role in governing functional transitions between open and closed states. Using mutational scanning and sensitivity analysis of protein residues, we identified the stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike structures of the mutant trimers. The results suggest that the D614G mutation can induce the increased stability of the open form acting as a driver of conformational changes, which may result in the increased exposure to the host receptor and promote infectivity of the virus. The network community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins showed that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range couplings between domains and strengthen the interdomain interactions in the open form, supporting the reduced shedding mechanism. This study provides the landscape-based perspective and atomistic view of the allosteric interactions and stability hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, offering a useful insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning functional effects of the global circulating mutations.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yasar; Gupta, Grace",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c02336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179666/,316

Regulatory RNA elements are common within RNAs from every domain of life. This growing body of RNA-mediated mechanisms continues to reveal new ways in which mRNA structure regulates translation.

Historical inequities and social determinants of health are significant contributors to observed disparities and affect access to diagnostic testing for STI. CONTENT: Public health systems rely heavily on laboratory medicine professionals for diagnosis and reporting of STI. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians and laboratory professionals be familiar with issues underlying disparities in STI incidence and barriers to reliable diagnostic testing. In this mini-review, we will summarize contributors to racial/ethnic disparity in STI, highlight current epidemiologic trends for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, discuss policy issues that affect laboratory and public health funding, and identify specific analytic challenges for diagnostic laboratories. SUMMARY: Racial and ethnic disparities in STI in the US are striking and are due to complex interactions of myriad social determinants of health. Budgetary cuts for laboratory and public health services and competition for resources during the COVID-19 pandemic are major challenges. Laboratory professionals must be aware of these underlying issues and work to maximize efforts to ensure equitable access to diagnostic STI testing for all persons, particularly those most disproportionately burdened by STI.","Lieberman, Joshua A; Cannon, Chase A; Bourassa, Lori A",J Appl Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfaa163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247907/,316

METHODS: Up-to-date trials were identiﬁed by the authors through searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases from inception up to September 14, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: According to the observational studies, patients who received CBPs showed a decline in all-cause mortality compared with patients who did not receive CBPs (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23–0.56; p < 0.00001). However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding all-cause mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57–1.19; p = 0.30). The use of CBPs did not increase the risk of adverse events (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60–1.29; p = 0.51). Using CBPs earlier compared with using CBPs later was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08–0.40; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the outcomes of RCTs, CBPs may not decrease all-cause mortality.

663629,Will the COVID Pandemic Lead to Uncounted Cancer Deaths in the Future?,2020-10-01,"Abstract Previously, two B-cell epitopes from the entero-pathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), namely the C epitope (TGEV-C) amino acids (aa) 363–371 and the A epitope (TGEV-A) aa 522–531 of the spike S protein (TGEV-S), have been separately expressed on the CS31A fibrillae at the surface of Escherichia coli following insertion into a same region of ClpG. However, the resulting chimeras induced a marginal TGEV-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in mice. Here, with the view to improving this response, we introduced TGEV-C alone or in different tandem association with TGEV-A (A::C or C::A) in twelve putatively exposed regions of ClpG. Among the 28 resulting engineered proteins only 15, carrying up to 51 extra aa, had not essentially disturbed the correct CS31A fibrillae formation process. Six partially permissive sites accepting only TGEV-C and three highly permissive sites tolerating A::C or C::A tandem peptide, were identified throughout ClpG. Intact bacteria or extracted CS31A hybrid fibrillae expressing TGEV epitopes at any of the permissive sites, were recognized by Ab directed against the foreign parent protein, providing a direct argument for exposure of the corresponding ClpG region at the cell surface and for antigenicity of the epitopes in the polymeric CS31A fibrillae context. The potential of CS31A fibrillae as carriers of the TGEV peptides indicates that there may be three positions (N terminus, aa 202–204 and 202–218) in ClpG which may turn out to be important fusion sites and therefore be relevant for the eventual design of TGEV vaccines. Unexpectedly, TGEV-A, whatever its position in ClpG, mediated the partial proteolytic degradation of the hybrid proteins, suggesting that it functions as a substrate for a cellular protease, and thereby that its suitability as a vaccine antigen candidate is doubtful.","Méchin, Marie-Claire; Der Vartanian, Maurice; Martin, Christine",Gene,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111996003484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8972902/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111996003484,316

Synthetic 21-23 nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) with 2 nt 3′ overhangs was recently found to mediate efficient sequence-specific mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. Here, we studied the effects of synthetic siRNA duplexes targeted to SARS coronavirus structural proteins E, M, and N in a cell culture system. Among total 26 siRNA duplexes, we obtained 3 siRNA duplexes which could sequence-specifically reduce target genes expression over 80% at the concentration of 60 nM in Vero E6 cells. The downregulation effect was in correlation with the concentrations of the siRNA duplexes in a range of 0∼60 nM. Our results also showed that many inactive siRNA duplexes may be brought to life simply by unpairing the 5' end of the antisense strands. Results suggest that siRNA is capable of inhibiting SARS coronavirus genes expression and thus may be a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of SARS.","SHI, Yi; YANG, De Hua; XIONG, Jie; JIA, Jie; HUANG, Bing; JIN, You Xin",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780182/,316

Nevertheless, within the population of patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDDs), viral infections can be the feature that drives a diagnostic evaluation or can be the most significant morbidity for the patient. This review is focused on the viral complications of PIDDs. It will focus on respiratory viruses, the most common type of viral infection in the general population. Children and adults with an increased frequency or severity of respiratory viral infections are often referred for an immunologic evaluation. The classic teaching is to investigate humoral function in people with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, but this is often interpreted to mean recurrent bacterial infections. Recurrent or very severe viral infections may also be a harbinger of a primary immunodeficiency as well. This review will also cover persistent cutaneous viral infections, systemic infections, central nervous system infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

Pediatric surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID 19 who had a co existing surgical emergency. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency department and later diagnosed to have COVID 19 by RT PCR. The study duration was 3 months (April 2020 to June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT PCR with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board. Results: Total patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty four (75%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen (43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days. One neonate with ARM died in the postoperative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got infected with SARS Co V2 during this period.

Conventionally, vaccines are applied parenterally to induce serotype-dependent humoral response but fail to drive adequate mucosal immune protection for viral infections such as influenza, HIV, and coronaviruses. Oral mucosa, however, provides a vast immune repertoire against specific microbial pathogens and yet is shaped by an ever-present microbiome community that has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years. Adjuvants targeting mucosal T-cells abundant in oral tissues can promote soluble-IgA (sIgA)-specific protection to confer increased vaccine efficacy. Th17 cells, for example, are at the center of cell-mediated immunity and evidence demonstrates that protection against heterologous pathogen serotypes is achieved with components from the oral microbiome. At the point of entry where pathogens are first encountered, typically the oral or nasal cavity, the mucosal surfaces are layered with bacterial cohabitants that continually shape the host immune profile. Constituents of the oral microbiome including their lipids, outer membrane vesicles, and specific proteins, have been found to modulate the Th17 response in the oral mucosa, playing important roles in vaccine and adjuvant designs. Currently, there are no approved adjuvants for the induction of Th17 protection, and it is critical that this research is included in the preparedness for the current and future pandemics. Here, we discuss the potential of oral commensals, and molecules derived thereof, to induce Th17 activity and provide safer and more predictable options in adjuvant engineering to prevent emerging infectious diseases.","Zenobia, Camille; Herpoldt, Karla-Luise; Freire, Marcelo",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078913/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-021-00341-4,316

Nevertheless, detrimental aspects of the lockdown for older people are a reduction in physical activity and limited access to physiotherapy, which are likely to have a negative impact on the health status. This study examined the feasibility of video-based physiotherapy (VT) and the subjective rating of VT by patients and therapists. METHODS: From April to June 2020, 4 facilities with 9 patients (6 women, 64–82 years old) participated in the study and were provided with technical equipment. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in eight patients to assess physical activity, functional ability and participation before and during the restrictions. Both patients and therapists were asked about their subjective experiences with VT. RESULTS: A total of 92 VT sessions took place. Performance of the exercises and comprehension of instructions were rated as good to very good. The level of acceptance was high. Of the patients four described a perceived reduction in their physical activities due to the public restrictions; however, in the questionnaires no substantial differences in participation and physical activity were found. DISCUSSION: The use of VT is feasible in older patients. Only minor technical support is needed. In pandemic situations or in other contexts VT appears to be a promising supplement or alternative to normal physiotherapy. Further studies are needed to identify suitable patient groups, to prove efficacy and to develop further content-related aspects of VT.","Happe, Lisa; Lau, Sandra; Koschate, Jessica; Diekmann, Rebecca; Hein, Andreas; Zieschang, Tania",Z Gerontol Geriatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01899-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938980/,316

The pandemic situation may make difficult to prioritize patients with allergies diseases (AD), face-to-face evaluation, and moreover concern about the possible COVID-19 diagnosis, since COVID-19 shared many symptoms in common with AD. Being COVID-19 a novel disease, everyone is susceptible; there are some advances on vaccine and specific treatment. We evaluate existing literature on allergic diseases (AD): allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, drug allergy, and skin allergy, and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between AD and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between AD and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19. AD patients should minimize hospital and face-to-face visits, and those who have used biologics and allergen immunotherapy should continue the treatment. It is essential to wear personal protective equipment for the protection of health care workers. SUMMARY: Social distancing, rational use of facemasks, eye protection, and hand disinfection for health care workers and patients deserve further attention and promotion.

Innate immune system overactivity, termed the cytokine storm, appears to be critical in the development of the worst consequences of COVID-19 infection. Pathophysiology suggests that viral stimulation of the innate immune system, augmented by inflammatory signals sent from dying cells, ramps up into a poorly controlled outpouring of inflammatory mediators. Other aging-related changes in cells such as senescence as well as higher prevalence of chronic disease states also likely ramp up inflammatory signaling. This in turn drives downstream pathophysiological changes to pulmonary, cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and brain tissues that drive many of the adverse health outcomes observed in older adults. This article provides an overview of the underlying etiologies of innate immune system activation and adaptive immune system dysregulation in older adults and how they potentiate the consequences of the COVID-19-related cytokine storm, and possible uses of this knowledge to develop better risk assessment and treatment monitoring strategies.","Nidadavolu, Lolita S; Walston, Jeremy D",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841329/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa209,316

Computed tomography of the abdomen and the pelvis revealed extensive inflammatory infiltrations of the subcutaneous tissue of the hypogastrium, and the penis; along with liquefaction and presence of gas in the subcutaneous tissues of the scrotum, the perineum, and the right gluteal region. The patient was diagnosed with FG, and was urgently qualified to undergo surgery in the Department of Urology. After performing the necessary examinations, a resection of the necrotic tissues with bilateral orchiectomy and excision of the penile and scrotal skin was performed. After surgery, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.

Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: During April 2015—December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged <5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5–13) and 11 months (IQR: 6–18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV.

Numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets. Why these mutations were naturally selected or how SARS-CoV evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood, presenting evolutionary and epidemic conundrums. In this study, we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition, an important determinant of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, functional, and crystallographic approaches, we elucidated the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected RBD mutations. These mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce unfavorable interactions with two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2, and by doing so, they enhance viral interactions with either human (hACE2) or civet (cACE2) ACE2. Therefore, these mutations were viral adaptations to either hACE2 or cACE2. To corroborate the above analysis, we designed and characterized two optimized RBDs. The human-optimized RBD contains all of the hACE2-adapted residues (Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 but relative low affinity for cACE2. The civet-optimized RBD contains all of the cACE2-adapted residues (Tyr-442, Pro-472, Arg-479, Gly-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for cACE2 and also substantial affinity for hACE2. These results not only illustrate the detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation by SARS-CoV but also provide a molecular and structural basis for tracking future SARS-CoV evolution in animals.","Wu, Kailang; Peng, Guiqing; Wilken, Matthew; Geraghty, Robert J.; Li, Fang",Journal of Biological Chemistry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820608523; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m111.325803; http://www.jbc.org/content/287/12/8904.full.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820608523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291007/,316

We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on the surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with the immune system. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized genome-reduced Escherichia coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as killed whole-cell vaccines. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the six FP core amino acid residues, along with the four adjacent residues upstream and the three residues downstream from the core, are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated interferon-γ responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine-appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.","Maeda, Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris; Tian, Debin; Yu, Hanna; Dar, Nakul; Rajasekaran, Vignesh; Meng, Sarah; Mahsoub, Hassan M.; Sooryanarain, Harini; Wang, Bo; Heffron, C.

Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3’-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307–3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3’-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.","Chan, Agnes.

685525,High-Resolution CT Findings of Myositis-Related Interstitial Lung Disease,2021-07-06,"We are living in the age of big data, a majority of which is stream data. The real-time processing of this data requires careful consideration from different perspectives. Concept drift is a change in the data’s underlying distribution, a significant issue, especially when learning from data streams. It requires learners to be adaptive to dynamic changes. Random forest is an ensemble approach that is widely used in classical non-streaming settings of machine learning applications. At the same time, the Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) is a stream learning algorithm that showed promising results in terms of its accuracy and ability to deal with various types of drift. The incoming instances’ continuity allows for their binomial distribution to be approximated to a Poisson [Formula: see text] distribution. In this study, we propose a mechanism to increase such streaming algorithms’ efficiency by focusing on resampling. Our measure, resampling effectiveness ([Formula: see text]), fuses the two most essential aspects in online learning; accuracy and execution time. We use six different synthetic data sets, each having a different type of drift, to empirically select the parameter [Formula: see text] of the Poisson distribution that yields the best value for [Formula: see text]. By comparing the standard ARF with its tuned variations, we show that ARF performance can be enhanced by tackling this important aspect. Finally, we present three case studies from different contexts to test our proposed enhancement method and demonstrate its effectiveness in processing large data sets: (a) Amazon customer reviews (written in English), (b) hotel reviews (in Arabic), and (c) real-time aspect-based sentiment analysis of COVID-19-related tweets in the United States during April 2020. Results indicate that our proposed method of enhancement exhibited considerable improvement in most of the situations.","AlQabbany, Abdulaziz O.; Azmi, Aqil M.",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356400/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e23070859,316
685706,COVID-19 Pandemic: The Concerns of Pediatric Neurologists,2020-06-10,"The aim of this study is to obtain a clear picture of ENT related symptoms in active COVID-19 patients. This study also intends to determine the association of ENT symptoms with Olfactory and Gustatory dysfunction in these patients. Material and Methods: This is a prospective study on 70 active COVID-19 patients who were admitted in the Tertiary Care Hospital. History of all symptoms including Olfactory and Gustatory function were enquired after obtaining Informed Consent. Results: Throat related symptoms was 77.78%, Nasal symptoms accounted for 63.49% and Ear related symptoms constituted 14.28%. It was seen that Rhinorrhoea and Sneezing was significantly more associated in the presence of Olfactory dysfunction. The most common ENT symptoms were Sore throat (49.21%), Rhinorrhoea (34.92%), Sneezing (33.33%), changes in Smell perception (36.51%), changes in Taste perception (47.62%) and Headache (30.16%). 17.14% of the patients in this study had both Olfactory and Gustatory dysfunction. Ear related symptoms were also observed where 11.11% had Aural fullness, 3.17% with Tinnitus and 6.35% of the patients complained of Hearing loss which was either noticed for the first time or had worsened on contracting the COVID-19 disease. Discussion: Knowledge of ENT symptomatology in COVID 19 patients will aid in early quarantine and hence limitation of viral transmission. The manifestation of Anosmia or Hyposmia, Ageusia and Aural Fullness in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can also act as an important tool and help in early isolation and quicker initiation of COVID-19 therapy.","Gosavi, Swapnil; Nagarajan, Sivasubramaniam; Shah, Nirali Jayant; Thomas, Neelikattu Aathira Tess; Kumar, Kalpana Rajiv; Sangole, Vaishali",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-021-02815-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422621/,316

Methods: A cross-sectional investigation was conducted into women hospitalized for delivery in Hubei Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital from December 31, 2019 to March 22, 2020, a period which encompasses the entire time frame of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was adopted to evaluate perinatal depression status. A Chi-square test and logistic regression model were utilized for data analysis. Results: A total of 2,883 participants were included, 33.71% of whom were found to suffer from depressive symptoms. In detail, 27.02%, 5.24%, and 1.46% were designated as having mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The perinatal depression prevalence increased as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened. Compared to the period from December 31, 2019 to January 12, 2020, perinatal depression risk significantly decreased within the 3 weeks of March 2–22, 2020 (1st week: OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.78; 2nd week: OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.73; and 3rd week: OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.94); and the postnatal depression risk significantly rose within the four weeks of January 27-February 23, 2020 (1st week: OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.68; 2nd week: OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.35, 3.04; 3rd week: OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.14; and 4th week: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.48). Conclusion: The dynamic change of perinatal depression was associated with the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic among new mothers who were exposed to the pandemic. An elevated risk of postnatal depression was also observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, Guoqiang; Wang, Qi; Lin, Ying; Li, Ruyan; Yang, Lijun; Liu, Xian; Peng, Min; Wang, Hongyan; Yang, Xuewen; Ren, Wei; Yang, Hui; Cheng, Yao",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.551812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391042/,316

From 536 laboratory-confirmed cases, 483 completed the study (90.1%) carried by the Public Health Center of Castelló and the Emergency and Microbiology and Clinical Analysis of Hospital de la Plana Vila-real. The study included ABO determination and telephone interviews of patients. The participants had a mean age of 37.2 ± 17.1 years, 300 females (62.1%). ABO were O (41.4%), A (45.5%), B (9.1%), and AB (3.9%). We found no difference in the incidence of COVID-19 infections. A total of 159 (32.9%) patients reported one or more post-COVID-19 complications with divergent incidences after adjustment: O (32.3%), A (32.6%), B (54.1%), and AB (27.6%); B groups had more complications post-COVID-19 when compared with O group (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.68, 95% CI 1.24–2.27), and symptoms of fatigue (1.79, 95% CI 1.08–2.95), myalgia (2.06, 95% CI 1.10–3.84), headache (2.61, 95% CI 1.58–4.31), and disorder of vision (4.26 95% CI 1.33–13.60).

Materials and Methods: We investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among 12 discordant child-parent pairs in our ward. In each hospital isolation room, caregivers and children lived in close contact during the entire hospitalization period. Results: A total of 136 swab-positive children (mean age, 3.6 ± 4.9 median age, 1; IQR 0–6.2, range 0.1–17) attended by their caregivers were hospitalized. Of those, 12/136 (8.8%, mean age, 6.1 ± 5.3 median age, 4.5) were attended by caregivers who were swab and serology negative at admission despite previous close contact with positive children at home. Three children were completely dependent on their mothers, one of whom was being breastfed. The mean duration of overall exposure to the index case was 20.5 ± 8.2 days. Conclusion: None of the infected children transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to their caregivers, raising the hypothesis of a cluster of resistant mothers or of limited transmission from children to adults despite prolonged exposure and close contact. These data might provide reassurance regarding school openings and offer the chance of investigating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future under the same quasi-experimental conditions.","Nunziata, Francesco; Poeta, Marco; Vassallo, Edoardo; Continisio, Grazia Isabella; Lo Vecchio, Andrea; Guarino, Alfredo; Bruzzese, Eugenia",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414146/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.720084,316

Objective: The objective of this study was to construct contact patterns to evaluate the degree to which social contacts rebounded to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and location-specific settings. Design: Four population-based cross-sectional surveys. Setting: Canada. Participants: Members of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender, official language, and region of residence. Methods: Respondents provided information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-hour period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of 18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the reproduction number (Rt) for each survey. Respondents with children estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and extracurricular settings. Results: Estimated Rt values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.29-0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63-1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47-1.17) for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the home (51.3% in May), in other locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3% and 65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1-24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7-20.4) (December) contacts at school per day per child in attendance. Conclusion: The skewed distribution of reported contacts toward workplace settings in September and December combined with the number of reported school-related contacts suggest that these settings represent important opportunities for transmission emphasizing the need to ensure infection control procedures in both workplaces and schools.","Brankston, G.; Merkley, E.; Fisman, D.

The same survey was carried out in Shanghai and Beijing pre (December 2018) and post COVID-19 (November 2020), ~9 months after China’s initial outbreak, with 500 and 523 consumers, respectively. From December 2018 to November 2020, there was an increase in the proportion of Chinese consumers purchasing red meat online or from a butcher, and cooking their lamb well-done. In contrast, there were minimal differences in Chinese consumer ratings between December 2018 and November 2020 for different lamb attributes and opinions of New Zealand lamb. Cluster analysis revealed that many consumers (140 in December 2018/376 in November 2020) used only a small portion of the high end of the scale when rating lamb attributes, resulting in little differences between the attributes. This study suggests COVID-19 has enhanced some food safety related behaviors but had little effect on Chinese opinions and preferences for New Zealand lamb attributes. It also highlights that survey design should be carefully considered when collecting responses from Chinese consumers.","Hutchings, Scott C.; Guerrero, Luis; Mirosa, Miranda; Bremer, Phil; Mather, Damien; Pavan, Enrique; Hicks, Talia M.; Day, Li; Realini, Carolina E.",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201350/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10061324,316

METHODS: This online community-based cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between 19 April 2020 and 5 June 2020, using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of three sections: sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, and impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A convenience sampling method was used to select participants. RESULTS: A total of 570 adults aged ⩾18 years participated in the study. Of them, 258 (45.3%), 120 (21%), and 192 (33.7%) were residing in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, respectively. A large portion of participants (73.2%) reported that the containment measures of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had caused an excessive burden on their families; 549 (96.3%) revealed that water supplies were not always available at home. However, paying attention to personal hygiene and home cleaning was more than usual before the announcement of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The mean times of going out of their homes have dropped significantly following the onset of the pandemic, p value = 0.001 (95% confidence interval). In addition, 192 (33.7%) participants reported that they changed to working remotely from home with 66 (11.6%) having lost their employment. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was associated with an additional burden on the Palestinian families. Moreover, we suggest discussing the obtained results with local and national stakeholders to ensure that they know to improve their actions.","Abuzerr, Samer; Zinszer, Kate; Shaheen, Amira; el Bilbeisi, Abdel Hamid; Al Haj Daoud, Ayman; Aldirawi, Ali; Salem, Alshaarawi",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796295/; https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211001137,316
