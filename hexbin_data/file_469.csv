4513,Key constituents for integration of care for children assisted with long-term home ventilation: a European study,2020-02-15,"Vaccination is the most effective measure at preventing influenza virus infections. However, current seasonal influenza vaccines are only protective against closely matched circulating strains. Even with extensive monitoring and annual reformulation our efforts remain one step behind the rapidly evolving virus, often resulting in mismatches and low vaccine effectiveness. Fortunately, many next-generation influenza vaccines are currently in development, utilizing an array of innovative techniques to shorten production time and increase the breadth of protection. This review summarizes the production methods of current vaccines, recent advances that have been made in influenza vaccine research, and highlights potential challenges that are yet to be overcome. Special emphasis is put on the potential role of glycoengineering in influenza vaccine development, and the advantages of removing the glycan shield on influenza surface antigens to increase vaccine immunogenicity. The potential for future development of these novel influenza vaccine candidates is discussed from an industry perspective.","Chen, Juine-Ruey; Liu, Yo-Min; Tseng, Yung-Chieh; Ma, Che",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023813/,469

The Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) is a new instrument that measures cognitive factors associated with HC. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties and factor structure of the SHAI in a large sample of medically healthy university students. We also examined the scale’s convergent, divergent, and predictive validity. Results indicated that the SHAI has good psychometric properties and contains three factors that assess the perceived likelihood and perceived severity of becoming ill, and body vigilance. Facets of health anxiety uniquely predicted increased safety-seeking behavior and medical utilization, behaviors that are commonly observed in HC. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive-behavioral model of HC.","Abramowitz, Jonathan S.; Deacon, Brett J.; Valentiner, David P.",Cognit Ther Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088052/,469
5214,Potential Inoculum Sources of Phaeomoniellachlamydospora in South African Grapevine Nurseries,2006-06-07,"Although a cause-and-effect relationship between viral infection and myocarditis remains inferential, two distinct clinical syndromes can be identified. During the early viral phase, the cardiac manifestations emerge while the symptoms of active viral infection are also present. During the chronic phase, symptoms of the viral infection may be remote or nonexistent, and identification of active myocarditis is contingent upon an aggressive diagnostic approach with endomyocardial biopsy and gallium 67 imaging. The exact incidence of myocarditis in patients with heart failure of unknown cause is unclear due to lack of standardization of histologic parameters. There are no other clinical clues to the presence of myocarditis in those patients presenting with cardiomyopathy or ventricular arrhythmia. For further clarification of the incidence and various presentations of myocarditis a large multi-center trial is necessary.","O'Connell, John B.; Robinson, John A.; Gunnar, Rolf M.; Scanlon, Patrick J.",Heart Vessels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088165/,469

The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanism of the functional changes of CDllb+/Ly6C(intermediate) macrophages after renal IRI. The gene expression profiles of CDllb+/Ly6Cintermcdiate macrophages of the sham surgery mice, and the mice 4 h, 24 h and 9 days after renal IRI were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological processes and pathways by the series test of cluster. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed and analysed to discover the key genes. A total of 6738 DEGs were identified and assigned to 20 model profiles. DEGs in profile 13 were one of the predominant expression profiles, which are involved in immune cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Signet analysis showed that Atp5al, Atp5o, Cox4i, Cdc42, Rac2 and Nhp2 were the key genes involved in oxidation-reduction, apoptosis, migration, M1-M2 differentiation, and proliferation of macrophages. RPS18 may be an appreciate reference gene as it was stable in macrophages. The identified DEGs and their enriched pathways investigate factors that may participate in the functional changes of CD 1lb(+)Ly6C(intermediate) macrophages after renal IRI. Moreover, the vital gene Nhp2 may involve the polarization of macrophages, which may be a new target to affect the process of AKI","Sun, Dong; Wan, Xin; Pan, Bin-bin; Sun, Qing; Ji, Xiao-bing; Zhang, Feng; Zhang, Hao; Cao, Chang-chun",Curr Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089064/,469

13498,"Global health education in medical schools (GHEMS): a national, collaborative study of medical curricula",2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND: Empirical antimicrobial therapy (EAT) is a challenge for community-acquired, hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia, particularly in the context of the increasing occurrence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCR-E), including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) and high-level expressed AmpC cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacterales (HLAC-E). To prevent the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies, such as carbapenems, we assessed the performance of screening for intestinal carriage of HLAC-E in addition to ESBL-E to predict 3GCR-E (ESBL-E and/or HLAC-E) presence or absence in respiratory samples in ICU, and to evaluate its potential impact on carbapenem prescription. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This monocentric retrospective observational study was performed in a surgical ICU during a 4-year period (January 2013–December 2016). Patients were included if they had a positive culture on a respiratory sample and a previous intestinal carriage screening performed by rectal swabbing within 21 days. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated for the screening for intestinal carriage of ESBL-E, HLAC-E and 3GCR-E (ESBL-E and/or HLAC-E) as predictor of their absence/presence in respiratory samples. Impact of HLAC-E and ESBL-E reporting on EAT was also studied. RESULTS: 765 respiratory samples, retrieved from 468 patients, were analyzed. ESBL-E prevalence was 23.8% in rectal swab and 4.4% in respiratory samples. HLAC-E prevalence was 9.0% in rectal swabs and 3.7% in respiratory samples. Overall, the 3GCR-E prevalence was 31.8% in rectal swabs and 7.7% in respiratory samples. NPVs were 98.8%, 98.0% and 96.6% for ESBL-E, HLAC-E and 3GCR-E, respectively. Over the study period, empirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated for 315 episodes of respiratory infections: 228/315 (72.4%) were associated with negative intestinal carriage screening for both HLAC-E and ESBL-E, of whom 28/228 (12.3%) were treated with carbapenems. Of 23/315 (7.3%) cases with screening for positive intestinal carriage with HLAC-E alone, 10/23 (43.5%) were treated with carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Systematic screening and reporting of HLAC-E in addition to ESBL-E in intestinal carriage screening could help to predict the absence of 3GCR-E in respiratory samples of severe surgical ICU patients. This could improve the appropriateness of EAT in ICU patients with HAP and may prevent the overuse of carbapenems.","Elsa, Manquat; Matthieu, Le Dorze; De Ponfilly Gauthier, Pean; Hanaa, Benmansour; Rishma, Amarsy; Emmanuelle, Cambau; Benjamin, Soyer; Glenn, Chousterman Benjamin; Hervé, Jacquier",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594978/,469

18006,A Response to “Doctors' Challenges During Infectious Disease Outbreaks: Medical Education Insights from Realistic Fiction Movies” [Response to Letter],2021-05-28,"Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are metabolites synthesized and excreted by a variety of microorganisms, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB). EPS serve several biological functions such as interactions between bacteria and their environments, protection against hostile conditions including dehydration, the alleviation of the action of toxic compounds (bile salts, hydrolyzing enzymes, lysozyme, gastric, and pancreatic enzymes, metal ions, antibiotics), and stresses (changing pH, osmolarity), and evasion of the immune response and phage attack. Bacterial EPSs are considered valuable by the food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries, owing to their health-promoting benefits and rheological impacts. Numerous studies have reported the unusual antimicrobial activities of various EPS against a wide variety of pathogenic microbes (bacteria, virus, and fungi). This review aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of different EPSs, mainly against foodborne bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. The mechanism of EPS action against these pathogens as well as the methods used to measure antimicrobial activities are critically reviewed.","Abdalla, Abdelmoneim K.; Ayyash, Mutamed M.; Olaimat, Amin N.; Osaili, Tareq M.; Al-Nabulsi, Anas A.; Shah, Nagendra P.; Holley, Richard",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170130/,469
20669,Widening Participation in Medicine: The Impact of Medical Student-Led Conferences for Year 12 Pupils,2021-08-24,"PURPOSE: To assess whether the newly designed small-molecule oral P-selectin inhibitor 3S-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-methyl aspartyl ester (THCMA) as a nanomedicine enhances antithrombosis, anti-inflammation, and antitumor activity more than the clinical trial drug PSI-697. METHODS: THCMA was designed as an amphiphile containing pharmacophores of PSI-697. Its nanofeatures were explored with TEM, SEM, Tyndall effect, ζ-potential, FT-ICR-MS, and NOESY 2D (1)H NMR. The P-selectin inhibitory effect of THCMA was demonstrated with molecular docking, ultraviolet (UV) spectra, and competitive ELISA. In vivo and in vitro assays — anti-arterial thrombosis, anti–venous thrombosis, anti-inflammation, antitumor growth, anti–platelet aggregation, rat-tail bleeding time, anticoagulation index, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) expression, and serum TNFα expression — were performed to explore bioactivity and potential mechanisms. Water solubility of THCMA was measured using UV-absorption spectra. RESULTS: THCMA self-assembled into nanorings of approximately 100 nm in diameter. Its water solubility was about 1,030-fold that of PSI-697. THCMA exhibited more potent P-selectin inhibitory effect than PSI-697. The oral efficacy of THCMA was 100-fold that of PSI-697 in inhibiting arterial and venous thrombosis and tenfold in inhibiting inflammation. THCMA inhibited thrombosis at a dose that produces no coagulation disorders and no bleeding risk. THCMA exhibited enhanced antitumor activity over PSI-697 without systemic chemotherapy toxicity. THCMA significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and downregulated the expression levels of serum sP-selectin and TNFα in vivo. CONCLUSION: A new small-molecule P-selectin inhibitor, THCMA, has been successfully designed as a nanomedicine with largely enhanced oral efficacy compared to the clinical trial drug PSI-697, and thus might be developed for the oral treatment of arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, inflammation, and cancer-associated thrombosis.","Feng, Qiqi; Wang, Mengyang; Muhtar, Eldar; Wang, Yaonan; Zhu, Haimei",Int J Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403725/,469

It is a powerful tool for understanding how we behave and interact with the world. In this paper, we introduce a framework to track emotion dynamics through one’s utterances. Specifically we introduce a number of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) metrics inspired by work in Psychology. We use this approach to trace emotional arcs of movie characters. We analyze thousands of such character arcs to test hypotheses that inform our broader understanding of stories. Notably, we show that there is a tendency for characters to use increasingly more negative words and become increasingly emotionally discordant with each other until about 90% of the narrative length. UED also has applications in behavior studies, social sciences, and public health.","Hipson, Will E.; Mohammad, Saif M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452047/,469

It is associated with a significant drop in the dry matter intake, milk yield, and increased susceptibility of dairy cows to metritis, mastitis, and displaced abomasum. The objective of this study was to identify metabolic alterations that precede and are associated with the disease occurrence. Blood samples were collected from 100 dairy cows at −8 and −4 weeks prior to parturition and on the day of retained placenta, and only 16 healthy cows and 6 cows affected by retained placenta were selected to measure serum polar metabolites by a targeted gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) metabolomics approach. A total of 27 metabolites were identified and quantified in the serum. There were 10, 18, and 17 metabolites identified as being significantly altered during the three time periods studied. However, only nine metabolites were identified as being shared among the three time periods including five amino acids (Asp, Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr), one sugar (myo-inositol), phosphoric acid, and urea. The identified metabolites can be used as predictive biomarkers for the risk of retained placenta in dairy cows and might help explain the metabolic processes that occur prior to the incidence of the disease and throw light on the pathomechanisms of the disease.","Zhang, Guanshi; Tobolski, Dawid; Zwierzchowski, Grzegorz; Mandal, Rupasri; Wishart, David S.; Ametaj, Burim N.",Metabolites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466882/,469

26078,Lessons Learned and Reordering Policy Prescriptions,2017-05-09,"Ribosomal frameshifting at a particular site can yield two protein products from one coding sequence or one protein product from two overlapping open reading frames. Many organisms are known to utilize ribosomal frameshifting to express a minority of genes. However, finding ribosomal frameshift sites by a computational method is difficult because frameshift signals are diverse and dependent on the organisms and environments. There are few computer programs available for public use to identify frameshift sites from genomic sequences. We have developed a web-based application program called FSFinder2 for predicting frameshift sites of general type. We tested FSFinder2 on the Escherichia coli K12 genome to detect potential -1 frameshifting genes. From the genome sequence, we identified 18,401 frameshift sites following the X XXY YYZ motif. 11,530 frameshift sites out of the 18,401 sites include secondary structures. Comparison with the GenBank annotation produced 11 potential frameshift sites, including 3 known frameshift sites. The program is useful for analyzing frameshifts of various types and for discovering new genes expressed by frameshifts.","Moon, Sanghoon; Byun, Yanga; Han, Kyungsook",Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122894/,469
26125,Desire and the Law: Creative Resistance in the Reluctant Passenger and the Heart of Redness,2017-07-16,"For the sake of simplicity, let us start by naming an infectious agent a “germ.” There are countless germs that can infect human, animal, and plant hosts. Germs can be transmitted directly between hosts via respiratory air droplets or bodily fluids (e.g., saliva, blood, or secretions from sexual organs). Germs can also be transmitted indirectly through an intermediary source, for instance via mosquitoes, ticks, rodents, environmental particles (e.g., contaminated water and food) or contaminated blood products. Germs evolve and transform while new germs emerge regularly, implying their supply can be considered infinite. A broad distinction is often made between microscopically small germs with relatively short life spans, which replicate within their hosts (often called microparasites such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and much larger germs with relatively longer life spans (often called macroparasites such as parasitic worms). Many germs live inside or on the surface of their hosts’ bodies without causing illness or even discomfort.","Hens, Niel; Shkedy, Ziv; Aerts, Marc; Faes, Christel; Van Damme, Pierre; Beutels, Philippe",Modeling Infectious Disease Parameters Based on Serological and Social Contact Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122953/,469

34369,Necrotizing tracheobronchitis with endotracheal tube obstruction in COVID-19 patients(),2020-06-13,"Reactive programming (RP) languages and Synchronous Coordination (SC) languages share the goal of orchestrating the execution of computational tasks, by imposing dependencies on their execution order and controlling how they share data. RP is often implemented as libraries for existing programming languages, lifting operations over values to operations over streams of values, and providing efficient solutions to manage how updates to such streams trigger reactions, i.e., the execution of dependent tasks. SC is often implemented as a standalone formalism to specify existing component-based architectures, used to analyse, verify, transform, or generate code. These two approaches target different audiences, and it is non-trivial to combine the programming style of RP with the expressive power of synchronous languages. This paper proposes a lightweight programming language to describe component-based Architectures for Reactive systems, dubbed ARx, which blends concepts from RP and SC, mainly inspired to the Reo coordination language and its composition operation, and with tailored constructs for reactive programs such as the ones found in ReScala. ARx is enriched with a type system and with algebraic data types, and has a reactive semantics inspired in RP. We provide typical examples from both the RP and SC literature, illustrate how these can be captured by the proposed language, and describe a web-based prototype tool to edit, parse, and type check programs, and to animate their semantics.","Proença, José; Cledou, Guillermina",Coordination Models and Languages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282853/,469

43504,The fast response of academic spinoffs to unexpected societal and economic challenges. Lessons from the COVID‐19 pandemic crisis,2020-11-18,"The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted everyday life as individuals, especially older adults, are encouraged to distance to reduce virus transmission. Remote strategies for connection may ameliorate risks for social isolation, however, older adults’ adoption of such strategies remains unknown. This study involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with 30 older adults (ages 68-94) regarding adaptations to the call for social distancing and use of technology. From a socioemotional selectivity theory lens, findings demonstrate respondents’ positive views of technology, expressing value in the context of supporting emotionally important relationships and goals, e.g. social connection and entertainment, rather than knowledge acquisition. Surprisingly, most respondents were uninterested in technology training. This may be consistent with diminished future time perspectives; several participants referenced their advanced age to explain disinterest in learning new technology and most seemed to have developed a level of technology use that met their needs. Technology resistance was consistent with a focus on emotionally meaningful goals; several respondents conveyed disinterest in social media due to perceived intrusiveness and others indicated a lack of interest in telemedicine and health portals due to the perceived loss in valuable human contact. Personal challenges with social distancing generally reflected limitations in safe human interactions, e.g. a desire for hugs or missing the spontaneity of social get-togethers, which remained emotionally meaningful but outside the scope of how technology could support wellbeing. These results suggest that focusing on older adults’ emotional goals, and highlighting how technology can support their achievement, may support meaningful use to promote health and connection.","Bardach, Shani; Rhodus, Elizabeth; Parsons, Kelly; Gibson, Allison",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741244/,469

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective hospital cohort study on patients ≥ 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to our hospital between 03/15/2020 and 05/25/2020. Study individuals were recruited if they had a complete CBC profile and inflammatory markers such as CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and LDH, as well as a well-defined clinical outcomes (discharged alive or expired). Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were reviewed and retrieved. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were employed to identify prognostic markers associated with mortality. RESULTS: Out of the 344 confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients during the study period, 31 who did not have a complete blood profile were excluded; 303 patients were included in the study, 89 (29%) expired, and 214 (71%) were discharged alive. Demographic analysis was tabulated in Table 1. The univariate analysis showed a significant association of death with absolute neutrophil count (ANC, p=0.022), NLR (p=002), neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR, p=< 0.0001), LCR (p=0.007), lymphocyte-LDH ratio (LLR, p=< 0.0001), lymphocyte-D-dimer ratio (LDR, p=< 0.0001), lymphocyte-ferritin ratio (LFR, p=< 0.0001), and platelets (p=0.037) with mortality. With multivariable logistic regression analysis, the only values that had an odds of survival were high LDR (odds ratio [OR] 1.763; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–2.69), and a high LFR (OR 1.136, CI 1.01–1.34). We further build up a model which can predict >85% mortality in our cohorts with the utilization of D-dimer (>500 ng/ml), Ferritin (>200 ng/ml), LDR (< 1.6), LFR (< 4) and ANC (>2.5). This new model has a ROC of 0.68 (p< 0.0001). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 suggests LDR and LFR as potential independent prognostic indicators. A new model with combination of D-dimer, Ferritin, LDR, LFR and ANC, was able to predict >85% mortality in our cohort with ROC of 0.68, it will need to be validated in a prospective cohort study.

45763,Care Life Expectancy: Gender and Unpaid Work in the Context of Population Aging,2021-02-15,"In recent years, cancer immunotherapy experienced remarkable developments and it is nowadays considered a promising therapeutic frontier against many types of cancer, especially hematological malignancies. However, in most types of solid tumors, immunotherapy efficacy is modest, partly because of the limited accessibility of lymphocytes to the tumor core. This immune exclusion is mediated by a variety of physical, functional and dynamic barriers, which play a role in shaping the immune infiltrate in the tumor microenvironment. At present there is no unified and integrated understanding about the role played by different postulated models of immune exclusion in human solid tumors. Systematically mapping immune landscapes or “topographies” in cancers of different histology is of pivotal importance to characterize spatial and temporal distribution of lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment, providing insights into mechanisms of immune exclusion. Spatially mapping immune cells also provides quantitative information, which could be informative in clinical settings, for example for the discovery of new biomarkers that could guide the design of patient-specific immunotherapies. In this review, we aim to summarize current standard and next generation approaches to define Cancer Immune Topographies based on published studies and propose future perspectives.","Pietrobon, Violena; Cesano, Alessandra; Marincola, Francesco; Kather, Jakob Nikolas",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873485/,469

METHODS: A total of 16 patients (27 knees involved) were divided into a pre-lockdown group (10 patients; 17 knees) and a post-lockdown group (6 patients, 10 knees) in terms of the time of surgeries performed before and after lockdown, respectively, due to COVID-19 pandemic. Patients of pre-lockdown group underwent rehabilitation under the guidance of trained physiotherapists for at-home sessions and under assisted physiotherapy. Patients of post-lockdown group followed the rehabilitation protocol of at-home sessions and under home-care assistance during COVID-19 lockdown. Functional recovery of the knee was assessed against the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Junior. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The pre- and postoperative mean KOOS Junior of pre-lockdown group were 48.73 ± 2.64 and 64.91 ± 2.74, respectively (p < 0.001). The pre- and postoperative scores of post-lockdown group were 48.83 ± 2.83 and 67.84 ± 4.31 (p < 0.001), respectively. Intergroup comparison between pre- and postoperative KOOS Jr. revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the routine postoperative rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty, the coordination among the surgeon, therapists, and home caregivers can provide sustained assistance in rehabilitation. The guidelines for practitioners and physiotherapists can benefit functional recovery of the knee.","Tomar, Lavindra; Govil, Gaurav; Dhawan, Pawan",Arthroplasty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7920634/,469

The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) Study aimed to contemporaneously report changes to practice and subsequent outcomes of vascular patients managed during the pandemic. METHODS: COVER is a three-tiered international multi-centre observational cohort study aiming to quantify the specific impact of the pandemic on the provision of vascular and endovascular surgery and the adjustments made to standard vascular practice during this time. The primary outcome of Tier 3 was to identify how the management of all referred urgent vascular cases changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included longitudinal data to identify condition-specific outcomes for these patients at 3, 6 months and 1 year. Over a minimum four-week period, contributing vascular centers contemporaneously collected prospective data on the management of all urgent referrals received during this time. RESULTS: Data from over 1693 patients worldwide has been obtained and is currently undergoing analysis. Provisional results suggest that approximately 18% of patients had significant changes to their care during the pandemic. Full descriptive results of management changes during the pandemic itself will be reported at the NRCM meeting. CONCLUSIONS: It is anticipated that this work will highlight significant deviation in the management of urgent vascular referrals when compared to pre-pandemic best practice guidelines. It will be crucial to identify and monitor the ongoing impact this has on patient care.","Preece, Ryan",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030178/,469

The oxygen atoms and π-system revealed a high chemical reactivity for the title compound as electron donor spots and active sites for an electrophilic attack. Quantum chemical parameters such as hardness (η), softness (S), electronegativity (χ), and electrophilicity (ω) were yielded as descriptors for the molecule’s chemical behavior. The optimized molecular structure was obtained, and the experimental data were matched with geometrical analysis values describing the molecule’s stable structure. The computed FT-IR and Raman vibrational frequencies were in good agreement with those observed experimentally. In a molecular docking study, the inhibitory potential of the studied molecule was evaluated against the penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The carbonyl group in the molecule was shown to play a significant role in antibacterial activity, four bonds were formed by the carbonyl group with the key protein of the bacteria (three favorable hydrogen bonds plus one van der Waals bond) out of six interactions.

55304,Social media capital and civic engagement: Does type of connection matter?,2021-07-02,"BACKGROUND: SARS‐CoV‐2 enters cells through the Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) receptor present on the cell surface. ACE‐2 is present in many cell types including endothelial cells, where it functions to protect against oxidative damage. Reports suggest that COVID‐19 patients also showed symptoms related to endothelial damage. We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity. We investigated this in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein S1 Receptor‐Binding Domain (S1RBD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used. The expression of VE‐Cadherin, PECAM‐1, JAM‐A and Connexin 43, was probed by Western blot in normal and diabetic cells, before and after treatment with S1RBD. RESULTS: The expression of VE‐Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, was not affected by diabetes or by S1RBD treatment. PECAM‐1 expression showed a small but significant (~15%) decrease after S1RD treatment in control cells. Junctional Adhesion Molecule (JAM‐A), a tight junction protein, and the gap junction protein, Connexin‐43, decreased by ~50 and 80% respectively in the presence of S1RBD when compared to untreated controls. Expression of PECAM‐1, JAM‐A and connexin‐43 were significantly lower in untreated diabetic endothelial cells, compared to untreated control cells. This expression level further decreased significantly in the presence of S1RBD, with maximal effects observed with JAM‐A and Connexin‐43 expression (~80 and 90% decrease, respectively). These results indicate that healthy and diabetic endothelial cells respond differently when challenged with SARS‐CoV‐2 S1RBD. CONCLUSION: S1RBD‐induces degradation of endothelial junctional proteins that likely affects endothelial barrier function and causes vascular damage.","Raghavan, Somasundaram; Kenchappa, Divya; Leo, M.",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239909/,469

We employ a novelty procedure to explore this phenomenon. This procedure performs apriori segmentation based on gender and generation. It then applies the deep learning technique to identify the predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, altruism, telepresence, social identity, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, perceived physical condition, social norms, habit, and trust) by segments. The predictor variables were taken from the literature on the use of social network sites, and an empirical study was carried out by quota sampling with a sample size of 395 older people. The results show different predictors of social network sites considering all the samples, baby boomer (born between 1947 and 1966) males and females, silent (born between 1927 and 1946) males and females. The high heterogeneity among older people is confirmed; this means that dealing with older adults as a uniform set of users of social network sites is a mistake. This study demonstrates that the four segments behave differently, and many diverse variables influence the acceptance of social network sites.","Ramírez-Correa, Patricio E.; Rondán-Cataluña, F.

In this study, one cabin of a fully enclosed train was taken as an example to conduct experimental and numerical research on pollution level and distribution characteristic of total volatile organic compound (TVOC). The results show that when the average emission rate under daily environmental conditions was taken as the reference, TVOC concentration in the cabin exceeded the limit level of Chinese Indoor Air Quality Standard by more than 4 times. The obvious pollutants accumulative phenomenon could be found at bottoms and corners under the action of airflow. Setting air inlets at the roof of the train, mean age of air ranged from 30 s to 50 s in the breathing area. The concentration of pollutants was the lowest at 2.5–5 m from the center point of the cabin structure, and the ventilation efficiency was the highest. The introduction of clean fresh air could effectively eliminate pollutants. When the complete displacement ventilation rates were 51.4 h(−1) and 28.6 h(−1), the removal efficiency of pollutants was about 0.85 and 0.48 mg/m(3) per minute, respectively.

The molecular basis underlying the susceptibility of auditory cortex to loss of afferent input remains largely unknown. The transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) expression in the visual cortex has been shown to be crucial in the formation of vision, but the role of EGR-1 during the process of auditory function formation is still unclear. In this study, we presented data showing that EGR-1 was expressed in the neurons of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in mice. We observed that the auditory deprivation induced by kanamycin during the auditory critical period leads to laminar-specific alteration of neuronal distribution and EGR-1 expression in A1. In addition, MK-801 administration inhibited the expression of EGR-1 in A1 and aggravated the abnormal cortical electric response caused by kanamycin injection. Finally, we showed that the expression of PI3K, the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) were decreased in A1 after kanamycin-induced hearing loss. These results characterized the expression of EGR-1 in A1 in response to the acoustic input and suggested the involvement of EGR-1 in auditory function formation.","Wang, Man; Han, Yuechen; Wang, Xue; Liang, Shuo; Bo, Chuan; Zhang, Zhenbiao; Wang, Mingming; Xu, Lei; Zhang, Daogong; Liu, Wenwen; Wang, Haibo",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-021-01791-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423191/,469

Following implementation in April, the percentage of MDT outcomes with keywords recorded was 79% in June and 77% for the first two weeks of July. Analysis of the 3,680 MDT outcomes with at least one key word recorded showed that 96% had the 'intention to proceed' recorded. For 59% patients, the decision was to 'proceed', 5% patients are being monitored, 3% patients have been deferred and 29% were 'closed'. While this process adds time to busy MDTs, we hypothesise that it will support the tracking and safety-netting of thousands of cancer patients whose care has been affected by the pandemic.

61948,Virtual Social Work Care with Older Black Adults: A Culturally Relevant Technology-Based Intervention to Reduce Social Isolation and Loneliness in a Time of Pandemic.,2020-09-12,"OBJECTIVE Recently, we reported a minimally invasive stent-electrode array capable of recording neural signals from within a blood vessel. We now investigate the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to infer changes occurring to the electrode-tissue interface from devices implanted in a cohort of sheep for up to 190 days. APPROACH In a cohort of 15 sheep, endovascular stent-electrode arrays were implanted in the superior sagittal sinus overlying the motor cortex for up to 190 days. EIS was performed routinely to quantify viable electrodes for up to 91 days. An equivalent circuit model (ECM) was developed from the in vivo measurements to characterize the electrode-tissue interface changes occurring to the electrodes chronically implanted within a blood vessel. Post-mortem histological assessment of stent and electrode incorporation into the wall of the cortical vessels was compared to the electrical impedance measurements. MAIN RESULTS EIS could be used to infer electrode viability and was consistent with x-ray analysis performed in vivo, and post-mortem evaluation. Viable electrodes exhibited consistent 1 kHz impedances across the 91 day measurement period, with the peak resistance frequency for the acquired data also stable over time. There was a significant change in 100 Hz phase angles, increasing from -67.8° ± 8.8° at day 0 to -43.8° ± 0.8° at day 91, which was observed to stabilize after eight days. ECM's modeled to the data suggested this change was due to an increase in the capacitance of the electrode-tissue interface. This was supported by histological assessment with >85% of the implanted stent struts covered with neointima and incorporated into the blood vessel within two weeks. CONCLUSION This work demonstrated that EIS could be used to determine the viability of electrode implanted chronically within a blood vessel. Impedance measurements alone were not observed to be a useful predictor of alterations occurring at the electrode tissue interface. However, measurement of 100 Hz phase angles was in good agreement with the capacitive changes predicted by the ECM and consistent with suggestions that this represents protein absorption on the electrode surface. 100 Hz phase angles stabilized after 8 days, consistent with histologically assessed samples. SIGNIFICANCE These findings demonstrate the potential application of this technology for use as a chronic neural recording system and indicate the importance of conducting EIS as a measure to identify viable electrodes and changes occurring at the electrode-tissue interface.","Opie, Nicholas L; John, Sam E; Rind, Gil S; Ronayne, Stephen M; Grayden, David B; Burkitt, Anthony N; May, Clive N; O'Brien, Terence J; Oxley, Thomas J",Journal of neural engineering,https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2560/13/4/046020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378157/,469

Primary evaluation of male factor infertility includes a semen analysis (SA). The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria is widely used to interpret SA. However, the current normative values seen in WHO criteria have led to research showing racial disparities in prevalence of abnormal SA. OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between different self-reported racial groups and rates of abnormal SA. MATERIALS & METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single large tertiary care facility. All men who underwent a SA for evaluation of suspected male infertility, unexplained infertility, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, were considered for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria were unreported race or ethnicity, SA for fertility preservation only, history of varicocele or testicular surgery, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens, prior testosterone use, or prior exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation. Samples obtained via testicular sperm extraction or postejaculatory urine collection, or those analyzed ≥1 hour from ejaculation, were also excluded. RESULTS 872 SAs were identified, of which 615 met inclusion criteria, yielding 384 normal and 231 abnormal results. Only race (p<0.0001) and age (p=0.002) were statistically significant. Black men had the highest rate of abnormal SA (54%) and were significantly more likely to have lower semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, percent motile sperm, and total motile sperm (p<0.05). In a logistic regression model, controlling for age and using White Non-Hispanic as the referent group, only Blacks had lower odds for a normal SA (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.28, 0.60). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Black men are more likely to have an abnormal SA based on the 2010 WHO criteria. Black men seeking infertility treatment should be educated on the incidence of abnormal SA and actively seek infertility evaluation.","Walker, Zachary; Rucker, Lindsay; Owen, John; Wiltshire, Ashley; Kendall, Lacey; Edmonds, Johnathan; Gunn, Deidre",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630395/,469

Single-cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids revealed reproducibility across experiments and enabled the tracking of the neural and mesodermal differentiation trajectories as organoids developed and matured. NMOs contain functional neuromuscular junctions supported by terminal Schwann cells. They contract and develop central pattern generator-like neuronal circuits.

67981,"COVID-19 pandemic, emergency remote teaching and Nursing Now: challenges for nursing education.",2021,"Drinking water softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience e.g. by reducing lime scaling and soap use. Softening reduces hardness, but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water, depending on the technology. A broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e.g. health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design, otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience. We here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling, soap use, corrosion, human health, taste and removal of contaminants. None of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators. Precipitation technologies (lime/soda-ash softening and pellet softening) reduce the predicted copper and lead release, but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the Larson Ratio. Pellet softening does not remove magnesium, which may limit the achievable softening depth, but maintains a protective effect against cardio-vascular diseases. Strong-acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators, whereas the effects from membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) and weak-acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design. All the evaluated technologies reduce hardness, calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP) and atopic eczema, but have potential adverse effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S).

SOT was defined as any recipient who had received a heart, lung, liver, intestinal, kidney, pancreas, or combined thoracic and/or abdominal organ transplantation. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and concomitant diagnosis of pneumonia or urinary tract infection were adjusted for in our analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay and total hospital charges. RESULTS A total of 105,780 hospital discharges of SOT recipients were included. The incidence of CDI was 3,554 (3.36%) among SOTs. CDI was associated with a higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.56-2.20, p<0.01), longer length of hospital stay (mean difference 5.07 days, 95%CI 4.43-5.71, p<0.01) and higher total hospital charges (mean difference 43,958 US dollars, p<0.01). CONCLUSION Our study found that CDI is associated with poorer overall outcomes among hospitalized SOT recipients. However, there was a possible improving trend of the outcomes when compare to previous studies.","Mahatanan, Rattanaporn; Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Charoenpong, Prangthip; Ferrey, Antoney",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894617/,469

72496,[Organ changes found by postmortem examination in COVID-19 patients].,2020,"BACKGROUND Cholinergic neuronal loss is one of the hallmarks of AD related neurodegeneration; however, preclinical promise of α7 nAChR drugs failed to translate into humans. CHRFAM7A, a uniquely human fusion gene, is a negative regulator of α7 nAChR and was unaccounted for in preclinical models. METHODS Molecular methods: Function of CHRFAM7A alleles was studied in vitro in two disease relevant phenotypic readouts: electrophysiology and Aβ uptake. Genome edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were used as a model system with the human context. Double blind pharmacogenetic study: We performed double-blind pharmacogenetic analysis on the effect of AChEI therapy based on CHRFAM7A carrier status in two paradigms: response to drug initiation and DMT effect. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used as outcome measure. Change in MMSE score from baseline was compared by 2-tailed T-test. Longitudinal analysis of clinical outcome (MMSE) was performed using a fitted general linear model, based on an assumed autoregressive covariance structure. Model independent variables included age, sex, and medication regimen at the time of the first utilized outcome measure (AChEI alone or AChEI plus memantine), APOE4 carrier status (0, 1 or 2 alleles as categorical variables) and CHRFAM7A genotype. FINDINGS The direct and inverted alleles have distinct phenotypes. Functional CHRFAM7A allele classifies the population as 25% non-carriers and 75% carriers. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models α7 nAChR mediated Aβ neurotoxicity. Pharmacological readout translates into both first exposure (p = 0.037) and disease modifying effect (p = 0.0048) in two double blind pharmacogenetic studies. INTERPRETATION CHRFAM7A accounts for the translational gap in cholinergic strategies in AD. Clinical trials not accounting for this uniquely human genetic factor may have rejected drug candidates that would benefit 25% of AD. Reanalyses of the completed trials using this pharmacogenetic paradigm may identify effective therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS It is a retrospective, feasibility study, monocentric. All patients who were operated by the single-port, between 1st January 2010 to 1st November 2011, were included. RESULTS We note that 107 patients were included. We made different interventions: uni- and bilateral salpingo-ovariectomy, hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy in gynecologic malignancies. The median age of the population and the body mass index were respectively 52 and 22.6 kg/m(2). In total, six interventions will be converted. The median hospital stay of patients, all procedures combined, was 2 days. We find low rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Gynecological cancer surgery appears feasible for single-port.

74494,[Obesity as a risk factor for complications during acute respiratory infections in children].,2016,"BACKGROUND Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely-used investigative technique in motor cortical evaluation. Recently, there has been a surge in TMS studies evaluating lower-limb fatigue. TMS intensity of 120-130% resting motor threshold (RMT) and 120% active motor threshold (AMT) and TMS intensity determined using stimulus-response curves during muscular contraction have been used in these studies. With the expansion of fatigue research in locomotion, the quadriceps femoris is increasingly of interest. It is important to select a stimulus intensity appropriate to evaluate the variables, including voluntary activation, being measured in this functionally important muscle group. This study assessed whether selected quadriceps TMS stimulus intensity determined by frequently employed methods is similar between methods and muscles. METHODS Stimulus intensity in vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and vastus medialis muscles was determined by RMT, AMT (i.e. during brief voluntary contractions at 10% maximal voluntary force, MVC) and maximal motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from stimulus-response curves during brief voluntary contractions at 10, 20 and 50% MVC at different stimulus intensities. RESULTS Stimulus intensity determined from a 10% MVC stimulus-response curve and at 120 and 130% RMT was higher than stimulus intensity at 120% AMT (lowest) and from a 50% MVC stimulus-response curve (p < 0.05). Stimulus intensity from a 20% MVC stimulus-response curve was similar to 120% RMT and 50% MVC stimulus-response curve. Mean stimulus intensity for stimulus-response curves at 10, 20 and 50% MVC corresponded to approximately 135, 115 and 100% RMT and 180, 155 and 130% AMT, respectively. Selected stimulus intensity was similar between muscles for all methods (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Similar optimal stimulus intensity and maximal MEP amplitudes at 20 and 50% MVC and the minimal risk of residual fatigue at 20% MVC suggest that a 20% MVC stimulus-response curve is appropriate for determining TMS stimulus intensity in the quadriceps femoris. The higher selected stimulus intensities at 120-130% RMT have the potential to cause increased coactivation and discomfort and the lower stimulus intensity at 120% AMT may underestimate evoked responses. One muscle may also act as a surrogate in determining optimal quadriceps femoris stimulation intensity.","Temesi, John; Gruet, Mathieu; Rupp, Thomas; Verges, Samuel; Millet, Guillaume Y",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-0003-11-40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655366/,469

In order to close the gap in these health disparities, efforts to develop and test culturally appropriate interventions are critical. METHODS A PRISMA-guided systematic review was conducted to identify and critically evaluate health promotion interventions for African Americans delivered in barbershops and hair salons. Subject headings and keywords used to search for synonyms of 'barbershops,' 'hair salons,' and 'African Americans' identified all relevant articles (from inception onwards) from six databases: Academic Search Ultimate, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index). Experimental and quasi-experimental studies for adult (> 18 years) African Americans delivered in barbershops and hair salons that evaluated interventions focused on risk reduction/management of obesity-related chronic disease: cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes were included. Analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS Fourteen studies met criteria for inclusion. Ten studies hosted interventions in a barbershop setting while four took place in hair salons. There was substantial variability among interventions and outcomes with cancer the most commonly studied disease state (n = 7; 50%), followed by hypertension (n = 5; 35.7%). Most reported outcomes were focused on behavior change (n = 10) with only four studies reporting clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Health promotion interventions delivered in barbershops/hair salons show promise for meeting cancer screening recommendations and managing hypertension in African Americans. More studies are needed that focus on diabetes and obesity and utilize the hair salon as a site for intervention delivery.

HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8-12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012;61[No. RR-4]). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with two new recommendations: 1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is <0.1% and 2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is <0.1%. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.","Schillie, Sarah; Wester, Carolyn; Osborne, Melissa; Wesolowski, Laura; Ryerson, A Blythe",MMWR.

Resins, particularly those with a significant level of compressibility, require proper knowledge of the packing methodology to ensure scalable performance. The study demonstrates the applicability of pressure-flow modeling based on the Blake-Kozeny equation for cellulose based resins, using the MEP HyperCel (Pall) resin as a case study. This approach enabled the understanding of the appropriate bed compressibility and the determination of the minimum column diameter that can predict bed integrity during commercial manufacturing scale operation. Studies suggested that scale-dependent wall effects become negligible for column diameters exceeding 20 cm. Pressure-flow modeling produced a minimum compression recommendation of 0.206 for the MEP HyperCel resin. Columns with diameters up to 80 cm packed with this bed compression yielded incompressible beds with pressure-flow curves consistent with model predictions. Model parameter (particle diameter, viscosity, porosity) values were then varied to demonstrate how changing operating conditions influence model predictions. This analysis supported the successful troubleshooting of unexpected high pressures at the commercial manufacturing scale using MEP HyperCel resin, further supporting the applicability of this approach.","Prentice, Jessica; Evans, Steven T; Robbins, David; Ferreira, Gisela",Journal of chromatography.

The disease seems to infect men and women in equal numbers, though trends suggest that men have greater morbidity. This has been attributed to differences in immunological response, expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), prevalence of comorbidities, and health-related behaviours, such as smoking. However, this cannot be taken to mean that women are somehow protected. Advanced age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have emerged as the leading contributors to increased morbidity and mortality from the disease. Women with diabetes form a vulnerable group as they often receive suboptimal diabetes care and support, even though they have a high burden of comorbidities and complications. While there are challenges in healthcare delivery during the pandemic, cardiometabolic care cannot be compromised, which calls for exploring new avenues of healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine. Pregnant women with diabetes should continue to receive quality care for optimal outcomes, and the psychological health of women also needs special consideration. The management of hyperglycaemia during COVID-19 infection is important to reduce morbidity and mortality from the infection. The gendered impact of outbreaks and quarantine goes beyond biomedical and psychological aspects, and the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic is likely to affect the long-term care of women with diabetes, which creates an urgent need to create effective policies and interventions to promote optimal care in this vulnerable group.","Priya, Gagan; Bajaj, Sarita; Grewal, Emmy; Maisnam, Indira; Chandrasekharan, Sruti; Selvan, Chitra",European endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.17925/ee.2020.16.2.100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117440/,469
80794,The Care Home Pandemic - What Lessons Can We Learn for the Future?,2020-07-16,"Forests have re-taken centre stage in global conversations about sustainability, climate and biodiversity. Here, we use a horizon scanning approach to identify five large-scale trends that are likely to have substantial medium- and long-term effects on forests and forest livelihoods: forest megadisturbances; changing rural demographics; the rise of the middle-class in low- and middle-income countries; increased availability, access and use of digital technologies; and large-scale infrastructure development. These trends represent human and environmental processes that are exceptionally large in geographical extent and magnitude, and difficult to reverse. They are creating new agricultural and urban frontiers, changing existing rural landscapes and practices, opening spaces for novel conservation priorities and facilitating an unprecedented development of monitoring and evaluation platforms that can be used by local communities, civil society organizations, governments and international donors. Understanding these larger-scale dynamics is key to support not only the critical role of forests in meeting livelihood aspirations locally, but also a range of other sustainability challenges more globally. We argue that a better understanding of these trends and the identification of levers for change requires that the research community not only continue to build on case studies that have dominated research efforts so far, but place a greater emphasis on causality and causal mechanisms, and generate a deeper understanding of how local, national and international geographical scales interact.","Oldekop, Johan A; Rasmussen, Laura Vang; Agrawal, Arun; Bebbington, Anthony J; Meyfroidt, Patrick; Bengston, David N; Blackman, Allen; Brooks, Stephen; Davidson-Hunt, Iain; Davies, Penny; Dinsi, Stanley C; Fontana, Lorenza B; Gumucio, Tatiana; Kumar, Chetan; Kumar, Kundan; Moran, Dominic; Mwampamba, Tuyeni H; Nasi, Robert; Nilsson, Margareta; Pinedo-Vasquez, Miguel A; Rhemtulla, Jeanine M; Sutherland, William J; Watkins, Cristy; Wilson, Sarah J",Nature plants,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-00814-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257859/,469

Long-term anatomical and patient-reported outcomes after pelvic floor repair are therefore required. METHODS This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in a teaching hospital with tertiary referral function for patients with POP. Patients with symptomatic vaginal vault or uterine prolapse (simplified POP Quantification [sPOPQ] stage ≥2), who underwent robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) or supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy (RSHS), were included. Follow-up visits with sPOPQ evaluations were planned 4 years after surgery. Patients received pre- and postoperative questionnaires reporting symptoms of vaginal bulge, Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6), and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7). Primary outcome was patient self-reported symptoms. Secondary outcome was anatomical cure (sPOPQ stage 1) for all vaginal compartments. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included. Sixty-one patients (79%) were evaluated after 50 months (physical examination n = 51). Symptoms of bulge (95% vs 15% p ˂ 0.0005), median UDI-6 scores (26.7 vs 22.2, p = 0.048), median PFIQ-7 scores (60.0 vs 0, p = 0.008), and median sPOPQ stages in all landmarks improved significantly from the pre- to the postoperative visit. Thirty patients (59%) were completely recurrence free and 96% of patients had no apical recurrence. Most recurrences were asymptomatic cystoceles (20%). There was one surgical re-intervention for recurrent prolapse (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy and RSHS show sustainable results in the treatment of prolapse. Symptoms of bulge, urinary symptoms, and quality of life improved substantially 50 months postoperatively. Patients should be counseled about the risk of anterior wall recurrence and the small chance of recurrent symptoms that need treatment.","van Zanten, Femke; Lenters, Egbert; Broeders, Ivo A M J; Schraffordt Koops, Steven E",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04740-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159402/,469

Various behavioral, social and environmental factors present in this region perpetuate common metabolic risk factors of non-communicable diseases. This study will identify social determinants of common metabolic risk factors of major non-communicable diseases in the context of the South Asian region and map their causal pathway. METHODS A systematic review of selected articles will be carried out following Cochrane guidelines. Review will be guided by Social Determinants of Health Framework developed by the World Health Organization to extract social determinants of metabolic risk factors of non-communicable diseases from studies. A distinct search strategy will be applied using key words to screen relevant studies from online databases. Primary and grey literature published from the year 2000 to 2016 and studies with discussion on proximal and distal determinants of non-communicable risk factors among adults of the South Asia region will be selected. They will be further checked for quality, and a matrix illustrating contents of selected articles will be developed. Thematic content analysis will be done to trace social determinants and their interaction with metabolic risk factors. Findings will be illustrated in causal loop diagrams with social determinants of risk factors along with their interaction (feedback mechanism). DISCUSSION The review will describe the interplay of social determinants of common NCD metabolic risk factors in the form of causal loop diagram. Findings will be structured in two parts: the first part will explain the linkage between proximal determinants with the metabolic risk factors and the second part will describe the linkage among the risk factors, proximal determinants and distal determinants.

Lung metastases are the primary cause of death from osteosarcomas. Complete resection of lung metastases can prolong the survival. However, complete resection in elderly patients is often difficult due to high risk of operative complications. Computed tomography (CT) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique to destroy tumor nodules using heat. In this report, we present the first case older than 65 years applying RFA for lung metastases due to osteosarcoma. PATIENT CONCERNS A 74-year-old male presented with 1-year history of heel pain. A conventional high-grade osteosarcoma in his calcaneus was diagnosed. Below-knee amputation was performed. However, lung metastases were found in both lungs 1 year after amputation. CT-guided lung RFA was chosen since surgical intervention for lung metastases was abandoned because of tumor multiplicity and medical comorbidities. A total of 18 lung metastases were treated by CT-guided RFA. The most frequent complication was pneumothoraxes in 4 of 8 (50%) procedures and chest tube drainage was required in 2 of these (2 of 8 (25%) procedures). DIAGNOSES Six lung metastases of osteosaroma were found in both lungs at 1 year after surgery. INTERVENTIONS CT-guided lung RFA was performed. A total of 18 lung metastases were treated in 8 lung RF procedures. OUTCOMES The patient has been alive with disease for 5.5 years after the initial surgery. LESSONS CT-guided lung RFA is effective for elderly patients with osteosarcoma lung metastases in spite of discouragement of lung metastasectomy due to multiplicity of metastases and medical-comorbidities.","Futani, Hiroyuki; Takaki, Haruyuki; Sawai, Tatsuo; Taniguchi, Junichi; Kako, Yasukazu; Ide, Yoshi-Hiro; Yamakado, Koichiro; Tachibana, Toshiya",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449453/,469

87409,Demographic and socioeconomic profiles of patients admitted with diabetic foot complications in a tertiary hospital in Belem - Para.,2020,"In late 2014, 56 hospitals in the United States were designated by state and federal public health authorities as specially designed high-level isolation units (HLIUs) equipped with advanced infrastructure, laboratory capabilities, and trained staff to care for patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases (HHCDs), such as Ebola virus disease. This survey describes the clinical laboratory support capabilities of U.S. HLIUs, including the specific test menus that HLIUs have identified to safely manage HHCD patients and the locations where such testing would be performed. In spring 2016, a survey was electronically distributed, as a fillable pdf file, to the 56 U.S. HLIUs. Site representatives completed the surveys, and data were coded and analyzed in an electronic spreadsheet, using descriptive statistics. Thirty-six HLIUs (64%) responded, and 33 completed the laboratory capabilities section. Thirty-one HLIUs (94%) had performed risk analyses for all laboratory procedures and equipment. Twenty-nine (88%) had decontamination procedures specified for all laboratory equipment used for patients with suspected or confirmed HHCDs. On-site laboratories in 27 HLIUs (81%) had the capacity to inventory and to securely store HHCD patient specimens. Ten HLIUs (31%) had at least one test they would conduct within the patient isolation room. The high-risk nature of HHCDs and the occupational exposures that may occur in clinical laboratories demand advanced preparation and risk assessment of work practices, laboratory equipment, and instrumentation by HLIU laboratories. Although risk analyses of clinical laboratory testing and equipment that HLIUs have conducted have likely focused on those for Ebola virus, HLIUs must be prepared to revise their current procedures for other HHCDs.","Herstein, Jocelyn J; Iwen, Peter C; Jelden, Katelyn C; Biddinger, Paul D; Gibbs, Shawn G; Le, Aurora B; Hewlett, Angela L; Lowe, John J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01608-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167287/,469
88006,Experimental study of femoral vein reconstruction with sugarcane biopolymer tubular graft.,2018,"A major goal in the development of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF), and subsequently, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3) was linking the instrument to contemporary models of psychopathology. The present study evaluated whether the higher order structure of MMPI-3 scales, and in particular, the 26 Specific Problems as well as RC6 and RC8 (markers of thought disorder) scales aligned with the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model. For this purpose, a large diverse mental health sample (n = 1,537) and a male prison inmate sample (n = 452) were used to capture a diverse range of psychopathology. Confirmatory factor analyses generally supported the six HiTOP spectra in both samples, albeit with some important qualifications. Associations between latent factor scores and conceptually relevant external criterion measures further supported the validity of this model. Furthermore, Goldberg's sequential hierarchical factoring approach was used to evaluate the structure of MMPI-3 SP and RC6/RC8 at descending levels of the hierarchy. Again, most of the HiTOP spectra were replicated. The structures for the mental health and prison samples were generally similar with substantive differences being linked to their respective contexts. Overall, the results indicate that the hierarchical organization of the MMPI-3 scales is generally consistent with the extant psychopathology literature, which constitutes good support for overall construct validity of the scales.

Methods Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were systematically searched to identify studies examining the association between factors and medication engagement among older diabetes patients. A study met inclusion for meta-analysis if the prevalence of medication engagement or factor was reported in ≥2 studies and the frequency or strength of association was either reported or able to be computed. Quality appraisal was performed with the Downs and Black tool. Results Of 538 retrieved studies, 33 (20 cohort and 13 cross-sectional) were included for systematic review; of these, 22 met criteria for meta-analysis. Findings from meta-analysis show that women (odds ratio [OR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97), those with depression (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.87), and those with higher out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94) were less likely to take diabetes medication when compared with men, those without depression, and those with lower out-of-pocket costs, respectively. Older age (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.27) was associated with better engagement to diabetes medication. Conclusions Of 4 identified factors, 2 are modifiable. Recent policy efforts to decrease the cost burden of prescribed medication for older adults, such as Medicare Part D, may remove this barrier to medication engagement. Routine screening for depression among older adults with diabetes should be included as part of usual care to facilitate an integrated treatment approach.","Choi, Yoon Jeong; Smaldone, Arlene M",The Diabetes educator,https://doi.org/10.1177/0145721717747880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29284354/,469

In view of the increased bacteria resistance caused by overuse or improper use of antibiotics, antibacterial biomaterials are developed as the substitutes for antibiotics in some cases. Among them, antibacterial hydrogels are attracting more and more attention due to easy preparation process and diversity of structures by changing their chemical cross-linkers via covalent bonds or noncovalent physical interactions, which can endow them with various specific functions such as high toughness and stretchability, injectability, self-healing, tissue adhesiveness and rapid hemostasis, easy loading and controlled drug release, superior biocompatibility and antioxidation as well as good conductivity. In this review, the recent progress of antibacterial hydrogel including the fabrication methodologies, interior structures, performances, antibacterial mechanisms, and applications of various antibacterial hydrogels is summarized. According to the bacteria-killing modes of hydrogels, several representative hydrogels such as silver nanoparticles-based hydrogel, photoresponsive hydrogel including photothermal and photocatalytic, self-bacteria-killing hydrogel such as inherent antibacterial peptides and cationic polymers, and antibiotics-loading hydrogel are focused on. Furthermore, current challenges of antibacterial hydrogels are discussed and future perspectives in this field are also proposed.","Cao, Zhongming; Luo, Yue; Li, Zhaoyang; Tan, Lei; Liu, Xiangmei; Li, Changyi; Zheng, Yufeng; Cui, Zhenduo; Yeung, Kelvin Wai Kwok; Liang, Yanqin; Zhu, Shengli; Wu, Shuilin",Macromolecular bioscience,https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.202000252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881309/,469

A retrospective cohort study of 1647 women.,2020-10-02,"Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused widespread clinical disease, triggering limited in-person gatherings and social-distancing guidelines to minimize transmission. These regulations led most emergency medicine (EM) residency training programs to rapidly transition to virtual didactics. We sought to evaluate EM resident perceptions of the effects of COVID-19 on their didactic and clinical education. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey study at seven EM residency programs using a mixed-methods approach designed to understand resident perceptions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their educational experience. Quantitative data were presented as percentages with comparison of subgroups, while open-ended responses were analyzed using qualitative methodology. Results We achieved a 59% response rate (187/313). The majority of respondents (119/182, 65.4%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on their residency education with junior residents disproportionately affected. A total of 81 of 182 (44.5%) participants reported that one or more of their clinical rotations were partially or completely canceled due to the pandemic. Additionally, we identified four themes and 34 subthemes highlighting the contextual effects of the pandemic, which were then divided into positive and negative influences on the residency experience. The four themes include systems experience, clinical experience, didactic experience, and wellness. Conclusion Our study examined the impact of COVID-19 on residents' educational experiences. We found overall mixed responses with a slightly negative impact on residency education, wellness, and clinical rotations, while satisfaction with EM as a career choice was increased. Factors influencing this included systems, clinical, and didactic experiences as well as overall wellness.","Ford, Tabitha R; Fix, Megan L; Shappell, Eric; Egan, Daniel J; Mannix, Alexandra; Bailitz, John; Li, Xian; Gottlieb, Michael",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124514/,469
91526,The Need for Community Practice to Support Aging in Place during COVID-19.,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND Manual qualitative and quantitative measures of terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution were previously reported to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk. We developed and applied a deep-learning method to yield quantitative measures of TDLU involution in normal breast tissue. We assessed the associations of these automated measures with breast cancer risk factors and risk. METHODS We obtained eight quantitative measures from whole slide images (WSIs) from a benign breast disease (BBD) nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Studies (287 breast cancer cases and 1083 controls). Qualitative assessments of TDLU involution were available for 177 cases and 857 controls. The associations between risk factors and quantitative measures among controls were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age. The relationship between each measure and risk was evaluated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for the matching factors, BBD subtypes, parity, and menopausal status. Qualitative measures and breast cancer risk were evaluated accounting for matching factors and BBD subtypes. RESULTS Menopausal status and parity were significantly associated with all eight measures; select TDLU measures were associated with BBD histological subtype, BMI, and birth index (p<0.05). No measure was correlated with body size at ages 5-10 years, age at menarche, age at first birth, or breastfeeding history (p>0.05). Neither quantitative nor qualitative measures were associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS Among Nurses' Health Studies women diagnosed with BBD, TDLU involution is not a biomarker of subsequent breast cancer. IMPACT TDLU involution may not impact breast cancer risk as previously thought.","Kensler, Kevin H; Liu, Emily Z F; Wetstein, Suzanne C; Onken, Allison M; Luffman, Christina I; Baker, Gabrielle M; Collins, Laura C; Schnitt, Stuart J; Bret-Mounet, Vanessa C; Veta, Mitko; Pluim, Josien P W; Liu, Ying; Colditz, Graham A; Eliassen, A Heather; Hankinson, Susan E; Tamimi, Rulla M; Heng, Yujing J","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-0723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917665/,469

Previous studies have suggested the potential use of olfactometry to identify infected individuals. We performed a sequential olfactometry using the odor stick identification test for Japanese (OSIT-J) in a COVID-19 patient without pneumonia. The test uses 12 odorants that are familiar to the Japanese population. Our patient was a 56-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 who was admitted to our hospital following the development of anosmia. He had no respiratory symptoms except pharyngeal pain. Chest CT findings did not reveal the presence of pneumonia. The patient underwent OSIT-J on the 1st hospital day, and his score was 1 out of 12. Following the olfactometry, ciclesonide was administered. The patient did not develop any new symptoms during hospitalization, and his anosmia was gradually improved. The OSIT-J scores were 9 and 11 on the 7th and 16th hospital day, respectively. The patient was discharged on the 25th hospital day after two negative PCR test results. In our case, OSIT-J could identify anosmia in a COVID-19 patient. Some COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic, expect for olfactory disturbances, and OSIT-J may help identify such patients in the Japanese population.","Asahara, Yuki; Mukai, Taiji; Suda, Machiko; Suzuki, Masahiko",Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,https://doi.org/10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504752/,469

In this report, we use the lung carcinoma-derived cell line, A549, which is genetically viable to express a functional IFNλ4, to address transcriptional requirements of the IFNL4 gene. We show that the GC-rich DNA-binding transcription factor (TF) specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is recruited to the IFNL4 promoter and has a role in induction of gene expression upon stimulation with viral RNA mimic poly(I:C). By using RNAi and overexpression strategies, we also show key roles in IFNL4 gene expression for the virus-inducible TFs, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7. Interestingly, we also observe that overexpression of IFNλ4 influences IFNL4 promoter activity, which may further be dependent on the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor pathway. Together, our work for the first time reports on the functional characterization of the human IFNL4 promoter.","Chinnaswamy, Sreedhar; Bhushan, Anand; Behera, Amit K; Ghosh, Sumona; Rampurkar, Vijay; Chandra, Vikas; Pandit, Bhaswati; Kundu, Tapas K",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2015.0076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684959/,469

The primary end point was survival at day 28. The population consisted of 112 patients (56 treated with anakinra and 56 controls). Survival at day 28 was obtained in 69 patients (61.6%) and was significantly higher in anakinra-treated patients than in the controls (75.0 versus 48.2%, p = 0.007). When stratified by continuous positive airway pressure support at baseline, anakinra-treated patients' survival was also significant compared with the controls (p = 0.008). Univariate analysis identified anakinra usage (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-7.17) as a significant survival predictor. This was not supported by multivariate modeling. The rate of infectious-related adverse events was similar between groups.

The forehead offers an obvious site, but does not present an isothermic surface, as various small arteries passing close to the surface create 'hot-spots'. The aim of this study is to use non-contact infrared (IR) thermometry to determine the link between the temperature at specific facial skin sites and clinical body temperature. A sample of 169 asymptomatic adults (age range 18-54 years) was screened with IR thermometers (Braun Thermoscan proLT for auditory meatus (AM) temperature representing clinical body temperature, and a Raytek, Raynger MX for skin surface temperature). Peak IR skin temperature was measured over the course of each posterior auricular artery (PAA) and each superficial temporal artery (STA). In a sub-group (n = 54) the peak skin temperature of the forehead's metopic region (MR) was also recorded. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between the PAA and STA at 34.2 +/- 0.9 degrees C and 34.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C, respectively, which were 2.5 degrees C cooler than the AM temperature (36.7 +/- 0.5 degrees C, p < 0.001). Although there was no correlation between AM and PAA or STA there was a correlation (r2 = 0.63, p < 0.001) between PAA and STA. There were no asymmetric temperature differences between the left and right sides and males had warmer skin over the MR (F, 33.6 +/- 0.7 degrees C versus M, 34.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C, p < 0.001).

It causes inflammation, expansion and fibrosis of orbital fat, muscles and the lacrimal gland, leading to facial disfigurement, functional disability and, in severe cases, blindness. Overall, approximately 20% of affected patients need some form of surgical intervention requiring anaesthesia. This narrative review explores the background of thyroid eye disease, surgical procedures performed and their implications for anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is used for orbital decompression procedures, strabismus correction surgery and complex oculoplastic procedures. Local anaesthetic infiltration or regional anaesthesia under monitored anaesthesia care are the techniques most commonly employed for eyelid retraction surgery. It is important to limit the volume of local anaesthetic agent used during infiltration and continuously monitor the orbital volume and ocular pressure with a ballottement technique. In addition, the contralateral eye should be checked and, if necessary, protected against corneal exposure. Retrobulbar, peribulbar and sub-Tenon's blocks are best avoided.

Abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFT) after COVID-19 infection have been described. The determinants of these abnormalities are unclear. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarkers and CT scan parameters at the time of infection would be associated with abnormal gas transfer at short term follow-up. METHODS We retrospectively studied subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and discharged. Serum inflammatory biomarkers, CT scan and clinical characteristics were assessed. CT images were evaluated by Functional Respiratory Imaging with automated tissue segmentation algorithms of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature. Volumes of the pulmonary vessels that were ≤5mm (BV5), 5-10mm (BV5_10), and ≥10mm (BV10) in cross sectional area were analyzed. Also the amount of opacification on CT (ground glass opacities). PFT were performed 2-3 months after discharge. The diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) was obtained. We divided subjects into those with a DLCO <80% predicted (Low DLCO) and those with a DLCO ≥80% predicted (Normal DLCO). RESULTS 38 subjects were included in our cohort. 31 out of 38 (81.6%) subjects had a DLCO<80% predicted. The groups were similar in terms of demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, and smoking status. Hemoglobin, inflammatory biomarkers, spirometry and lung volumes were similar between groups. CT opacification and BV5 were not different between groups, but both Low and Normal DLCO groups had lower BV5 measures compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 and BV10 measures were higher in the Low DLCO group compared to the normal DLCO group. Both BV5_10 and BV10 in the Low DLCO group were greater compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 was independently associated with DLCO<80% in multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01, 1.64). BV10 negatively correlated with DLCO% predicted (r = -0.343, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS Abnormalities in pulmonary vascular volumes at the time of hospitalization are independently associated with a low DLCO at follow-up. There was no relationship between inflammatory biomarkers during hospitalization and DLCO. Pulmonary vascular abnormalities during hospitalization for COVID-19 may serve as a biomarker for abnormal gas transfer after COVID-19 pneumonia.","Salerno, Daniel; Oriaku, Ifeoma; Darnell, Melinda; Lanclus, Maarten; De Backer, Jan; Lavon, Ben; Gupta, Rohit; Jaffe, Fredric; Vega Sanchez, Maria Elena; Kim, Victor",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34653196/,469

94394,COVID-19 and the Need for Leadership Training in Psychiatry.,2020-11-06,"BACKGROUND respiratory viral infections account for a considerable proportion of pediatric emergency room visits. Illnesses range in severity from mild upper respiratory tract infections to serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The relationship between viral load and specific viruses to clinical diagnosis made by physicians in this setting is poorly understood. METHODS we applied a real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) panel for 13 common respiratory viruses to 195 frozen, archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens obtained from symptomatic children ≤ 4 months of age presenting to the emergency room. Mean total viral load and number of viruses per archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen were compared between LRTI (n = 70) and non-LRTI (1 or more of upper respiratory tract infection, fever, or cough) (n = 125), as were yield and concordance of qPCR results to viral culture/direct fluorescence assay (DFA). RESULTS children with LRTI had significantly increased total viral load and harbored more viruses than the non-LRTI group. Respiratory syncytial virus-A and -B were significantly associated with LRTI, and parainfluenza virus-1 with non-LRTI. Individual loads of parainfluenza virus-2 and human rhinovirus were increased in LRTI versus non-LRTI. Quantitative PCR yielded more viruses (including coinfections, where a ""dominant virus"" was typically identified) than viral culture/DFA and documented nucleic acid from pathogens not tested by culture/DFA including human rhinovirus; coronaviruses -OC43, -229E, and -NL63; and metapneumovirus. CONCLUSIONS in symptomatic children presenting to the emergency room, total viral load is related to clinical diagnosis; specific viruses are associated with particular clinical diagnoses, and qPCR has a higher yield than other viral diagnostic methods.","Utokaparch, Soraya; Marchant, David; Gosselink, John V; McDonough, John E; Thomas, Eva E; Hogg, James C; Hegele, Richard G",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181ff2fac; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20980931/,469

94971,Current state of trauma and violence in São Paulo - Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021,"KEY POINTS Exercising at different times of day elicits different effects on exercise performance and metabolic health however, the specific signals driving the observed time-of-day specific effects of exercise are not fully identified; Exercise influences the skeletal muscle circadian clock, but the relative contribution of muscle contraction and extracellular signals is unknown; Here we show that contraction acutely increases the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifts Per2 rhythmicity in muscle cells. This contraction effect on core clock genes is mediated through a calcium-dependant mechanism; Our results suggest that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by muscle contraction. Contraction interventions may be used to mimic some time-of-day specific effects of exercise on metabolism and muscle performance. ABSTRACT Exercise entrains the central and peripheral circadian clocks, however, the mechanism by which exercise modulates expression of skeletal muscle clock genes is unclear. Here, our aim was to determine if skeletal muscle contraction alone could directly influence circadian rhythmicity and uncover the underlying mechanism by which contraction modulates clock gene expression. We investigated the expression of core clock genes in human skeletal muscle after acute exercise, as well as following in vitro contraction in mouse soleus muscle and cultured C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Additionally, we interrogated the molecular pathways by which skeletal muscle contraction could influence clock gene expression. Contraction acutely increased the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifted Per2 rhythmicity in C2C12 myotubes in vitro. Further investigation revealed that pharmacologically increasing cytosolic calcium concentrations by ionomycin treatment mimicked the effect of contraction on Per2 expression. Similarly, treatment with the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, blocked the effect of electric pulse stimulation (EPS) induced contraction on Per2 expression. Increased calcium influx from contraction lead to binding of the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to the Per2 promoter, suggesting a role of CREB in contraction-induced Per2 transcription. Thus, by dissociating the effect of muscle contraction alone from the whole effect of exercise, our investigations indicate that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by contraction.

97280,Inequalities in the distribution of the general practice workforce in England: a practice-level longitudinal analysis.,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND The snoRNA host gene SNHG15 produces a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with a short half-life and has been reported to be dysregulated in multiple cancers and has recently been found to be correlated with tumour progression. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the generalised prognostic role of small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in malignancies, based on variable data from different studies. METHODS Four public databases were used to identify eligible studies. The association between prognostic indicators and clinical features was extracted and pooled to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was measured using Begg's test and Egger's test, and the stability of pooled results were measured using sensitivity analysis. Additionally, an online database based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was screened to further validate our results. Ultimately, we predicted the molecular regulation of SNHG15 based on the public databases. RESULTS In total, 11 studies including 1087 patients were ultimately enrolled in our meta-analysis. We found that SNHG15 overexpression was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and this was validated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) cohort. Moreover, increased SNHG15 expression suggested advanced TNM stage and LNM, but was not associated with age, gender, or tumour size. No publication bias or instability of the results was observed. SNHG15 was significantly upregulated in seven cancers and elevated expression of SNHG15 indicated shorter OS and DFS in five malignancies based on the validation using the GEPIA cohort. Further functional prediction indicated that SNHG15 may participate in some cancer-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS Upregulation of lncRNA SNHG15 was notably associated with worse prognosis and clinical features, suggesting that SNHG15 might serve as a novel prognostic factor in various cancers.","Chen, Caizhi; Feng, Yeqian; Wang, Jingjing; Liang, Ye; Zou, Wen",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07649-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243205/,469

98022,Mental Health of Communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumour. They are graded using the WHO classification system, with Grade II-IV astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are WHO Grade II infiltrative brain tumours that typically appear solid and non-enhancing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. People with LGG often have little or no neurologic deficit, so may opt for a watch-and-wait-approach over surgical resection, radiotherapy or both, as surgery can result in early neurologic disability. Occasionally, high-grade gliomas (HGGs, WHO Grade III and IV) may have the same MRI appearance as LGGs. Taking a watch-and-wait approach could be detrimental for the patient if the tumour progresses quickly. Advanced imaging techniques are increasingly used in clinical practice to predict the grade of the tumour and to aid clinical decision of when to intervene surgically. One such advanced imaging technique is magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion, which detects abnormal haemodynamic changes related to increased angiogenesis and vascular permeability, or ""leakiness"" that occur with aggressive tumour histology. These are reflected by changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) expressed as rCBV (ratio of tumoural CBV to normal appearing white matter CBV) and permeability, measured by Ktrans. OBJECTIVES To determine the diagnostic test accuracy of MR perfusion for identifying patients with primary solid and non-enhancing LGGs (WHO Grade II) at first presentation in children and adults. In performing the quantitative analysis for this review, patients with LGGs were considered disease positive while patients with HGGs were considered disease negative.To determine what clinical features and methodological features affect the accuracy of MR perfusion. SEARCH METHODS Our search strategy used two concepts: (1) glioma and the various histologies of interest, and (2) MR perfusion. We used structured search strategies appropriate for each database searched, which included: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index). The most recent search for this review was run on 9 November 2016.We also identified 'grey literature' from online records of conference proceedings from the American College of Radiology, European Society of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology and European Society of Neuroradiology in the last 20 years. SELECTION CRITERIA The titles and abstracts from the search results were screened to obtain full-text articles for inclusion or exclusion. We contacted authors to clarify or obtain missing/unpublished data.We included cross-sectional studies that performed dynamic susceptibility (DSC) or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion or both of untreated LGGs and HGGs, and where rCBV and/or Ktrans values were reported. We selected participants with solid and non-enhancing gliomas who underwent MR perfusion within two months prior to histological confirmation. We excluded studies on participants who received radiation or chemotherapy before MR perfusion, or those without histologic confirmation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data, and assessed the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We present a summary of the study characteristics and QUADAS-2 results, and rate studies as good quality when they have low risk of bias in the domains of reference standard of tissue diagnosis and flow and timing between MR perfusion and tissue diagnosis.In the quantitative analysis, LGGs were considered disease positive, while HGGs were disease negative. The sensitivity refers to the proportion of LGGs detected by MR perfusion, and specificity as the proportion of detected HGGs. We constructed two-by-two tables with true positives and false negatives as the number of correctly and incorrectly diagnosed LGG, respectively, while true negatives and false positives are the number of correctly and incorrectly diagnosed HGG, respectively.Meta-analysis was performed on studies with two-by-two tables, with further sensitivity analysis using good quality studies. Limited data precluded regression analysis to explore heterogeneity but subgroup analysis was performed on tumour histology groups. MAIN RESULTS Seven studies with small sample sizes (4 to 48) met our inclusion criteria. These were mostly conducted in university hospitals and mostly recruited adult patients. All studies performed DSC MR perfusion and described heterogeneous acquisition and post-processing methods. Only one study performed DCE MR perfusion, precluding quantitative analysis.Using patient-level data allowed selection of individual participants relevant to the review, with generally low risks of bias for the participant selection, reference standard and flow and timing domains. Most studies did not use a pre-specified threshold, which was considered a significant source of bias, however this did not affect quantitative analysis as we adopted a common rCBV threshold of 1.75 for the review. Concerns regarding applicability were low.From published and unpublished data, 115 participants were selected and included in the meta-analysis. Average rCBV (range) of 83 LGGs and 32 HGGs were 1.29 (0.01 to 5.10) and 1.89 (0.30 to 6.51), respectively. Using the widely accepted rCBV threshold of <1.75 to differentiate LGG from HGG, the summary sensitivity/specificity estimates were 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.93)/0.48 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.90). Sensitivity analysis using five good quality studies yielded sensitivity/specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.91)/0.67 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.98). Subgroup analysis for tumour histology showed sensitivity/specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.99)/0.42 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.95) in astrocytomas (6 studies, 55 participants) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.93)/0.53 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.88) in oligodendrogliomas+oligoastrocytomas (6 studies, 56 participants). Data were too sparse to investigate any differences across subgroups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The limited available evidence precludes reliable estimation of the performance of DSC MR perfusion-derived rCBV for the identification of grade in untreated solid and non-enhancing LGG from that of HGG. Pooled data yielded a wide range of estimates for both sensitivity (range 66% to 93% for detection of LGGs) and specificity (range 9% to 90% for detection of HGGs). Other clinical and methodological features affecting accuracy of the technique could not be determined from the limited data. A larger sample size of both LGG and HGG, preferably using a standardised scanning approach and with an updated reference standard incorporating molecular profiles, is required for a definite conclusion.","Abrigo, Jill M; Fountain, Daniel M; Provenzale, James M; Law, Eric K; Kwong, Joey Sw; Hart, Michael G; Tam, Wilson Wai San",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011551.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357120/,469

In the present investigation, we aimed to identify novel and potent benzimidazole molecules to overcome the resistance management. A series of 20 benzimidazole derivatives were examined for its activity as selective antitubercular agents. Initially, AutodockVina algorithm was performed to assess the efficacy of the molecules. The results are further enriched by redocking by means of Glide algorithm. The binding free energies of the compounds were then calculated by MM-generalized-born surface area method. Molecular docking studies elucidated that benzimidazole derivatives has revealed formation of hydrogen bond and strong binding affinity in the active site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein. Note that ARG308, GLY189, VAL312, LEU403, and LEU190 amino acid residues of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein PrpR are involved in binding with ligands of benzimidazoles. Interestingly, the ligands exhibited same binding potential to the active site of protein complex PrpR in both the docking programs. In essence, the result portrays that benzimidazole derivatives such as 1p, 1q, and 1 t could be potent and selective antitubercular agents than the standard drug isoniazid. These compounds were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to validate the dynamics activity of the compounds against PrpR. Finally, the inhibitory behavior of compounds was predicted using a machine learning algorithm trained on a data collection of 15,000 compounds utilizing graph-based signatures. Overall, the study concludes that designed benzimidazoles can be employed as antitubercular agents. Indeed, the results are helpful for the experimental biologists to develop safe and non-toxic drugs against tuberculosis.","Rajasekhar, Sreerama; Karuppasamy, Ramanathan; Chanda, Kaushik",Journal of computational chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216033/,469

However, its effectiveness varies across studies and population groups. This may be due to differences in the rate of adherence. Hence, this review aims to examine the level of adherence to NRT and to assess if the level of adherence to NRT affects success of smoking cessation. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using studies retrieved from five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of science, and PsycINFO) and grey literature. Pooled analysis was conducted using Stata version 16 software. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. Analyses were done among those studies that used similar measurements to assess level of adherence and successful smoking cessation. Heterogeneity of studies was assessed using the Higgins' I2 statistical test. Funnel plots and Egger's regression asymmetry test were used to affirm presence of significant publication bias. RESULTS A total of 7521 adult participants of 18 years old and above from 16 studies were included in the analysis. Level of adherence to NRT among participants of randomised controlled trials were found to be 61% (95% CI, 54-68%), p-value of < 0.001 and I2 = 85.5%. Whereas 26% of participants were adherent among participants of population-based studies with 95% CI, 20-32%, p-value of < 0.001 and I2 = 94.5%. Level of adherence was the lowest among pregnant women (22%) with 95% CI, 18-25%, p-value of 0.31 and I2 = 15.8%. Being adherent to NRT doubles the rate of successful quitting (OR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.34-3.51), p-value of < 0.001 and I2 = 77.6%. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights a low level of adherence to NRT among participants of population-based studies and pregnant women as compared to clinical trials. Moreover, the review illustrated a strong association between adherence and successful smoking cessation. Hence, it is recommended to implement and assess large scale interventions to improve adherence. Health programs and policies are recommended to integrate the issue of adherence to NRT as a core component of smoking cessation interventions.

METHODS Three metallic mechanical tacking devices (ProTack, Salute, EndoANCHOR), 4 absorbable tacking devices (AbsorbaTack, PermaSorb, I-Clip, and SorbaFix), and 2 types of fibrin sealant (Tisseel, Artiss) were compared with 0-polypropylene suture. Three constructs from each device or an amount of sealant sufficient to cover a 3 × 3 cm(2) area were used to affix a 4 × 3 cm piece of absorbable barrier-coated mesh (Proceed, Ethicon, Inc) to the peritoneal surface of porcine abdominal wall. Ten samples were completed for each fixation modality. Acute fixation strength was measured via a lap shear test on an Instron tensiometer. RESULTS Acute fixation strength was significantly greater for suture (59.7 7.2 N) compared with all laparoscopic tacking devices and to fibrin sealant (P < .001 for all comparisons). Protack (29.5 ± 2.8 N) was stronger than Absorbatack (13.2 ± 3.7 N; P = .029). Protack, Permasorb, SorbaFix, and I-clip were stronger than fibrin sealant (P < .05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS The acute fixation strengths of metallic or absorbable tacks as well as fibrin sealant are all significantly less than that achieved with polypropylene suture. These factors should be considered in selecting the type of mechanical fixation for patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.","Melman, Lora; Jenkins, Eric D; Deeken, Corey R; Brodt, Michael D; Brown, Shaun R; Brunt, L Michael; Eagon, J Christopher; Frisella, Margaret; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610379427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20817641/,469

We aimed to scope the literature and present what is known, and highlight what is not known, about walking and mental health. METHODS Design: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES Ovid (Medline), ProQuest, Web of Science.Screening and reporting: 13 014 records were identified and screened by a team of researchers. Included full texts were analysed and reported according to mental health outcome. RESULTS For the 8 mental health outcomes (identified a priori), there were a total of 5 systematic reviews and 50 individual papers included. Depression had the most evidence and existing systematic reviews were reported. Evidence for anxiety, psychological stress, psychological well-being, subjective well-being and social isolation and loneliness varied in volume and effectiveness, but no harmful effects were identified. There were no studies for walking and resilience. The setting and context of walking seems to be important variables. CONCLUSION The evidence base that suggests walking benefits mental health is growing, but remains fragmented and incomplete for some important outcomes. Policy and national guidelines should promote the known mental health benefits of increased walking and future research should directly address the gaps we have identified.","Kelly, Paul; Williamson, Chloë; Niven, Ailsa G; Hunter, Ruth; Mutrie, Nanette; Richards, Justin",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2017-098827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29858467/,469

Using validated tools, perceived stress, anxiety, stress response styles, and sleep behaviors of undergraduate and graduate students from seven countries during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized in order to examine the relationships between these factors using mediation and moderation analyses. Students enrolled in universities in China, Ireland, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States were recruited in May 2020. A total of 2254 students completed this cross-sectional study. Perceived stress and anxiety were negatively associated with sleep quality through the mediation of rumination. Increased psychological resilience weakened the relationships between perceived stress and anxiety on sleep quality. The majority of students reported that COVID-19 negatively influenced their mental health and sleep quality but not sleep duration. Based on these results, university students would likely benefit from sleep education and mental health promotion programs that include trainings to increase psychological resilience and reduce rumination, particularly during times of increased stress.","Du, Chen; Zan, Megan Chong Hueh; Cho, Min Jung; Fenton, Jenifer I; Hsiao, Pao Ying; Hsiao, Richard; Keaver, Laura; Lai, Chang-Chi; Lee, HeeSoon; Ludy, Mary-Jon; Shen, Wan; Swee, Winnie Chee Siew; Thrivikraman, Jyothi; Tseng, Kuo-Wei; Tseng, Wei-Chin; Tucker, Robin M",Clocks & sleep,https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep2030025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089208/,469

However, asthma and atopy do not appear to be overrepresented comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, and hypotheses attempt to explain this observation. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, it is imperative to understand how disease outcomes may be influenced in this population to guide patient care. RECENT FINDINGS Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the principal host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMRSS2) is the main priming protease. Models have linked atopic endotypes to reductions in ACE2 and increases in TMRSS2 on respiratory epithelia. Epidemiologic and experimental findings imply alterations in ACE2 expression correlate with clinical COVID-19 disease, but limitations restrict the ability to draw direct conclusions. SUMMARY There is reasonable evidence to assert atopic endotypes modulate COVID-19 susceptibility, but it remains premature to classify this association as protective or deleterious. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies should focus on investigating COVID-19 outcomes by underlying endotype. Direct experimental and clinical evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions on how the complex interplay of ACE2 and TMRSS2 affect viral entry.

Tests were performed with water containing 40 and 24 μg/L soluble lead at pH 7 buffered with 50 mg C/L dissolved inorganic concentration (DIC). The amounts of lead sorbed greatly varied by filter, and only two filter types, polypropylene and mixed cellulose esters, performed well and are recommended.

Of these patients, 54 had no history of pancreatic tumor or surgery and underwent MRI more than 3 months after an episode of acute pancreatitis. In addition, 57 age- and sex-matched control subjects with secretin-enhanced MRCP and ERCP correlation and without a diagnosis of recurrent acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis were enrolled as the control group. All studies were anonymized, and secretin-enhanced MRCP images (image set A) were separated from conventional 2D and 3D MRCP and T2-weighted images (image set B). Image sets A and B for each patient were assigned different and randomized case numbers. Two blinded reviewers independently assessed both image sets for ductal abnormalities and group A image sets for exocrine response to secretin. RESULTS There were statistically significantly more patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis with reduced exocrine function compared with patients in the control group (32% vs 9%; p < 0.01) on secretin-enhanced images. Patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis were more likely to have side branch dilation (p = 0.02; odds ratio, 3.6), but not divisum, compared with the control group. Secretin-enhanced images were superior to non-secretin-enhanced images for detecting ductal abnormalities in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis, with higher sensitivity (76% vs 56%; p = 0.01) and AUC values (0.983 vs 0.760; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Up to one-third of patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis showed exocrine functional abnormalities. Secretin-enhanced MRCP had a significantly higher yield for ductal abnormalities than did conventional MRI and should be part of the MRCP protocol for investigation of patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis.","Sandrasegaran, Kumar; Tahir, Bilal; Barad, Udaykamal; Fogel, Evan; Akisik, Fatih; Tirkes, Temel; Sherman, Stuart",AJR.

Many kinds of psychiatrical and psychological disorders, such as drug abuse, associate with abnormal properties of pupillary light reflex. Thus, the properties of pupillary light reflex could serve as an indicator for drug abuse detection. However, the effect of drug abuse on pupillary light reflex is till unclear. To assess the effects of addictive drugs on pupillary light reflex quantificationally, in the present study, we examined the effects of morphine on pupil diameter and pupillary light reflex in rhesus monkeys. By measuring the pupil diameter at different timing points before and after the administration of morphine, we found that morphine administration reduced the diameter of pupil and decreased the constriction rate. Our present results provide an experimental support for applying the properties of pupillary light reflex as a reference in addicts' detection.","Meng, Zhi-Qiang; Zhang, Yu-Hua; Chen, Nan-Hui; Miao, Ying-Da; Hu, Xin-Tian; Ma, Yuan-Ye",Dong wu xue yan jiu = Zoological research,https://doi.org/10.3724/sp.j.1141.2010.03282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20672416/,469

115303,Latinos and Structural Racism.,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE Many patients with depression respond or remit with current treatments, but often experience persistent distress, in part because they perceive that they have not returned to their normal or premorbid state. Some continue to have a lack of subjective psychological well-being and positive affect following treatment. It would be useful to measure these deficits and explore whether interventions can improve them. Currently, no clinically useful scale has been developed to measure positive affect. To fill this gap, we developed the Clinical Positive Affect Scale (CPAS). METHOD The purpose of this study is to describe the development and validation of the CPAS, a 16-item self-report measurement of self-perceived affective and cognitive correlates of positive affect, in a sample of 300 college students. RESULTS A principal component analysis with varimax rotation showed one major factor of positive affect, with all items revealing high loadings (≥ 0.65) on the single factor. The CPAS also demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.97) and strong part-whole correlations. Finally, the CPAS revealed some degree of divergent validity through moderately strong negative correlations with validated measures of depression, anxiety and drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the validity of the CPAS, which may help clinicians and researchers to assess patients' current self-perceived levels of hedonic capacity and enthusiasm for life.","Nierenberg, Andrew A; Bentley, Kate H; Farabaugh, Amy H; Fava, Maurizio; Deckersbach, Thilo",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867412459810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22990434/,469

Telehealth technology use is established in the ambulatory setting, but not yet widely deployed at scale for inpatient care. OBJECTIVES This article presents and describes our experience with evaluating and implementing inpatient telehealth technologies in a large health care system with the goals of reducing use of PPE while enhancing communication for health care workers and patients. METHODS We discovered use cases for inpatient telehealth revealed as a result of an immense patient surge requiring large volumes of PPE. In response, we assessed various consumer products to address the use cases for our health system. RESULTS We identified 13 use cases and eight device options. During device setup and implementation, challenges and solutions were identified in five areas: security/privacy, device availability and setup, device functionality, physical setup, and workflow and device usage. This enabled deployment of more than 1,800 devices for inpatient telehealth across seven hospitals with positive feedback from health care staff. CONCLUSION Large-scale setup and distribution of consumer devices is feasible for inpatient telehealth use cases. Our experience highlights operational barriers and potential solutions for health systems looking to preserve PPE and enhance vital communication.","Ong, Shawn Y; Stump, Lisa; Zawalich, Matthew; Edwards, Lisa; Stanton, Glynn; Matthews, Michael; Hsiao, Allen L",Applied clinical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147644/,469

Vessel number and size, vascular surface area and vascular leakage are all increased in biopsies from patients with asthma. High levels of VEGF and other angiogenic factors have been detected in tissues and biological samples of patients with asthma and correlate with disease activity and inversely with airway hyper-responsiveness. Inflammation in the lung stimulates the growth of new blood vessels and these contribute to the airway obstruction or airway hyper-responsiveness, or both. Effector cells of inflammation (human lung mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, etc.) are major sources of a vast array of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce vascularity and growth factor expression and might modulate bronchial vascular remodeling in asthma. Specific antagonists to VEGF and other angiogenic factors and their receptors might help to control chronic airway inflammation and vascular remodeling and offer a novel approach for the treatment of chronic inflammatory lung disorders.","Detoraki, A; Granata, F; Staibano, S; Rossi, F W; Marone, G; Genovese, A",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02372.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20415716/,469

In this preliminary study, we compared a simplified method of pulse wave detection from the finger and toe to pulse wave detection from the carotid and radial arteries using applanation tonometry in children and young adults. We hypothesized that the simplified method of PWV measurement would strongly correlate with the standard measurement in different age groups and oxygen conditions. Participants included (a) boys and girls aged 8-12 years and (b) men and women aged 18-40 years. Participants rested supine while carotid and radial artery pulse waves were measured using applanation tonometry and finger and toe pulse waves were simultaneously collected using a Finometer Midi and a piezo-electric pulse transducer, respectively. These measurements were repeated under hypoxic conditions. Finger-toe PWV measurements were strongly correlated to carotid-radial PWV in adults (R=0.58; P=0.011), but not in children (R=0.056; P=0.610). Finger-toe PWV was sensitive enough to show increases in PWV with age (P<0.0001) and hypoxia in children (P<0.0001) and adults (P=0.003). These results indicate that the simplified measurement of finger-toe PWV strongly correlates with the standard measurement of carotid-radial PWV in adults, but not in children. However, finger-toe PWV can be used in either population to determine changes with hypoxia.","Edgell, Heather; Stickland, Michael K; MacLean, Joanna E",Blood pressure monitoring,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbp.0000000000000183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905286/,469

METHODS Clinical and CT imaging data of 43 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital and the cooperative hospital between January 15-30, 2020 were collected (27 male and 16 female). Patients were classified as common type (26 cases, 60%), severe type (14 cases, 33%) or critical type (three cases, 7%) according to the new coronavirus pneumonia treatment scheme (sixth edition). Patient clinical data and CT images were analyzed and evaluated. RESULTS Fever was the main symptom in common type COVID-19 cases (23/26, 88.46%). Both severe and critical type COVID-19 patients had fever and cough symptoms, and dyspnea was observed in all three critical COVID-19 patients. CT manifestations in the common type COVID-19 cohort were bilateral involvement (20/26, 71%), multiple lesions (14/26, 54%), ground-glass density shadow (17/26, 65%), and some cases were accompanied by local consolidation (9/26, 35%), which is consistent with early stage COVID-19 CT performance. CT manifestations in the severe and critical types involved both lungs. Severe COVID-19 cases predominantly consisted of multiple mixed-density lesions (10/14, 71%), and a few patients showed diffuse lung glass density shadows in both lungs (4/14, 29%), which is consistent with the progression stage COVID-19 CT performance. Critical COVID-19 cases exhibited mixed-density lesions, and two cases displayed ""white lung"", which is the CT manifestation at the severe COVID-19 stage. Only one critical COVID-19 patient had pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS The CT manifestations of COVID-19 are specific and there are variations between different clinical types. Thus, CT is an important clinical tool for early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of COVID-19.","Li, Xue-Ying; Zhou, Yang; Kong, Zi-Xuan; Hou, Mei-Dan; Luo, Ning; Sun, Wei-Hang; Huang, Nan; Yang, Chao; Zhang, Ao-Dan; Li, Yu-Shi",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302632/,469

Clinical information about patients undergoing lung resection while infected with this virus and pathological information about early COVID-19 pneumonia are still scarce. CASE PRESENTATION A 69-year-old male patient underwent a right pneumonectomy for squamous cell lung carcinoma. Until the fourth postoperative day, the patient, who had minor radiological changes on chest x-ray, was asymptomatic. From this day, the COVID-19 test, which was performed after the appearance of symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath, lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacity in the left lung on computed tomography, was reported to be positive. The patient was given NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and azithromycin in isolation intensive care, with the diagnosis of severe pneumonia. He was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with healing of the lung lesions. The pathology specimen of the patient, who was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the day of surgery, was examined retrospectively. Irregular and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial thickening, oedema, pronounced protein exudates, diffuse enlargement of the alveolar walls, macrophage infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation, which is an indicator of early organisation, were detected. CONCLUSION We believe that the clinical course and pathology findings obtained after right pneumonectomy in a patient with pre-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia will guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Çınar, Hüseyi N Ulaş; İnce, Özgür; Çelik, Burçin; Saltabaş, Faruk; Özbek, Muharrem",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580215/,469

120868,Financial Outcomes of Interventions Designed to Improve Retirement Savings: A Systematic Review.,2020-12-22,"PURPOSE It has been hypothesized that selenium (Se) can prevent cancer, and that Se deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. However, findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess the association between Se intake and risk of breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). METHODS This study included 145,033 postmenopausal women 50-79 years who completed baseline questionnaires between October 1993 and December 1998, which addressed dietary and supplemental Se intake and breast cancer risk factors. The association between baseline Se intake and incident breast cancer was examined in Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 15.5 years, 9487 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified. Total Se (highest versus lowest quartile: HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92-1.09, Ptrend = 0.66), dietary Se (highest versus lowest quartile: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.08, Ptrend = 0.61), and supplemental Se (yes versus no: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.03) were not associated with breast cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that Se intake is not associated with incident breast cancer among postmenopausal women in the United States. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings by using biomarkers such as toenail Se to reduce the potential for misclassification of Se status.","Guo, Dan; Hendryx, Michael; Liang, Xiaoyun; Manson, JoAnn E; He, Ka; Vitolins, Mara Z; Li, Yueyao; Luo, Juhua",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05764-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607639/,469

METHODS The Government of Spain set up a special committee for the management of EVD, and the Spanish Ministry of Health and foreign health services created an action protocol. Each region is responsible for selecting a reference hospital and an in-house care team to care for patients under investigation. Laboratory-confirmed cases of EVD have to be transferred to the Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid. Predeployment training and follow-up support are required to help personnel work safely and effectively. Simulation-based scenarios were designed to give staff the opportunity to practice before encountering a real-life situation. Lessons learned by each team during debriefings were listed, and a survey administered 3 months later assessed the implementation of practice and system changes. RESULTS Implemented changes were related to clinical practice (eg, teamwork principles application), protocol implementation (eg, addition of new processes and rewriting of confusing parts), and system and workflow (eg, change of shift schedule and rearrangement of room equipment). CONCLUSIONS Simulation can be used to detect needed changes in protocol or guidelines or can be adapted to meet the needs of a specific team.","Rojo, Elena; Oruña, Clara; Sierra, Dolores; García, Gema; Del Moral, Ignacio; Maestre, Jose M",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.1097/sih.0000000000000139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043093/,469

Methods Between January 2014 and June 2019, 18 HCC nodules proximal to the HBDs were included in a US-MR fusion imaging-assisted radiofrequency ablation (RFA) group (study group), while 13 HCC nodules in a similar location were included as a control group. For the study group, the tumor and adjacent bile ducts were outlined on preprocedural MR images. Procedural ablation planning was conducted to assess the feasibility of ablating the tumors while avoiding biliary injury. Such tumors were then ablated under US-MR fusion imaging guidance. The control group nodules were ablated under conventional ultrasound guidance. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between the groups. Results After preprocedural assessment, 14 of 18 patients with tumors that were feasible to ablate underwent US-MR fusion imaging-assisted RFA. No biliary complications were observed in these 14 patients; the complication rate was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (30.8%, 4/13) (P = 0.041). There was no significant difference in the technique efficacy rates [92.9% (13/14) versus 100% (13/13), P = 1] or local progression rates [7.1% (1/14) versus 7.7% (1/13), P = 1] between the study and control groups.

In this study, resting-state and task-based fMRI (rs- and tb-fMRI) were utilized to examine network changes in a pediatric porcine TBI model that has increased predictive potential in the development of novel therapies. rs- and tb-fMRI were performed one day post-TBI in piglets. Activation maps were generated using group independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (sDL). Activation maps were compared to pig reference functional connectivity atlases and evaluated using Pearson spatial correlation coefficients and mean ratios. Nonparametric permutation analyses were used to determine significantly different activation areas between the TBI and healthy control groups. Significantly lower Pearson values and mean ratios were observed in the visual, executive control, and sensorimotor networks for TBI piglets compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed within several specific individual anatomical structures within each network. In conclusion, both rs- and tb-fMRI demonstrate the ability to detect functional connectivity disruptions in a translational TBI piglet model, and these disruptions can be traced to specific affected anatomical structures.","Simchick, Gregory; Scheulin, Kelly M; Sun, Wenwu; Sneed, Sydney E; Fagan, Madison M; Cheek, Savannah R; West, Franklin D; Zhao, Qun",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91853-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117318/,469

Prior research suggests starting a new job is an uncertain experience; we theorize that the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional environmental stressors that affect new hire engagement. First, we hypothesize that the occurrence of COVID-19 and unemployment rates relate negatively to engagement. Second, we theorize that the effects of the pandemic become more disruptive on new hire engagement as they gain tenure within the organization. Third, drawing from strategic management theory, we test whether States that introduce stronger COVID-19 policies help enhance the engagement of new hires. Examining a U.S. national sample of 12,577 newly hired (90 days or less) quick service restaurant employees across 9 months (January-September, 2020), we find support for these hypotheses. Subsequent model comparisons suggest there may be health stressors that shape engagement more strongly than purely economic stressors. These findings may be important because they highlight the experiences of workers more likely to be exposed to the pandemic and affected by COVID-related policies. Should the results generalize to other samples and jobs, this study offers potentially new research directions for understanding relationships between macro stressors and new hire perceptions and socialization. It also offers practical implications by helping organizations understand the importance of explicitly managing job insecurity, particularly in terms of COVID-19 policy.

Various traditional practices associated with their processing and consumption are uncommon and unknown to the present generation, resulting to their underutilization. Methods Qualitative data were obtained through focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews (KIIs), and participant observation. Using a checklist and questionnaire, a total of 120 individuals from 120 randomly selected households in Kilimanjaro and Morogoro regions were interviewed. Results. Underutilised indigenous vegetables from Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions were investigated. Out of 40 vegetables, four underutilised vegetables (UVs), Sunga (Launea cornuta), Kikundembala (Vigna vexillata), Mokiki (Momordica foetida), and Inyiri (Basella alba), were identified, collected, and studied. Over 75% of respondents preferred UVs to exotic species, the likes of cabbage, amaranth, eggplant, pumpkin leaves, and spinach. It was further noted that with the existing myths and fads associated with consumption of UVs, as well as the widespread use of the exotic vegetable species among the modern generation, UVs' future demand is diminishing. Conclusion There are many varieties of UVs in Morogoro and Kilimanjaro regions. However, the UVs are currently showing decreasing demand due to various reasons including difficulties in preparation, low palatability, and negative image to consumers; introduction of exotic species of vegetables was found to further suppress the use of UVs.","Chacha, James S; Laswai, Henry S",International journal of food science,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3529434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832539/,469

There are currently no known factors that predict response to therapy. METHODS This was a retrospective study aimed to evaluate treatment effect grade (TEG) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy and surgery at a single center. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of TEG, scaled from 0 to 3. RESULTS Fifty patients were identified. The majority were male (n = 33) and 50% were Hispanic. The most common regimens given were: 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (n = 23, 46%), epirubicin, cis- or oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or Xeloda (n = 8, 16%), and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (n = 9, 18%). Twenty-seven patients (55%) had complete or partial response to therapy (TEG 0-2), and 23 patients (46%) had no response (TEG 3). Of numerous variables analyzed, only race and SRC histology were associated with TEG. TEG was associated with disease free, but not disease specific survival. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, 46% of patients had no histologic response to therapy. SRC histology, and possibly race, should be considered in determination of optimal multidisciplinary regimens and in amount of therapy to be given upfront, as patients with SRC histology and those of non-Asian race are less likely to respond to standard regimens.","Rajabnejad, Ataollah; Vaida, Florin; Valasek, Mark; Razzaque, Saqib; Fanta, Paul; Horgan, Santiago; Bouvet, Michael; Lowy, Andrew M; Kelly, Kaitlyn J",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735448/,469

127707,To Do or Not to Do: On Being a Medical Student During COVID-19.,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND Given the social distancing adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has been transformed from a convenience into a necessity. The behavioral changes caused by isolation have ranged from adaptation of consumption, work, and teaching routines to leisure options to occupy idle time at home. Such transformations can be positive by expanding the use of digital technologies, but they can also have serious future physical and emotional consequences if there is no conscious use of technological devices. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to validate the BCSDTSD instrument for assessing behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing. METHOD Validation of the BCSDTSD in 5 phases: 1. construction of an initial scale with 10 questions; 2. evaluation of the questions by a panel of experts; 3. application to 1,012 volunteers via the internet; 4. statistical analysis of the results; and 5. preparation of the validated final version of the BCSDTSD. Data analysis used the dplyr, psy, and paran packages and the REdaS statistical program. Three statistical criteria were used in the factor analysis (FA). RESULTS FA confirmed the maintenance of the 10 questions in the questionnaire, confirming its robust construction, and Cronbach's alpha reinforced the internal consistency with a value of 0.725, which is satisfactory for first-application questionnaires. CONCLUSION The BCSDTSD instrument was validated to assess behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing.","Pádua, Mariana Spear King Lins de; King, Anna Lucia Spear; Gonçalves, Lucio Lage; Santos, Hugo Kegler; Rodrigues, Douglas; Nardi, Antônio Egidio",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2020-0173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984201/,469

130159,Impact of Covid-19 physical distancing policies on incidence of intentional self-harm in Western Sydney.,2021-05-03,"Image-guided therapies in the abdomen and pelvis are often hindered by motion artifacts in cone-beam CT (CBCT) arising from complex, non-periodic, deformable organ motion during long scan times (5-30 s). We propose a deformable image-based motion compensation method to address these challenges and improve CBCT guidance. Motion compensation is achieved by selecting a set of small regions of interest in the uncompensated image to minimize a cost function consisting of an autofocus objective and spatiotemporal regularization penalties. Motion trajectories are estimated using an iterative optimization algorithm (CMA-ES) and used to interpolate a 4D spatiotemporal motion vector field. The motion-compensated image is reconstructed using a modified filtered backprojection approach. Being image-based, the method does not require additional input besides the raw CBCT projection data and system geometry that are used for image reconstruction. Experimental studies investigated: (1) various autofocus objective functions, analyzed using a digital phantom with a range of sinusoidal motion magnitude (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mm); (2) spatiotemporal regularization, studied using a CT dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive with deformable sinusoidal motion of variable magnitude (10, 15, 20, 25 mm); and (3) performance in complex anatomy, evaluated in cadavers undergoing simple and complex motion imaged on a CBCT-capable mobile C-arm system (Cios Spin 3D, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Gradient entropy was found to be the best autofocus objective for soft-tissue CBCT, increasing structural similarity (SSIM) by 42%-92% over the range of motion magnitudes investigated. The optimal temporal regularization strength was found to vary widely (0.5-5 mm-2) over the range of motion magnitudes investigated, whereas optimal spatial regularization strength was relatively constant (0.1). In cadaver studies, deformable motion compensation was shown to improve local SSIM by ∼17% for simple motion and ∼21% for complex motion and provided strong visual improvement of motion artifacts (reduction of blurring and streaks and improved visibility of soft-tissue edges). The studies demonstrate the robustness of deformable motion compensation to a range of motion magnitudes, frequencies, and other factors (e.g. truncation and scatter).","Capostagno, S; Sisniega, A; Stayman, J W; Ehtiati, T; Weiss, C R; Siewerdsen, J H",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb16e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594993/,469

We have used indocyanine green (ICG)-videoangiography to study intraoperatively the flow inside the SOV in two cases of indirect CCF. In this paper, we report the operative technique and the result of ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV for endovascular treatment of CCF. Two male patients, of 59 and 66 years of age respectively, presented at our Institution with right decreased visual acuity, persistent binocular diplopia and painful ophthalmoplegia, chemosis and proptosis, due to right unilateral indirect CCF fistula. The endovascular transvenous approach failed in one case due to thrombosis of the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) and the extreme tortuosity of the angular vein. In the other case, it was considered unfeasible due to an unfavourable vascular angioarchitecture. For this reason, an ICG videoangiographic-guided cannulation of the SOV, followed by endovascular obliteration of the CCF, was performed. CCF was cured in both cases with this approach. No additional neurological deficits and no complications due to SOV cannulation were registered during the hospital stay. There were no fistula recurrences during the mean follow-up of 18 months. ICG-videoangiography is a simple, fast and cost-effective technique that can be reliably applied in SOV cannulation for subsequent indirect CCF embolization.","Acerbi, Francesco; Farago, Giuseppe; Broggi, Morgan; Cavallo, Claudio; Ranieri, Michela; Caldiera, Valentina; Ciceri, Elisa; Ferroli, Paolo",Turkish neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.5137/1019-5149.jtn.18213-16.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593848/,469

METHOD Subjects lay supine on a couch with a calf compressor on each leg. Peak flow velocities in the PV were measured by duplex ultrasound during activation of the compressor, when the knee was either flexed or hyperextended. Hyperextension of the knee is seen when the heel is elevated to prevent heel pressure ulcers. RESULTS The results were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. This showed a significant increase in peak flow measurements related to narrowing of the PV when the knee was hyperextended. CONCLUSION There is a functional narrowing of the PV during hyperextension of the knee. We developed a model, which postulates an increase in the risk of deep vein thrombosis in patients whose knee is hyperextended. Based on this model, we suggest that the knee should be flexed slightly when patients are supine and anaesthetized.","Levine, A; Huber, J; Huber, D",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1258/phleb.2010.010035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576706/,469

However, the most appropriate recanalization strategy in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is still controversial. This study aimed to assess outcomes of patients with BAO at an academic stroke center in Brazil. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with BAO from a prospective stroke registry at Ribeirão Preto Medical School. Primary outcomes were mortality and favorable outcome (modified Rankin score [mRS] ≤3) at 90 days. After univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of primary outcomes. RESULTS Between August 2004 and December 2015, 63 (65% male) patients with BAO and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 31 (interquartile range: 19-36) were identified. Twenty-nine (46%) patients received no acute recanalization therapy, 15 (24%) received IVT, and 19 (30%) received EVT (68% treated with stent retrievers). Twenty-four (83%) patients treated conservatively died, and only 2 (7%) achieved an mRS less than or equal to 3. Among patients treated with acute recanalization therapies, 15 (44%) died, and 9 (26.5%) had a favorable outcome. On multivariate analysis, baseline systolic blood pressure (odds ratio [OR] = .97; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .95-0.99; P = .023), posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (OR = .62; 95% CI: .41-0.94; P = .026), and successful recanalization (OR = .18; 95% CI: .04-0.71; P = .015) were independent predictors of lower mortality. Baseline NIHSS (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.08-1.82; P = .012), prior use of statins (OR = .003; 95% CI: .001-0.28; P = .012), and successful recanalization (OR = .05; 95% CI: .001-0.27; P = .009) were independent predictors of favorable outcome.

Although the impact of hiatal reinforcement on long-term recurrence remains controversial, the main limitation of this approach has been the risk of adverse events related with the use of synthetic materials in the vicinity of the esophagus. METHODS A total of 14 female domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic primary hiatal hernia repair of a simulated defect in the esophageal hiatus. Seven of the hiatal repairs were reinforced with an extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold, whereas the remaining seven served as primary repair controls. Animals were survived for 8 wk. At necropsy, after gross morphologic evaluation, samples were sent for mechanical testing and histology. RESULTS The repaired defect site reinforced with ECM scaffolds showed a robust closure of the crura in all cases with a smooth peritoneal-like structure covering the entire repair. Average load at failure of the treated group was found to be significantly stronger than that of the controls (185.8 ± 149.7 g versus 57.5 ± 57.5 g, P < 0.05). Similarly, the stiffness was significantly higher in the treated animals (57.5 ± 26.9 g/mm versus 19.1 ± 17.5 g/mm; P < 0.01). Interestingly, there was no difference in elongation at failure (7.62 ± 2.02 mm versus 7.87 ± 3.28 mm; P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS In our animal survival model, we have provided evidence that the addition of an ECM to augment a primary hiatal repair leads to tissue characteristics that may decrease the possibility of early failure of the repair. This may translate to decreased recurrence rates.

The purpose of this study is to identify the published literature on how this tool applies to the prediction of cerebral palsy in term and late-preterm infants diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy and so detect the research gaps. METHODS We will conduct a systematic scoping review for data on sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value and describe the strengths and limitations of the results. This review will consider studies that included infants more than or equal to 34 + 0 weeks gestational age, diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy, with a General Movements Assessment done between birth to six months of life and an assessment for cerebral palsy by at least 2 years of age. Experimental and quasi-experimental study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, before and after studies, interrupted time-series studies and systematic reviews will be considered. Case reports, case series, case control, and cross-sectional studies will be included. Text, opinion papers, and animal studies will not be considered for inclusion in this scoping review as this is a highly specific and medical topic. Studies in the English language only will be considered.

These raw materials were composted with laboratory equipment, which was controlled at 60℃ after the temperature peak by autothermal composting. Clopyralid concentration did not changed during composting in the thermophilic phase; on the contrary, it increased because clopyralid accumulated in compost when recycled compost was used repeatedly as a bulking agent. The clopyralid accumulation ratio (ratio of clopyralid concentration to that in the first compost) could be explained by a model using a recurrence formula, and a correlation existed between the calculated (model) accumulation ratios and measured accumulation ratios (R2 = 0.78). Using this model, the excessive accumulation of clopyralid could be controlled when using recycled compost as a bulking agent with lower moisture content or when part of the recycled compost was replaced by another bulking agent, even if recycled compost had high moisture content.

Colovaginal anastomosis is a surgical error which should not occur. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 39-year old woman underwent low anterior resection with double stapling technique, for rectal carcinoma in the City Hospital. On the fifth postoperative day she noticed passage of gas and two days later passage of feces from vagina. The surgeons who performed the operation explained to her that it is a normal condition for such modern procedure that is supervised by international educator engaged by the Government. The patient lived with this condition, passage of gas and feces from the vagina and nothing from anus for three months when her oncologist referred her for a second opinion at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. The digital examinations revealed a blind rectal stump, and feces in vagina; thus having the patient's history in mind, we assumed that the patient had a colovaginal anastomosis. Our assumption was confirmed by two succeeding radiological examinations. Initially, water soluble contrast enema was performed to assess the colon, when a clear-cut blind rectal stump was detected. Afterwards, the vaginography revealed a copious flow of contrast material from the vagina toward the sigmoid colon. After a few days, a restorative surgery was done. DISCUSSION Most of the early postoperative complications are a result of surgical errors. CONCLUSION We believe that there is no excuse for such a surgical error and postoperative follow-up.","Panovski, Milcho; Sazdovska, Ivana Roso; Fildisevski, Igor; Dzambaz, Darko; Spirov, Vasilcho",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2014.12.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590648/,469

144363,Should skin picking disorder be considered a diagnostic category? A systematic review of the evidence.,2019,"OBJECTIVES To estimate population need and coverage for distance glasses, hearing aids and wheelchairs in India and Cameroon; and to explore the relationship between assistive product (AP) need measured through self-report and clinical impairment assessment. METHODS Population based surveys of approximately 4000 people each were conducted in Mahabubnagar district, India and Fundong district, Cameroon. Participants underwent standardised vision, hearing and musculoskeletal impairment assessment to assess need for distance glasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs. Participants with moderate or worse impairment and/or self-reported difficulties in functioning were also asked about their self-reported AP need. RESULTS 6.5% (95% CI 5.4-7.9) in India and 1.9% (95% CI 1.5-2.4) in Cameroon of the population needed at least one of the three APs based on moderate or worse impairments. Total need was highest for distance glasses [3.7% (95% CI 2.8-4.7) India; 0.8% (95% CI 0.5-1.1), Cameroon] and lowest for wheelchairs (0.1% both settings; 95% CI 0.03-0.3 India, 95% CI 0.04-0.3 Cameroon). Coverage for each AP was below 40%, except for distance glasses in India, where it was 87% (95% CI 77.1-93.0). The agreement between self-report and clinical impairment assessment of AP need was poor. For instance, in India, 60% of people identified through clinical assessment as needing distance glasses did not self-report a need. Conversely, in India, 75% of people who self-reported needing distance glasses did not require one based on clinical impairment assessment. CONCLUSIONS There is high need and low supply of three APs in two low-and middle-income settings. Methodological shortcomings highlight the need for improved survey methods compatible with the international classification of functioning, disability and health to estimate population-level need for AP and related services to inform advocacy and planning.","Boggs, Dorothy; Kuper, Hannah; Mactaggart, Islay; Murthy, Gvs; Oye, Joseph; Polack, Sarah",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166008/,469

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of the interventional radiology database and electronic medical records of 120 patients who had tunneled dialysis catheters inserted from April 1997 to July 2010 was performed with institutional review board approval. There were 61 female patients and 59 male patients, with a mean age of 13.3 years (range, 0.2-28.5 y). A total of 193 primary insertions and 330 salvage procedures were performed. RESULTS The technical success rate for primary catheter insertions was 100%. Immediate complications included self-limiting tract bleeding and air embolism in two of 193 insertions each (1.03%). Mean indwell duration for primary insertions was 66 catheter-days (range, 1-765 d), compared with a total mean of 159.4 catheter-days (range, 1-1,034 d). Rates of infection and mechanical complications were 0.21 and 0.9 per 100 total catheter-days, respectively. Mechanical and infections complications were increased in children younger than 9 years of age and weighing less than 20 kg. The catheter removal rates for infection and mechanical complications were 0.084 and 0.081 per 100 catheter-days, respectively. Medical salvage procedures, ie, intracatheter thrombolytic agent use or antibiotic therapy (52.1%) and interventional radiologic catheter salvage procedures (47.1%), increased catheter survival by an average of 54.8 days (range, 0-959 d). CONCLUSIONS Radiologic placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheters is a safe and technically successful procedure in pediatric patients. However, there is a high rate of infectious and mechanical complications, particularly in younger and smaller patients.","Adeb, Melkamu; Baskin, Kevin M; Keller, Marc S; Krishnamurthy, Ganesh; Nijs, Els; Meyers, Kevin; Pradhan, Madhura; Cahill, Anne Marie",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2012.01.075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459877/,469

The model is applied to a limited thickness, cancerous layer problem. The problem was solved analytically in the transformed domain using Laplace transform as a tool. The exact solution is obtained in the context of transformation Laplace. Numerical results are given and illustrated graphically for the distributions of temperature, displacement, and stress.

150287,The Virtual Match: A New Approach to Celebrating Students During Social Distancing Due to COVID-19.,2020-08-05,"Lytic infection with the two human gammaherpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), leads to significant depletion of the cellular transcriptome. This host shutoff phenotype is driven by the conserved herpesviral alkaline exonuclease, termed SOX in KSHV and BGLF5 in EBV, which in gammaherpesviruses has evolved the genetically separable ability to target cellular mRNA. We now show that host shutoff is also a prominent consequence of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection, which is widely used as a model system to study pathogenesis of these viruses in vivo. The effector of MHV68-induced host shutoff is its SOX homolog, here termed muSOX. There is remarkable functional conservation of muSOX host shutoff activities with those of KSHV SOX, including the recently described ability of SOX to induce mRNA hyperadenylation in the nucleus as well as cause nuclear relocalization of the poly(A) binding protein. SOX and muSOX localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. Using spatially restricted variants of these proteins, we go on to demonstrate that all known host shutoff-related activities of SOX and muSOX are orchestrated exclusively from the cytoplasm. These results have important mechanistic implications for how SOX and muSOX target nascent cellular transcripts in the nucleus. Furthermore, our findings establish MHV68 as a new, genetically tractable model to study host shutoff.","Covarrubias, Sergio; Richner, Justin M; Clyde, Karen; Lee, Yeon J; Glaunsinger, Britt A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01051-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19587049/,469

Bi, as a nontoxic and inexpensive diamagnetic heavy metal, has been used for the fabrication of various nanoparticles (NPs) with unique structural, physicochemical, and compositional features to combine various properties, such as a favourably high X-ray attenuation coefficient and near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, excellent light-to-heat conversion efficiency, and a long circulation half-life. These features have rendered bismuth-containing nanoparticles (BiNPs) with desirable performance for combined cancer therapy, photothermal and radiation therapy (RT), multimodal imaging, theranostics, drug delivery, biosensing, and tissue engineering. Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOx, where X is Cl, Br or I) and bismuth chalcogenides, including bismuth oxide, bismuth sulfide, bismuth selenide, and bismuth telluride, have been heavily investigated for therapeutic purposes. The pharmacokinetics of these BiNPs can be easily improved via the facile modification of their surfaces with biocompatible polymers and proteins, resulting in enhanced colloidal stability, extended blood circulation, and reduced toxicity. Desirable antibacterial effects, bone regeneration potential, and tumor growth suppression under NIR laser radiation are the main biomedical research areas involving BiNPs that have opened up a new paradigm for their future clinical translation. This review emphasizes the synthesis and state-of-the-art progress related to the biomedical applications of BiNPs with different structures, sizes, and compositions.

On the other hand, the impact of COVID-19 on patients with MS and disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is unknown. We report on a female patient who was treated with interferon beta 1a (IFNB-1a) for many years for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) until December 2018. She developed COVID 19 infection in April 2020, after giving birth to a healthy baby girl, five weeks before. She developed a mild right hemiparesis 2 weeks later, without cold symptoms. On admission, PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and she received antivirals and corticotherapy. One month later, specific IgG and IgM antibodies were negative. The patient did not develop immunity to COVID-19 infection. This report raises several problems. The focal deficit could be a real relapse or a pseudo-relapse due to SARS-CoV-2 and postpartum patient vulnerability. The treatment options in this particular case raise many challenges. The absence of antibodies after a SARS-CoV-2 infection raises a big question over the acquired immunity, the increased risk of reinfection, and the subsequent evolution of MS. The standard of care for a woman with MS and COVID-19 infection during the postpartum period must be explored and more precise recommendations must be established in the future.","Florea, Anca Alexandra; Sirbu, Carmen Adella; Ghinescu, Minerva Claudia; Plesa, Cristina Florentina; Sirbu, Anca Maria; Mitrica, Marian; Ionita-Radu, Florentina",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.9524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363603/,469

We have analysed the postoperative morbidity, mortality and risk factors in a consecutive series of 228 segmentectomies performed in our department. METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2011, 221 patients underwent 228 segmentectomies. There were 99 women (45%) and 122 men (55%). The mean age was 61 years (range 18-86 years). The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 87%, and 30 patients had an FEV1 of ≤60%. Fifty-seven patients had a previous history of pulmonary resection. Indications for segmentectomy were: primary lung cancer (111 cases), metastases (71 cases), benign non-infectious (25 cases) and benign infectious diseases (21 cases). The approach was a posterolateral thoracotomy (Group PLT) in 146 patients (64%) and a thoracoscopy (Group TS) in 82 (36%). The two groups were homogenous in terms of age, gender, indications of surgery and type of segmentectomy. RESULTS The mortality rate at 3 months was 1.3% (3 patients). The overall complication rate was 34%. Ten patients were reoperated for the following reasons: haemothorax (4 cases), ischaemia of the remaining segment (3 cases), active bleeding (1 case), prolonged air leak (1 case) and dehiscence of thoracotomy (1 case). The average duration of drainage was 5 days (range 1-34 days) and the average length of stay was 9 days (range 3-126 days). On univariate analysis, FEV1, male gender and thoracotomy were statistically significant risk factors for complications. On multivariate analysis, the same three predictive factors of complications independently of age were found statistically significant: preoperative FEV1 < 60% [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% CI (2.5-13.7), P < 0.001] male gender [OR = 2.04, 95% CI (1.2-3.6), P < 0.013] and thoracotomy [OR = 2.14, 95% CI (1.33-3.46), P = 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary anatomical segmentectomies have an acceptable morbidity rate. Postoperative complications are more likely to develop in male gender patients, with FEV1 ≤ 60% and operated by open surgery.","Traibi, Akram; Grigoroiu, Madalina; Boulitrop, Celia; Urena, Anna; Masuet-Aumatell, Cristina; Brian, Emmanuel; Stern, Jean-Baptiste; Zaimi, Rym; Gossot, Dominique",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivt292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864580/,469

METHODS This is an institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant retrospective study of all patients treated with computed tomography guided RFA for multifocal renal neoplasms at one institution. Fifty-seven subjects, mean age 70 (range 37-88) years, underwent RFA of 169 renal neoplasms (average size 2.0 cm). Subjects had between 2 and 8 (mean 2.96) neoplasms ablated. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was measured before and after RFA. Complications related to RFA were recorded. RESULTS eGFR decreased on average of 4.4 % per tumor treated and 6.7 % per ablation session (average 1.76 tumors treated per session). For subjects with the largest neoplasm measuring >3 cm, eGFR decreased an average of 14.5 % during the course of their treatment. If the largest neoplasm measured 2-3 cm, eGFR decreased an average of 7.7 %, and if the largest neoplasm measured <2 cm, eGFR decreased an average of 3.8 %. Subjects with reduced baseline renal function were more likely to have a greater decline in eGFR after RFA. There was a minor complication rate of 6.3 % (6 of 96 sessions), none of which required treatment, and a major complication rate of 4.2 % (4 of 96 sessions).

In this study, water samples were collected before, during, and after flushing showers in five unoccupied (i.e., for ∼2 months) university buildings with quantification of opportunists via a cultivation-based assay (Legionella pneumophila only) and quantitative PCR. L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), the estimated risks of illness from exposure to L. pneumophila and MAC via showering were generally low (i.e., less than a 10-7 daily risk threshold), with the exception of systemic infection risk from MAC exposure in some buildings. Flushing rapidly restored the total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased bacterial gene targets to building inlet concentrations within 30 min. During the postflush stagnation period, the residual chlorine dissipated within a few days and bacteria rebounded, approaching preflush concentrations after 6-7 days. These results suggest that flushing can quickly improve water quality in unoccupied buildings, but the improvement may only last a few days.","Hozalski, Raymond M; LaPara, Timothy M; Zhao, Xiaotian; Kim, Taegyu; Waak, Michael B; Burch, Tucker; McCarty, Michael",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c06357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232602/,469

We intend to outline the current radiation therapy methods that are employed to treat uveal melanoma. We will outline their relative benefits over one another. We will also provide some background about radiation therapy in general to accustom the ophthalmologists likely reading this review. RECENT FINDINGS Four main options exist for radiation therapy of uveal melanoma. Because the eye is a small space, and because melanomas are relatively radioresistant, oncologists treating uveal melanoma must deliver highly focused doses in high amounts to a small space. Therapies incorporating external beams include proton beam therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery comes in two forms, gamma knife therapy and cyberknife therapy. Radiation may also be placed directly on the eye surgically via plaque brachytherapy. All methods have been used effectively to treat uveal melanoma. SUMMARY Each particular radiotherapy technique employed to treat uveal melanoma has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. The ocular oncologist can choose amongst these therapies based upon his or her clinical judgment of the relative risks and benefits. Availability of the therapy and cost to the patient remain significant factors in the ocular oncologist's choice.","Reichstein, David A; Brock, Anderson L",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769328/,469

160137,COVID-19 Pandemic: Workforce Implications for Gerontological Social Work.,2020-06-05,"OBJECTIVE Nutrition therapy is an integral part of self-management education in patients with type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index are recommended, but the ideal amount of carbohydrate in the diet is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis comparing diets containing low to moderate amounts of carbohydrate (LCD) (energy percentage below 45%) to diets containing high amounts of carbohydrate (HCD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We systematically reviewed Cochrane library databases, EMBASE, and MEDLINE in the period 2004-2014 for guidelines, meta-analyses, and randomized trials assessing the outcomes HbA1c, BMI, weight, LDL cholesterol, quality of life (QoL), and attrition. RESULTS We identified 10 randomized trials comprising 1376 participants in total. In the first year of intervention, LCD was followed by a 0.34% lower HbA1c (3.7 mmol/mol) compared with HCD (95% CI 0.06 (0.7 mmol/mol), 0.63 (6.9 mmol/mol)). The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater the glucose-lowering effect (R=-0.85, p<0.01). At 1 year or later, however, HbA1c was similar in the 2 diet groups. The effect of the 2 types of diet on BMI/body weight, LDL cholesterol, QoL, and attrition rate was similar throughout interventions. LIMITATIONS Glucose-lowering medication, the nutrition therapy, the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, glycemic index, fat and protein intake, baseline HbA1c, and adherence to the prescribed diets could all have affected the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Low to moderate carbohydrate diets have greater effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes compared with high-carbohydrate diets in the first year of intervention. The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater glucose lowering, a relationship that has not been demonstrated earlier. Apart from this lowering of HbA1c over the short term, there is no superiority of low-carbohydrate diets in terms of glycemic control, weight, or LDL cholesterol.","Snorgaard, Ole; Poulsen, Grith M; Andersen, Henning K; Astrup, Arne",BMJ open diabetes research & care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2016-000354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316796/,469

STUDY DESIGN A case-control study: LS using tackers (n=35, tacker group) compared with LS using sutures (n=65, suture group). In addition to clinical evaluation of prolapse, all patients were evaluated for urinary incontinence (ICIQ-SF), dorsolumbar pain, overall quality of life (SF-36 score), and overall improvement in symptoms (PGI-I), one year after LS. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, initial stage of prolapse,…) were comparable in the two groups, as was operating time (240 vs. 210min, p=0.18). There was no significant between-group difference in terms of anatomical correction (median post-operative ICS stage: 0 in both groups, p=0.26) or post-operative complication rates. The incidence of de novo low back pain appearing after LS was equivalent in both groups (50% vs. 25%, in the tacker and suture groups, respectively, p=0.11). However, there was a significant difference in lumbar pain intensity evaluated using the visual analog scale (4 (IQR 0-6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-4) in the tacker and suture groups, respectively; p=0.01), and in post-operative quality of life, which was better in patients in the suture group according to all the questionnaires. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the use of tackers for prosthesis fixation to the promontory does not increase the incidence of post-operative dorsolumbar pain, but may increase its intensity and decrease quality of life.","Vieillefosse, Sarah; Thubert, Thibault; Dache, Arnaud; Hermieu, Jean-François; Deffieux, Xavier","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2015.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748488/,469

It is caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel Phlebovirus in family Bunyaviridae. Although the viral pathogenesis remains largely unknown, hemopoietic cells appear to be targeted by the virus. In this study we report that human monocytes were susceptible to SFTSV, which replicated efficiently, as shown by an immunofluorescence assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We examined host responses in the infected cells and found that antiviral interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible proteins were induced upon infection. However, our data also indicated that downregulation of key molecules such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or weakened activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-κB responses may contribute to a restricted innate immunity against the infection. NSs, the nonstructural protein encoded by the S segment, suppressed the beta interferon (IFN-β) and NF-κB promoter activities, although NF-κB activation appears to facilitate SFTSV replication in human monocytes. NSs was found to be associated with TBK1 and may inhibit the activation of downstream IRF and NF-κB signaling through this interaction. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the nucleoprotein (N), also encoded by the S segment, exhibited a suppressive effect on the activation of IFN-β and NF-κB signaling as well. Infected monocytes, mainly intact and free of apoptosis, may likely be implicated in persistent viral infection, spreading the virus to the circulation and causing primary viremia. Our findings provide the first evidence in dissecting the host responses in monocytes and understanding viral pathogenesis in humans infected with a novel deadly Bunyavirus.","Qu, Bingqian; Qi, Xian; Wu, Xiaodong; Liang, Mifang; Li, Chuan; Cardona, Carol J; Xu, Wayne; Tang, Fenyang; Li, Zhifeng; Wu, Bing; Powell, Kira; Wegner, Marta; Li, Dexin; Xing, Zheng",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00612-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22623799/,469

Correction methods are usually based on simulations approximating biophysical chemistry, making them computationally expensive and often not correcting all clashes. Results We propose a computationally fast data-driven statistical method yielding suites free from within-suite clashes: From such a clash free training data set, devising mode hunting after torus PCA on adaptive cutting average linkage tree clustering (MINTAGE), we learn RNA suite shapes. With classification based on multiscale structure enhancement (CLEAN), for a given clash suite we determine its neighborhood on a mesoscopic scale involving several suites. As corrected suite we propose the Fréchet mean on a torus of the largest classes in this neighborhood. We validate CLEAN MINTAGE on a benchmark data set, compare it to a state of the art correction method and apply it, as proof of concept, to two exemplary suites adjacent to helical pieces of the frameshift stimulation element of SARS-CoV-2 which are difficult to reconstruct. In contrast to a recent reconstruction proposing several different structure models, CLEAN MINTAGE unanimously proposes structure corrections within the same clash free class for all suites.

A case study of the Polish Public Prosecutor's office,2021,"Poor efficacy of seasonal influenza virus vaccines is often attributed to pre-existing immunity interfering with the persistence and maturation of vaccine-induced B cell responses.1 Consistent with this notion, no significant increase in somatic hypermutation (SHM) among circulating influenza-binding lineages was detected following seasonal vaccination in humans.2 A more recent study showed that at least a subset of vaccine-induced B cell lineages are recruited into germinal centers (GCs) following vaccination, suggesting that affinity maturation of these lineages can occur.3 Crucially, however, it has not been demonstrated whether these GC-engaged lineages actually accumulate additional SHM. Here, we address this point using a phylogenetic test of measurable evolution. We first validate this test through simulations and demonstrate measurable B cell evolution in known examples of affinity maturation such as the response to HIV infection. We then show that lineages in the blood are rarely measurably evolving following influenza vaccination, but that GC-engaged lineages - likely derived from memory B cells - are frequently measurably evolving. These findings confirm that seasonal influenza virus vaccination can stimulate additional SHM among responding B cell lineages.","Hoehn, Kenneth B.; Turner, Jackson S.; Miller, Frederick I.; Jiang, Ruoyi; Pybus, Oliver G.; Ellebedy, Ali H.; Kleinstein, Steven H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425648,469

KTx recipients with BKPyV reactivation mount a robust humoral response, but this often fails to clear the virus. In order to characterize the BKPyV-specific B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in KTx recipients, we used fluorescence-labeled BKPyV virus-like particles (VLPs) to sort with BKPyV-specific B-cells, then single-cell RNAseq to obtain paired heavy and light chain antibody sequences, and gene transcriptome data. The BCR repertoire was highly diverse in terms of both V-gene usage and clonotype diversity, with approximately 3% repertoire overlap between patients. The BKPyV-specific response was characterized by the presence of both memory IgG and memory IgM B-cells with extensive somatic hypermutation, which expressed distinct BCR repertoires within the same patient. The gene expression profile of IgG and IgM memory B-cells was highly similar, with only 19 genes, including CD83, CD79A and PARP1 showing significant differential expression. These results confirm that the IgM memory B-cells are a significant component of the BKPyV-specific humoral response, and show for the first time that IgG and IgM repertoires directed against the same antigen can have significant differences.","NGUYEN, N.-K.; Gautreau-Rolland, L.; Devilder, M.-C.; Fourgeux, C.; Sinha, D.; Poschmann, J.; Hourmant, M.; Bressollette-Bodin, C.; Saulquin, X.; McILROY, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.04.21250913v1?rss=1,469

It has been widely spread worldwide. At present, the situation of novel coronavirus epidemic prevention and control in China is still bleak. Waste disposal for the novel coronavirus should be standardized, a necessary measure for avoiding the re-spread of novel coronavirus and preventing secondary disasters. The management and disposal of medical waste is increasingly valued worldwide. International organizations represented by WHO are actively providing developing countries with comprehensive medical waste management and disposal systems to protect the health and environmental safety of people in more countries. The current investigation has found that there may be novel coronavirus in the medical waste. If the medical waste generated from the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients is not properly disposed of, it is likely to cause the novel pneumonia epidemic to break out again. Effective management of medical waste disposal related to novel coronavirus pneumonia is an essential requirement for the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia in medical waste disposal institutions.

Recent studies advocate in favor of the significant role that SNSs have in promoting well-being and, more importantly, in disseminating reliable information during a global crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the growing importance of SNSs to the global framework, the main purpose of this study is to empirically assess the link between the use of symmetric social networks such as Facebook, or asymmetric social networks, like Instagram, and the level of satisfaction, employing the methodology of structural equation modeling. The results of the research validate the hypothesis that SNS activities increase the level of satisfaction, and therefore, that there is a direct link between the number of posts and comments and the level of satisfaction. Furthermore, based on the reversible and significant link between the level of satisfaction and the importance attributed to SNSs, the main conclusion of the study is that the higher the importance of the SNS, the greater the level of dissatisfaction experienced by users. Also, public activities on social networks positively affect social network satisfaction, while private activities have a direct negative relationship with the importance of social networks.","Mican, Daniel Mihuţ Ioana-Sorina",Symmetry,https://doi.org/10.3390/sym12101656,469

DR results are frequently represented by scatterplots, where spatial proximity encodes similarity among data samples. In the literature, techniques support the understanding of scatterplots’ organization by visualizing the importance of the features for cluster definition with layout enrichment strategies. However, current approaches usually focus on global information, hampering the analysis whenever the focus is to understand the differences among clusters. Thus, this paper introduces a methodology to visually explore DR results and interpret clusters’ formation based on contrastive analysis. We also introduce a bipartite graph to visually interpret and explore the relationship between the statistical variables employed to understand how the data features influence cluster formation. Our approach is demonstrated through case studies, in which we explore two document collections related to news articles and tweets about COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, we evaluate our approach through quantitative results to demonstrate its robustness to support multidimensional analysis.","Marcílio, Wilson E.; Eler, Danilo M.; Garcia, Rogério E.",Computers & Graphics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2021.08.014,469

Traditional newspaper coverage is important amidst increasing disinformation, yet uncertainties make covering health risks and efforts to limit transmission difficult. This study assesses print and online newspaper coverage of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 for March 2020, when the global pandemic was declared, through August 2020 in three countries: Canada (with the lowest per-capita case and death rates during the study timeframe), the United Kingdom (with a pronounced early spike), and the United States (with persistently high rates). Tools previously validated for pandemic-related news records allow measurement of multiple indicators of scientific quality (i.e., reporting that reflects the state of scientific knowledge) and of sensationalism (i.e., strategies rendering news as more extraordinary than it really is). COVID-19 reporting had moderate scientific quality and low sensationalism across 1331 sampled articles in twelve newspapers spanning the political spectrums of the three countries. Newspapers oriented towards the populist-right had the lowest scientific quality in reporting, combined with very low sensationalism in some cases. Against a backdrop of world-leading disease rates, U.S. newspapers on the political left had more exposing coverage, e.g., focused on policy failures or misinformation, and more warning coverage, e.g., focused on the risks of the disease, compared to U.S. newspapers on the political right. Despite the generally assumed benefits of low sensationalism, pandemic-related coverage with low scientific quality that also failed to alert readers to public-health risks, misinformation, or policy failures may have exacerbated the public-health effects of the disease. Such complexities will likely remain central for both pandemic news media reporting and public-health strategies reliant upon it.","Mach, Katharine J.; Salas, Reyes Raúl Pentz Brian Taylor Jennifer Costa Clarissa A.; Cruz, Sandip G.; Thomas, Kerronia E.; Arnott, James C.; Donald, Rosalind Jagannathan Kripa Kirchhoff Christine J.; Rosella, Laura C.; Klenk, Nicole",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00900-z,469

To investigate, we profiled patient-derived fibroblasts from inflamed and non-inflamed synovium, intestine, lung, and salivary glands with single-cell RNA-sequencing. We integrated all fibroblasts into a multi-tissue atlas to characterize shared and tissue-specific phenotypes. Two shared clusters, CXCL10+CCL19+ immune-interacting and SPARC+COL3A1+ vascular-interacting fibroblasts were expanded in all inflamed tissues and additionally mapped to dermal analogues in a public atopic dermatitis atlas.

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of psychological distress in a rural area of Australia while exploring the association between psychological distress and social isolation at the individual and area level. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey of 408 adult volunteers was conducted across rural south-eastern New South Wales from October 2019 to April 2020. The Kessler 10 was used to measure psychological distress, while area-level social fragmentation was assessed using the family (ANSFIfam) and mobility (ANSFImob) components of the Australian Neighbourhood Social Fragmentation Index. The number of different occupations of people known socially was used to assess individual-level social isolation. Spatial analysis was performed to identify any spatial autocorrelation. Results: The prevalence of high psychological distress in the sample was 29%. Using logistic regression models, there was little evidence of a relationship between high psychological distress and ANSFIfam (odds ratio (OR)=0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.93, 1.03), or ANSFImob (OR=1.04, 95%CI=0.99, 1.09). High psychological distress also did not appear to be associated with number of occupations known socially (OR=1.00, 95%CI=0.99, 1.00). There was no significant spatial autocorrelation of psychological distress or social fragmentation at the postal area level. Conclusion: The results suggest that social fragmentation or isolation may not have a significant effect on psychological distress in a rural setting. Nevertheless, further investigation of the effects of social isolation on mental health in rural areas is warranted.","Forcadela, V.; Bagheri, N.; Slimings, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230771v1?rss=1,469
176821,The impact and implications of COVID-19: Reflections on the Zimbabwean society,2021,"As the growing proportion of aging population, the demand for sustainable, high quality, and timely healthcare services has become increasingly pressing, especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the early of 2020. To meet this demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing and digital twin techniques into the healthcare systems, where the cloud server is employed for storing healthcare data and offering efficient query services, and the digital twin is used for building digital representation for patients and leverages the query services of the cloud server to monitor healthcare states of patients. Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient. © 2021 IEEE.","Zheng, Y.; Lu, R.; Guan, Y.; Zhang, S.; Shao, J.","29th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service, IWQOS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/iwqos52092.2021.9521351,469

Findings In total, 130 valid responses were obtained. The results showed that the majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that strategic sourcing positively impacts the supply chain response amid the COVID-19 effects. Also, for the five phases of the strategic sourcing process, the majority of respondents considered them as a high and very high impact on the supply chain response. Research limitations/implications This paper provides timely insights for practitioners and academics, especially those involved in the supply chain management area, showing how the strategic sourcing process plays an important role in making supply chains more responsive amid disruption situations. Practical implications Findings of this paper clearly shows the impact of the phases of the strategic sourcing process on the responsiveness of the supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This can encourage supply chain leadership to devote more time to strategic sourcing initiatives to generate improvements on the supply chain performance. Originality/value This paper is unique since it brings an unexplored relation in respect to strategic sourcing amid disruption situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, from a practitioner's perspective. It also significantly contributes to developing new directions for the supply chain management domain to deal with large-scale disruptions, such as the coronavirus pandemic.","Frederico, G.

Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells. Our study provides a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside a biosafety level 3 setting and identifies viral N mutations and viral particle assembly as mechanisms to explain the increased spread of current viral variants, including Delta (N:R203M). One-Sentence Summary R203M substitution within SARS-CoV-2 N, found in delta variant, improves RNA packaging into virus-like particles by 10-fold.","Syed, Abdullah M.; Taha, Taha Y.; Khalid, Mir M.; Tabata, Takako; Chen, Irene P.; Sreekumar, Bharath; Chen, Pei-Yi; Hayashi, Jennifer M.; Soczek, Katarzyna M.; Ott, Melanie; Doudna, Jennifer A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.455082,469
180269,Statement of Removal,2021,"The Paris Agreement set policy scenarios to address mitigating against the climate emergency, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. There has been a drive toward electrifying transport, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at the forefront. Reliance on single-technology policy development can lead to consequential impacts, often not considered, or dismissed. Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be transformed. While BEVs may represent zero tailpipe emissions, the battery energy must be sourced elsewhere. An ideal policy scenario will come from ""renewable"" sources;however, current global energy mixes require the electricity to come from carbon-burning point source emitters. Therefore, the emissions are deferred to low socioeconomic regions. The move to ban new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales has been accelerated. High BEV costs will preclude low-income groups from making purchases. Such groups typically rely on used cars for mobility. Without considered consequential policy analysis, transport underclasses may result, where private transport is only accessible by the wealthy. Synthetic fuels derived from CO2 represent a social bridge in the energy transition, also helping to accelerate toward net zero. The Covid-19 lockdown provided a unique opportunity to experience an environment with reduced transport-related emissions. Global studies allowed the consequential effects of pollution reduction to be studied. These are surprising and offer the opportunity for policies, driven by science, to be developed. Here, we consider the consequential effects of clean air policies, and how these can be used to propose dynamic responses to policy recommendations.","Styring, P.; Duckworth, E. L.; Platt, E.

This may adversely affect personal dignity, hygiene and ability to sleep comfortably, negatively impacting staff engagement, sense of being valued and belonging and workplace performance. More intense shift working and increased fatigue and need to clean after wearing PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic increased these challenges.The Sanitary Products On Site (SOS) and Too Tired To Travel Home (T4H) boxes were established to meet these needs. Led by a junior doctor, they were piloted at three South East Wales acute hospitals, targeting junior and SAS doctors. All female doctor survey respondents felt that the pilot SOS box: was very useful;relieved concerns about being at work without sanitary products;and improves dignity, wellbeing and peace of mind at work. SOS box usage across a health board cost £0.33/week. T4H pilot survey respondents stated that personal hygiene products maintain dignity and wellbeing and improve their sense of being valued.Expansion of the SOS and T4H box schemes in March-April 2020 in response to COVID-19 targeted all healthcare staff in Emergency Departments and/or Intensive Care Units at all acute hospitals and the new field hospital in Wales. Expansion involved recruiting individuals to site boxes in hospitals, fundraising and seeking box contents donations. Interim feedback was via user emails and social media.The wellbeing box scheme expansion demonstrates that leadership can be flexible and delivered effectively via remote means. This involved expanding the Wales project, alongside empowering others to take a vision for positive change forward UK-wide. Leadership during a pandemic can be particularly powerful when meeting needs or channelling feelings of helplessness into purpose.

Design/methodology/approach: Through a cross-sectional survey design, the study adopted a quantitative approach to data collection and analysis. The study used an online survey to collect data from 478 respondents eligible to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. Findings: Attitude, social norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived susceptibility and cues to action were found to be predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The results also showed that perceived severity, perceived benefits and perceived barriers did not predict COVID-19 vaccination intention. Practical implications: To enhance the effectiveness of COVID-19 social marketing campaigns, social marketing theories such as the TPB and HBM can aid in assessing the intention of the target population to take the vaccines. An assessment of vaccination intention will help understand disease threat perception and behavioural evaluation. The consideration of the effect of demography on vaccination intention will aid in developing effective campaigns to satisfy the needs of segments. Originality/value: This study adds to the limited research on understanding citizens’ intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 by combining the TPB and HBM to predict vaccination intention.

Worldwide, there have been increasing reports of Bordetella pertussis infection among adolescents and adults, but the peak incidence and highest mortality occur among infants. We report a 19-day-old female infant presenting with progressive respiratory failure. The mother was the only familial contact who complained of mild cough. However, occasional apneic episodes with cyanosis and peripheral lymphocytosis prompted us to examine the presence of Bordetella pertussis, which remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in unimmunized infants. Understanding the source of pertussis transmission to infants may provide new approaches to prevent pertussis in the most vulnerable infants. Various potential strategies have been reviewed or recommended in countries with the aim of better protecting infants against pertussis. Public health measures to prevent the disease could be strengthened and booster vaccinations against pertussis considered.","Armangil, Didem; Tekinalp, Gülsevin; Yurdakök, Murat; Yalçin, Ebru",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20560262/,469

The currently reported epidemiological statistics show that age, gender, and type of comorbidities may be high-risk factors for critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, there is no comprehensive analysis of these risk factors. In the present study, we systematically explored the prognostic value of the clinical factors (gender, age and comorbidities) in 189 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. We discovered that the gender, age and comorbidities were tightly associated with the survival of COVID-19 patients via performing Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Compared with the female patients, male patients have a lower survival rate. Similarly, the older patients and those with more comorbidities also tended to have an unfavorable survival outcome. In addition, further stratified analysis of COVID-19 patients according to the three risk factors indicated that some laboratory indicators including CRP, IL-6 and lymphocytes showed significant trends in gender, age and comorbidities groups.

To assess clinical outcomes in consecutively hospitalized patients with mild covid-19 in India we performed a study. Methods We developed a case registry of successive patients admitted with suspected covid-19 infection to our hospital (n=501). Covid-19 was diagnosed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demographic, clinical, investigations details and outcomes were recorded. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results Covid-19 was diagnosed in 234 (46.7%) and data compared with 267 (53.3%) negative controls. Mean age of covid-19 patients was 35.1±16.6y, 59.4% were <40y and 64% men. Symptoms were in less than 10% and comorbidities were in 4-8%. History of BCG vaccination was in 49% cases vs 10% controls. Cases compared to controls had significantly greater white cell (6.96+1.89 vs 6.12+1.69x109 cells/L) and lower lymphocyte count (1.98+0.79 vs 2.32+0.91x109 cells/L). No radiological and electrocardiographic abnormality was observed. All these were isolated or quarantined in the hospital and observed. Covid-19 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to prevalent guidelines. One patient needed oxygen support while hospital course was uncomplicated in the rest. All were discharged alive. Conversion to virus negative status was in 10.2±6.4 days and was significantly lower in age >40y (9.1±5.2) compared to 40-59y (11.3±6.1) and ≥60y (16.4±13.3) (p=0.001).

Both PMOs were conjugated with an Arg-rich peptide. One peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) binds to the 5' terminus of the viral genome (5'-end PPMO); the other targets an essential 3' RNA element required for genome cyclization (3' conserved sequence I [3' CSI] PPMO). The 3' CSI PPMO displayed a broad spectrum of antiflavivirus activity, suppressing WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as demonstrated by reductions in viral titers of 3 to 5 logs in cell cultures, likely due to the absolute conservation of the 3' CSI PPMO-targeted sequences among these viruses. The selection and sequencing of PPMO-resistant WNV showed that the 5'-end-PPMO-resistant viruses contained two to three mismatches within the PPMO-binding site whereas the 3' CSI PPMO-resistant viruses accumulated mutations outside the PPMO-targeted region. The mutagenesis of a WNV infectious clone demonstrated that the mismatches within the PPMO-binding site were responsible for the 5'-end PPMO resistance. In contrast, a U insertion or a G deletion located within the 3'-terminal stem-loop of the viral genome was the determinant of the 3' CSI PPMO resistance. In a mouse model, both the 5'-end and 3' CSI PPMOs (administered at 100 or 200 microg/day) partially protected mice from WNV disease, with minimal to no PPMO-mediated toxicity. A higher treatment dose (300 microg/day) caused toxicity. Unconjugated PMOs (3 mg/day) showed neither efficacy nor toxicity, suggesting the importance of the peptide conjugate for efficacy. The results suggest that a modification of the peptide conjugate composition to reduce its toxicity yet maintain its ability to effectively deliver PMO into cells may improve PMO-mediated therapy.","Deas, Tia S; Bennett, Corey J; Jones, Susan A; Tilgner, Mark; Ren, Ping; Behr, Melissa J; Stein, David A; Iversen, Patrick L; Kramer, Laura D; Bernard, Kristen A; Shi, Pei-Yong",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17485503/,469

Among them, bunyaviruses form immature viral particles that change their structure in a trans-Golgi-dependent manner. To identify key Golgi factors for viral structural maturation, we have purified and characterized the three viral forms assembled in infected cells, two intracellular intermediates and the extracellular mature virion. The first viral form is a pleomorphic structure with fully endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo-H)-sensitive, nonsialylated glycoproteins. The second viral intermediate is a structure with hexagonal and pentagonal contours and partially Endo-H-resistant glycoproteins. Sialic acid is incorporated into the small glycoprotein of this second viral form. Growing the virus in glycosylation-deficient cells confirmed that acquisition of Endo-H resistance but not sialylation is critical for the trans-Golgi-dependent structural maturation and release of mature viruses. Conformational changes in viral glycoproteins triggered by changes in sugar composition would then induce the assembly of a compact viral particle of angular contours. These structures would be competent for the second maturation step, taking place during exit from cells, that originates fully infectious virions.","Novoa, Reyes R; Calderita, Gloria; Cabezas, Pilar; Elliott, Richard M; Risco, Cristina",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103138/,469

Spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation in the virus were examined on a local geographical scale in order to test the hypothesis that the genetic similarity of PRRSV isolates (measured as their percentage pairwise ORF5 nucleotide similarity) was positively correlated with their geographical proximity. Levels of genetic variability in the Illinois/eastern Iowa PRRSV sample were similar to levels of variability seen across broader geographical regions within North America. The genetic similarity of isolates did not correlate with their geographical distance. These results imply that the movement of PRRSV onto farms does not generally occur via distance-limited processes such as wind or wildlife vectors, but more typically occurs via the long-distance transport of animals or semen. Genetic distances between PRRSV isolates collected from the same farms at different times increased as the time separating the collection events increased. This result implies rapid movement of new genetic types of PRRSV into and out of farms. PRRSV ORF5 displayed a pattern of third-codon-position diversity bias that was not evident in a geographically comparable sample of pseudorabies virus (a swine alphaherpesvirus) gC gene sequences. This result provides evidence that PRRSV ORF5 is experiencing stabilizing selection against structural novelty. Despite high genetic variability at all geographical levels, PRRSV ORF5 nevertheless contained potentially antigenic regions that were invariant at the amino acid level. These regions should make effective vaccine targets if they prove to be immunogenic.","Goldberg, T L; Hahn, E C; Weigel, R M; Scherba, G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10640555/,469

These mechanisms are usually mediated by antiviral proteins whose expression and activities can be constitutive but are frequently amplified by interferon induction. Among these interferon-stimulated proteins, members of the IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) family are unique because they prevent infection before a virus can traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell. At least three human IFITM proteins-IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3-have antiviral activities. These activities limit infection in cultured cells by many viruses, including dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and West Nile virus.

In this study, we have explored the potential of rats as a susceptible host. In a single replication cycle, rat cell lines Rat2 and Nb2 produced infectious virus at levels 10- to 60-fold lower than those produced by human cells. Rat-derived cells supported substantial levels of early HIV-1 gene expression, which was further enhanced by overexpression of human cyclin T1. Rat cells displayed quantitative, qualitative, and cell-type-specific limitations in the late phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle including relative expression levels of HIV-1 Gag proteins, intracellular Gag processing, and viral egress. Nb2 cells were rendered permissive to HIV-1 R5 viruses by coexpression of human CD4 and CCR5, indicating that the major restriction on HIV-1 replication was at the level of cellular entry. We also found that primary rat lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglia expressed considerable levels of early HIV-1 gene products following infection with pseudotyped HIV-1. Importantly, primary rat macrophages and microglia, but not lymphocytes, also expressed substantial levels of HIV-1 p24 CA and produced infectious virions.

The aim of this study was to describe the main epidemiological findings of a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in March 2020 at a nursing home for elderly in Granada. Risk factors associated with the spread of the virus in the center were investigated. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted, collecting the most relevant clinical and epidemiological findings, occurred during the outbreak follow-up period (from 03/13/2020 to 06/20/2020). The association between the residents' health conditions (underlying diseases, level of physical dependence, level of cognitive impairment) and the risk of infection was estimated using multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS 52 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among the residents and 50 cases among the employees of the nursing home. The epidemic curve was characteristic of a person to person transmission. Among residents with a higher level of physical dependence, according to the Barthel index score, a higher incidence of infection was detected, adjusting for age, sex and health conditions. At 55 days of exposure, moderately (RR 2.82), severely (RR 4.71) and completely (RR 3.49) dependent residents had between 2-4 times greater risk of infection than the minimally dependent residents (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The epidemic curve supports the hypothesis of a cross-transmission of infections between residents and staff members of the nursing home. In the context of sustained transmission of the virus, physical dependence of the residents increases the risk of exposure to the virus, facilitating its spreading.","Causa, Roberta; Almagro Nievas, Diego; Bermúdez Tamayo, Clara",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767129/,469

201513,Virtual education revolution during the COVID-19 pandemic: the introduction of national educational rounds in sport and exercise medicine,2021,"Epithelial cell injury under hyperinflammatory conditions is critical in the development of septic acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of the present study is to analyze the cytotoxic effects of a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines in the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549. The cytotoxicity of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in A549 cells by measuring lactate dehydrogenase released into the culture medium and by crystal violet staining of surviving cells. Activation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway was evaluated by monitoring cleavage of cytokeratin 18 by caspases using enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To estimate the cytotoxic signaling pathways responsible for epithelial injury, agents with antiinflammatory or antioxidative properties were extensively screened for cytoprotective effects in the inflammation-associated epithelial injury model. The present study revealed that inflammatory cytokines exerted cytotoxicity in A549 cells. A mixture of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), designated as cytomix, augmented cytotoxicity compared with each individual cytokine. Treatment with glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), tetracycline-derived antiinflammatory antibiotics (minocycline or doxycycline), angiotensin II receptor blockers (losartan or telmisartan), or antioxidants (dimethyl sulfoxide, catalase) attenuated cytomix-induced cytotoxicity, including caspase activation. These results implied that inflammatory cytokines alone could cause alveolar epithelial injury in the pathophysiology of septic ALI. Caspase-dependent apoptosis was speculated to be one mechanism responsible for the cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. Agents with antiinflammatory or antioxidative properties such as glucocorticoid, tetracycline-derived antibiotics, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct antioxidants showed substantial effect in attenuating cytokine-induced cytotoxicity and may be candidates for treatment options.","Muroya, Mitsuaki; Chang, Kyungho; Uchida, Kanji; Bougaki, Masahiko; Yamada, Yoshitsugu",Bioscience trends,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22621989/,469

Data from the Gallup World Poll in 2018/2019 wave (N = 145,417) were collected in 142 countries using telephone and face to face interviews. We describe differences in frequency of 'scratch' cooking lunch and dinner across the globe by gender. Poisson regression was used to assess predictors of cooking frequency. Associations between disparities in cooking frequency (at the country level) between men and women with perceptions of subjective well-being were assessed using linear regression. Across the globe, cooking frequency varied considerably; dinner was cooked more frequently than lunch; and, women (median frequency 5 meals/week) cooked both meals more frequently than men (median frequency 0 meals/week). At the country level, greater gender disparities in cooking frequency are associated with lower Positive Experience Index scores (-0.021, p = 0.009). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency with which men and women cook meals varied considerably between nations; and, women cooked more frequently than men worldwide. The pandemic, and related 'stay at home' directives have dramatically reshaped the world, and it will be important to monitor changes in the ways and frequency with which people around the world cook and eat; and, how those changes relate to dietary patterns and health outcomes on a national, regional and global level.","Wolfson, Julia A; Ishikawa, Yoshiki; Hosokawa, Chizuru; Janisch, Kate; Massa, Jennifer; Eisenberg, David M",Appetite,,469
207590,Virtual Social Work Care with Older Black Adults: A Culturally Relevant Technology-Based Intervention to Reduce Social Isolation and Loneliness in a Time of Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: In the setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a potential association of this disease with stroke has been suggested. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: This is a case series of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to an academic health system in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia (USA) between March 24th, 2020 and July 17th, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described. RESULTS: Of 396 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 13 (2.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 61.6 ± 10.8 years, 10 (76.9%) male, 8 (61.5%) were Black Americans, mean time from last normal was 4.97 ± 5.1 days, and only one received acute reperfusion therapy. All 13 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic with 4 explained by atrial fibrillation. COVID-19 patients had a significantly higher rate of cryptogenic stroke than non-COVID-19 patients during the study period (69% vs 17%, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors at an age typically seen in non-COVID populations, and mainly affecting males and Black Americans. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes, a prolonged median time to presentation and symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for increased community awareness, early identification, and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients.","Jillella, Dinesh V; Janocko, Nicholas J; Nahab, Fadi; Benameur, Karima; Greene, James G; Wright, Wendy L; Obideen, Mahmoud; Rangaraju, Srikant",PLoS One,,469

We previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a unique orf8 accessory gene absent from other human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a novel immunogenic secreted protein and utilized it for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA. We hypothesize that orf8 secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates early mounting of B cell response. The serological test detecting anti-orf8 IgG antibody can be used for the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Current commercially available serological tests for COVID-19 patients are detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein. The antinucleoprotein and antispike antibodies can be accurately detected in patients during the mid or late stage of infection, and therefore, these assays have not been widely used for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, we characterized the secretory property of a SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein and proposed that orf8 secretion during infection facilitates early mounting of the B cell response. We demonstrated the presence of anti-orf8 antibodies in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during the early stage of infection, while the anti-N antibody is not detected. Our serological test detecting anti-orf8 antibodies may facilitate the development of early and accurate diagnosis for COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaohui; Lam, Joy-Yan; Wong, Wan-Man; Yuen, Chun-Kit; Cai, Jian-Piao; Au, Shannon Wing-Ngor; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin K W; Kok, Kin-Hang; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",mBio (Online),,469

Unfortunately, there is a non-available effective treatment to combat these viruses. Domain-motif interactions (DMIs) are an essential means by which viruses mimic and hijack the biological processes of host cells. To disentangle how viruses achieve this process can help to develop new rational therapies. Data mining was performed to obtain DMIs stored as regular expressions (regexp) in 3DID and ELM databases. The mined regexp information was mapped on the coronaviruses' proteomes. Most motifs on viral protein that could interact with human proteins are shared across the coronavirus species, indicating that molecular mimicry is a common strategy for coronavirus infection. Enrichment ontology analysis for protein domains showed a shared biological process and molecular function terms related to carbon source utilization and potassium channel regulation. Some of the mapped motifs were nested on B, and T cell epitopes, suggesting that it could be as an alternative way for reverse vaccinology. The information obtained in this study could be used for further theoretic and experimental explorations on coronavirus infection mechanism and development of medicines for treatment.","Martinez, Y.

METHODS: We surveyed 2,328 Taiwanese from July 29 to August 6, 2020, assessing demographics, information sources, and practice of preventive behaviors from the 2003 SARS or 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (2009pdmH1N1) era to the current pdmCOVID-19 as well as post-survey intention to continue preventive practices. Logistic regression was employed to identify characteristics associated with close adherence to preventive behavior practices in 2020. RESULTS: About 70.2% of participants adhered closely to recommended preventive behavior practices. Compared with 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1, there was a significant increase in the use of facemasks during pdmCOVID-19 (66.6% vs. 99.2% [indoors], p < 0.001) and the use of on-person alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHS) (44.2% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001) or 98.4% (hand sanitation at entry of buildings, p < 0.001) during the pdmCOVID-19.

The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS: Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","De Luca, Rosaria; Rifici, Carmela; Pollicino, Patrizia; Di Cara, Marcella; Miceli, Sabrina; Sergi, Giuseppina; Sorrenti, Luisa; Romano, Michela; Naro, Antonino; Billeri, Luana; Lauria, Paola; Caminiti, Angelo; Bramanti, Placido; Torrisi, Michele",J Telemed Telecare,,469

However, overall arterial and venous TE rates of COVID-19 and effect of TE on COVID-19 mortality is unknown. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating TE in COVID-19. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase for studies published up to June 12, 2020. Random effects models were used to produce summary TE rates and odds ratios (OR) of mortality in COVID-19 patients with TE compared to those without TE. Heterogeneity was quantified with I 2 . Findings: Of 425 studies identified, 42 studies enrolling 8271 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall venous TE rate was 21% (95% CI:17-26%): ICU, 31% (95% CI: 23-39%). Overall deep vein thrombosis rate was 20% (95% CI: 13-28%): ICU, 28% (95% CI: 16-41%); postmortem, 35% (95% CI:15-57%). Overall pulmonary embolism rate was 13% (95% CI: 11-16%): ICU, 19% (95% CI:14-25%); postmortem, 22% (95% CI:16-28%). Overall arterial TE rate was 2% (95% CI: 1-4%): ICU, 5% (95%CI: 3-7%). Pooled mortality rate among patients with TE was 23% (95%CI:14-32%) and 13% (95% CI:6-22%) among patients without TE. The pooled odds of mortality were 74% higher among patients who developed TE compared to those who did not (OR, 1.74; 95%CI, 1.01-2.98; P = 0.04).

217963,Reflections on the impact of coronavirus on public affairs,2020,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1·58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1·36-1·84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48·3% (95% CI 48·1-48·5) and 16·0% (15·7-16·3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

However, there is limited information on recipients transplanted after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A full understanding of this scenario is required, as transplantation is a lifesaving procedure and COVID-19 remains an ongoing threat. METHODS: Abdominal organ transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to transplantation were identified by chart review and clinical data was collected. The primary outcome was the transplant outcome including graft loss, rejection and death, and reactivation of infection posttransplant. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients who received abdominal organ transplants after symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; four patients had a positive PCR at the time of admission for transplantation. The median time of follow-up was 79 (22-190) days. One recipient with negative PCR before transplant tested positive 9 days after transplant. One of 14 transplanted patients developed disseminated mold infection and died 86 days after transplant.

It was first published in 1939 as 'An Aztec Herbal'. One of the depicted plants is Huetzcanixochitl (laughing flower) interpreted as Zephyranthes fosteri (Amaryllidaceae). No chemical or pharmacological studies are reported for this species; so, we decide to investigate it. The GC/MS of the bulbs and aerial parts extracts indicated that they contain Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, among them: lycorine, 3-O-acetylpowelline, and norlycoramine. An unknown major alkaloid was isolated and identified by 1 H, 13 C-NMR and MS, as 3'-demethoxy-6-epimesembranol (1). The methanolic extract, the alkaloid fraction, and compound 1 inhibited acetylcholinesterase inâ vitro. Mesembrine alkaloids are found in Sceletium species (Aizoaceae). Several are known as serotonin recapture inhibitors and have been proposed as potential antidepressant drugs.

221090,Aligning Student-Led Initiatives and Incident Command System Resources in a Pandemic,2020,"Aims Encouraging adherence to agreed triage guidelines is a critical facet of endoscopy waiting list management,particularly in the current climate of COVID-19. Unfortunately, few such guidelines exist and there is considerable variabilityin their application. The aim of this study was to determine if the use of locally developed flowsheets, created using existing guidelines, couldaid in standardisation of endoscopy triage and surveillance in a single endoscopy unit. Methods Existing international (BSG) and national (NICE, NCSS and HIQA) guidelines were reviewed. Simple flowsheetswere devised to address upper and lower GI endoscopy triage, polyp and Barretts surveillance, family history of colorectalcancer. A baseline quiz involving clinical scenarios was devised and endoscopy users were invited to participate. The quizwas then retaken after reviewing the relevant flowsheets. Results 20 endoscopy users took part. The mean number of correct answers increased significantly after reviewingflowsheets (45±11 % v 71±12 %;p=&lt;0.0001). Similar improvements were noted across both the triage and surveillancesections (25±15 % v 25±18 %;p=0.8368), and between nursing and medical staff (24±18 % v 27±15 %;p=0.7075).Consultants had more correct answers than nurses at initial assessment (56±5 % v 42±12 %;p=0.054) but there was nosignificant difference after reviewing the flowsheets (71±10 % v 66±14 %;p=0.5566). Conclusions We have shown a significant improvement in triage accuracy after reviewing appropriate guideline flowsheets among medical and nursing staff. While medical staff performed better at initial assessment, there was no significant difference between medical and nursing staff scores after reviewing the guidelines. We conclude that all staff should refer to guidelines when triaging clinical requests. In addition it reassures us that nurses, with appropriate guidelines as reference, can be utilised to support or replace doctor-led triage.

222094,Learning from the Unpredictable: College Students Mental Health and Medical Education in the Covid-19 Pandemic/ Aprendendo com o Imprevisível: Saúde Mental dos Universitários e Educação Médica na Pandemia de Covid-19,2020,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a national suspension of ""non-urgent"" elective hip and knee arthroplasty. The study aims to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume in Scotland. Secondary objectives are to measure the success of restarting elective services and model the time required to bridge the gap left by the first period of suspension. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset. All patients undergoing elective THAs and TKAs during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020 were included. A negative binomial regression model using historical case-volume and mid-year population estimates was built to project the future case-volume of THA and TKA in Scotland. The median monthly case volume was calculated for the period 2008 to 2019 (baseline) and compared to the actual monthly case volume for 2020. The time taken to eliminate the deficit was calculated based upon the projected monthly workload and with a potential workload between 100% to 120% of baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the period 2008 to 2019, primary TKA and THA volume fell by 61.1% and 53.6%, respectively. Since restarting elective services, Scottish hospitals have achieved approximately 40% to 50% of baseline monthly activity. With no changes in current workload, by 2021 there would be a reduction of 9,180 and 10,170 for THA and TKA, respectively. Conversely, working at 120% baseline monthly output, it would take over four years to eliminate the deficit for both TKA and THA. CONCLUSION: This national study demonstrates the significant impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on overall THA and TKA volume. In the six months after resuming elective services, Scottish hospitals averaged less than 50% normal monthly output. Loss of operating capacity will increase treatment delays and likely worsen overall morbidity.

Clinical characteristics regarding secondary infections in patients with COVID-19 have been reported but detailed microbiology, risk factors and outcomes of secondary bloodstream infections (sBSI) in patients with severe COVID-19 have not been well described. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, case-control study including all hospitalized patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and blood cultures drawn from March 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020 at three academic medical centers in New Jersey, USA. Data collection included demographics, clinical and microbiologic variables, and patient outcomes. Risk factors and outcomes were compared between cases (sBSI) and controls (no sBSI). RESULTS: A total of 375 hospitalized patients were included. There were 128 sBSIs during the hospitalization. For the first set of positive blood cultures, 117 (91.4%) were bacterial and 7 (5.5%) were fungal. Those with sBSI were more likely to have altered mental status, lower mean percent oxygen saturation on room air, have septic shock and be admitted to the intensive care unit compared to the controls. In-hospital mortality was higher in those with a sBSI versus controls (53.1% vs 32.8%, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 and sBSI had a more severe initial presentation, prolonged hospital course, and worse clinical outcomes.

Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard.","Packalen, Mikko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03417v1.pdf,469

The most common allergens-milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, and wheat-account for 90% of serious allergic reactions. A literature review of online databases in CINAHL, PubMed Central, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Google Scholar, Health Resource Center Academic, and archival searching was performed to identify evidenced-based practices for managing food allergies in schools. There is no cure for food allergies. The current management standard is to avoid the allergen, treat a mild reaction with antihistamine and observation, and treat anaphylaxis with an intramuscular injection of epinephrine. Due to COVID-19 social distancing recommendations, food consumption in schools has moved from cafeterias and lunchrooms into classrooms and other spaces. This in turn necessitates strict adherence to hand washing and disinfecting all surfaces that come in contact with food. Managing food allergies in schools requires cooperation among school administrators, nurses, teachers, staff, families, and health care providers. Resources for managing food allergies in schools are presented offering information for parents, school administrators, nurses, teachers, and staff for planning and implementing strategies for preventing and reducing allergic reactions and treating life-threatening food allergy reactions.","Heideman, Katherine; Poronsky, Cathlin Buckingham",Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,,469

Therefore, we aimed to compare the pattern of abnormal liver tests in SARS-CoV-2 patients with those of patients infected with influenza, a non-hepatotropic respiratory virus, and their association with worse outcomes during hospitalization. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1737 hospitalized patients (865 with influenza and 872 with SARS-Cov-2) in a tertiary medical center. We defined abnormal liver tests as GPT or GOT &#8805;40IU/ML at any time-point during hospitalization. Results: Abnormal liver tests were mild-moderate in the majority of patients regardless of infection type, but the majority of patients with influenza had a transaminases peak earlier during hospitalization compared to patients with SARS-Cov-2. Abnormal liver tests correlated with markers of severe disease in either influenza or SARS-Cov-2 infections, and were associated with death, occurring mainly in patients with severe liver tests abnormalities (>200IU/L) (38.7% and 60% of patients with influenza or SARS-Cov-2, respectively). In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, lymphopenia and CRP, liver tests abnormalities remained significantly associated with death for influenza (OR= 4.344, 95% CI 2.218-8.508) and SARS-Cov-2 (OR= 3.898, 95% CI 2.203-6.896). These results were confirmed upon propensity score matching. Conclusions: Abnormal liver tests during hospitalization with SARS-Cov-2 or influenza infections are common, may differ in their time-course and reflect disease severity. They are associated with worse outcomes, mainly in patients with severe liver test abnormalities, regardless of infection type.","Shafran, Noa; Issachar, Assaf; Shochat, Tzippy; Shafran, Inbal Haya; Bursztyn, Michael; Shlomai, Amir",JHEP Rep,,469

These methods are recommended and frequently used for athlete monitoring, yet their uniformity has not been well assessed, and we have a limited understanding of their relationship with measures of training load. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applications and designs of single-item self-report measures used in monitoring team-sport athletes and present the relationship between these measures and measures of training load. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus were searched between inception and March 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they concerned adult athletes from field- or court-sport domains, if athlete well-being was measured using a single-item self-report, and if the relationship with a measure of modifiable training load was investigated over at least 7 days. DATA EXTRACTION: Data related to participant characteristics, self-report measures, training load measures, and statistical analysis and outcomes were extracted by 2 authors (C.D. and C.D.). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 21 studies were included in the analysis. A narrative synthesis was conducted. The measures used most frequently were muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All measures presented various relationships with metrics of training load from no association to a very large association, and the associations were predominantly trivial to moderate in the studies with the largest numbers of observations. Relationships were largely negative associations. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of this review should be considered by users in the application and clinical utility of single-item self-report measures in athlete monitoring. Great emphasis has been placed on examining the relationship between subjective and objective measures of training load. Although the relationship is still unclear, such an association may not be expected or useful. Researchers should consider the measurement properties of single-item self-report measures and seek to establish their relationship with clinically meaningful outcomes. As such, further study is required to inform practitioners on the appropriate objective application of data from single-item self-report measures.","Duignan, Ciara; Doherty, Cailbhe; Caulfield, Brian; Blake, Catherine",J Athl Train,,469
226539,"Mexico City: Housing conditions and social distancing imposed, Covid-19",2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The new type of Coronavirus (2019-nCov) epidemic spread rapidly, causing more than 250 thousand deaths worldwide. The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods. METHODS: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information. RESULTS: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model (XGBoost) achieved the best prediction of death status based on the factors as compared to the other algorithms. The results of this study can guide patients with certain variables to take early measures and access preventive health care services before they become infected with the virus.","Kivrak, Mehmet; Guldogan, Emek; Colak, Cemil",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,469

Paradoxically, the need for health professionals has increased. Online methods are being widely used, but its efficacy is rarely measured. Objectives: This study was conducted to find the efficacy of an online course in developing competency among medical students to prescribe balanced diet. Methods: An online module was hosted at https://drzinia.moodlecloud.com/. A noninferiority trial was conducted among voluntary participants of the third MBBS students, in 2019. Stratified block randomization was done, so that ten students were allocated to the intervention arm of online sessions and ten students were allocated to the control arm of classroom sessions. Pretest assessments, seven assessments related to sessions conducted, and a postassessment were done. Generalized estimating equations were done to adjust for the effects of other confounders and see whether the intervention was a significant determinant of ability to prescribe balanced diet. Results: Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. The pretest scores were not significantly different in the two groups. The mean total marks scored by the online group (47.33/70) was not significantly different (t=0.68; p=0.50) from that of the class room group (45.70/70).

So far, many studies have aimed to develop a therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Montelukast (MK) is a safe asthma controller drug, which is considered as a potential antiviral drug for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review has a systematic approach to investigate the reports on the use of MK as a part of treatment or a prophylactic agent in COVID-19. The search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and yielded 35 studies containing the influence of MK on SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, MK appears to be worth being used as an adjuvant therapeutic and prophylactic drug against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, more clinical trials are required to accurately investigate its effectiveness.","Sharifinejad, N.; Sharafian, S.; Salekmoghadam, S.; Tavakol, M.; Qorbani, M.",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,,469
234589,Towards A Comprehensive Narrative and Response to COVID-19 in Southeast Asia,2020,"As part of the 2030 Agenda, higher education has been conceptualised as one of the ways to overcome the social disparities experienced in rural areas in Colombia. Thus, in concordance with the benefits of this level of education, the state has been designing public policies during the last few years, in order to facilitate access to undergraduate programmes to these populations, focusing mainly on the implementation of the virtual modality. In this context, it is recognised that access itself is not enough, but that continuance and timely graduation are required to materialise the benefits obtained along with a higher education degree;hence, dropout is a subject of interest for study, especially due to the high rates existing in the rural student population. Therefore, the event of dropout becomes an obstacle to social change and transformation in rural areas. Thus, this article aimed to identify which individual, institutional, academic and socio-economic characteristics influence rural student dropout in virtual undergraduate programmes in Colombia. For this purpose, an exploratory, quantitative and cross-sectional study was proposed, with a sample of 291 students to whom a student characterisation instrument and a classroom evaluation instrument were applied. With these data, it was proceeded to establish which of them had deserted, constituting the extraction of the sample of the study, which were 168. With the information, an exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and descriptive statistics were used to establish which explanatory variables are involved in the dropout of this type of student. The results showed that the academic variables analysed do not have an impact on the event, while marital status (associated with family obligations), age, social stratum, work obligations, parents’ level of education and type of work, income and type of employment relationship of the student, and, finally, the number of people who depend on the family’s income do.","Alfredo Guzmán, Rincón Barragán Sandra Favio Cala Vitery",Sustainability,,469

Recent Findings: In addition to bone health, vitamin D may play a role in innate immunity, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. Although rickets is often regarded as an historical disease of the early twentieth century, it appears to be making a comeback worldwide, including ""first-world"" countries. Broad-spectrum sunscreens (with high UVA filters) that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations. Summary: New attention is now focused on the role of vitamin D in a variety of diseases, and more individualized patient recommendation schemes are being considered that take into account more realistic and achievable goals for achieving sufficient vitamin D through diet, supplements, and sun behavior.","Matsui, Mary S",Curr Dermatol Rep,,469

The Government's Effectiveness during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the first year outcomes of a remote screening program for detection of retinal diseases using handheld nonmydriatic cameras in occupational routine checkups performed onsite at work centers. METHODS: Cross-sectional, first year screening program outcomes audit. Participants were volunteers recruited from staff within work centers. Retinal fundus images were captured by technicians, and images and data were anonymized and sent securely to a remote server. A team of ophthalmologists, all retinal specialists, remotely read the images using a custom-made software and sent telematic reports of findings within 24-48 h. The main items evaluated were the detection of retinal abnormalities and the relationship between retinal findings and demographic data such as age and sex. RESULTS: A total of 19,881 workers were evaluated in 52 centers. Mean age was 41.1 years old, 43.9% men and 56.1% women. Mean duration of the test was around 2 min. Of the workers, 7.8% presented abnormalities in retinal fundus images, being the main findings choroidal nevus (2.4%), macular pigment abnormalities (1.5%), glaucomatous optic disc (1.2%), and macular signs of high myopia (1.1%). The presence of abnormalities was associated with greater age, being 5%, 7.9%, 12.6%, and 19.7% in workers less than 40 years, from 40 to 49, 50-59, and &#8805; 60 years (p < 0.05), respectively. Men had more abnormalities in retinal fundus images than women (8.6 vs. 7.2; p < 0.05 RR: 1.2; CI 1092-1322). CONCLUSIONS: Mass screening of retinal and optic disc abnormalities during occupational health routine checkups is a feasible, quick, and efficient tool for early detection of potential vision-threatening disease markers.","Zapata, Miguel A; Martín, Ruth; Garcia-Arumí, Claudia; Fonollosa, Alex; Flores-Moreno, Ignacio; Gallego-Pinazo, Roberto; Gutiérrez, Estanislao; Abraldes, Maximino; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,469

This study demonstrates the relationship between the manifestation of COVID-19 and the presence of chronic miasmatic disease, based on the works of Samuel Hahnemann. The reaction of the individual who previously presented chronic miasmatic disease, when in contact with the stimulus of the epidemic disease, depends on the type of response that the organism was generating in the face of the pre-existing situation: if it is an intense reaction and greater than that which the stimulus of COVID-19 can generate, this individual will not develop the severe form of the epidemic disease; if the reaction is less than that generated by COVID-19, more intense symptoms may appear. Understanding that the presence of a chronic miasmatic disease interferes with the manifestation of COVID-19, which may have repercussions on other organs, can change how one must act on the treatment, as this can alter the individual's health status.","da Costa Fujino, Fernanda Maria Simões; Olandim, Ana Amélia Campos Claro; Barnabé, Vagner Doja; Coggan, Jennifer Anne; Benites, Nilson Roberti",Homeopathy,,469

243555,Strengthening public health systems : policy ideas from a governance perspective,2020,"The OC43 coronavirus is a human pathogen that usually causes only the common cold. One of its key enzymes, similar to other coronaviruses, is the 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase), which is essential for viral RNA stability and expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 2'-O-RNA MTase in a complex with the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin solved at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure reveals an overall fold consistent with the fold observed in other coronaviral MTases. The major differences are in the conformation of the C terminus of the nsp16 subunit and an additional helix in the N terminus of the nsp10 subunits. The structural analysis also revealed very high conservation of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding pocket, suggesting that the SAM pocket is a suitable spot for the design of antivirals effective against all human coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Some coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens, while some cause only common colds. The reasons are not understood, although the spike proteins probably play an important role. However, to understand the coronaviral biology in sufficient detail, we need to compare the key enzymes from different coronaviruses. We solved the crystal structure of 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase of the OC43 coronavirus, a virus that usually causes mild colds. The structure revealed some differences in the overall fold but also revealed that the SAM binding site is conserved, suggesting that development of antivirals against multiple coronaviruses is feasible.","Dostalik, Pavel; Krafcikova, Petra; Silhan, Jan; Kozic, Jan; Chalupska, Dominika; Chalupsky, Karel; Boura, Evzen",J Virol,,469

Therefore, extra research efforts to develop reliable and more accessible techniques for disease diagnosis are of supreme importance. Here, a target-responsive assembly of gold nanoparticle-core hairpin-spherical nucleic acids (AuNP-core H-SNAs) was implemented to modify the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the ""naked-eye"" colorimetric detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Two hairpin DNA ligands are designed based on the two highly conserved regions within N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by positioning two short palindromic arms (stem) on either side of a recognition sequence (loop). In the presence of a sequence-specific probe (activator), hairpin DNAs anchored to the surface of AuNPs unfold and expose the palindromic ends to the DNA-directed assembly of AuNPs. The sequence of the activator probes was chosen to be identical to the TaqMan probe in a real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay for specifically targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. They may either be degraded by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase during PCR cycles or stay intact depending on the presence or absence of the target template in the sample, respectively. Post-addition of H-SNA solutions to the final PCR products of some preconfirmed clinical samples for COVID-19 generated naked-eye-observable red and blue colors for positive and negative cases, respectively, with similar sensitivity to that of the real-time RT-PCR method.","Karami, Abbas; Hasani, Masoumeh; Azizi Jalilian, Farid; Ezati, Razieh",Anal Chem,,469

Current State of The Art (SOTA) typically make use of string comparison algorithms (e.g. Levenshtein Distance), which are computationally heavy. One reason for this is the lack of publicly available datasets thus hindering the training of more advanced Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, no one font is able to render all types of punycode correctly, posing a significant challenge to the creation of a dataset that is unbiased toward any particular font. This coupled with the vast number of internet domains pose a challenge in creating a dataset that can capture all possible variations. Here, we show how a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), PhishGAN, can be used to generate images of hieroglyphs, conditioned on non-homoglpyh input text images. Practical changes to current SOTA were required to facilitate the generation of more varied homoglyph text-based images. We also demonstrate a workflow of how PhishGAN together with a Homoglyph Identifier (HI) model can be used to identify the domain the homoglyph was trying to imitate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhishGAN's ability to generate datasets on the fly facilitate the quick adaptation of cybersecurity systems to detect new threats as they emerge.","Lee, Joon Sern; Yam, Gui Peng David; Chan, Jin Hao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13742v2.pdf,469

It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p <0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.","Molla, Kindu Alem; Abegaz, Silamlak Birhanu",PLoS One,,469

251137,People’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic during its early stages and factors affecting those responses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Economic crises during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic severely impacted mental health outcomes. However, there is limited evidence on this issue in Thailand. We aimed to evaluate the association of economic burden during the first phase of the pandemic and the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in the Thai population. METHODS: We recruited 2,303 participants aged 18 years or above with employment/full-time jobs before the national lockdown in April-May 2020. The measures of economic burden were job loss, income loss, and financial problems related to the outbreak. The outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress. The association between economic burden and adverse mental health outcomes was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Individuals who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic had a higher risk of perceived stress compared to those who maintained their job (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.51; p = .006). A higher risk of anxiety was observed in individuals with a monthly income loss of 50% (adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.99; p = .035; individuals without income loss, reference group) or over. Self-reported financial problems were significantly associated with adverse mental health outcomes (nonexperienced financial problems, reference group): Adjusted ORs of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.34-2.51; p < .001) for depressive symptoms, 2.00 (95% CI, 1.48-2.71; p < .001) for anxiety, and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.51-2.95; p < .001) for perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Economic burden, especially self-reported financial problems, was associated with adverse mental health outcomes. However, long-term studies are needed to address the mental health consequences of COVID-19 and economic downturns.","Ruengorn, Chidchanok; Awiphan, Ratanaporn; Wongpakaran, Nahathai; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Nochaiwong, Surapon",Depress Anxiety,,469
251138,Practising social work groups online: Practitioners’ reflection on the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Abstract Background: Valle del Cauca is the region with the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in Colombia (&gt;50,000 on September 7, 2020). Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making","Iragorri, Nicolas; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Barrett, Kali; Herrera, Socrates; Hurtado, Isabel; Khan, Yasin; Mac, Stephen; Naimark, David; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Rosselli, Diego; Toro, Dilian; Villamizar, Pedro; Ximenes, Raphael; Zapata, Helmer; Sander, Beate",Colomb. med,,469

To identify new candidates, we screen a repurposing library of â¼3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells finds few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validates 23 diverse antiviral drugs. Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we find that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we find nine drugs are antiviral in respiratory cells, seven of which have been used in humans, and three are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, including cyclosporine. We find that the antiviral activity of cyclosporine is targeting Cyclophilin rather than calcineurin, revealing essential host targets that have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.","Dittmar, Mark; Lee, Jae Seung; Whig, Kanupriya; Segrist, Elisha; Li, Minghua; Kamalia, Brinda; Castellana, Lauren; Ayyanathan, Kasirajan; Cardenas-Diaz, Fabian L; Morrisey, Edward E; Truitt, Rachel; Yang, Wenli; Jurado, Kellie; Samby, Kirandeep; Ramage, Holly; Schultz, David C; Cherry, Sara",Cell Rep,,469

METHODS: We assessed whether proteinuria can be predictive of kidney failure, the development of chronic kidney disease, and mortality in 37 critically ill COVID-19 patients. We used machine learning (ML) methods as decision trees and cut-off points created by the OneR package to add new aspects, even in smaller cohorts. RESULTS: Among a total of 37 patients, 24 suffered higher-grade renal failure, 20 of whom required kidney replacement therapy. More than 40% of patients remained on hemodialysis after intensive care unit discharge or died (27%). Due to frequent anuria proteinuria measured in two-thirds of the patients, it was not predictive for the investigated endpoints; albuminuria was higher in patients with AKI 3, but the difference was not significant. ML found cut-off points of >31.4 kg/m2 for BMI and >69 years for age, constructed decision trees with great accuracy, and identified highly predictive variables for outcome and remaining chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Different ML methods and their clinical application, especially decision trees, can provide valuable support for clinical decisions. Presence of proteinuria was not predictive of CKD or AKI and should be confirmed in a larger cohort.","Herzog, Anna Laura; von Jouanne-Diedrich, Holger K; Wanner, Christoph; Weismann, Dirk; Schlesinger, Tobias; Meybohm, Patrick; Stumpner, Jan",PLoS One,,469

Although hydroxychloroquine is generally considered safe during pregnancy based on studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic conditions, there may still be reluctance to institute this antimalarial during pregnancy for the sole purpose of antiviral therapy. METHODS: To provide data regarding any potential fetal/neonatal cardiotoxicity, we leveraged a unique opportunity in which neonatal ECGs and hydroxychloroquine blood levels were available in a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily to prevent the recurrence of congenital heart block associated with anti-SSA/Ro (anti-Sjögren's Syndrome A/Ro) antibodies. RESULTS: Forty-five ECGs were available for corrected QT interval (QTc) measurement, and levels of hydroxychloroquine were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and in the cord blood, providing unambiguous assurance of drug exposure. Overall, there was no correlation between cord blood levels of hydroxychloroquine and the neonatal QTc (R=0.02, P=0.86) or the mean of hydroxychloroquine values obtained throughout each individual pregnancy and the QTc (R=0.04, P=0.80). In total 5 (11% [95% CI, 4%-24%]) neonates had prolongation of the QTc >2 SD above historical healthy controls (2 markedly and 3 marginally) but ECGs were otherwise normal. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, these data provide reassurances that the maternal use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with a low incidence of infant QTc prolongation. However, if included in clinical COVID-19 studies, early postnatal ECGs should be considered.

The rapid spreading of this pandemic, together with the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, has led governments around the world to take drastic actions, including limiting the free movement of citizens, establishing maximum capacities and enforcing social distancing measures, among others. Consequently, major medical congresses, meetings, conferences, and workshops have been either cancelled or delayed. This situation has forced rapid changes in how the medical and scientific communities interact, and they now mainly meet using online technology. While political leaders have closed the borders of their countries as a logical public health measure, we have witnessed medical societies, clinicians, and scientists breaking other barriers and creating a new reality of global technological collaboration unlike anything seen before. An immense variety of webinars, online conferences, podcasts, courses and many other forms of uploaded content can be seen from the comfort of one's own workplace or home at any time, and this has exponentially increased our reach; however, this great number of possibilities can be overwhelming, and it is more important than ever to separate wheat from chaff when deciding what online event to attend. The purpose of this article is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on congresses and meetings, to examine how GI physicians feel about the emerging trend of online initiatives and to offer suggestions on how to balance web-based meetings and daily work.","Albéniz, Eduardo; Rosón, Pedro; Hernández-Villalba, Luis; Enguita, Mónica",Tech Innov Gastrointest Endosc,,469

It went on to be officially recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020. While many public health strategies have evolved, there has been little mention of the immune system and how this could be strengthened to help protect against viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The present paper evaluates the current evidence base relating to immunonutrition, with a particular focus on respiratory viruses. Within the nutrition sector a promising body of evidence studying inter-relationships between certain nutrients and immune competence already exists. This could potentially be an important player in helping the body to deal with the coronavirus, especially among elders. Evidence for vitamins C, D and zinc and their roles in preventing pneumonia and respiratory infections (vitamins C and D) and reinforcing immunity (zinc) appears to look particularly promising. Ongoing research within this important field is urgently needed.","Derbyshire, Emma; Delange, Joanne",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,,469

This study aims to evaluate and analyze the factors that influence the quality of life (QOL) of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during COVID-19 to provide a realistic basis for improving their QOL. A total of 70 patients with CHD were selected through convenience sampling from three heart rehabilitation centers. The cross-sectional survey of the study cases were carried out using an online survey platform. All of the participants completed a general situation questionnaire, and QOL was assessed through the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Results showed that the overall QOL of patients with CHD during COVID-19 was poor, having an average score of 65.99 ± 10.97. Moreover, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that worry about COVID-19 (P < 0.05) and different exercise intervention types (P < 0.05) were the main factors affecting the QOL of patients. On the one hand, positive measures should be taken to provide psychological counseling to ease their sense of concern. On the other hand, engaging in exercise is more important for these patients to improve physical function, particularly Tai Chi exercises.","Zhang, Jianwei; Lyu, Shaojun; Yin, Hengchan; Ma, Jing; Chen, Zaihao; Cui, Meize; Wei, Qiuyang; Yuan, Wen; Li, Yameng",Psychol Health Med,,469

Our aim is to characterise the precise nature and extent of organ dysfunction following an episode of AP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an observational prospective cohort study in a single centre comprising a University hospital with an acute and emergency receiving unit and clinical research facility. Participants will be adult patient admitted with AP. Participants will undergo assessment at recruitment, 3 months and 3 years. At each time point, multiple biochemical and/or physiological assessments to measure cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, renal and cognitive function, diabetes mellitus and quality of life. Recruitment was from 30 November 2017 to 31 May 2020; last follow-up measurements is due on 31 May 2023. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of new-onset type 3c diabetes mellitus during follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include: quality of life analyses (SF-36, Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index); montreal cognitive assessment; organ system physiological performance; multiomics predictors of AP severity, detection of premature cellular senescence. In a nested cohort within the main cohort, individuals may also consent to multiparameter MRI scan, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and pulse-wave analysis.

We have therefore investigated the safety and efficacy of megadose sodium ascorbate in sepsis. DESIGN: Interventional study. SETTING: Research Institute. SUBJECTS: Adult Merino ewes. INTERVENTIONS: Sheep were instrumented with pulmonary and renal artery flow-probes, and laser-Doppler and oxygen-sensing probes in the kidney. Conscious sheep received an infusion of live Escherichia coli for 31 hours. At 23.5 hours of sepsis, sheep received fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg, Hartmann solution) and were randomized to IV sodium ascorbate (0.5 g/kg over 0.5 hr + 0.5 g/kg/hr for 6.5 hr; n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5). Norepinephrine was titrated to restore mean arterial pressure to baseline values (~80 mm Hg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sepsis-induced fever (41.4 ± 0.2°C; mean ± SE), tachycardia (141 ± 2 beats/min), and a marked deterioration in clinical condition in all cases. Mean arterial pressure (86 ± 1 to 67 ± 2 mm Hg), arterial PO2 (102.1 ± 3.3 to 80.5 ± 3.4 mm Hg), and renal medullary tissue PO2 (41 ± 5 to 24 ± 2 mm Hg) decreased, and plasma creatinine doubled (71 ± 2 to 144 ± 15 µmol/L) (all p < 0.01). Direct observation indicated that in all animals, sodium ascorbate dramatically improved the clinical state, from malaise and lethargy to a responsive, alert state within 3 hours. Body temperature (39.3 ± 0.3°C), heart rate (99.7 ± 3 beats/min), and plasma creatinine (32.6 ± 5.8 µmol/L) all decreased. Arterial (96.5 ± 2.5 mm Hg) and renal medullary PO2 (48 ± 5 mm Hg) increased. The norepinephrine dose was decreased, to zero in four of five sheep, whereas mean arterial pressure increased (to 83 ± 2 mm Hg). We confirmed these physiologic findings in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient with shock by compassionate use of 60 g of sodium ascorbate over 7 hours. CONCLUSIONS: IV megadose sodium ascorbate reversed the pathophysiological and behavioral responses to Gram-negative sepsis without adverse side effects. Clinical studies are required to determine if such a dose has similar benefits in septic patients.","Lankadeva, Yugeesh R; Peiris, Rachel M; Okazaki, Nobuki; Birchall, Ian E; Trask-Marino, Anton; Dornom, Anthony; Vale, Tom A M; Evans, Roger G; Yanase, Fumitaka; Bellomo, Rinaldo; May, Clive N",Crit. care med,,469

276032,Fairness and Protection for the Vulnerable: Lessons from Esketamine,2020,"In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Shoukat, Affan; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Wells, Chad R; Sah, Pratha; Pandey, Abhishek; Sachs, Jeffrey D; Wang, Zheng; Meyers, Lauren A; Singer, Burton H; Galvani, Alison P",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,469

276551,Fear of childbirth in time of the new coronavirus pandemic,2020,"AimsUnique challenges have been faced by women in the perinatal period during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of this is compounded for women suffering from mental illness. This service evaluation looked at different aspects of the treatment pathway on a specialist inpatient psychiatric Mother and Baby Unit during the pandemic to identify what changes occurred.MethodData were collected for all admissions to the unit between January 2019 and October 2020, with the beginning of the pandemic being defined as on or after 1st March 2020. Information was collected retrospectively from electronic clinical notes on ethnicity, length of stay, diagnosis, mental health act use and restrictive practice, medication, psychology, occupational therapy and social services involvement.ResultThere were 114 admissions to the MBU during the study period. 4 were parenting assessments rather than acute psychiatric admissions and were excluded from the analysis, giving a sample of 110 women. 58% (62/110) were classed as “pre-pandemic” and 43.6% (48/110) were “during pandemic”. 95.45% (105/110) of women were postpartum 4.55% (5/110) were pregnant. Mean length of stay was shorter during the pandemic at 44 days, compared to 61 pre-pandemic. There was greater use of the mental health act during the pandemic: only 43.75% of patients were informal throughout admission, compared to 70.97% pre-pandemic. Mean duration of detention was shorter at 25 days (32 pre-pandemic). Psychotic illness made up a greater proportion of diagnoses during the pandemic: 56% (27/48) compared to 44% (27/62) pre-pandemic. The next most common diagnostic group was mood and anxiety disorders, which made up 29% (14/48) of diagnoses during the pandemic, but 43% (27/62) pre-pandemic. Outcomes as measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale showed a mean improvement between admission and discharge of 6.65, compared to 5.15 pre-pandemic. HONOS scores were higher on admission during the pandemic (12.83, vs 10.88), suggesting a higher level of acuity.ConclusionDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on this Mother and Baby Unit, length of stay was shorter, a greater proportion of patients were detained under the mental health act (although length of detention was shorter) and psychotic illness was more prevalent. This study demonstrates that there were differences in this perinatal inpatient population during the pandemic and this may be a reflection on the wider impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health.","Cranshaw, Joanna Seneviratne Gertrude Rao Ranga Ogunmuyiwa Julia McMillin Rebecca Ntephe Chukwuma Dain Victoria",BJPsych Open,,469

280175,Rising to the Challenges of the Pandemic: Telehealth Innovations in U.S. Emergency Departments,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted outpatient radiology practices, necessitating change in practice infrastructure and workflow. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the consequences of social distancing regulations on 1) outpatient imaging volume and 2) no-show rates per imaging modality. METHODS: Volume and no-show rates of a large, multicenter metropolitan healthcare system outpatient practice were retrospectively stratified by modality including radiography, CT, MRI, ultrasonography, PET, DEXA, and mammography from January 2 to July 21, 2020. Trends were assessed relative to timepoints of significant state and local social distancing regulatory changes. RESULTS: The decline in imaging volume and rise in no-show rates was first noted on March 10, 2020 following the declaration of a state of emergency in New York State (NYS). Total outpatient imaging volume declined 85% from baseline over the following 5 days. Decreases varied by modality: 88% for radiography, 75% for CT, 73% for MR, 61% for PET, 80% for ultrasonography, 90% for DEXA, and 85% for mammography. Imaging volume and no-show rate recovery preceded the mask mandate of April 15, 2020, and further trended along with New York City's reopening phases. No-show rates recovered within 2 months of the height of the pandemic, however, outpatient imaging volume has yet to recover to baseline after 3 months. CONCLUSION: The total outpatient imaging volume declined alongside an increase in the no-show rate following the declaration of a state of emergency in NYS. No-show rates recovered within 2 months of the height of the pandemic with imaging volume yet to recover after 3 months. CLINICAL IMPACT: Understanding the impact of social distancing regulations on outpatient imaging volume and no-show rates can potentially aid other outpatient radiology practices and healthcare systems in anticipating upcoming changes as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.","Doshi, Amish H; Kihira, Shingo; Mahmoudi, Keon; Dayan, Etan; Carlon, Tim; Marinelli, Brett; Goldman, Daryl; Finkelstein, Mark; Delman, Bradley N; Lookstein, Robert; Sullivan, Nisha; Hart, John; Drayer, Burton P",Clin Imaging,,469

In the clinical symptoms of Behçet's disease, many immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs are used. The suspicion that drugs used in chronic disease treatments such as Behçet's disease during pandemic will increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, and that the disease may progress more lethally in these patients after the infection caused clinicians to worry. As far as we know, there is no study in the literature about the management of patients with Behçet's disease in the pandemic period. Fifty-four patients with Behçet's disease who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 11 March and July 14, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In this pandemic period, 44 of 54 patients were recommended to continue their previous treatment. While the dose of medication used by 7 patients was reduced, it was decided to change the treatment of 3 patients. No life-threatening activation was observed. None of the patients developed COVID-19 disease. This article is important in terms of being the first study in the literature examining the treatment of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19. In this period, we know that the treatment practices in chronic diseases change frequently daily, and in this respect, we hope that our study will provide a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the treatment of Behçet's disease during the pandemic.","Dursun, Recep; Temiz, Selami A; Özer, Ilkay; Daye, Munise; Ataseven, Arzu",Dermatol Ther,,469

The suspicion that drugs used in chronic disease treatments such as Behçet's disease during pandemic will increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, and that the disease may progress more lethally in these patients after the infection caused clinicians to worry. As far as we know, there is no study in the literature about the management of patients with Behçet's disease in the pandemic period. Fifty-four patients with Behçet's disease who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 11 March and July 14, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. In this pandemic period, 44 of 54 patients were recommended to continue their previous treatment. While the dose of medication used by 7 patients was reduced, it was decided to change the treatment of 3 patients. No life-threatening activation was observed. None of the patients developed COVID-19 disease. This article is important in terms of being the first study in the literature examining the treatment of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19. In this period, we know that the treatment practices in chronic diseases change frequently daily, and in this respect, we hope that our study will provide a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the treatment of Behçet's disease during the pandemic.","Dursun, Recep; Temiz, Selami A; Özer, Ilkay; Daye, Munise; Ataseven, Arzu",Dermatol Ther,,469
282741,Fear of death and polarization: Political consequences of the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Abstract Satellite NO2 measurements are used extensively to infer nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and their trends, but interpretation can be complicated by background contributions to the NO2 column sensed from space. We use the step decrease of US anthropogenic emissions from the COVID-19 shutdown to compare the responses of NO2 concentrations observed at surface network sites and from satellites (OMI, TROPOMI). After correcting for differences in meteorology, surface NO2 measurements for 2020 show decreases of 20% in March-April and 10% in May-August compared to 2019. The satellites show much weaker responses in March-June and no decrease in July-August, consistent with a large background contribution to the NO2 column. Inspection of the long-term OMI trend over remote US regions shows a rising summertime NO2 background from 2010 to 2019 potentially attributable to wildfires.","Qu, Zhen Jacob Daniel J.; Silvern, Rachel F.; Shah, Viral Campbell Patrick C.; Valin, Lukas C.; Murray, Lee T.",Geophysical Research Letters,,469

Individuals who walk at least 10 000 steps per day are likely to meet recommended physical activity guidelines. Very little is known about the physical activity levels of doctors at work, in particular those working in emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES: To determine how many steps per shift were taken by doctors in a South African (SA) ED. Secondary objectives were to assess what factors influenced the number of steps taken. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study in a tertiary academic teaching hospital ED in Johannesburg over a 1-month period. Doctors wore pedometers during their day shifts in the ED and the number of steps taken during their shifts was measured, as well as the number and triage category of patients seen and whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) number of steps taken per shift was 6 328 (4 646 - 8 409). The number of steps taken exceeded the 10 000-step target in only 11.7% of shifts. The overall mean (standard deviation (SD)) number of steps per hour was 744 (490). Factors that significantly increased the number of steps taken included shift duration, number of patients seen who were triaged yellow, and performance of CPR in a shift. Each additional hour of shift led to a mean (SD) increase of 575 (115) steps. Each additional yellow patient seen led to a mean (SD) increase of 118 (108) steps. The mean (SD) number of steps for a shift with CPR was significantly higher (8 309 (850) steps) than for a shift without CPR (6 496 (384) steps). CONCLUSIONS: Doctors working in an SA ED are not achieving the daily recommended number of steps while at work. The increased risk of ill health and burnout in an already high-risk specialty heightens the importance of exercise and physical activity that needs to be achieved outside the workplace.","Beringer, C B; Wells, M; Goldstein, L N",S Afr Med J,,469

During the five days of Hajj, a total of 185 pilgrims were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of 126/185 patients (68.11%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses by PCR. Among the 126 pilgrims whose NPS were PCR positive: (a) there were 93/126 (74%) with a single virus infection, (b) 33/126 (26%) with coinfection with more than one virus (up to four viruses): of these, 25/33 cases had coinfection with two viruses; 6/33 were infected with three viruses, while the remaining 2/33 patients had infection with four viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common detected viruses with 53 cases (42.06%), followed by 27 (21.43%) cases of influenza A (H1N1), and 23 (18.25%) cases of influenza A other than H1N1. Twenty-five cases of CoV-229E (19.84%) were detected more than other coronavirus members (5 CoV-OC43 (3.97%), 4 CoV-HKU1 (3.17%), and 1 CoV-NL63 (0.79%)). PIV-3 was detected in 8 cases (6.35%). A single case (0.79%) of PIV-1 and PIV-4 were found. HMPV represented 5 (3.97%), RSV and influenza B 4 (3.17%) for each, and Parechovirus 1 (0.79%). Enterovirus, Bocavirus, and M. pneumoniae were not detected. Whether identification of viral nucleic acid represents nasopharyngeal carriage or specific causal etiology of RTI remains to be defined. Large controlled cohort studies (pre-Hajj, during Hajj, and post-Hajj) are required to define the carriage rates and the specific etiology and causal roles of specific individual viruses or combination of viruses in the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections in pilgrims participating in the annual Hajj.

Here, we present a revised analysis from the New Orleans dataset of soil lead (SPb) and children's blood Pb (BPb), which was systematically assembled for 2000-2005 and 2011-2016. We show the spatial-temporal inequities in SPb, children's BPb, racial composition, and household income in New Orleans.

Between 2000-2005 and 2011-2016, a BPb decline occurred. Long-standing environmental and socioeconomic Pb exposure injustices have positioned Black populations at extreme risk of adverse health consequences. Given the overlapping health outcomes of Pb exposure with co-morbidities for conditions such as COVID-19, we suggest that further investigation be conducted on Pb exposure and pandemic-related mortality rates, particularly among Black populations.

291144,Factors associated with psychic symptomatology in diabetics during the COVID-19 pandemic/ Fatores associados à sintomatologia psíquica em diabéticos durante a pandemia da COVID-19,2021,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a comprehensive regulator of vascular and airway tone. Endogenous NO produced by nitric oxide synthases regulates multiple signaling cascades, including activation of soluble guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP, relaxing smooth muscle cells. Inhaled NO is an established therapy for pulmonary hypertension in neonates, and has been recently proposed for treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the effects of endogenous and exogenous NO on protein S-nitrosylation, which is the selective and reversible covalent attachment of a nitrogen monoxide group to the thiol side chain of cysteine. This post-translational modification targets specific cysteines based on the acid/base sequence of surrounding residues, with significant impacts on protein interactions and function. S-nitrosothiol (SNO) formation is tightly compartmentalized and enzymatically controlled, but also propagated by non-enzymatic transnitrosylation of downstream protein targets. Redox-based nitrosylation and denitrosylation pathways dynamically regulate the equilibrium of SNO-proteins. We review the physiological roles of SNO proteins, including nitrosohemoglobin and autoregulation of blood flow through hypoxic vasodilation, and pathological effects of nitrosylation including inhibition of critical vasodilator enzymes; and discuss the intersection of NO source and dose with redox environment, in determining the effects of protein nitrosylation.

Contextualising the COVID-19 pandemic, we draw on the six behavioural indicators (media coverage, fake news, panic, sentiment, media hype and infodemic) of the 17 largest economies and data from 1st January 2020 to 3rd February 2021. Our key findings, obtained using a time-varying parameter-vector auto-regression (TVP-VAR) model, indicate the total and net connectedness for the new index, entitled ’feverish sentiment’. This index provides us insight into economies that send or receive the sentiment shocks. The construction of the network structures indicates that the United Kingdom, China, the United States and Germany became the epicentres of the sentimental shocks that were transmitted to other economies. Furthermore, we also explore the predictive power of the newly constructed index on stock returns and volatility. It turns out that investor sentiment positively (negatively) predicts the stock volatility (return) at the onset of COVID-19.

Information about these agents and their effects circulated throughout the general public media, raising the concern for self-directed consumption of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. Case Report: We present two cases of chloroquine toxicity that occurred after ingestion of an aquarium disinfectant that contained chloroquine phosphate in a misguided attempt to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2. One patient had repeated emesis and survived, while the other was unable to vomit, despite attempts, and suffered fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. Conclusion: These cases illustrate the spectrum of toxicity, varied presentations, and importance of early recognition and management of chloroquine poisoning. In addition, we can see the importance of sound medical guidance in an era of social confusion compounded by the extremes of public and social media.","Graff, Jonathan Thompson Michelle Geyer Berriochoa Zachary Kuhn Bryan Ruha Anne-Michelle Lipinski Christopher",Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine,,469

Prior to the arrival of this viral pandemic, the world was already plagued with a significant burden of cardiovascular disease. With the introduction of the novel virus, the world now faces a double jeapordy. Early reports have suggested an increased risk of death in individuals with underlying cardio-metabolic disorders. The exact effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system are not well determined, however lessons from prior viral epidemics suggest that such infections can trigger acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias and heart failure via direct and indirect mechanisms. In this article, we aimed to discuss the effects and potential underlying mechanisms of COVID -19 as well as potential implications of treatments targeted against this virus on the cardiovascular system.","Rojulpote, Chaitanya; Gonuguntla, Karthik; Patil, Shivaraj; Bhattaru, Abhijit; Bravo, Paco E",Colomb Med (Cali),,469
293949,Management of food security actions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: There are no prior reports that compare differentially methylated regions of DNA in blood samples from COVID-19 patients to samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using a shared epigenotyping platform. We performed a genome-wide analysis of circulating blood DNA CpG methylation using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip on 124 blood samples from hospitalized COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients and compared these data with previously reported data from 39 healthy individuals collected before the pandemic. Prospective outcome measures such as COVID-19-GRAM risk-score and mortality were combined with methylation data. RESULTS: Global mean methylation levels did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy pre-pandemic controls. About 75% of acute illness-associated differentially methylated regions were located near gene promoter regions and were hypo-methylated in comparison with healthy pre-pandemic controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed terms associated with the immune response to viral infections and leukocyte activation; and disease ontology analyses revealed a predominance of autoimmune disorders. Among COVID-19-positive patients, worse outcomes were associated with a prevailing hyper-methylated status. Recursive feature elimination identified 77 differentially methylated positions predictive of COVID-19 severity measured by the GRAM-risk score. CONCLUSION: Our data contribute to the awareness that DNA methylation may influence the expression of genes that regulate COVID-19 progression and represent a targetable process in that setting.","Balnis, Joseph; Madrid, Andy; Hogan, Kirk J; Drake, Lisa A; Chieng, Hau C; Tiwari, Anupama; Vincent, Catherine E; Chopra, Amit; Vincent, Peter A; Robek, Michael D; Singer, Harold A; Alisch, Reid S; Jaitovich, Ariel",Clin Epigenetics,,469
294850,Safety model for chest drainage in pandemic by COVID-19,2020,"Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), AUC, precision and F1-score achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95%, 96.35%, 93.10% and 93.07%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.","Sun, Liang; Mo, Zhanhao; Yan, Fuhua; Xia, Liming; Shan, Fei; Ding, Zhongxiang; Song, Bin; Gao, Wanchun; Shao, Wei; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Wei, Ying; Gao, Yaozong; Sui, He; Zhang, Daoqiang; Shen, Dinggang",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,469
296766,Alternative approaches for clinical clerkship during the COVID-19 pandemic: online simulated clinical practice for inpatients and outpatients-A mixed method,2021,"With the onset of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, industrial suppliers are increasingly challenged to close their open sales opportunities and keep generating business. Against this backdrop, the authors of this study investigate which offerings industrial customers are most likely to purchase as the pandemic progresses. Drawing on positive decision theory and empirically investigating 31,353 sales opportunities across 57 countries, the authors show that the coronavirus pandemic significantly decreases industrial customers' purchase probability, especially for high-priced offerings. In countries with low uncertainty avoidance and strong long-term orientation (e.g., China, India, Singapore), purchase probability is less affected by the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic even increases purchase probability for offerings with low prices in countries where cultures are simultaneously uncertainty-avoidant and short-term oriented (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). This is presumably because customers safeguard their operations in the face of impending supply shortages. Consequently, this helps suppliers focus on the right sales opportunities to secure their business during exogenous global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic.","Habel, Johannes; Jarotschkin, Viktor; Schmitz, Bianca; Eggert, Andreas; Plötner, Olaf",Ind.

METHODS: We collected the data of type 2 diabetics with COVID-19 treated in our hospital from January 28 to March 15, 2020 and performed a retrospective analysis. Using severity, duration of hospital stay, and the time required for nucleic acid results became negative as prognostic indicators, we explored the relationship between these inflammation-based markers and prognosis of type 2 diabetics with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 134 type 2 diabetics with COVID-19 were selected for this study. Correlation analysis showed that NLR, LMR and RDW were correlated with prognosis (P < 0.05). In multivariate regression analysis after controlling for the relevant confounding factors, COVID-19 diabetes patients with higher NLR had heavier severity, longer duration of hospital stay, more time required for nucleic acid results became negative, and heavier hospital expenses (P < 0.05). ROC curve result displayed that higher NLR predicted all prognostic indicators with statistical significance, and lower LMR predicted severe and extremely severe with statistical significance (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NLR is a more powerful and practical marker for predicting the prognosis of type 2 diabetic COVID-19 patients that is simple and fast.","Liu, Gaoli; Zhang, Shaowen; Hu, Haifeng; Liu, TingTing; Huang, Jie",Scott Med J,,469

297641,Corrigendum,2020,"Introduction En France, une Autorisation d’Utilisation Temporaire de cohorte (ATUc) a été délivrée le 27/02/2021 pour l’utilisation du bamlanivimab en monothérapie dans le traitement précoce (&lt;5jours du début des symptômes) de patients adultes avec un COVID-19 léger à modéré confirmé par PCR et à haut risque d’évolution vers une forme sévère. Les patients concernés étaient les patients de &gt;80 ans ou les patients de &lt;80 ans immunodéprimés (transplantation, chimiothérapie, traitement immunosuppresseur). Le risque d’émergence de variants potentiellement résistants à un monothérapie par anticorps monoclonal anti-Spike, en particulier les variants E484K, avait été pris en compte lors de l’ATUc. Cependant, le bénéfice potentiel de ces traitements chez les patients à haut risque a été considéré comme supérieur au risque. Ici nous décrivons 6 patients ayant reçu de ce traitement, leur évolution et l’émergence de mutations de résistance sous pression de sélection. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude unicentrique en centre hospitalier universitaire. Le bamlanivimab a été administré à une dose unique de 700mg en injection IV d’une heure chez 6 patients qui ont accepté d’utiliser le traitement dans le cadre de l’ATUc. Le suivi virologique des patients a consisté en un test RT-qPCR itératif réalisé le jour de la perfusion ou la veille, à J3±1, à J5±1, à J7±1 puis tous les 3jours jusqu’à ce que la PCR soit négative. La sélection de mutation de résistance a été vérifiée par séquençage du génome complet du SARS-CoV-2 chez tous les patients. Résultats Les six hommes traités avaient un âge médian de 65 ans (extrêmes 35-97), plus de 3 comorbidités à haut risque d’évolution vers une forme sévère et 5 étaient infectés par un variant UK (N501Y.V1, B.1.1.7). Le traitement a été administré dans les 4jours suivant l’apparition des symptômes (médiane 2jours). Les 6 patients ont eu une évolution clinique favorable, deux ont eu besoin d’oxygène au débit maximal de 4 L/min. Aucun patient n’a eu besoin d’oxygénothérapie haut débit, d’une ventilation non invasive ou d’une ventilation invasive. À J20 après l’administration, un seul présentait une PCR nasopharyngée négative et 5 présentaient l’apparition d’une mutation E484K à différents moments après l’administration (J6, J7, J12, J14 et J26). Conclusion Chez ces patients à très haut risque d’évolution vers une forme sévère, la sélection de la mutation E484K après administration de bamlanivimab en monothérapie était très fréquente et bien plus importante qu’observée dans les premiers essais cliniques. Ceci peut être expliqué en partie par l’infection par un variant UK pour 5/6 patients décrits ici. L’émergence de résistance lors des bithérapies devra être suivi attentivement, notamment avec l’émergence des nouveaux variants.","Peiffer-Smadja, N.; Bridier-Nahmias, A.; Carpentier, C.; Garé, M.; Rioux, C.; Allemand, A.; Kramer, L.; Descamps, D.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Visseaux, B.",Infectious Diseases Now,,469

This paper offers a critical and context-based approach to understanding globalization and localization by challenging the conceptualization of 'value' and 'risk' within the current global production networks framework as well as identifying key operational strategies in risk management and national security. An analysis of the adaptation strategies of the GPNs of 91 companies identifies the role played by four different forms of value in configuring production networks. This is to balance 'economic value' with non-price-based sources of value and alternative values. The analysis underscores the critical role of the state in ensuring national and human security as well as its increasing power as a key actor in GPNs and the global economy.","Bryson, John R; Vanchan, Vida",Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie,,469
302625,Demoralization in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: Whereto the future for young Australians?,2020,"Transmission of respiratory viruses is a complex process involving emission, deposition in the airways, and infection. Inhalation is often the most relevant transmission mode in indoor environments. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the risk of inhalation transmission is not yet fully understood. Here, we used an indoor aerosol model combined with a regional inhaled deposited dose model to examine the indoor transport of aerosols from an infected person with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to a susceptible person and assess the potential inhaled dose rate of particles. Two scenarios with different ventilation rates were compared, as well as adult female versus male recipients. Assuming a source strength of 10 viruses/s, in a tightly closed room with poor ventilation (0.5 h-1), the respiratory tract deposited dose rate was 140-350 and 100-260 inhaled viruses/hour for males and females; respectively. With ventilation at 3 h-1 the dose rate was only 30-90 viruses/hour. Correcting for the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in air, these numbers are reduced by a factor of 1.2-2.2 for poorly ventilated rooms and 1.1-1.4 for well-ventilated rooms. Combined with future determinations of virus emission rates, the size distribution of aerosols containing the virus, and the infectious dose, these results could play an important role in understanding the full picture of potential inhalation transmission in indoor environments.","Hussein, Tareq; Löndahl, Jakob; Thuresson, Sara; Alsved, Malin; Al-Hunaiti, Afnan; Saksela, Kalle; Aqel, Hazem; Junninen, Heikki; Mahura, Alexander; Kulmala, Markku",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,469
302648,Coronavirus:-An emerging pathogen,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While detection of SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) is currently used to diagnose acute COVID-19 infection, serological assays are needed to study the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)G/A/M antibodies against spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were characterized in recovered subjects who were RT-PCR-positive (n = 153) and RT-PCR-negative (n = 55) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These antibodies were also further assessed for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 90.9% of resolved subjects up to 180 days post-symptom onset. Anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG titers correlated (r = 0.5157 and r = 0.6010, respectively) with viral neutralization. Of the RT-PCR-positive subjects, 22 (14.3%) did not have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and of those, 17 had RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values > 27. These high Ct values raise the possibility that these indeterminate results are from individuals who were not infected or had mild infection that failed to elicit an antibody response. This study highlights the importance of serological surveys to determine population-level immunity based on infection numbers as determined by RT-PCR.","Huynh, Angela; Arnold, Donald M; Smith, James W; Moore, Jane C; Zhang, Ali; Chagla, Zain; Harvey, Bart J; Stacey, Hannah D; Ang, Jann C; Clare, Rumi; Ivetic, Nikola; Chetty, Vasudhevan T; Bowdish, Dawn M E; Miller, Matthew S; Kelton, John G; Nazy, Ishac",Viruses,,469

This case has been cited several times but without accuracy or entirety, we feel obligated to report it and share our thoughts on the epidemic among medical staff and performing endonasal endoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient developed a fever 3 d post endonasal endoscopic surgery during which cerebrospinal leak occurred, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection later. Several medical staff outside the operating room were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the ones who participated in the surgery were not. CONCLUSION: The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a cliché in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate. The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.","Zhu, Wende; Huang, Xing; Zhao, Hongyang; Jiang, Xiaobing",Neurosurgery,,469

CLIAs and ELISAs can be automated to a high degree but commonly require larger serum or plasma volumes for sample processing. We addressed the suitability of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood as an alternative sample material for antibody testing against SARS-CoV-2 by electro-CLIA (ECLIA; Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and ELISA (IgG and IgA; Euroimmun, Germany). Simultaneously drawn venous serum and EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples from 223 individuals were included. Correction of the whole blood results for hematocrit led to a good agreement with the serum results for weakly to moderately positive antibody signals. In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, all three assays displayed comparable diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) using corrected whole blood and serum (AUCs: 0.97 for ECLIA and IgG ELISA; 0.84 for IgA ELISA). In conclusion, our results suggest that the investigated assays can reliably detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in hemolyzed whole blood anticoagulated with EDTA. Correction of these results for hematocrit is suggested. This study demonstrates that the automated processing of whole blood for identification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with common ECLIA and ELISA methods is accurate and feasible.","Kovac, Marc; Risch, Lorenz; Thiel, Sarah; Weber, Myriam; Grossmann, Kirsten; Wohlwend, Nadja; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Bigler, Susanna; Ferrara, Francesca; Bodmer, Thomas; Egli, Konrad; Imperiali, Mauro; Heer, Sonja; Salimi, Yacir; Renz, Harald; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Kahlert, Christian R; Paprotny, Matthias; Risch, Martin",,,469

316652,Communicable disease outbreaks: Contact tracing,2020,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic situation the world is facing caused by the new SARS-Cov-2 continues to evolve and still represent a real problem. With more than eight thousand reported cases infection, Cameroon stands as the seventh most affected country in Africa. Prevention remains the best way to fight against this zoonosis. However, the limited information available about this infection is a great barrier to stopping the propagation of the virus within the population, especially in rural and semi-rural areas, where the lack of financial and material resources is a reality. This study aimed to assessing Awareness and attitudes of the population of the Menoua Division on COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 9 to April 15 2020 amongst the populations of rural and semi-rural areas of the Menoua Division. Data were collected using a questionnaire administered face to face to each participant. The analysis was carried out using the Statistical Analysis System software (SAS version 9.4). The significance threshold was set at a P value of less than 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 434 participants of which male majority (sex ratio 1.07) were included in this study. The most represented age group was [21 - 40] years old representing 40.29% of the participants. Approximately all participants (98.57%) were aware of the world emergency state due to Coronavirus. 75.56%, 91% and 90.93% of the participants knew respectively that having close contacts, kissing and touching the face with the hands could favor the transmission of the virus. However, nearly 91.14% were not aware of the clinical symptoms of the disease. Moreover, 85.02% responded that they would not be able to comply with the confinement measures if they were applied at national level. The level of awareness varied significantly according to the occupation (p=0.038) and the educational level (p&lt;0.001)of the participants. CONCLUSION: The average level of awareness of the population of the Menoua Division on COVID-19 infection was relatively low. Overcoming this pandemic disease means ensuring the flow of the correct information towards the population. Community outreach activities focus on clinical manifestations and what to do in case of COVID-19 infection as well as material and financial support should be help the population to protect themselves effectively against pandemic, particularly in rural areas and surrounding.","Zogning Makemjio, Eméline; Tiotsia Tsapi, Armand; Défo Tamgno, Eric; Djeunang Dongho, Ghyslaine Bruna; Nguefack-Tsague, Georges; Montesano, Carla; Colizzi, Vittorio; Russo, Gianluca; Sanou Sobze, Martin",Ig Sanita Pubbl,,469

The target of this research is to investigate students' manners of studying at home during the school suspension time as a result of COVID-19. Through analyzing original survey data from 420 K6-12 students in Hanoi, Vietnam, this work demonstrates the different learning habits of students with different socioeconomic statuses and occupational aspirations during the disease's outbreak. In particular, we featured the differences in students' learning behaviors between private schools and public schools, as well as between students who plan to follow STEM-related careers and those who intend to engage in social science-related careers. The empirical evidence of this study can be used for the consideration of the local government to increase the sustainability of coming policies and regulations to boost students' self-efficacy, as it will affect 1.4 million students in Hanoi, as well as the larger population of nearly 10 million Vietnamese students. These results can also be the foundation for future investigations on how to elevate students' learning habits toward Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4)-Quality Education-especially in fanciful situations in which the regular school operation has been disrupted, counting with limited observation and support from teachers and parents.","Tran, Trung; Hoang, Anh-Duc; Nguyen, Yen-Chi; Nguyen, Linh-Chi; Ta, Ngoc-Thuy; Pham, Quang-Hong; Pham, Chung-Xuan; Le, Quynh-Anh; Dinh, Viet-Hung; Nguyen, Tien-Trung",Sustainability,,469

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA detection was performed with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 163 samples were collected from February 6 to April 4. Among 122 surface samples, 2 were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA detection. One was collected from the flush button of the toilet bowl, and the other was collected from a hand-basin. Although 10 of the sewage samples were positive for viral RNA detection, all positive samples were negative for viral culture. CONCLUSION: These results revealed the routine disinfection procedures in our hospital were effective in reducing the potential risk of healthcare associated infection. Two surface samples were positive for viral detection, suggesting that more attention should be paid when disinfecting places easy to be ignored.","Ge, Tianxiang; Lu, Ye; Zheng, Shufa; Zhuo, Lixin; Yu, Ling; Ni, Zuowei; Zhou, Yanan; Ni, Lingmei; Qu, Tingting; Zhong, Zifeng",Am. j. infect. control,,469
321675,What can COVID-19 teach us about responding to climate change?,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contacts. It is important to collect information on age-specific contact patterns because SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, transmission, and morbidity vary by age. To reduce risk of infection, social distancing measures have been implemented. Social contact data, which identify who has contact with whom especially by age and place are needed to identify high-risk groups and serve to inform the design of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We estimated and used negative binomial regression to compare the number of daily contacts during the first wave (April-May 2020) of the Minnesota Social Contact Study, based on respondents age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, and other demographic characteristics. We used information on age and location of contacts to generate age-structured contact matrices. Finally, we compared the age-structured contact matrices during the stay-at-home order to pre-pandemic matrices. During the state-wide stay-home order, the mean daily number of contacts was 5.6. We found significant variation in contacts by age, gender, race, and region. Adults between 40 and 50 years had the highest number of contacts. Respondents in Black households had 2.1 more contacts than respondent in White households, while respondents in Asian or Pacific Islander households had approximately the same number of contacts as respondent in White households. Respondents in Hispanic households had approximately two fewer contacts compared to White households. Most contacts were with other individuals in the same age group. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the biggest declines occurred in contacts between children, and contacts between those over 60 with those below 60.","Dorelien, Audrey M; Venkateswaran, Narmada; Deng, Jiuchen; Searle, Kelly; Enns, Eva; Kulasingam, Shalini",,,469
322128,[Response capacity to the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean],2020,"Teleneurology in Spain had not been implemented so far in clinical practice, except in urgent patients with stroke. Telemedicine was hardly used in epilepsy, and patients and neurologists usually preferred onsite visits. Our goal was to study impressions of adult and pediatric epileptologists about the use of telemedicine after emergent implementation during the new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was sent to the members of the Spanish Epilepsy Society and the members of the Epilepsy Study Group of the Catalan Neurological Society, inquiring about different aspects of telemedicine in epilepsy during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 66 neurologists responded, mostly adult neurologists (80.3%), the majority with a monographic epilepsy clinic (4 out of 5). Of all respondents, 59.1% reported to attend more than 20 patients with epilepsy (PWE) a week. During the pandemic, respondents handled their epilepsy clinics mainly with telephone calls (88%); only 4.5% used videoconference. Changes in antiseizure medications were performed less frequently than during onsite visits by 66.6% of the epileptologists. Scales were not administered during these visits, and certain types of information such as sudden expected unrelated death in epilepsy (SUDEP) were felt to be more appropriate to discuss in person. More than 4 out of 5 of the neurologists (84.8%) stated that they would be open to perform some telematic visits in the future.

This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria's epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. RESULTS: About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients' satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. Being over 30 years of age was significantly associated with an increased clients' satisfaction score (ß = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.10-2.50). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown posed challenges to accessing RMNCH services for a significant proportion of women surveyed. Although overall satisfaction with care was fairly high, there is a need to provide tailored COVID-19 sensitive inter-personal care to clients at all levels of care.","Balogun, Mobolanle; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Sekoni, Adekemi; Boateng, Godfred O; Yesufu, Victoria; Wright, Ololade; Ubani, Osinachi; Abayomi, Akin; Afolabi, Bosede B; Ogunsola, Folasade",PLoS One,,469

325212,The COVID Clerkship,2021,"Background: Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder, which autoantibodies against postsynaptic (muscle) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). MG patients have a higher prevalence of cardiac manifestations in the presence of thymoma. It is not known whether Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause more severe illness in patients with chronic neuromuscular disorders such as MG, which can cause respiratory muscle weakness, or in those who are immunosuppressed. This case report will discuss patient with MG, thymoma, atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19. Case presentation: A 60-year old man came to the hospital with difficulty of swallowing. He had nasal voice and dropping of eyelids. These complaints were happened repeatedly, worsened at night and got better in the next morning. From the neurological examination, it was also obtained Wartenberg test (+), counting test (+), and prostigmine test (+). Atrial fibrillation was found with normal ventricular response and decreased systolic left ventricular function on the electrocardiogram and echocardiography. On the chest MSCT, a lobulated homogeneous solid mass was found in anterior mediastinum which supported the image of thymoma, and there was the imaging of typical viral pneumonia. The patient also had the positive result of COVID-19 PCR test. Conclusion: MG patients have been shown with abnormal manifestations of heart rhythm. This may reflect as a complication of myocarditis or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. COVID-19 infection in MG can be challenging for many reasons. Current guidelines recommend continuing the current standard care treatment of MG during hospitalization.","Tugasworo, D.; Kurnianto, A.; Retnaningsih, Andhitara Y.; Ardhini, R.; Daynuri, Budiman J.",Bali Medical Journal,,469

MethodsIn this prospective study, disease activity and clinical assessments were recorded from the first dose of vaccine, until day 15 after the second dose in 126 SLE patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were measured against wild-type spike antigen while serum-neutralizing activity was assessed against the SARS-CoV-2 historical strain and variants of concerns (VOCs). Vaccine-specific T-cell responses were quantified by Interferon (IFN)-{gamma} release assay after the second dose. ResultsBNT162b2 was well tolerated and no statistically significant variations of BILAG and SLEDAI scores were observed throughout the study in SLE patients with active and inactive disease at baseline. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and Methotrexate (MTX) treatments were associated with drastically reduced BNT162b2 antibody-response ({beta}=-78; p=0.007, {beta}=-122; p<0.001, respectively). Anti-spike antibody response was positively associated with baseline total IgG serum levels, naive B cell frequencies ({beta}=2; p=0.018, {beta}=2.5; p=0.003) and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (r=0.462; p=0.003). In responders, serum neutralization activity decreased against VOCs bearing the E484K mutation but remained detectable in a majority of patients. ConclusionMMF, MTX and poor baseline humoral immune status, particularly: low naive B cell frequencies, are independently associated with impaired BNT162b2 mRNA antibody response, delineating SLE patients who might need adapted vaccine regimens and follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty monothematic items with a series of questions to evaluate child's clinical conditions have been set up in order to evaluate the different situations according to their severity. All items were highlighted according to conventional scores corresponding to the different answers (yes/no) given by the child's parents. This system has been implemented with large diffusion of computer programs and applications by the availability of a computer station in every ED room. RESULTS: The system allows healthcare workers to establish the medical check-up urgency which may be immediate, within the next 24 hours or scheduled in the pediatric ward. Therefore, it has been implemented a telephone triage consultation with a standardized method. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone consultation during outbreaks, considering the risks of contagion, allows healthcare workers to decrease the concern of families and to reduce indiscriminate access to ED. The remote approach will not solve logistic and setting problems related to COVID-19 outbreak17, but it would be a valid tool to improve medical evaluation without deep change in infrastructure and clinical organization.","Ferretti, S; Gatto, A; Pansini, V; Curatola, A; Capossela, L; Currò, V; Chiaretti, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,469

Studies are increasing to find the best therapeutic approach for the disease and its management. Regenerative medicine offers various cell-tissue therapeutics and related products, such as stem cell therapy, natural killer (NK) cell therapy, Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, exosomes, and tissue products. Interestingly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammatory symptoms and protect against cytokine storm, which critically contributes to the COVID-19 progression. Notably, having the potentials to exert cytotoxic effects on infected cells and induce interferon production probably make NK cells a candidate for COVID-19 cell therapy. Besides, exosomes are one of the crucial products of cells that can exert therapeutic effects through the induction of immune responses and neutralizing antibody titers. The paper aims to briefly consider current options for COVID-19 therapy to show that there is no specific cure for COVID-19, and then assess the real opportunities and range of promises regenerative medicine can provide for specific treatment of COVID-19.

The purpose of this paper is to describe how a strong academic-practice partnership shaped our response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. During this unprecedented time, existing relationships between the health system and school of nursing were quickly leveraged to provide mutually beneficial relief, opportunities, and support. Initiatives described in this paper demonstrate how powerful a concentrated academic-practice partnership can be in transforming the nursing profession. Moving forward, it will be crucial for schools to build partnerships with appropriate organizations that have a vested interest in preparing nurses for the future.","Reynolds, Staci; Fuchs, Mary Ann; Edwards, Pamela; Uzarski, Diane; Alston, Sylvia; Broome, Marion",,,469
331502,Public affairs and communicating coronavirus vaccine risk: The role of government in maintaining public trust,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused almost 2 million deaths worldwide. Both Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have recently approved the first COVID-19 vaccines, and a few more are going to be approved soon. METHODS: Several different approaches have been used to stimulate the immune system in mounting a humoral response. As more traditional approaches are under investigation (inactivated virus vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, recombinant virus vaccines), more recent and innovative strategies have been tried (non-replicating viral vector vaccines, RNA based vaccines, DNA based vaccines). RESULTS: Since vaccinations campaigns started in December 2020 in both the US and Europe, gastroenterologists will be one of the main sources of information regarding SARS-CoV 2 vaccination for patients in their practice, including vulnerable patients such as those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), patients with chronic liver disease, and GI cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we must ourselves be well educated and updated in order to provide unambiguous counseling to these categories of vulnerable patients. In this commentary, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of both approved COVID-19 vaccines and the ones still under development, and explore potential risks, benefits and prioritization of vaccination.","Spadaccini, Marco; Canziani, Lorenzo; Aghemo, Alessio; Lleo, Ana; Maselli, Roberta; Anderloni, Andrea; Carrara, Silvia; Fugazza, Alessandro; Pellegatta, Gaia; Galtieri, Piera Alessia; Hassan, Cesare; Greenwald, David; Pochapin, Mark; Wallace, Michael; Sharma, Prateek; Roesch, Thomas; Bhandari, Pradeep; Emura, Fabian; Raju, Gottumukkala S; Repici, Alessandro",,,469

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. METHODS: All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 - September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8&#8805;10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7&#8805;10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5&#8805;7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID&#8805;2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable ""disabling"" current mental disorders. RESULTS: 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Workers with pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring ""all of the time"" for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). CONCLUSIONS: One in seven Spanish healthcare workers screened positive for a disabling mental disorder during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers reporting pre-pandemic lifetime mental disorders, those frequently exposed to COVID-19 patients, infected or quarantined/isolated, female workers, and auxiliary nurses should be considered groups in need of mental health monitoring and support.","Alonso, Jordi; Vilagut, Gemma; Mortier, Philippe; Ferrer, Montse; Alayo, Itxaso; Aragón-Peña, Andrés; Aragonès, Enric; Campos, Mireia; Cura-González, Isabel D; Emparanza, José I; Espuga, Meritxell; Forjaz, Maria João; González-Pinto, Ana; Haro, Josep M; López-Fresneña, Nieves; Salázar, Alma D Martínez de; Molina, Juan D; Ortí-Lucas, Rafael M; Parellada, Mara; Pelayo-Terán, José Maria; Pérez-Zapata, Aurora; Pijoan, José I; Plana, Nieves; Puig, Maria Teresa; Rius, Cristina; Rodríguez-Blázquez, Carmen; Sanz, Ferran; Serra, Consol; Kessler, Ronald C; Bruffaerts, Ronny; Vieta, Eduard; Pérez-Solà, Víctor","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

333452,Student Perspectives on Remote Medical Education in Clinical Core Clerkships During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates burnout and sources of COVID-related stress among a group of healthcare risk managers/patient safety practitioners. METHODS: An online survey including Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), and one open-ended question: ""Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, what work or non work-related issues have been causing you the most stress?"" RESULTS: 31 participants completed the OLBI; 27 answered the open-ended question. Over 70% of participants qualified as burned out. Thematic analysis was used to analyze stressors. Key themes included: Impacts of social distancing, changing duties and workload, real and potential impacts of the virus (e.g., fear of infection for self or others), and financial concerns (personal and organizational). Less common themes included untrustworthy and constantly changing guidance, feeling abused by persons in power, and positive comments about the experience of working during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Burnout and pandemic-related stress may be very common in the healthcare risk management and patient safety workforce. Additional research is required to more robustly estimate the prevalence of burnout in this population. Meanwhile, the sources of stress identified here may aid healthcare organizations in taking immediate action to protect this vital workforce.","Card, Alan J",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,469

The results showed different fluence rates across the thickness of the eight different FFRs, implying that some FFR models may be more treatable than others, with the following order being (from most to least treatable): models 1512, 9105s, 1805, 9210, 1870+, 8210, 8110s and 1860, for single side illumination. The model predictions did not coincide well with some previously reported experimental data on virus inactivation when applied to FFR surfaces. The simulations predicted that FFRs should experience higher log reductions (>>6-log) than those observed experimentally (often limited to ~5-log). Possible explanations are virus shielding by aggregation or soiling, and a lack of the Monte Carlo simulations considering near-field scattering effects that can create small, localized regions of low UV photon probability on the surface of the fiber material. If the latter is the main cause in limiting practical UV viral decontamination, improvement might be achieved by exposing the FFR to UV isotropically from all directions, such as by varying the UV source to the FFR surface angle during treatment.","Abdalrhman, Abdallatif Satti; Wang, Chengjin; Manalac, Angelica; Weersink, Madrigal; Yassine, Abdul-Amir; Betz, Vaughn; Barbeau, Benoit; Lilge, Lothar; Hofmann, Ron",J Biophotonics,,469

Since the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of sequences have been obtained and many genetic variants have been identified. Some of them bear significant mutations that affect biological properties of the virus. These genetic variants, currently Variants of Concern (VoC), include the so-called United Kingdom variant (20I/501Y), the Brazilian variant (20J/501Y.V3), and the South African variant (20H/501Y.V2).

342935,COVID-19 Reflections on Inpatient Rehabilitation,2020,"Abstract While some argue that market forces are imperative to stimulate the increased supply of critical products and services to address the COVID-19 crisis, others contend that dealing with the pandemic requires coordination and rapid adjustments in supply that may be constrained by a host of factors. Although discussions have centered on policies to promote financial liquidity, we examine whether the state apparatus-not only state-owned enterprises but also development agencies and investment funds-can innovate and adjust production processes to improve infrastructure and capabilities to prevent and treat the disease. Potential actions include public-private effort addressing both discovery and coordination problems-such as a collaborative effort to develop prevention and treatment technologies, as well as state capital to stimulate retooling and expansion of strategic infrastructure. The state apparatus can also help access remote and critical areas with relatively lower private returns. In contrast, support to industries must be implemented with caution, especially for sectors whose demand may suffer permanently due to lifestyle changes. Exit strategies must be carefully crafted to avoid the risk of perpetuating unjustified and ineffective state support, establishing milestones and termination clauses based on clear performance indicators. We argue that, although using the state apparatus as a countermeasure entails a set of risks, not using it may increase the risk of extending the crisis and end with an overloaded state sector (e.g., due to massive bailouts), challenging the implementation of subsequent adjustments.","Lazzarini, Sérgio Giovanetti; Musacchio, Aldo",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,469

Academic administration and pandemic policy,2021,"More effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat influenza viruses are urgently required worldwide because the conventional anti-influenza drugs are facing drug resistance. Here, dihydropyrrolidones (DHPs), the products of an efficient multi-components reaction, were found to possess good activities against influenza A virus (IAV). Primary structure-activity relationship indicated that the activities of DHPs were greatly influenced by substituents and four of them had IC50 values lower than 10 µM (DHPs 5-2, 8, 14 and 19: IC50 = 3.11-9.23 µM). The activities against multiple IAV strains and mechanism of DHPs were further investigated by using 5-2 (IC50 = 3.11 µM). It was found that 5-2 possessed antiviral effects against all the investigated subtypes of IAVs with the IC50 values from 3.11 to 7.13 µM. Moreover, 5-2 showed very low cytotoxicity with CC50 > 400 µM. Results of mechanism study indicated that 5-2 could efficiently inhibit replication of IAV, up-regulate the expression of key antiviral cytokines IFN-ß and antiviral protein MxA, and suppress the production of the NDAPH oxidase NOX1 in MDCK cells. These results indicated that 5-2 could be used as a potential inhibitor against wide subtypes of IAVs.","Liu, Teng; Dai, Chenshu; Sang, Huiting; Chen, Fangzhao; Huang, Yingna; Liao, Hui; Liu, Shuwen; Zhu, Qiuhua; Yang, Jie",Eur J Med Chem,,469

The VTE risk appears highest in those with critical care admission. The need for postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remains controversial, which is reflected in conflicting expert guideline recommendations. Our local protocol provides thromboprophylaxis to COVID-19 patients during admission only. We report postdischarge VTE data from an ongoing quality improvement program incorporating root-cause analysis of hospital-associated VTE (HA-VTE). Following 1877 hospital discharges associated with COVID-19, 9 episodes of HA-VTE were diagnosed within 42 days, giving a postdischarge rate of 4.8 per 1000 discharges. Over 2019, following 18 159 discharges associated with a medical admission; there were 56 episodes of HA-VTE within 42 days (3.1 per 1000 discharges). The odds ratio for postdischarge HA-VTE associated with COVID-19 compared with 2019 was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-3.1). COVID-19 hospitalization does not appear to increase the risk of postdischarge HA-VTE compared with hospitalization with other acute medical illness. Given that the risk-benefit ratio of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remains uncertain, randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role of continuing thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients following hospital discharge are required.","Roberts, Lara N; Whyte, Martin B; Georgiou, Loizos; Giron, Gerard; Czuprynska, Julia; Rea, Catherine; Vadher, Bipin; Patel, Raj K; Gee, Emma; Arya, Roopen",Blood,,469

This information may influence smoking cessation related beliefs in smokers. METHODS: Online questionnaires were answered from 26 March to 3 April 2020 in the Netherlands by 340 smokers willing to quit smoking. Beliefs regarding (quitting) smoking and (consequences of) the coronavirus are described and associations with motivation to quit due to the coronavirus are reported. RESULTS: While 67.7% of the smokers indicated that the coronavirus did not influence the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 18.5% smoked less cigarettes and 13.8% smoked more cigarettes per day due to the coronavirus. One-third of the smokers were more motivated to quit smoking due to the coronavirus. Motivation to quit due to the coronavirus was positively associated with beliefs about the coronavirus as a serious threat, being at high risk of catching the coronavirus and developing severe illness, smokers being at higher risk than non-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce complaints, the social environment endorsing quitting, and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of smokers may be receptive to smoking cessation advice due to COVID-19. Because of the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus (e.g. stay at home as much as possible), personalized digital health interventions may be particularly suitable to reach smokers at home.","Elling, Jan M; Crutzen, Rik; Talhout, Reinskje; de Vries, Hein",Tob Prev Cessat,,469

356390,"Asthma and risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality from COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Although several COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be effective in rigorous evaluation and have emerging availability in parts of the world, their supply will be inadequate to meet international needs for a considerable period of time. There also will be continued interest in vaccines that are more effective or have improved scalability to facilitate mass vaccination campaigns. Ongoing clinical testing of new vaccines also will be needed as variant strains continue to emerge that may elude some aspects of immunity induced by current vaccines. Randomized clinical trials meaningfully enhance the efficiency and reliability of such clinical testing. In clinical settings with limited or no access to known effective vaccines, placebo-controlled randomized trials of new vaccines remain a preferred approach to maximize the reliability, efficiency and interpretability of results. When emerging availability of licensed vaccines makes it no longer possible to use a placebo control, randomized active comparator non-inferiority trials may enable reliable insights. METHODS: In this article, ""hybrid"" methods are proposed to address settings where, during the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial, a judgment is made to replace the placebo arm by a licensed COVID-19 vaccine due to emerging availability of effective vaccines in regions participating in that trial. These hybrid methods are based on proposed statistics that aggregate evidence to formally test as well as to estimate the efficacy of the experimental vaccine, by combining placebo-controlled data during the first period of trial conduct with active-controlled data during the second period. RESULTS: Application of the proposed methods is illustrated in two important scenarios where the active control vaccine would become available in regions engaging in the experimental vaccine's placebo-controlled trial: in the first, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 50%-70% for the 4- to 6-month duration of follow-up of its placebo-controlled trial; in the second, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 90%-95% during that duration. These two scenarios approximate what has been seen with adenovirus vaccines or mRNA vaccines, respectively, assuming the early estimates of vaccine efficacy for those vaccines would hold over longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The proposed hybrid methods could readily play an important role in the near future in the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials performed to address the need for multiple additional vaccines reliably established to be safe and have worthwhile efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic disease from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Fleming, Thomas R; Nason, Martha; Krause, Philip R; Longini, Ira M; Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria",Clin Trials,,469

Forecasting the number of cases infected with this virus can help authorities make accurate decisions on the interventions that must be implemented to control the pandemic. Investigation of the studies on COVID-19 forecasting indicates that various techniques such as statistical, mathematical, and machine and deep learning have been utilized. Although deep learning models have shown promising results in this context, their performance can be improved using auxiliary features. Therefore, in this study, we propose two hybrid deep learning methods that utilize the statistical features as auxiliary inputs and associate them with their main input. Specifically, we design a hybrid method of the multihead attention mechanism and the statistical features (ATT_FE) and a combined method of convolutional neural network and the statistical features (CNN_FE) and apply them to COVID-19 data of 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases. The results of experiments indicate that the hybrid models outperform their conventional counterparts in terms of performance measures. The experiments also demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid ATT_FE method over the long short-term memory model.","Abbasimehr, Hossein; Paki, Reza; Bahrini, Aram",,,469

Materials and Methods: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiographies (CTPAs) from 43 consecutive patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively reviewed, taking into consideration the revised Geneva score and the D-dimer value for each patient. Filling defects within the pulmonary arteries were recorded along with pleural and parenchymal findings such as ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving, linear consolidation, and pleural effusion. All these variables were compared between patients with and without PAFD. The predictive performance of statistically different parameters was investigated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results: Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 15/43 patients (35%), whereas CTPA and parenchymal changes related to pulmonary COVID-19 disease were evident in 39/43 patients (91%). The revised Geneva score and the mean D-dimer value obtained using two consecutive measurements were significantly higher in patients with PAFD. The ROC analysis demonstrated that a mean D-dimer value is the parameter with the higher predictivity (AUC 0.831) that is a cut-off value > 1800 µg/l which predicts the probability of PAFD with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 78%, respectively. Conclusions: This single centre retrospective report shows a high prevalence of pulmonary artery filling defects revealed using CTPA in COVID-19 patients and demonstrates that the mean value of multiple D-dimer measurements may represent a predicting factor of this complication.","Scardapane, Arnaldo; Villani, Laura; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Passerini, Francesca; Ianora, Amato Antonio Stabile; Lucarelli, Nicola Maria; Angarano, Gioacchino; Portincasa, Piero; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Saracino, Annalisa",Biomed Res Int,,469

Food Navigators followed a program Playbook, though unlike many similar programs, the program did not offer incentives to subsidize FM purchases. To inform program design and understand outcomes, data were collected from Food Navigators, shoppers, FM managers, and FM vendors. Food Navigators supported five to seven FMs each season (May through October), spending 590 days in FMs over three seasons. Due to their interaction with Food Navigators, shoppers in Season 3 (n = 689) indicated that they would: shop more at the FM (80%); eat more vegetables (52%); and purchase more vegetables (50%). Of shoppers who interacted with Food Navigators more than once (n = 55), 26% reported a higher frequency of vegetable consumption on their last survey compared with their first. In Season 3, at least half of FM managers (n = 4, 50%) and vendors (n = 68, 57%) agreed that food navigators helped increase overall market fruit and vegetables sales. Findings indicated the program did influence multiple levels of a social ecological framework as intended. FM nutrition programs can have success at increasing market sales and improving health-related behaviors without offering incentives. As a result, programs could operate with smaller budgets and be more likely to have increased shopper fruit and vegetable consumption sustainably beyond the direct subsidy of purchases.","Scott, Marci K; Gutuskey, Lila; Zwemer, Teresa; Gallington, Kyli",Health Promot Pract,,469

Understanding community expectations of paramedics will provide some clarity around this issue. The objective of this research was to explore the expectations of a sample of Australian community members regarding the professional obligation of paramedics to respond during pandemics. METHODS: The authors used qualitative methods to gather Australian community member perspectives immediately before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Focus groups were used for data collection, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The findings revealed 9 key themes: context of obligation (normal operations versus crisis situation), hierarchy of obligation (individual versus organizational obligation), risk acceptability, acceptable occupational risk (it's part of the job), access to personal protective equipment, legal and ethical guidelines, education and training, safety, and acceptable limitations to obligation. The factors identified as being acceptable limitations to professional obligation are presented as further sub-themes: physical health, mental health, and competing personal obligations. CONCLUSIONS: The issue of professional obligation must be addressed by ambulance services as a matter of urgency, especially in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

To mitigate the pandemic, China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O3, leading to high concentrations of O3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to lockdown measures.

367173,"Doctoral research amidst the Covid-19 pandemic: Researcher reflections on practice, relationships, and unexpected intimacy",2021,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency compromises muscle function and is related to the etiology of several clinical conditions that can contribute to the development of disability. However, there are few epidemiological studies investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and the incidence of disability. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the incidence of disability in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and to verify whether there are sex differences in this association. METHODS: A 4-y follow-up study was conducted involving individuals aged 50 y or older who participated in ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). The sample consisted of 4814 participants free of disability at baseline according to the modified Katz Index. Vitamin D was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and the participants were classified as sufficient (>50 nmol/L), insufficient (>30 to &#8804;50 nmol/L), or deficient (&#8804;30 nmol/L). Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were also investigated. BADL were re-evaluated after 2 and 4 y of follow-up. The report of any difficulty to perform &#8805;1 BADL was considered as an incident case of disability. Poisson models stratified by sex and controlled for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were carried out. RESULTS: After 4-y follow-up, deficient serum 25(OH)D was a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in both women (IRR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.03) and men (IRR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.02). However, insufficient serum 25(OH)D was not a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS: Independently of sex, deficient serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with increased risk of incidence of BADL disability in adults >50 y old and should be an additional target of clinical strategies to prevent disability in these populations.","Luiz, Mariane M; Máximo, Roberta; Oliveira, Dayane C; Ramírez, Paula C; de Souza, Aline F; Delinocente, Maicon L B; Steptoe, Andrew; de Oliveira, Cesar; Alexandre, Tiago",J. nutr,,469

This paper presents our vision, technology setup, and an initial investigation of the efficacy of the various acoustic and visual speech metrics automatically extracted by the platform. 82 healthy controls and 54 people with ALS (pALS) were instructed to interact with the platform and completed a battery of speaking tasks designed to probe the acoustic, articulatory, phonatory, and respiratory aspects of their speech. We find that multiple acoustic (rate, duration, voicing) and visual (higher order statistics of the jaw and lip) speech metrics show statistically significant differences between controls, bulbar symptomatic and bulbar pre-symptomatic patients. We report on the sensitivity and specificity of these metrics using five-fold cross-validation. We further conducted a LASSO-LARS regression analysis to uncover the relative contributions of various acoustic and visual features in predicting the severity of patients' ALS (as measured by their self-reported ALSFRS-R scores).

METHODS: This is a 24-week nationwide prospective multi-centre cohort with a control group without RD and not using HCQ. All participants were monitored through scheduled phone interviews performed by health professionals. Details regarding COVID-19 symptoms, and epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data were recorded on a specific web-based platform. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health criteria and classified as mild, moderate or severe. RESULTS: A total of 9,585 participants, 5,164 (53.9%) RD patients on HCQ and 4,421 (46.1%) HC were enrolled from March 29th, 2020 to September 30th, 2020, according to the eligibility criteria. COVID-19 confirmed cases were higher in RD patients than in cohabitants [728 (14.1%) vs. 427 (9.7%), p&lt;0.001] in a 24-week follow-up. However, there was no significant difference regarding outcomes related to moderate/ severe COVID-19 (7.1% and 7.3%, respectively, p=0.896). After multiple adjustments, risk factors associated with hospitalisation were age over 65 (HR=4.5;95%CI 1.35-15.04, p=0.014) and cardiopathy (HR=2.57;95%CI 1.12-5.91, p=0.026). The final survival analysis demonstrated the probability of dying in 180 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis was significantly higher in patients over 65 years (HR=20.8;95%CI 4.5-96.1) and with 2 or more comorbidities (HR=10.8;95%CI 1.1-107.9 and HR=24.8;95%CI 2.5-249.3, p=0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although RD patients have had a higher COVID-19 incidence than individuals from the same epidemiological background, the COVID-19 severity was related to traditional risk factors, particularly multiple comorbidities and age, and not to underlying RD and HCQ.","Pinheiro, M.

METHODS: In the discovery cohort, the gene expression level of 84 lncRNAs were measured in the blood of 24 adult patients including healthy controls and patients with asthma and COPD. In the replication cohort the expression of 6 selected lncRNAs were measured in 163 subjects including healthy controls and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD and children with asthma. It was evaluated whether these lncRNAs can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for any studied disease. With systems biology analysis the biological functions of the selected lncRNAs were predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the mean expression of 27 lncRNAs showed nominally significant differences in at least one comparison. OIP5-AS1, HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX, RP11-282O18.3, MZF1-AS1 were selected for measurement in the replication cohort. Three lncRNAs (HNRNPU, RP11-325K4.3, JPX) expressed significantly higher in healthy children than in adult controls. All the mean expression level of the 6 lncRNAs differed significantly between adult allergic rhinitis patients and controls. RP11-325K4.3, HNRNPU and OIP5-AS1 expressed higher in allergic asthma than in non-allergic asthma. COPD and asthma differed in the expression of RP11-325K4.3 from each other. In examining of the lncRNAs as biomarkers the weighted accuracy (WA) values were especially high in the comparison of healthy controls and patients with allergic rhinitis. OIP5-AS1 and JPX achieved 0.98 and 0.9 WA values, respectively, and the combination of the selected lncRNAs also resulted in a high performance (WA = 0.98). Altogether, OIP5-AS1 had the highest discriminative power in case of three out of six comparisons. CONCLUSION: Differences were detected in the expression of circulating lncRNAs in chronic respiratory diseases. Some of these differences might be utilized as biomarkers and also suggest a possible role of these lncRNAs in the pathomechanism of these diseases. The lncRNAs and the associated pathways are potential therapeutic targets in these diseases, but naturally additional studies are needed for the confirmation of these results.","Gál, Zsófia; Gézsi, András; Semsei, Ágnes F; Nagy, Adrienne; Sultész, Monika; Csoma, Zsuzsanna; Tamási, Lilla; Gálffy, Gabriella; Szalai, Csaba",J Transl Med,,469

Treatment services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and counselling services. Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems.COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation.People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group. People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns. Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses. Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids. Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.","Dunlop, Adrian; Lokuge, Buddhima; Masters, Debbie; Sequeira, Marcia; Saul, Peter; Dunlop, Grace; Ryan, John; Hall, Michelle; Ezard, Nadine; Haber, Paul; Lintzeris, Nicholas; Maher, Lisa",Harm Reduct J,,469

In this study, we analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of injury to define the sources of tissue injury that contribute to such different trajectories.METHODSWe conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study to enroll patients with COVID-19 and collect plasma samples. Plasma cfDNA was subject to bisulfite sequencing. A library of tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures was used to analyze sequence reads to quantitate cfDNA from different tissue types. We then determined the correlation of tissue-specific cfDNA measures to COVID-19 outcomes. Similar analyses were performed for healthy controls and a comparator group of patients with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza.RESULTSWe found markedly elevated levels and divergent tissue sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 patients compared with patients who had influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus and with healthy controls. The major sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 were hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelium, hepatocytes, adipocytes, kidney, heart, and lung. cfDNA levels positively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. cfDNA profile at admission identified patients who subsequently required intensive care or died during hospitalization. Furthermore, the increased cfDNA in COVID-19 patients generated excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in renal tubular cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This mtROS production was inhibited by a TLR9-specific antagonist.CONCLUSIONcfDNA maps tissue injury that predicts COVID-19 outcomes and may mechanistically propagate COVID-19-induced tissue injury.FUNDINGIntramural Targeted Anti-COVID-19 grant, NIH.","Andargie, Temesgen E; Tsuji, Naoko; Seifuddin, Fayaz; Jang, Moon Kyoo; Yuen, Peter St; Kong, Hyesik; Tunc, Ilker; Singh, Komudi; Charya, Ananth; Wilkins, Kenneth; Nathan, Steven; Cox, Andrea; Pirooznia, Mehdi; Star, Robert A; Agbor-Enoh, Sean",JCI insight,,469

385472,Relationship between lifestyle and work stress in nursing staff in times of covid-19,2021,"Pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are classified into low-grade neuroendocrine tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). There are significant differences in therapeutic strategies of the different NEN subtypes, and therefore, precise classification of pulmonary NENs is critical. However, challenges in pulmonary NEN classification include overlap of diagnostic histological features among the subtypes and reduced or negative expression of neuroendocrine markers in poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Recently, transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was identified as a sensitive marker of neuroendocrine and neuroepithelial differentiation. In this study, INSM1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in greater than 94% of pulmonary NENs, indicating that it is a highly sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs and is useful to detect poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Although there are well-established morphological and immunohistologic criteria to diagnose pulmonary NENs, there is no universal consensus regarding prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs. Studies have shown that non-small cell lung cancers express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and carcinogenesis. We characterized expression and function of lncRNAs, including HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in pulmonary NENs, including typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC/NEC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC/NEC). In situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies showed higher expression (p < 0.01) of all lncRNAs in SCLC/NEC. Small interfering RNA studies indicated a role for MEG3 and PCA3 in tumor proliferation. Therefore, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness and as possible therapeutic targets.","Narayanan, Damodaran; Mandal, Rakesh; Hardin, Heather; Chanana, Vishal; Schwalbe, Michael; Rosenbaum, Jason; Buehler, Darya; Lloyd, Ricardo V",Endocr. pathol,,469

It is unclear whether and to what extent patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases are willing and in a position to deal with the new media, such as video consultation. METHODS: In the middle of the pandemic in May 2020 outpatients were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire in order to document their possibilities and willingness to participate in a video consultation. The treating physicians were asked whether carrying out a video consultation was considered to be a possible and meaningful option. RESULTS: Overall, 232 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases were surveyed (64.7% female, average age 54.0â¯± 15.2 years), seropositive (nâ¯= 58) and seronegative (nâ¯= 51) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA, nâ¯= 77) including axial SpA (axSpA) and psoriatic arthropathy (PsA) as well as collagenosis and vasculitis (CoV, nâ¯= 46). The mean duration of disease was 5.5â¯± 8.2 years, whereby in 75 patients (32.3%) it was the first diagnosis. The mean disease activity (0-10, subjective patient self-estimation) was 4.7â¯± 2.5. Overall, 176 patients were basically aware of the possibility to carry out video consultations (75.9%) and 166 considered that they were technically capable to participate (71.6%) but only 131 were principally willing to participate (56.5%). Logistic regression analyses showed that the willingness to participate in video consultations decreased with increasing age (ßâ¯= 0.28, pâ¯= 0.01). According to the medical estimation video consultations were thought to be principally possible for 161 patients for technical reasons (69.4%) and for 127 for medical reasons (54.7%); however, a video consultation within the framework of treatment was only considered to be meaningful by the physician for 76 patients (32.8%). CONCLUSION: Not all patients can or want to participate in video consultations and the willingness declines with increasing age. The estimation of the meaningfulness of video consultations by physicians was also limited to approximately one third of the patients surveyed. This must be taken into consideration for the future planning of video consultations.","Baraliakos, X; Alshakaki, F; Bühring, B; Andreica, I; Kiltz, U; Braun, J",Z. rheumatol,,469

Clinical improvement was noted mostly in young patients <5 years (p = .001), asthmatic patients (p = .033), and patients with multiple underlying respiratory disorders (p = .015). Patients whose condition significantly worsened were more likely to be >5 years (p < .001), had increased screen time, decreased physical activity, and shorter sleep duration compared to their younger counterparts (p = .008, <.001, and .001, respectively). Caregivers' reports (n = 236 [58%]) of their own anxiety levels and perceptions of the patients' elevated health risk were increased, regardless of the children's actual clinical status. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown was associated with clinical improvement/stability for most of the surveyed children; however, their caregivers' anxiety level was heightened. An increased sedentary lifestyle was reported mostly in older children.","Cahal, Michal; Amirav, Israel; Diamant, Nir; Be039,; er, Moria; Besor, Omri; Lavie, Moran",Pediatr Pulmonol,,469

390290,Basic human values & compliance with government-recommended prosocial health behavior,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To study the implementation of a cluster randomised controlled effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial testing the effectiveness of a medication review at hospital discharge combined with a communication stimulus between hospital physicians (HPs) and general practitioners (GPs) on rehospitalisation of multimorbid older patients. DESIGN: Extension of Grant's mixed method process evaluation framework to trials with multilevel clustering. SETTING: General internal medicine wards in Swiss hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience samples of 15 chief physicians (of 21 hospitals participating in the effectiveness trial), 60 (74) senior HPs, 65 (164) junior HPs and 187 (411) GPs. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY: Two-hour teaching sessions for senior HPs on a patient-centred, checklist-guided discharge routine. PROCESS EVALUATION COMPONENTS: Data collection on recruitment, delivery and response from chief physicians (semistructured interviews), senior HPs, junior HPs, GPs (surveys) and patients (via HPs). Quantitative data were summarised using descriptive statistics, and interviews analysed using thematic analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intervention dose (quantitative), implementation fidelity (qualitative), feasibility and acceptability, facilitators and barriers, implementation support strategies. RESULTS: Recruitment of hospitals was laborious but successful, with 21 hospitals recruited. Minimal workload and a perceived benefit for the clinic were crucial factors for participation. Intervention dose was high (95% of checklist activities carried out), but intervention fidelity was limited (discharge letters) or unknown (medication review). Recruitment and retention of patients was challenging, partly due to patient characteristics (old, frail) and the COVID-19 pandemic: Only 612 of the anticipated 2100 patients were recruited, and 31% were lost to follow-up within the first month after discharge. The intervention was deemed feasible and helpful by HPs, and the relevance of the topic appreciated by both HPs and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this evaluation will support interpretation of the findings of the effectiveness study and may inform researchers and policy makers who aim at improving hospital discharge.

393307,Psychosocial Intervention During COVID-19 in a Hospital Mortuary: A Social Worker's Reflection,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an inactivated and aluminium hydroxide adsorbed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Sinovac, China) in voluntary participants after 14 days of the second dose against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases. The secondary objectives include evaluating the efficacy after at least one dose of the vaccine against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases; the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine on the rates of hospitalization and death; the safety of the vaccine including adverse reactions up to one year after the 2nd dose of vaccination; and the immunogenicity of the vaccine and its duration up to 120 days. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled case driven clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. The study is planned to be carried out within two separate cohorts in voluntary participants aged between 18-59 years old. The first cohort includes healthcare professionals actively working in healthcare units, who are assumed to have higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the second cohort includes other immunocompetent subjects in the same age group, who are at a regular risk for COVID-19 disease. In Cohort 1, healthcare professionals will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of investigational product or the placebo in a 1:1 ratio and they will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19. In Cohort 2, immunocompetent subjects will be randomized to receive vaccine or the placebo in a 2:1 ratio. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals of both genders, including medical doctors, nurses, cleaners, hospital technicians, and administrative personnel who work in any department of a healthcare unit and immunocompetent individuals of both genders are included. Pregnant (confirmed by positive beta-hCG test) and breastfeeding women as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months. Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection). Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research & Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade &#8805;3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions. RANDOMISATION: Eligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups. The IWRS system customizes the randomization algorithm. After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts. The remaining 11640 subjects will be screened in the Cohort 2 and eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 6.0 - 15 October 2020. Recruitment started on 15.09.2020 and is expected to end on February 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04582344 .

394046,O papel da atenção primária no combate ao Covid-19: impacto na saúde pública e perspectivas futuras,2020,"Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally, Australia has applied a number of public health measures to counter the disease' epidemiology. The public heath response has been effective in virus testing, diagnosing and treating patients with COVID-19. The imposed strict border restrictions and social distancing played a vital role in reducing positive cases via community transmission resulting in 'flattening of the curve'. Now is too soon to assess the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health, as it will be determined by both short- and long-term consequences of exposure to stress, uncertainty, loss of control, loneliness and isolation. The authors explored cultural and societal influences on mental health during the current pandemic utilising Geert Hofstede's multidimensional construct of culture and determined psychological and cultural factors that foster resilience. We also reflected on the psychological impact of the pandemic on the individual and the group at large by utilising Michel Foucault' and Jacques Lacan' psychoanalytic theories. Remote Aboriginal Australian communities have been identified as a high-risk subpopulation in view of their unique vulnerabilities owing to their compromised health status, in addition to historical, systemic and cultural factors. Historically, Australia has prided itself in its multiculturalism; however, there has been evidence of an increase in racial microaggressions and xenophobia during this pandemic. Australia's model of cultural awareness will need to evolve, from reactionary to more reflective, post COVID-19 pandemic to best serve our multicultural, inclusive and integrated society.","Furlong, Y; Finnie, T",Ir J Psychol Med,,469

The requirement for enhanced automation across various industry segments often entails mobile robotic systems operating in logistics facilities with little/no infrastructure. In such environments, out-of-box low-cost robotic solutions are desirable. Wireless connectivity plays a crucial role in successful operation of such mobile robotic systems. A wireless mesh network of mobile robots is an attractive solution; however, a number of system-level challenges create unique and stringent service requirements. The focus of this paper is the role of Bluetooth mesh technology, which is the latest addition to the Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity landscape, in addressing the challenges of infrastructure-less connectivity for mobile robotic systems. It articulates the key system-level design challenges from communication, control, cooperation, coverage, security, and navigation/localization perspectives, and explores different capabilities of Bluetooth mesh technology for such challenges. It also provides performance insights through real-world experimental evaluation of Bluetooth mesh while investigating its differentiating features against competing solutions.","Aijaz, Adnan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05563v1.pdf,469
397352,Cognitive overload during the COVID-19 pandemic: A student's response to Sewell et al,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evades most innate immune responses but may still be vulnerable to some. Here, we systematically analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract anti-viral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification. Most activities are evolutionarily conserved. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 antagonizes IFN signaling less efficiently than the orthologs of closely related RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 proteins counteract autophagy and type I IFN more efficiently than type II or III IFN signaling, and infection experiments confirm potent inhibition by IFN-Î³ and -&#955;1. Our results define the repertoire and selected mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonists but also reveal vulnerability to type II and III IFN that may help to develop safe and effective anti-viral approaches.","Hayn, Manuel; Hirschenberger, Maximilian; Koepke, Lennart; Nchioua, Rayhane; Straub, Jan Hendrik; Klute, Susanne; Hunszinger, Victoria; Zech, Fabian; Prelli Bozzo, Caterina; Aftab, Wasim; Christensen, Maria Hønholt; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis Alexander; Srinivasachar Badarinarayan, Smitha; Stürzel, Christina Martina; Forne, Ignasi; Stenger, Steffen; Conzelmann, Karl-Klaus; Münch, Jan; Schmidt, Florian Ingo; Sauter, Daniel; Imhof, Axel; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin Maria Johannes",Cell Rep,,469
399491,The tyranny of distance: The social effects and practice adaptations resulting from Covid-19 lockdown rules,2020,"Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are diseases of global health significance caused by arboviruses and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is of worldwide circulation. The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cúcuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cúcuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable local knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.","Morgan, Jasmine; Strode, Clare; Salcedo-Sora, J Enrique",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,469

As the pandemic evolves rapidly, there are data emerging to suggest that pregnant women diagnosed as having coronavirus disease 2019 can have severe morbidities (up to 9%). This is in contrast to earlier data that showed good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 include features of acute respiratory illnesses. Typical radiologic findings consists of patchy infiltrates on chest radiograph and ground glass opacities on computed tomography scan of the chest. Patients who are pregnant may present with atypical features such as the absence of fever as well as leukocytosis. Confirmation of coronavirus disease 2019 is by reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction from upper airway swabs. When the reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction test result is negative in suspect cases, chest imaging should be considered. A pregnant woman with coronavirus disease 2019 is at the greatest risk when she is in labor, especially if she is acutely ill. We present an algorithm of care for the acutely ill parturient and guidelines for the protection of the healthcare team who is caring for the patient. Key decisions are made based on the presence of maternal and/or fetal compromise, adequacy of maternal oxygenation (SpO2 >93%) and stability of maternal blood pressure. Although vertical transmission is unlikely, there must be measures in place to prevent neonatal infections. Routine birth processes such as delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin bonding between mother and newborn need to be revised. Considerations can be made to allow the use of screened donated breast milk from mothers who are free of coronavirus disease 2019. We present management strategies derived from best available evidence to provide guidance in caring for the high-risk and acutely ill parturient. These include protection of the healthcare workers caring for the coronavirus disease 2019 gravida, establishing a diagnosis in symptomatic cases, deciding between reverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction and chest imaging, and management of the unwell parturient.","Ashokka, Balakrishnan; Loh, May-Han; Tan, Cher Heng; Su, Lin Lin; Young, Barnaby Edward; Lye, David Chien; Biswas, Arijit; Illanes, Sebastian E; Choolani, Mahesh",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,469

401551,Responding to the needs of beedi workers after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) of this ß-CoV contains essential cis-acting RNA elements for the viral genome transcription and replication. These elements include an equilibrium between an extended bulged stem-loop (BSL) and a pseudoknot. The existence of such an equilibrium is supported by reverse genetic studies and phylogenetic covariation analysis and is further proposed as a molecular switch essential for the control of the viral RNA polymerase binding. Here, we report the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR structures in cells that transcribe the viral UTRs harbored in a minigene plasmid and isolated infectious virions using a chemical probing technique, namely dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-mutational profiling with sequencing (MaPseq). Interestingly, the putative pseudoknotted conformation was not observed, indicating that its abundance in our systems is low in the absence of the viral nonstructural proteins (nsps). Similarly, our results also suggest that another functional cis-acting element, the three-helix junction, cannot stably form. The overall architectures of the viral 3' UTRs in the infectious virions and the minigene-transfected cells are almost identical.","Zhao, Junxing; Qiu, Jianming; Aryal, Sadikshya; Hackett, Jennifer L; Wang, Jingxin",Viruses,,469

Motivated by the recent experimental success in realizing chiral optical ladders, here we present a scheme for synthesizing topological quantum matter, especially the quantum spin Hall phase, in the chiral optical ladders. More precisely, we first establish the synthetic pseudo-spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting in the chiral ladders. After analyzing the band structure of the ladders exposed to the bichromatic optical potentials, we report the existence of quantum spin Hall phase. We further identify a rich phase diagram of the bichromatic chiral ladders, illustrating that our proposal features a large space of system parameters exhibiting quantum phase transitions. Our scheme is within reach of the existing ladder optical lattices and hence provides a new method to engineer the elaborate topological bands for cold atomic gases.","Yu, Hang; Guo Guan, En; Wang, Gang; Hua Jiang, Jian; Hu, Jun; Hui Wu, Jin; Kuang Lee, Ray",Opt Express,,469
404179,The use of cyberspace by the public administration in the COVID-19 pandemic: diagnosis and vulnerabilities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Histology and Embryology and Pathology are two important basic medical morphology courses for studying human histological structures under healthy and pathological conditions, respectively. There is a natural succession between the two courses. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly swept the world. During this unusual period, to ensure that medical students would understand and master basic medical knowledge and to lay a solid foundation for future medical bridge courses and professional courses, a web-based medical morphology teaching team, mainly including teachers of courses in Histology and Embryology and Pathology, was established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore a new teaching mode of Histology and Embryology and Pathology courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate its feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: From March to July 2020, our team selected clinical medicine undergraduate students who started their studies in 2018 and 2019 as recipients of web-based teaching. Meanwhile, nursing undergraduate students who started their studies in 2019 and 2020 were selected for traditional offline teaching as the control group. For the web-based teaching, our team used the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to realize a new ""seven-in-one"" teaching method (ie, videos, materials, chapter tests, interactions, homework, live broadcasts, and case analysis/discussion). This new teaching mode involved diverse web-based teaching methods and contents, including flipped classroom, screen-to-screen experimental teaching, a drawing competition, and a writing activity on the theme of ""What I Know About COVID-19."" When the teaching was about to end, a questionnaire was administered to obtain feedback regarding the teaching performance. In the meantime, the final written pathology examination results of the web-based teaching and traditional offline teaching groups were compared to examine the mastery of knowledge of the students. RESULTS: Using the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to conduct ""seven-in-one"" teaching is feasible and acceptable. With regard to the teaching performance of this new web-based teaching mode, students demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, and the questionnaire showed that 71.3% or more of the students in different groups reported a greater degree of satisfaction or being very satisfied. In fact, more students achieved high scores (90-100) in the web-based learning group than in the offline learning control group (P=.02). Especially, the number of students with objective scores >60 in the web-based learning group was greater than that in the offline learning control group (P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the web-based teaching mode was not inferior to the traditional offline teaching mode for medical morphology courses, proving the feasibility and acceptability of web-based teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings lay a solid theoretical foundation for follow-up studies of medical students.","Liu, Qinlai; Sun, Wenping; Du, Changqing; Yang, Leiying; Yuan, Na; Cui, Haiqing; Song, Wengang; Ge, Li",JMIR Med Inform,,469

405279,How Should We Respond to Racist Legacies in Health Professions Education Originating in the Flexner Report?,2021,"Summary: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on waits for elective operations, with tens of thousands of scheduled surgeries being cancelled or postponed across Canada. Provincial governments will likely not only reopen elective surgical capacity when it is deemed safe, but also target new funding to address the backlog of cases. There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces' approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients' needs perspective or if they are associated with patients' perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won't be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals' marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed. Surgeon input, collaboration and leadership during the strategy development, implementation and management of surgical wait lists postpandemic will be imperative, as these decisions will significantly affect the health and lives of many Canadians.","Wiseman, Sam M; Crump, R Trafford; Sutherland, Jason M",Can J Surg,,469

406343,Gastroenterological considerations in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The initial response to COVID-19 in the UK involved a rapid contraction of face-to-face sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and widespread use of remote workarounds. This study sought to illuminate young people's experiences of accessing and using condoms and contraception in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data, including open-text responses, from an online survey conducted in June-July 2020 with a convenience sample of 2005 16-24-year-olds living in Scotland. RESULTS: Among those who used condoms and contraception, one quarter reported that COVID-19 mitigation measures had made a difference to their access or use. Open-text responses revealed a landscape of disrupted prevention, including changes to sexual risk-taking and preventive practices, unwanted contraceptive pathways, unmet need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and switches from freely provided to commercially sold condoms and contraception. Pandemic-related barriers to accessing free condoms and contraception included: (1) uncertainty about the legitimacy of accessing SRH care and self-censorship of need; (2) confusion about differences between SRH care and advice received from healthcare professionals during the pandemic compared with routine practice; and (3) exacerbation of existing access barriers, alongside reduced social support and resources to navigate SRH care. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging barriers to STI and pregnancy prevention within the context of COVID-19 have the potential to undermine positive SRH practices, and widen inequalities, among young people. As SRH services are restored amid evolving pandemic restrictions, messaging to support navigation of condom and contraception services should be co-created with young people.","Lewis, Ruth; Blake, Carolyn; Shimonovich, Michal; Coia, Nicky; Duffy, Johann; Kerr, Yvonne; Wilson, Jill; Graham, Cynthia Ann; Mitchell, Kirstin R",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,469

408237,Information about the COVID-19 pandemic – a thematic analysis of different ways of perceiving true and untrue information,2020,"The issue of the COVID-19 pandemic occupies the agenda of the whole world. The pivot of this pandemic is a crucial element that has become almost as important as the virus itself, namely the lockdown. Although, the rationale for lockdown is well-sustained by strong epidemiological arguments, exploring the 'other' unwanted consequences of the contemporary COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory for coagulating a robust agreed position against the numerous problems generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Starting from the rationale of the lockdown, in this paper we explored and exposed the other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic measures such as the use or abuse of human rights and freedom restrictions, economic issues, marginalized groups and eclipse of all other diseases. Our scientific attempt is to coagulate a stable position and integrate current opposing views by advancing the idea that rather than applying the uniform lockdown policy, one could recommend instead an improved model targeting more strict and more prolonged lockdowns to vulnerable risk/age groups while enabling less stringent measures for the lower-risk groups, minimizing both economic losses and deaths. Rigorous (and also governed by freedom) debating may be able to synchronize the opposed perspectives between those advocating an extreme lockdown (e.g., most of the epidemiologists and health experts), and those criticizing all restrictive measures (e.g., economists and human rights experts). Confronting the multiple facets of the public health mitigation measures is the only way to avoid contributing to history with yet another failure, as seen in other past epidemics.","Burlacu, Alexandru; Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Covic, Adrian; Raiu, Catalin; Mavrichi, Ionut; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Lillo-Crespo, Manuel",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,469

Thus far, the virus has killed over 2,782,112 people and infected over 126,842,694 in the world (state 27 March 2021), resulting in a pandemic for humans. Based on the present data, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans cannot be excluded. If mutations allowing breaking of the species barrier and enhancing transmissibility occurred, next changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, leading to easier spreading and greater pathogenicity, could happen. The environment and saliva might play an important role in virus transmission. Therefore, there is a need for strict regimes in terms of personal hygiene, including hand washing and surface disinfection. The presence of viral RNA is not an equivalent of active viral infection. The positive result of the RT-PCR method may represent either viral residues or infectious virus particles. RNA-based tests should not be used in patients after the decline of disease symptoms to confirm convalescence. It has been proposed to use the test based on viral, sub-genomic mRNA, or serological methods to find the immune response to infection. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still a little-known issue. In our review, we have prepared a meta-analysis of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child depending on the type of delivery. Our study indicated that the transmission of the virus from mother to child is rare, and the infection rate is not higher in the case of natural childbirth, breastfeeding, or contact with the mother. We hope that this review and meta-analysis will help to systemize knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on diagnostic implications and transmission routes, in particular, mother-to-child transmission.","Grudlewska-Buda, Katarzyna Wiktorczyk-Kapischke Natalia Wałecka-Zacharska Ewa Kwiecińska-Piróg Joanna Buszko Katarzyna Leis Kamil Juszczuk Klaudia Gospodarek-Komkowska Eugenia Skowron Krzysztof",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,469

Data on a daily number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of COVID-19-related deaths were gatheredfrom the official governmental website. Meteorological observations from 55 synoptic stations in Poland were used. Moreover, reports on the movement of people across different categories of places were collected. A cross-correlation function, principal component analysis and random forest were applied. Maximum temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity and variability of mean daily temperature affected the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase intemperature and sunshine hours decreased the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The occurrence of high humidity caused an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases 14 days later. Decreased sunshine duration and increased air humidity had a negative impact on the number of COVID-19-related deaths.

An example and a practical view,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a prognostic model to identify and quantify risk factors for mortality among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores and calibration plots in the test set. SETTING: Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset including over 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 17 086 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between 20 February 2020 and 5 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality while hospitalised. RESULTS: The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index=0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index=0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index=0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.3% for patients aged 18 years old, 8.9% for 55 years old and 28.7% for 85 years old. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 22.4% by March to 14.0% by May. CONCLUSION: Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality, although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information, with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The full model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.","Incerti, Devin; Rizzo, Shemra; Li, Xiao; Lindsay, Lisa; Yau, Vincent; Keebler, Dan; Chia, Jenny; Tsai, Larry",BMJ Open,,469

As the initial shock and confusion dissipated and the reality and routines of staying at home sank in, I began to see the connections between the COVID-19 crisis and the climate change challenge(3) that motivates many of us working on renewable energy research (Figure 1) No, I am not talking about the noticeable reduction of air pollution and carbon dioxide emission due to the shut downs,(4) which indeed has been observed and will contribute to the mitigation of climate change (though maybe temporarily) Instead, what I mean is that there are actually many parallels between the challenges in fighting this global pandemic and fighting the climate change in the longer term This clear and present COVID-19 crisis should serve as a wake-up call for us to act now and work even harder to prevent a climate crisis","Jin, Song",ACS Energy Letters,,469

Structural and practical xenophobia has driven asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA to abject poverty and misery. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment measures adopted by the SA government through the lockdown of the nation have tremendously deepened the unequal treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees in SA. This can be seen through the South African government's lack of consideration of this marginalized population in economic, poverty, and hunger alleviation schemes. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may lead to negative coping strategies causing mental health issues and secondary health concerns. An effective response to the socioeconomic challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the economic and health impact of the pandemic on asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants.","Mukumbang, Ferdinand C; Ambe, Anthony N; Adebiyi, Babatope O",Int J Equity Health,,469

This paper reports the experiences of women in England. MethodsData were obtained from both closed- and open-ended responses collected as part of the national COVID in Context of Pregnancy, Infancy and Parenting (CoCoPIP) Study online survey (n = 477 families) between 15th July 2020 - 29th March 2021. Frequency data are presented alongside the results of a sentiment analysis; the open-ended data was analysed thematically. ResultsTwo-thirds of expectant women reported giving birth via spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) (66.1%) and a third via caesarean section (CS) (32.6%) or other (1.3%). Just under half (49.7%) of the CS were reported to have been elective/planned, with 47.7% being emergencies. A third (37.4%) of participants reported having no changes to their delivery, with a further 25% reporting COVID-related changes, and 37.4% reporting non-COVID related changes (e.g., medical intervention). Experiences of COVID-related changes included limited birthing options and reduced feelings of control; difficulties accessing pain-relief and assistance, and feelings of distress and anxiety. Under half of the respondents reported not knowing whether there could be someone present at the birth (44.8%), with 2.3% of respondents reporting no birthing partner being present due to COVID-related restrictions. Parental experiences of communication and advice provided by the hospital prior to delivery were mixed, with significant stress and anxiety being reported in relation to both the fluctuating guidance and lack of certainty regarding the presence of birthing partners at the birth. The sentiment analysis revealed that participant experiences of giving birth during the pandemic were predominately negative (46.9%) particularly in relation to the first national lockdown, with a smaller proportion of positive (33.2%) and neutral responses (19.9%). ConclusionParents reported an overall increase in birthing interventions (e.g., emergency CS), increased uncertainties related to the birth, and poor communication, leading to increased feelings of anxiety and high levels of negative emotions. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Aydin, Ezra; Glasgow, Kevin A; Weiss, Staci M; Khan, Zahra; Austin, Topun; Johnson, Mark H; Barlow, Jane; Lloyd-Fox, Sarah",,,469

We used publicly collected data on cases of COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. We described the patient characteristics. The Cox proportional-hazards model was applied to evaluate the association between factors (sex, onset month, age group, city of residence) and mortality, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. During the study period, 5.7% (1782/31,152) of individuals who underwent PCR testing for COVID-19 showed positive results. Among 244 patients with information on symptoms, the most common symptom was fever (76.6%), followed by cough (44.3%). Of the 1782 patients, 86 patients died. Compared with those aged 0–59 years, higher mortality was observed among those aged 60–69 years (HR: 12.02 [3.37–42.93]), 70–79 years (HR: 44.62 [15.16–131.30]), 80–89 years (HR: 68.38 [22.93–203.89]), and ≥90 years (HR: 144.71 [42.55–492.15]).

We use the actual observations of new cases and deaths. First, we deal with short term prediction, namely daily prediction. We propose the use of the golden steady state Kalman Filter, which is designed to have parameters related to the golden section. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter has a satisfactory behavior compared with the classical mean or average filter. Secondly, we deal with long term prediction, for example average prediction per quarantine period (14 days). We propose to process blocks of measurements of time window corresponding for example to the quarantine period in order to predict the average of cases and deaths using steady state Kalman Filter. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter produces more reliable predictions than the classical mean or average filter does. The use of steady state Kalman Filter for cases and deaths prediction of Covid-19 can be effective for resources and prevention measures planning.","Assimakis, N.; Adam, M.; Ktena, A.; Manasis, C.",Results in Physics,,469

Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals' health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages. The HII research program is aimed at relating vaccine responsiveness to biological and immune age, and identifying aging-related pathways crucial to enhance vaccine effectiveness in aging populations.","Goudsmit, Jaap; van den Biggelaar, Anita Huiberdina Johanna; Koudstaal, Wouter; Hofman, Albert; Koff, Wayne Chester; Schenkelberg, Theodore; Alter, Galit; Mina, Michael Joseph; Wu, Julia Wei",Eur. j. epidemiol,,469

METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization included by 62 Spanish emergency departments in the SIESTA cohort. We collected the demographic characteristics and comorbidities, determined both individually and estimated globally by the Charlson index (ChI). Independent factors related to ICU admission were identified and different analyses of sensitivity were performed to contrast the consistency of the findings of the principal analysis. RESULTS: We included the 338 patients from the SIESTA cohort that died during hospitalization. Of these, 77 (22.8%) were admitted to an ICU before dying. After multivariate adjustment, 3 out of the 20 basal characteristics analyzed in the present study were independently associated with ICU admission: dementia (no patients with dementia who died were admitted to the ICU: OR = 0, 95%CI = not calculable), active cancer (OR = 0.07; 95%CI = 0.02-0.21) and age (< 70 years: OR = 1, reference; 70-74 years: OR = 0.21; 95%CI = 0.08-0.54; 75-79 years: OR = 0.21; 95%CI = 0.08-0.54; &#8805; 80 years: OR = 0.02; 95%CI = 0.01-0.05). The probability of ICU admission significantly increased in parallel to the ChI, even after adjustment for age (ChI 0 points: OR = 0, reference; ChI 1 point: OR = 0.36; 95%CI = 0.16-0.83; ChI 2 points: OR = 0.36; 95%CI = 0.16-0.83; ChI >2 points: OR = 0.09; 95%CI = 0.04-0.23). The sensitivity analyses showed no gross differences compared to the principal analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of COVID-19 patients who died without ICU admission is similar to that observed in the usual medical practice before the pandemic. The basal characteristics limiting their admission were age and global burden due to comorbidity, especially dementia and active cancer.","Miró, Ò; Alquézar-Arbé, A; Llorens, P; Martín-Sánchez, F J; Jiménez, S; Martín, A; Burillo-Putze, G; Jacob, J; García-Lamberechts, E J; Piñera, P; Del Castillo, J González","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,469
433262,When past is not a prologue: Adapting informatics practice during a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. At the time of writing (October 2020), the number of cases of COVID-19 had been approaching 38 million and more than 1 million deaths were attributable to it. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in hospital wards. OBJECTIVE: The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests. A further objective was to assess occupancy levels in hospital areas, such as waiting bays, before allocation to an appropriate bay. PERSPECTIVE/SETTING: The perspective was that of the UK NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical hospital with an accident and emergency department. METHODS: An individual patient model was constructed that simulated the spread of disease and mortality within the hospital and recorded occupancy levels. Thirty-two strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests were modelled. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits, and key patient outcomes, such as death and intensive care unit care, caused directly by COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile appears to have a relatively small number of infections, a low occupancy level within the waiting bays, and a high net monetary benefit. However, if hospital laboratory testing can produce results in 6 hours, then the benefits of point-of-care tests may be reduced. The acceptable target product profiles performed less well and had lower net monetary benefits than both a laboratory-based test with a 24-hour turnaround time and strategies using data from currently available SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. The desirable and acceptable point-of-care test target product profiles had lower requirement for patients to be in waiting bays before being allocated to an appropriate bay than laboratory-based tests, which may be of high importance in some hospitals. Tests that appeared more cost-effective also had better patient outcomes. LIMITATIONS: There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. The example hospital simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Should a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile become available, this appears promising, particularly when the reduction on the requirements for waiting bays before allocation to a SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, or a non-SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, is considered. The results produced should be informative to decision-makers who can identify the results most pertinent to their specific circumstances. FUTURE WORK: More accurate results could be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of, and the reduction in time to test result associated with, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, and on the impact of these tests on occupancy of waiting bays and isolation bays. These parameters are currently uncertain. FUNDING: This report was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme as project number 132154.

We analyzed the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3,605 symptomatic children and adolescents at 4,402 outpatient visits presenting to a pediatric emergency department. In a total of 1,105 (32.6%) episodes, the patients fulfilled clinical case definitions for SARS-CoV-2 infection and were tested by nucleic acid testing. A SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in 10/1,100 episodes (0.3% of analyzed episodes, 0.91% of validly tested patients). Symptoms at presentation did not differ between patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, apart from the frequency of measured temperature ≥37.5°C at presentation. Three percent of analyzed children reported disturbances of olfactory or gustatory senses, but none of them was infected with SARS-CoV-2. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections among symptomatic children and adolescents was low and SARS-CoV-2 infections could not reliably be differentiated from other infections without nucleic acid testing.","Zurl, C.; Eber, E.; Siegl, A.; Loeffler, S.; Stelzl, E.; Kessler, H.

In this present study, variations in terms of missense mutations among the SARS-CoV2 genomes from 128 Indian patients, as of May 2020, are accounted and thereby some key findings with some hypotheses were made. These mutations across various genes of these genomes show wide genetic variations in sequence and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV2 virus. The presence of unique mutations in the studied SARS-CoV2 genomes has led to their attenuation. Few Genes such as ORF6, ORF10 are free from any mutations in the Indian context of 339 genomes observed as of 14th July 2020. Further, E protein contains only one mutation. This may suggest that designing a therapeutic approach against ORF6, ORF10 and E genes may have a beneficial effect in controlling COVID-19 pandemic especially in India.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Bidyut; Jana, Siddhartha Sankar",Genomics,,469

The effect and safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in combination with these therapies have seldom been studied. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate changes in QTc in patients receiving double (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and triple therapy (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin + Lopinavir/Ritonavir) to treat COVID-19. Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. METHODS: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy. RESULTS: 168 patients (±66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748). Overall, 33 patients (19.6%) had a peak QTc and/or an increase QTc 60 ms from baseline, with a higher prevalence among those with hypokalemia (p = 0.003). All-cause mortality was similar between both strategy groups (p = 0.093) and high risk QTc prolongation was no related to clinical events in this series. CONCLUSIONS: DT and TT prolong the QTc in patients with COVID-19.

437911,When narrative practice suddenly goes online due to COVID-19 …,2021,"Recommendation systems have been extensively studied by many literature in the past and are ubiquitous in online advertisement, shopping industry/e-commerce, query suggestions in search engines, and friend recommendation in social networks. Moreover, restaurant/music/product/movie/news/app recommendations are only a few of the applications of a recommender system. A small percent improvement on the CTR prediction accuracy has been mentioned to add millions of dollars of revenue to the advertisement industry. Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction is a special version of recommender system in which the goal is predicting whether or not a user is going to click on a recommended item. A content-based recommendation approach takes into account the past history of the user's behavior, i.e. the recommended products and the users reaction to them. So, a personalized model that recommends the right item to the right user at the right time is the key to building such a model. On the other hand, the so-called collaborative filtering approach incorporates the click history of the users who are very similar to a particular user, thereby helping the recommender to come up with a more confident prediction for that particular user by leveraging the wider knowledge of users who share their taste in a connected network of users. In this project, we are interested in building a CTR predictor using Graph Neural Networks complemented by an online learning algorithm that models such dynamic interactions. By framing the problem as a binary classification task, we have evaluated this system both on the offline models (GNN, Deep Factorization Machines) with test-AUC of 0.7417 and on the online learning model with test-AUC of 0.7585 using a sub-sampled version of Criteo public dataset consisting of 10,000 data points.","Rajabi, Farzaneh; He, Jack Siyuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03811v1.pdf,469

The aim of this study was to ascertain the likelihood of finding LU abnormalities; mimicking lung involvement; in COVID-19 negative healthy individuals. METHODS: We performed LU on 265 healthcare workers; not presenting COVID-19 major symptoms and in good health; during the course of a serological screening program for COVID-19 in our General Hospital. LU results were reported as total Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) using a 12-zone method of reporting. RESULTS: 250/265 subjects were included in the COVID-19 negative group. LU was not completely normal (LUS &#8800; 0) in 65/250 COVID-19 negative subjects (26%) and in 12/15 (80%) poorly symptomatic COVID-19 positive subjects; with a multifocal pattern in 12.7% vs. 66.7% of cases respectively. Age and COVID-19 positivity were independent predictors of total LUS. A total LUS &#8805; 2 had a sensitivity of 66.67% and a specificity of 85.60% in detecting COVID-19 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: A slightly altered LU can be quite frequent in healthy COVID-19 negative subjects.

441728,"Relational Cities Disrupted: Reflections on the Particular Geographies of COVID-19 For Small But Global Urbanisation in Dublin, Ireland, and Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",2020,"With current COVID-19 vaccine demand outweighing supply and the emergency authorization/rollout of three novel vaccines in the United States, discussions continue regarding fair prioritization among various groups for this scarce resource. The US federal government's recommended vaccination schedule, meant to assist states with vaccine allocation, demonstrates fair ethical considerations; however, difficulties remain comparing various groups to determine fair vaccine access and distribution. Although strides have been taken to analyze risks versus benefits of early vaccination across certain high-risk populations, prioritizing vulnerable populations versus essential workers remains challenging for multiple reasons. Similarly, as COVID-19 vaccine allocation and distribution continues in the US and in other countries, topics that require continued consideration include sub-prioritization among currently prioritized groups, prioritization among vulnerable groups disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, like ethnic minorities, and holistic comparisons between groups who might receive various and disparate benefits from vaccination. Although all current COVID-19 vaccines are emergency authorization use only and a vaccine mandate would be considered only once these vaccines are licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration, future vaccination policies require time and deliberation. Similarly, given current vaccine hesitancy, mandatory vaccination of certain groups, like healthcare personnel, may need to be considered when these vaccines are licensed, especially if voluntary vaccination proves insufficient. Continued discussions regarding risks versus benefits of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination and the unique role of healthcare personnel in providing a safe healthcare environment could lead to better deliberation regarding potential policies. This commentary aims to address both questions of fair prioritization and sub-prioritization of various groups, as well as ethical considerations for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare personnel.","Hughes, Katarina; Gogineni, Vinaya; Lewis, Chandani; Deshpande, Abhishek",Curr Med Res Opin,,469

DESIGN: Prospective phase I clinical trial. SETTING: Medical center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. PATIENTS: Moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 200. INTERVENTIONS: Scaling for doses was required by Taiwan Food and Drug Administration as follows: the first three patients received low-dose human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (1.0 × 10 cells/kg), the next three patients with intermediate dose (5.0 × 10 cells/kg), and the final three patients with high dose (1.0 × 10 cells/kg) between December 2017 and August 2019. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nine consecutive patients were enrolled into the study. In-hospital mortality was 33.3% (3/9), including two with recurrent septic shock and one with ventilator-induced severe pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. No serious prespecified cell infusion-associated or treatment-related adverse events was identified in any patient.

443457,How Can Local Governments Address Pandemic Inequities?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with the occurrence since summer 2020 of several viral variants that overlapped or succeeded each other in time. Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477â¯N substitution in this RBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. RESULTS: All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93 %) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 2018/3960 (51%) patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6 %) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. DISCUSSION: Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in about half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.","Bedotto, Marielle; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Houhamdi, Linda; Levasseur, Anthony; Delerce, Jeremy; Pinault, Lucile; Padane, Abdou; Chamieh, Amanda; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Brouqui, Philippe; Sokhna, Cheikh; Azar, Eid; Saile, Rachid; Mboup, Souleymane; Bitam, Idir; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",J Clin Virol,,469

Various concepts and recommendations are being pursued to protect patients and hospital staff. However, the implementation of these recommendations may depend on the existing infrastructure, local conditions and in-house procedural instructions. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between 11th May and 26th May 2020, an anonymous online survey on the topic of COVID-19 was conducted among thoracic surgeons in Germany. The survey consisted of 16 questions on the local COVID-19 case numbers, protective measures, procedural instructions and treatment concepts. The results were summarised, descriptively analysed and discussed. RESULTS: The response rate of 42.6% (n = 66), included replies from 23 (34.8%) specialised hospitals, 18 (27.3%) maximum care hospitals and 14 (21.2%) university clinics. COVID-19-positive patients were treated in 65 (99%) clinics and 37.9% of the clinics also performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were the main instrument for COVID-19 patient testing (in 95.4% of the clinics). Test results influenced decisions on treatment in 71.2% of the clinics. In 59.1% of clinics, safety equipment was supplemented with FFP2 masks and eye protection during thoracic surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Almost all thoracic surgeons reported that they had treated patients with COVID-19 and half of them also had performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. The applied procedural instructions as well as the effects of COVID-19 on treatment decisions and patient-doctor contact differed between the reporting clinics.","Dziodzio, Tomasz; Hillebrandt, Karl-Herbert; Knitter, Sebastian; Ritschl, Paul Viktor; Jara, Maximilian; Nösser, Maximilian; Elsner, Aron; Öllinger, Robert; Pratschke, Johann; Rückert, Jens-Carsten; Neudecker, Jens",Zent.bl. chir,,469
449427,Vulnerability to disease: Look to the future,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a deadly disease that is affecting most of the countries worldwide. Public understanding, including knowledge about signs and symptoms, mode of transmission, and hygiene of COVID-19, is vital for designing effective control strategies during a public health crisis. The current study is aimed at investigating the public's perspective about COVID-19, including their knowledge, attitude, and practices. METHODS: A rapid online survey comprising 22 items was administered during the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Questions were focused on the prevention, transmission, clinical features, and control of COVID-19. In addition, the attitudes and practices of the participants were explored. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis were carried out during data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1257 respondents participated in this study. Most of the respondents had good knowledge (good = 64.8%, average = 30.5%, poor = 4.7%) of COVID-19. Gender, marital status, education, and residence were observed to have a significant association with the knowledge score. A vast majority of the survey respondents (77.0%) believed that COVID-19 would be controlled successfully in Pakistan. The practices of wearing a mask (85.8%) and handwashing (88.1%) were common among the participants. CONCLUSION: The participants demonstrated good knowledge and reasonable attitudes and practices toward most aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Improvements in certain areas could be made by mass-level education.","Hayat, Khezar; Rosenthal, Meagen; Xu, Sen; Arshed, Muhammad; Li, Pengchao; Zhai, Panpan; Desalegn, Gebrehaweria Kassa; Fang, Yu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,469

451814,Caring for a patient with COPD in general practice,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess concerns and healthcare-related behaviors of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Adults from the United States with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the ArthritisPower Patient-Powered Research Network and CreakyJoints patient community completed surveys. Concerns and behaviors were compared among patients with different autoimmune conditions, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use, and geographic measures of urban status, income, education, and COVID-19 activity. RESULTS: Among 1,517 participants (925 RA, 299 PsA, 185 AS, 108 SLE), mean age was 55.1 years, 88.3% were female, and 89.5% white. COVID-19 concerns were similar across the country and were higher in biologic users (p < 0.001). Avoidance of doctor's office visits (56.6%) or laboratory testing (42.3%) and use of telehealth (29.5%) were more common in urban areas. Among participants on DMARDs without COVID-19 or other respiratory illness, 14.9% stopped a DMARD, with 78.7% of DMARD interruptions not recommended by a physician. DMARD stopping was more common participants with lower socioeconomic status and in participants who avoided an office visit [OR 1.46(1.04-2.04)] or reported lack of telehealth availability [OR 2.26(1.25-4.08)]. CONCLUSION: In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RA, PsA, AS, and SLE frequently avoided office visits and laboratory testing. DMARD interruptions commonly occurred without the advice of a physician and were associated with socioeconomic status, office visits, and telehealth availability, highlighting the need for adequate healthcare access and attention to vulnerable populations during the pandemic.","George, Michael; Venkatachalam, Shilpa; Banerjee, Shubhasree; Baker, Joshua F; Merkel, Peter A; Gavigan, Kelly; Curtis, David; Danila, Maria I; Curtis, Jeffrey R; Nowell, W Benjamin",J. rheumatol,,469

456574,Covid-19 in Italy: A Lesson to be Learned,2020,"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic has had a significant impact on the healthcare delivery system worldwide. Many pre-pandemic norms, standards, and methods of providing medical services in most medical facilities had to be changed and re-evaluated. Many of them will likely stay changed and will probably never be provided in the same way in post-pandemic reality. The COVID-19 crisis is still ongoing and some sources say that we should be prepared for a third wave of the pandemic. The scope of the analysis conducted in this publication is related to the healthcare sector, including services and Polish healthcare professionals’ work quality during the COVID-19 crisis. The research gap, the basis for conducting new research, is the lack of clarified results analysing the quality assurance of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary to ask about healthcare professionals’ rate of personal protective equipment quality in Polish medical facilities. The result of cluster analysis will help us to know what the clusters for variables on quality assurance of protection measures for healthcare workers are. The research was carried out using a questionnaire survey on a sample of 21 medical personnel in Polish hospitals. The main findings of this publication are problems with information flow between staff and staff managers and determining appropriate zones. The quality of the personal protective equipment offered by medical facilities’ management and their availability is at an appropriate level. The publication aims to analyse the level of quality assurance of health care worker protection measures in the example of Silesian voivodeships in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Orzeł, Bartosz Wolniak Radosław",Administrative Sciences,,469

Past studies on internet use have focused on its impact on mental health, with little known about its impact on the physical health of individuals during COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study examines the impact of Internet use frequency on physical health during the Covid-19 lockdown in Bangladesh. MethodsA web-based cross-sectional study on 3242 individuals aged 18 and above was conducted from 2nd August - 1st October 1, 2020, during the lockdown in Bangladesh. The survey covers demographics, Internet use frequency and physical health questions. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the impact of internet use frequency on physical health. ResultsThe result indicated that 72.5%, 69.9%, 65.1% and 55.3% reported headache, back pain, numbness of the fingers and neck pain, respectively. The multivariable analyses showed increased physical health impact among regular (coefficient {beta} =0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18-0.85, P=0.003), frequent ({beta} = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.88-1.54, P < .001) and intense ({beta} = 2.24, 95%CI: 1.91-2.57, P < .001) internet users.

462069,“Thanks for hearing me out”: Voices of social work students during COVID-19,2021,"The innate immune system is important for initial antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 can result in overactivity or suppression of the innate immune system. A dysregulated immune response is associated with poor outcomes;with patients having significant Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratios (NLR) due to neutrophilia alongside lymphopenia. Elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 leads to overactivity and is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 can result in lymphopenia;where COVID-19 patients typically have significantly altered lymphocyte subsets. IL-8 attracts neutrophils;which may play a significant role in lung tissue damage with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps leading to cytokine storm or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several factors like pre-existing co-morbidities, genetic risks, viral pathogenicity, and therapeutic efficacy act as important modifiers of SARS-CoV-2 risks for disease through an interplay with innate host inflammatory responses. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system at play with other important modifiers in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hanan, Nicholas Doud Ronnie L.; Park, In-Woo Jones Harlan P.; Mathew, Stephen O.",Vaccines,,469

465020,Corona virus – dentist’s perspective,2020,"Introduction The recent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. This outbreak not only affected healthcare systems but the resultant economic losses were also enormous. COVID-19 has demanded that the health care systems globally evolve, develop new strategies, identify new models of functioning, and at times, fall back on the old conservative methods of orthopedic care to decrease the risk of disease transmission. Although, the majority of hospitals are refraining from performing elective surgeries, emergent and urgent procedures cannot be delayed. Various strategies have been developed at the institute level to reduce the risk of infection transmission among the theatre team from an unsuspected patient (asymptomatic and presymptomatic) during the perioperative period. Material and methods The present study is a part of an ongoing project which is being conducted in a tertiary level hospital after obtaining research review board approval. All patients admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The present study included 13 patients (nine males and four females) with an average age of 35.4 years The oldest patient was of 63 years which is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Results Eight patients (61.5%) presented with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to vertebral fracture with fall from height (87.5%) as the most common etiology. Among the traumatic SCI patients, six (75%) were managed surgically with posterior decompression and instrumented fusion with pedicle screws while two patients (25%) were managed conservatively. There were four patients (30.8%) of tuberculosis of the spine of whom two (50%) were managed with posterior decompression, debridement, and stabilization with pedicle screws, samples for culture, biopsy, and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) were collected during the procedure; for the remaining two patients (50%), a trans-pedicular biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis for initiation of anti-tubercular therapy. Prolapsed intervertebral disc causing cauda equina syndrome was the reason for emergency surgery in one patient (7.7%). COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed in four patients (30.8%), in whom the most common symptom was fever (two patients (50%)). These patients were residents of high prevalence area for COVID-19 infection. Sore throat (25%), fatigue (25%), and low oxygen saturation (25%) were present in one patient which prompted us to get the COVID-19 test. All patients were reported negative for COVID-19. Conclusion The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce infection risk and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched available medical resources. These precautions helped us to reduce transmission and exposure to COVID-19 in health care workers (HCW) and patients in our institute. The aim of this article is that our early experience can be of value to the medical communities that will soon be in a similar situation.","Verma, Virendra; Nagar, Manoj; Jain, Vaibhav; Santoshi, John A; Dwivedi, Manish; Behera, Prateek; Selvanayagam, Rajkumar; Pal, Dharm; Singh, Kuldeep",Cureus,,469

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, with sequence confirmation of the qPCR product, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 × 103-8.2 × 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 × 102-2.5 × 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.","Haramoto, Eiji; Malla, Bikash; Thakali, Ocean; Kitajima, Masaaki",Sci Total Environ,,469

Few cases of severe and often fatal COVID-19 have been reported although the infection is mild in the large majority. Children with cancers are recognised as a high risk group for all infections. Since there aren't any definite treatment guidelines established in children with severe COVID, treatment is guided by adult recommendations which too are often not evidence based. We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia who presented to us as febrile neutropenia. The use of convalescent plasma along with steroids and IVIG showed dramatic results in this child and she recovered without the need for any specific treatment. This is highlighted as one of the earliest cases that is reporting the use of convalescent plasma in a child; the first ever in a child with underlying malignancy.","Shankar, Ravi; Radhakrishnan, Nita; Dua, Seema; Arora, Satyam; Rana, Megha; Sahu, Dinesh Kumar; Rai, Sumit; Gupta, Devendra Kumar",Transfus Apher Sci,,469

METHODS: We collected individual information and aggregated data on COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to April 17, 2020. We accounted for right-censoring to estimate the CFR and explored the risk factors for mortality. We fitted Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions to time-to-event data using maximum-likelihood estimation. RESULTS: We analyzed 82,719 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China, including 4,632 deaths, and 77,029 discharges. The estimated CFR was 5.65% (95%CI: 5.50%-5.81%) nationally, with highest estimate in Wuhan (7.71%), and lowest in provinces outside Hubei (0.86%). The fatality risk among critical patients was 3.6 times that of all patients, and 0.8-10.3 fold higher than that of mild-to-severe patients. Older age (OR 1.14 per year; 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), and being male (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.10-3.04) were risk factors for mortality. The time from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, time from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation, and time from symptom onset to hospitalization were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Our CFR estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained in mainland China suggest that COVID-19 is more severe than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients, particularly in Wuhan. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic in China.

DESIGN: Indexed study used a mixed method design. Phase I employed qualitative methods for development of questionnaire including literature review, focus group discussion, expert evaluation and pre-testing. Phase II used quantitative methods for establishing construct validity of the questionnaire via parallel factor analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1 involved participation of experts from different fields (Departments of Medicine, Nutrition and Clinical Psychology) and general adult population. For phase II, data was collected from 124 adult respondents (female=57.26%); mean age (36±14.8) years residing in an urban setting. RESULTS: The questionnaire consisted of 3 sections: (A) socio-demographic and anthropometric parameters, (B) 24 items each for investigating the change in eating, activity and sleep behavior before versus during COVID-19, (C) 6 items assessing COVID-19 specific reasons for lifestyle change. The Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire is 0.72 suggesting its good internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be a valid tool to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle related behaviors with potential utility for public health researchers to identify these changes at community level and develop strategies to reinforce corrective behaviors.","Chopra, Sakshi; Ranjan, Piyush; Malhotra, Anita; Sahu, Anamika; Dwivedi, S N; Baitha, Upendra; Goel, Astha; Kumar, Arvind",Public Health Nutr,,469

Specifically, electrospun nanofiber scaffolds are considered an emergent technology and a promising approach that can be applied to biosensing, drug delivery, soft and hard tissue repair and regeneration, and wound healing. Several parameters control the functional scaffolds, such as fiber geometrical characteristics and alignment, architecture, etc. As it is based on nanotechnology, the concept of this approach has shown a strong evolution in terms of the forms of the materials used (aerogels, microspheres, etc.), the incorporated microorganisms used to treat diseases (cells, proteins, nuclei acids, etc.), and the manufacturing process in relation to the control of adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the mimetic nanofibers. However, several difficulties are still considered as huge challenges for scientists to overcome in relation to scaffolds design and properties (hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility) but also in relation to transferring biological nanofibers products into practical industrial use by way of a highly efficient bio-solution. In this article, the authors review current progress in the materials and processes used by the electrospinning technique to develop novel fibrous scaffolds with suitable design and that more closely mimic structure. A specific interest will be given to the use of this approach as an emergent technology for the treatment of bacteria and viruses such as COVID-19.","Kchaou, Mohamed; Alquraish, Mohammed; Abuhasel, Khaled; Abdullah, Ahmad; Ali, Ashraf A",,,469

However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiu, Ye; Zhao, Yuan-Bo; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Liao, Ce-Heng; Ge, Xing-Yi",Microbes Infect,,469

The primary aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence rates among HCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-facing oncology HCPs working at three large UK hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing [Luminex and point-of-care (POC) tests] on two occasions 28 days apart (June-July 2020). RESULTS: In total, 434 HCPs were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%), administrators (10.1%); 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2. All participants were PCR negative during the study, but 18.4% were Luminex seropositive on day 1, of whom 42.5% were POC seropositive. Nurses had the highest seropositive prevalence trend (21.3%, P = 0.2). Thirty-eight per cent of seropositive HCPs reported previous SARS-CoV-2 symptoms: 1.9 times higher odds than seronegative HCPs (P = 0.01). Of 400 participants retested on day 28, 13.3% were Luminex seropositive (92.5% previously, 7.5% newly). Thirty-two per cent of initially seropositive HCPs were seronegative on day 28. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of PCR-negative patient-facing oncology HCPs, almost one in five were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of the pandemic's first wave. Our findings that one in three seropositive HCPs retested 28 days later became seronegative support regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing until widespread immunity is achieved by effective vaccination.","Favara, D M; McAdam, K; Cooke, A; Bordessa-Kelly, A; Budriunaite, I; Bossingham, S; Houghton, S; Doffinger, R; Ainsworth, N; Corrie, P G",Clin. oncol,,469

481984,In the Shadow of the Government: The Chinese Nonprofit Sector in the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, but emerging evidence suggest that excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a key role in COVID-19 disease progression. Here, we evaluate if circulating markers of NETs are associated with COVID-19 disease severity and clinical outcome, as well as to markers of inflammation and in vivo coagulation and fibrinolysis. Approach and Results: One hundred six patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe disease were enrolled shortly after hospital admission and followed for 4 months. Acute and convalescent plasma samples as well as plasma samples from 30 healthy individuals were assessed for markers of NET formation: citrullinated histone H3, cell-free DNA, NE (neutrophil elastase). We found that plasma levels of NET markers were all elevated in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls, were associated with respiratory support requirement and short-term mortality, and declined to those found in healthy individuals 4 months post-infection. Levels of the NET markers also correlated with white blood cells, neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines, and C-reactive protein, as well as to markers of in vivo coagulation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial damage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a role of NETs in COVID-19 disease progression, implicating their contribution to an immunothrombotic state. Further, we observed an association between circulating markers of NET formation and clinical outcome, demonstrating a potential role of NET markers in clinical decision-making, as well as for NETs as targets for novel therapeutic interventions in COVID-19.

A descriptive cross-sectional, exploratory design was used to meet the aims of this study. The target population was all individuals aged 18 years and older and who can read and write Arabic, English, or Hindi. The results showed that most individuals demonstrated a high level of knowledge regarding COVID-19. Most individuals believed that COVID-19 is not fatal and that countries can control the COVID-19 virus. Despite the lower levels of anxiety and stress among this population, many individuals reported high levels of stress and anxiety. Higher levels of anxiety, higher levels of knowledge, and being married were associated with more preventive practices. This study showed that the level of knowledge is positively associated with compliance with preventive measures. Providing the public with accurate and consistent information regarding COVID-19 may enhance their compliance with preventive measures. Using different risk communication strategies will ensure collaboration from the public and encourage them to be active members when facing contagious diseases.","Alaloul, Fawwaz; Alomari, Khaled; Al Qadire, Mohammad; Al-Dwaikat, Tariq",Nurs. forum,,469

484232,"The experiences of the Good Companions Response Team during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China: a multi-professional team led by social workers",2020,"To monitor local and global COVID-19 outbreaks, and to plan containment measures, accessible and comprehensible decision-making tools need to be based on the growth rates of new confirmed infections, hospitalization or case fatality rates. Growth rates of new cases form the empirical basis for estimates of a variety of reproduction numbers, dimensionless numbers whose value, when larger than unity, describes surging infections and generally worsening epidemiological conditions. Typically, these determinations rely on noisy or incomplete data gained over limited periods of time, and on many parameters to estimate. This paper examines how estimates from data and models of time-evolving reproduction numbers of national COVID-19 infection spread change by using different techniques and assumptions. Given the importance acquired by reproduction numbers as diagnostic tools, assessing their range of possible variations obtainable from the same epidemiological data is relevant. We compute control reproduction numbers from Swiss and Italian COVID-19 time series adopting both data convolution (renewal equation) and a SEIR-type model. Within these two paradigms we run a comparative analysis of the possible inferences obtained through approximations of the distributions typically used to describe serial intervals, generation, latency and incubation times, and the delays between onset of symptoms and notification. Our results suggest that estimates of reproduction numbers under these different assumptions may show significant temporal differences, while the actual variability range of computed values is rather small.","Pasetto, Damiano; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Gatto, Marino; Rinaldo, Andrea",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,469

485557,Students Engagement and Protagonism in the Promotion of Medical Education During the Covid-19 Pandemic/ Engajamento e Protagonismo Estudantil na Promoção da Educação Médica em Tempos de Pandemia da Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Following a first wave in spring and gradual easing of lockdown, Luxembourg experienced an early second epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 before the start of summer school holidays on 15th July. This provided the opportunity to investigate the role of school-age children and school settings for transmission. METHODS: We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children, teachers and the general working population in Luxembourg during two epidemic waves: a spring wave from March-April 2020 corresponding to general lockdown with schools being closed and May-July 2020 corresponding to schools being open. We assessed the number of secondary transmissions occurring in schools between May and July 2020 using routine contact tracing data. RESULTS: During the first wave in March-April 2020 when schools were closed, the incidence in pupils peaked at 28 per 100,000, while during the second wave in May-July 2020 when schools were open, incidence peaked 100 per 100,000. While incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in adults than in children during the first spring wave, no significant difference was observed during the second wave in early summer. Between May and July 2020, we identified a total of 390 and 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 90,150 school-age children and 11,667 teachers, respectively. We further estimate that 179 primary cases caused 49 secondary cases in schools. While some small clusters of mainly student-to-student transmission within the same class were identified, we did not observe any large outbreaks with multiple generations of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Luxembourg schools was limited during an early summer epidemic wave in 2020. Precautionary measures including physical distancing as well as easy access to testing, systematic contact tracing appears to have been successful in mitigating transmission within educational settings.","Mossong, Joël; Mombaerts, Laurent; Veiber, Lisa; Pastore, Jessica; Coroller, Gwenaëlle Le; Schnell, Michael; Masi, Silvana; Huiart, Laetitia; Wilmes, Paul",BMC Infect Dis,,469

Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to May 11, 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that ~28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and ~184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by ~37 (µg/m3), 62 (µg/m3), and 145 (µg/m3), respectively. A total of ~1310, ~401, and ~430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as ~10, ~3.1, and ~3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detailed spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on the natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly.","Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Kumar, Prashant; Molter, Anna; Zhang, Qi; Basu, Bidroha; Basu, Arunima Sarkar; Pilla, Francesco",Environ Res,,469

We aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of add-on semi-individualized CM during the outbreak. A retrospective cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from 2235 consecutive linked records retrieved from five hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups, and the frequency of CMs used was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semi-individualized CM user group and 17.0% among the non-users. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77, [Formula: see text] = 0.005) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76, [Formula: see text] = 0.009) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients that received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality, especially among severe/critical cases. Chinese medicine could be considered as an add-on regimen for trial use.","Shu, Zixin; Chang, Kai; Zhou, Yana; Peng, Chaoan; Li, Xugui; Cai, Wei; Wei, Li; Zheng, Qiguang; Tian, Haoyu; Xia, Jianan; Yang, Kuo; Wang, Ning; Liu, Jifen; Min, Xiaojun; Yan, Dengying; Sun, Jing; Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Zheng, Yi; Yu, Zecong; Lu, Xi; Yang, Yuxia; Jia, Ting; Ji, Jinghui; Zou, Qunzheng; Wang, Yinyan; Xiao, Minzhong; Zhang, Qing; Xiong, Yajuan; Sun, Feng; Zhu, Qiang; Jiang, Xingxing; Wang, Guodong; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai; Zhang, Junhua; Li, Xiuyang; Zhang, Nevin; Zhang, Boli; Tong, Xiaolin; Liu, Baoyan; Zhou, Xuezhong; Chan, Kam Wa; Li, Xiaodong",Am J Chin Med,,469

Public hospitals have set adapted strategies dedicated to overcoming the overload of COVID-19 patients, and our Oncology and Hematology Center (OHC) has implemented a flexible adapted strategy aiming to reduce the burden of COVID-19. We report our single-center experience on the detailed infection control measures undertaken to minimize virus transmission. Methods: we reviewed all patients treated at the OHC from March 2nd to April 20th, 2020 as measures were taken since the detection of the first COVID-19 case to ensure the protection of patients and healthcare providers, especially a screening zone for any patient entering the center. The patient's data were retrospectively collected and anonymized. Results: we notified a significant decrease in patients' admissions during the lockdown period at the different units of our center. The screening area received a total of 5267 patients during our study period, with an average of 105 patients per day. Interestingly, no healthcare professional was infected and only 8 patients showed symptoms of fever and cough, and all of them had a negative test for COVID-19 (RT-PCR). Thus, the OHC is considered as a COVID-19 free center with zero cases among patients and healthcare providers. Conclusion: by having a 0% rate of infection, the efficiency of our measures is proven, but efforts are still needed as we have to measure the impact of this pandemic in our cancer management.","Ammor, Youssouf Mohamed; Kaïitouni, Zinah Idrissi; Darfaoui, Mouna; Lalya, Issam; Elomrani, Abdelhamid; Khouchani, Mouna",Pan Afr Med J,,469

491749,25 years of Ciência & Saúde Coletiva: trajectory and prospects/ 25 anos de Ciência & Saúde Coletiva: trajetória e perspectivas,2020,"Background: Infectious disease is one of the main issues that threatens human health worldwide. The 2019 outbreak of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, has become a serious global pandemic. Many attempts have been made to forecast the spread of the disease using various methods, including time series models. Among the attempts to model the pandemic, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have used the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to forecast confirmed cases. Objective: The primary objective of this paper is to construct a reliable, robust, and interpretable model for describing, decomposing, and forecasting the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and predicting the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A modified singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach was applied for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We proposed this approach and developed it in our previous studies regarding the separability and grouping steps in SSA, which play important roles in reconstruction and forecasting. The modified SSA approach mainly enables us to identify the number of interpretable components required for separability, signal extraction, and noise reduction. The approach was examined using different levels of simulated and real data with different structures and signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we examined the capability of the approach to analyze COVID-19 data. We then used vector SSA to predict new data points and the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Results: In the first stage, the confirmed daily cases on the first 42 days (March 02 to April 12, 2020) were used and analyzed to identify the value of the number of required eigenvalues (r) for separability between noise and signal. After obtaining the value of r, which was 2, and extracting the signals, vector SSA was used to predict and determine the pandemic peak. In the second stage, we updated the data and included 81 daily case values. We used the same window length and number of eigenvalues for reconstruction and forecasting of the points 90 days ahead. The results of both forecasting scenarios indicated that the peak would occur around the end of May or June 2020 and that the crisis would end between the end of June and the middle of August 2020, with a total number of infected people of approximately 330,000. Conclusions: Our results confirm the impressive performance of modified SSA in analyzing COVID-19 data and selecting the value of r for identifying the signal subspace from a noisy time series and then making a reliable prediction of daily confirmed cases using the vector SSA method.","Alharbi, Nader",JMIRx Med,,469

Such events are associated with explosive growth, followed by sustained transmission (3). During August 7-September 14, 2020, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (MeCDC) investigated a COVID-19 outbreak linked to a wedding reception attended by 55 persons in a rural Maine town. In addition to the community outbreak, secondary and tertiary transmission led to outbreaks at a long-term care facility 100 miles away and at a correctional facility approximately 200 miles away. Overall, 177 COVID-19 cases were epidemiologically linked to the event, including seven hospitalizations and seven deaths (four in hospitalized persons). Investigation revealed noncompliance with CDC's recommended mitigation measures. To reduce transmission, persons should avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing, wear masks, stay home when ill, and self-quarantine after exposure to a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons can work with local health officials to increase COVID-19 awareness and determine the best policies for organizing social events to prevent outbreaks in their communities.","Mahale, Parag; Rothfuss, Craig; Bly, Sarah; Kelley, Megan; Bennett, Siiri; Huston, Sara L; Robinson, Sara",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,469

However, reading groups can be vital for cultivating caring collectives and spaces of collegiality. In this paper we use assemblage thinking to explore 25 years of a Geography reading group at the University of Newcastle. The paper addresses two questions: what does reading together do and make possible; and how might we think about the labours of reading together as a way of building caring collectives. The paper draws on reflections from 24 past and present members of reading group to explore how these kinds of academic practices nourish our working lives.","Ey, Melina; Mee, Kathleen; Allison, Jai; Caves, Susan; Crosbie, Eliza; Hughes, Ainsley; Curtis, Faith; Doney, Rupert; Dunstan, Penny; Jones, Ryan; Tyndall, Adam; Baker, Tom; Cameron, Jenny; Duffy, Michelle; Dufty-Jones, Rae; Dunn, Kevin; Hodge, Paul; Kearnes, Matthew; McGuirk, Pauline; O’Neill, Phillip; Ruming, Kristian; Sherval, Meg; Williams, Miriam; Wright, Sarah",Aust.

Some wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes generate aerosols which have the potential to transmit pathogenic microorganisms and present a health risk for exposed individuals. We analyzed the presence of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater and air samples of WWTPs. The risk that may arise from exposure to virus-contaminated aerosols of wastewater was estimated by developing a quantitative microbial risk analysis (QMRA) method. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 9 of 24 (37.5%) wastewater samples with a concentration about 104 genomic copies L-1. The viral RNA was also detected in 40% (6/15) of air samples. QMRA analysis showed a relatively high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for wastewater workers via exposure to the viral aerosols. The estimated annual infection risk ranged from 1.1 × 10-2 to 2.3 × 10-2 per person per year (PPPY) for wastewater workers which was higher than the reference level recommended by WHO (10-3 pppy). However, due to the lack of data on survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its fate in aerosolized state, more research is needed to determine the importance of wastewater in transmission of COVID-19.","Gholipour, Sahar; Mohammadi, Farzaneh; Nikaeen, Mahnaz; Shamsizadeh, Zahra; Khazeni, Atefeh; Sahbaei, Zohreh; Mousavi, Seyed Mohammad; Ghobadian, Mojtaba; Mirhendi, Hossein",Chemosphere,,469

AIMS: To determine whether immunosuppressed patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 to help inform the management of patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of data from studies that reported on the prevalence of immunosuppression among patient cohorts with COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty full-text publications were identified. In total, six individual studies were included in the final analysis, contributing a total of 10 049 patients with COVID-19 disease. The prevalence of immunosuppressed patients among the study cohorts with COVID-19 ranged from 0.126% to 1.357%. In the pooled cohort a total of 64/10 049 (0.637%) patients with COVID-19 disease was immunosuppressed. Observed to expected ratios were used to compare the prevalence of immunosuppression in cohorts with confirmed COVID-19 disease to the background prevalence of immunosuppression in the general community. The observed to expected ratio of immunosuppression among patients with COVID-19 illness, relative to the general community, was 0.12 (95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the general population, immunosuppressed patients were not at significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This finding provides support for current expert consensus statements, which have recommended the continuation of immunosuppressant therapy in the absence of COVID-19.","Tassone, Daniel; Thompson, Alexander; Connell, William; Lee, Tanya; Ungaro, Ryan; An, Ping; Ding, Yijuan; Ding, Nik S",Intern Med J,,469

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that has already spread to more than 200 countries. However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of in silico predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified three potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the four-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use a populational approach in association with COVID-19 outcome.","Pretti, Marco Antônio M; Galvani, Rômulo G; Vieira, Gustavo Fioravanti; Bonomo, Adriana; Bonamino, Martín H; Boroni, Mariana",Front Immunol,,469

In this pandemic situation, health systems have been put under stress, and the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) exceeded the delivery capabilities of suppliers. To address this issue, 3D printing was identified as a possible solution to quickly produce PPE items such as face shields, mask straps, masks, valves, and ear savers. Around the world, companies, universities, research institutions, and private individuals/hobbyists stepped into the void, using their 3D printers to support hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, and even refugee camps by providing them with PPE. In Germany, the makervsvirus movement took up the challenge and connected thousands of end users, makers, companies, and logistic providers for the production and supply of face shields, protective masks, and ear savers. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) also joined the makervsvirus movement and used its facilities to print headbands for face shield assemblies and ear savers. Within this paper, the challenges and lessons learned from the quick ramp up of a research laboratory to a production site for medium-sized batches of PPE, the limitations in material supply, selection criteria for suitable models, quality measures, and future prospects are reported and conclusions drawn.","Mueller, Tobias; Elkaseer, Ahmed; Charles, Amal; Fauth, Janin; Rabsch, Dominik; Scholz, Amon; Marquardt, Clarissa; Nau, Katja; Scholz, Steffen G.",Appl.

So far, more than 460,000 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 190 countries, causing globally over 20,000 deaths. Currently, the epidemic is still spreading and there is no effective means to prevent the infection. Vaccines are proved to be the most effective and economical means to prevent and control infectious diseases. Several countries, companies, and institutions announced their programs and progress on vaccine development against the virus. While most of the vaccines are under design and preparation, there are some that have entered efficacy evaluation in animals and initial clinical trials. This review mainly focused on the progress and our prospects on field of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Jinyong; Zeng, Hao; Gu, Jiang; Li, Haibo; Zheng, Lixin; Zou, Quanming",Vaccines,,469

513776,Risk of a syndemic between COVID-19 and dengue fever in southern Mexico,2020,"Twinning is a critically important deformation mode in hexagonal close-packed metals. Twins are three-dimensional (3D) domains, whose growth is mediated by the motion of facets bounding the 3D twin domains and influences work hardening in metals. An understanding of twin transformations therefore necessitates that the atomic-scale structure and intrinsic mobilities of facets be known and characterized. The present work addresses the former point by systematically characterizing the boundary structures of 3D { 1 ¯ 012 } twins in magnesium using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Eight characteristic facets associated with twin boundaries are reported, five of which have never been experimentally observed before. Further, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the formation and motion of these facets is associated with the accumulation of twinning dislocations. This work provides insights into understanding the structural character of 3D twins and serves to develop strategies for modulating twin kinetics by modifying twin boundaries, such as solute segregation.","Wang, Shujuan; Gong, Mingyu; McCabe, Rodney J; Capolungo, Laurent; Wang, Jian; Tomé, Carlos N",Sci Adv,,469

OBJECTIVE: We examine the relationship between the COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health-related Google searches in 11 Latin American countries. We include the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. We also explore how changes in search patterns relate to income support policies and to COVID-19 death rates. METHOD: Using Google Trends data and an event-study design, as well as a difference-in-differences analysis, we investigate the association between country specific stay-at-home orders and internet searches including the following words: insomnia, stress, anxiety, sadness, depression, and suicide. RESULTS: We find three main patterns. First, searches for insomnia peak but then decline. Second, searches for stress, anxiety, and sadness increase and remain high throughout the lockdown. Third, there is no substantial change in depression-related or suicide-related searches after the lockdown. In terms of potential mechanisms, our results suggest that searches declined for suicide and insomnia following the passage of each country's income support, while in countries with higher COVID-19-related death rates, searches for insomnia, stress, and anxiety increased by more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in Latin America, Google searches for words associated with mild mental health disorders increased during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Nonetheless, these conclusions should not be construed as a general population mental health deterioration, as we cannot verify that search indicators are accurately related to the users' current feelings and behaviors, and as internet users may not be representative of the population in this region.","Silverio-Murillo, Adan; Hoehn-Velasco, Lauren; Rodriguez Tirado, Abel; Balmori de la Miyar, Jose Roberto",Soc Sci Med,,469
514759,"A Randomized, Crossover Pilot Study of a Novel Web-Based/Mobile Platform for Collaborative Small Group Practice in Therapeutic Reasoning",2020,"Purpose of Review: Mass casualty disasters (natural and man-made) present an acute, critical situation that taxes healthcare resources and clinician acumen. This review summarizes the characteristics and management skill sets that anesthesiologists possess that make them valuable clinicians during mass casualty events and why we as anesthesiologists must continually educate ourselves on this important topic. Recent Findings: Anesthesiologists should be involved in all aspects of emergency preparedness-mitigation, planning, response, and recovery. The anesthesia department should have a plan for how it will deal with managing patients during natural and man-made (unintentional or intentional) disasters, one that takes into account a risk hazard analysis and institutional goals. Unfortunately, most practicing anesthesiologists have not had training and ongoing education for such events, and few academic centers train anesthesiology residents and staff to prepare for mass casualty scenarios. Summary: The everyday clinical practice of anesthesiologists involves the utilization of some of the skills (vascular access, tracheal intubation) commonly required to successfully manage mass casualty scenarios. Anesthesiologists' knowledge of anti-cholinesterases makes them subject matter experts on nerve agent poisoning, and their experience managing trauma patients will serve them well, depending on the nature of the mass casualty event. Practicing anesthesiologists however need to continually educate themselves on their role during mass casualty events. and current anesthesiology residency programs should develop a curriculum and incorporate simulation training to better prepare future generations of anesthesiologists.","Lam, Christopher M; Murray, Michael James",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,,469

It is vital for graduating medical students to learn about COVID-19 because they are likely to treat COVID-19 patients after graduation. We developed a COVID-19 lesson for medical students that used either an online lecture or a serious game that we designed. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a serious game versus online lectures for improving medical students' COVID-19 knowledge. Materials and Methods: From our university's database of knowledge scores, we collected the prelesson, postlesson, and final test knowledge scores of the students who participated in the lesson and conducted a retrospective comparative analysis. Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods (P > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: In the context of the disruption of traditional university teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the serious game we designed is potentially an effective option for online medical education about COVID-19, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.","Hu, Hai; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Li, Hao",Games health j.

The coherence wavelet method and the wavelet-based Granger causality tests are applied to the data (31st December 2019 to 1st August 2020) based on daily COVID-19 observations, oil prices, US-EPU, the US geopolitical risk index, and the US stock price index. The short- and long-term COVID-19 consequences are depicted differently and may initially be viewed as an economic crisis. The results illustrate the reduced industrial productivity, which intensifies with the increase in the pandemic's severeness (i.e., a 10.57% decrease in the productivity index with a 1% increase in the pandemic severeness). Similarly, indices for oil demand, stock market, GDP growth, and electricity demand decrease significantly with an increase in the pandemic severeness index (i.e., a 1% increase in the pandemic severeness results in a 0.9%, 0.67%, 1.12%, and 0.65% decrease, respectively). However, the oil market shows low co-movement with the stock exchange, exchange rate, and gold markets. Therefore, investors and the government are recommended to invest in the oil market to generate revenue during the sanctions period.","Chien, FengSheng; Sadiq, Muhammad; Kamran, Hafiz Waqas; Nawaz, Muhammad Atif; Hussain, Muhammed Sajjad; Raza, Muhammad",,,469

METHODS: We selected a panel of 14 expert endoscopists. We identified 41 common indications for advanced endoscopic procedures from the ASGE Appropriate Use of GI Endoscopy guidelines. Using a modified Delphi method, we first achieved consensus on the patient-important outcome for each procedural indication. Panelists prioritized consensus patient-important outcome when categorizing each indication into one of the following 3 procedural time periods: (1) time-sensitive emergent (schedule within 1 week), (2) time-sensitive urgent (schedule within 1 to 8 weeks), and (3) non-time sensitive (defer for >8 weeks and then reassess the timing). Three anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. RESULTS: All 14 invited experts agreed to participate in the study. The prespecified consensus threshold of 51% was achieved for assigning patient-important outcome(s) to each advanced endoscopy indication. The prespecified consensus threshold of 66.7% was achieved for 40 of 41 advanced endoscopy indications in stratifying them into 1 of 3 procedural time periods. For 12 of 41 indications, 100% consensus was achieved; for 20 of 41 indications, 75% to 99% consensus was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: By using a Modified Delphi method that prioritized patient-important outcomes, we developed consensus recommendations on procedural timing for common indications for advanced endoscopy. These recommendations and the structured decision framework provided by our study can inform decision making as endoscopy services are reopened.","Sawhney, Mandeep S; Bilal, Mohammad; Pohl, Heiko; Kushnir, Vladimir M; Khashab, Mouen A; Schulman, Allison R; Berzin, Tyler M; Chahal, Prabhleen; Muthusamy, V Raman; Varadarajulu, Shyam; Banerjee, Subhas; Ginsberg, Gregory G; Raju, Gottumukkala S; Feuerstein, Joseph D",Gastrointest Endosc,,469

These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public’s preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents’ preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Aberdeen’s College Ethics Research Board (CERB) has approved the study (reference: CERB/2020/6/1974). We will seek CERB approval for major changes from the developmental and pilot work. Peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and results will be presented at public health and health economic conferences nationally and internationally.

One-binding-site model and two-binding-site model were used for the analysis of the electrical signals, revealing the number of binding sites on an antibody and the dissociation constants between the antibody and the short peptide. In the binding-site models, the surface coverage ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface is relevant to the electrical signals resulted from the peptide–antibody binding on the HEMTs. Two binding sites on an antibody were observed and two dissociation constants, 4.404×10−11 M and 1.596×10−9 M, were extracted from the binding-site model through the analysis of the surface coverage ratio of the short peptide on the sensor surface. We have also shown that the conventional method to extract the dissociation constant from the linear regression of curve-fitting with Langmuir isotherm equation may lead to an incorrect information if the receptor has more than one binding site for the ligand. The limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor observed in the experimental result (∼10pM of the short peptide) is very close to the LOD (around 2.7–3.4pM) predicted from the value of the smallest dissociation constants. The sensitivity of the sensor is not only dependent on the transistors, but also highly relies on the affinity of the ligand-receptor pair. The results demonstrate that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs cannot only be used for biosensors, but also for the biological affinity study.","Huang, Chih-Cheng; Lee, Geng-Yen; Chyi, Jen-Inn; Cheng, Hui-Teng; Hsu, Chen-Pin; Hsu, You-Ren; Hsu, Chia-Hsien; Huang, Yu-Fen; Sun, Yuh-Chang; Chen, Chih-Chen; Li, Sheng-Shian; Andrew Yeh, J.; Yao, Da-Jeng; Ren, Fan; Wang, Yu-Lin",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566312006720; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566312006720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23102432/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.09.066,469

Hyperinflammation mediated by dysregulated monocyte/macrophage function is considered to be the key factor that triggers severe illness in COVID-19. However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. Herein, we suggest candidate targets for imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19 by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by integrating the surface target database and drug-target binding database with RNA-sequencing data of severe COVID-19, we identified CCR1 and FPR1 as surface and druggable targets for drug delivery as well as molecular imaging.

The presentation of such findings, unfortunately, has created an infodemic. This study integrated the theory of planned behavior and the health belief model and incorporated findings on addiction from the medical literature to predict cessation intention and support for tobacco control measures in the context of the COVID-19 infodemic. The study found that cessation intention partially mediated the effect of perceived severity and fully mediated the effects of perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and addiction on support for control measures. In addition, a positively-valenced message of the effect of smoking on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 vs. a mixedly-valenced message was significant in predicting cessation intention, and the positively-valenced message of smoking indirectly predicted support for tobacco control measures.

This study examined the experiences of frontline health care professionals in an Australian hospital during the outbreak, with a focus on participant views on information, training and preparedness, to inform future outbreak preparedness planning. STUDY DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 healthcare professionals involved in Ebola preparedness planning, at a hospital in Australia. METHODS: The data were systematically coded to discover key themes in participants' accounts of Ebola preparedness. RESULTS: Three key themes identified were: 1) the impact of high volumes of—often inconsistent—information, which shaped participants' trust in authority; 2) barriers to engagement in training, including the perceived relative risk Ebola presented; and finally, 3) practical and environmental impediments to preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: These clinicians' accounts of Ebola preparedness reveal a range of important factors which may influence the relative success of outbreak preparedness and provide guidance for future responses. In particular, they illustrate the critical importance of clear communication and guidelines for staff engagement with, and implementation of training. An important outcome of this study was how individual assessments of risk and trust are produced via, and overlap with, the dynamics of communication, training and environmental logistics. Consideration of the dynamic ways in which these issues intersect is crucial for fostering an environment that is suitable for managing an infectious threat such as Ebola.","Broom, J.; Broom, A.; Bowden, V.",Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159021/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350616303900; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350616303900; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2016.11.008,469

601539,Pandemic disruptions: The subversion of neoliberalism,2021-03-11,"The market of biomolecules with therapeutic scopes, including peptides, is continuously expanding. The interest towards this class of pharmaceuticals is stimulated by the broad range of bioactivities that peptides can trigger in the human body. The main production methods to obtain peptides are enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, recombinant approach and, especially, chemical synthesis. None of these methods, however, produce exclusively the target product. Other species represent impurities that, for safety and pharmaceutical quality reasons, must be removed. The remarkable production volumes of peptide mixtures have generated a strong interest towards the purification procedures, particularly due to their relevant impact on the manufacturing costs. The purification method of choice is mainly preparative liquid chromatography, because of its flexibility, which allows one to choose case-by-case the experimental conditions that most suitably fit that particular purification problem. Different modes of chromatography that can cover almost every separation case are reviewed in this article. Additionally, an outlook to a very recent continuous chromatographic process (namely Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification, MCSGP) and future perspectives regarding purification strategies will be considered at the end of this review.","De Luca, Chiara; Lievore, Giulio; Bozza, Desiree; Buratti, Alessandro; Cavazzini, Alberto; Ricci, Antonio; Macis, Marco; Cabri, Walter; Felletti, Simona; Catani, Martina",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361839/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26154688,469
603482,Private hospital expansion in China: a global perspective,2018-06-30,"This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios. We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and pandemics.","Yin, X.; Buyuktahtakin, I. E.; Patel, B.

The spread of the simulated respiratory droplet nuclei by the air purifier was not significant, but the nano-sized aggregates were significantly affected by the airflow generated by the air purifier. However, due to the removal of the airborne particles by the HEPA filter contained in the air purifier, continuous operation of the air purifier reduced the number concentration of both the simulated respiratory droplet nuclei and nano-sized aggregates in comparison to the experiment without operation of the air purifier. The effect of the airflow generated by the air purifier on the spread of simulated respiratory droplet nuclei and nano-sized aggregates was negligible when the distance between the air purifier and the nebulizer exceeded 1 m.","Heo, Ki Joon; Park, Inyong; Lee, Gunhee; Hong, Keejung; Han, Bangwoo; Jung, Jae Hee; Kim, Sang Bok",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444175/,469

Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology presents a more efficient system at removing pathological microorganism compared with existing wastewater treatment systems. In the past 8 yr, over 50 MBR plants have been successfully built for hospital wastewater treatments, with the capacity ranging from 20 to 2000 m(3)/d. MBR can effectively save disinfectant consumption (chlorine addition can decrease to 1.0 mg/L), shorten the reaction time (approximately 1.5 min, 2.5–5% of conventional wastewater treatment process), and attain a good effect of inactivation of microorganism. Higher disinfection efficacy is achieved in MBR effluents at lower dose of disinfectant with less disinfection by-products (DBPs). Moreover, when capacity of MBR plants increases from 20 to 1000 m(3)/d, their operating cost decreases sharply.","Liu, Qiaoling; Zhou, Yufen; Chen, Lingyun; Zheng, Xiang",Desalination,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2009.09.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916409010066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226093/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0011916409010066,469

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of São Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students’ educational routines and medical training.

Samples are subjected to nuclease digestion and ultracentrifugation to separate encapsidated viral nucleic acids from cellular nucleic acids. A degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR (DOP-PCR) that has been optimized for the non-specific amplification of virus sized genomes is then employed. Virus identification is performed by sequencing of cloned DOP-PCR products followed by sequence comparison to sequences published in GenBank. This method was used to detect a variety of DNA viruses (including HSV, VZV, SV40, AAV, and EBV) and RNA viruses (including HTLV-I, HTLV-II, influenza, and poliovirus), which were spiked into cells, constitutively expressed in cell culture, or detected in productively infected cultured cells. This novel approach was compared with a non-specific virus detection method used previously and found to be several logs more sensitive. This type of approach has potential utility in solving virus detection and discovery problems where other methods have failed.","Nanda, Santosh; Jayan, Geetha; Voulgaropoulou, Frosso; Sierra-Honigmann, Ana Maria; Uhlenhaut, Christine; McWatters, Bernard J.P.; Patel, Amita; Krause, Philip R.",Journal of Virological Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.06.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408002048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18601953/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408002048,469

Road transport is one of the most important sources of PM in the urban environment, because it directly affects pedestrians. PM measurements were performed in the city of Žilina, Slovakia, at various road-traffic-related measurement stations over the course of several years. This paper evaluates changes in the concentration of the fine fraction (PM(2.5)), the ultrafine fraction (PM(1)), and the coarse fraction (PM(2.5–10)) over time. PM concentrations were measured by reference gravimetric method. Significant changes in PM concentrations over time due to the diversification of pollution sources and other, secondary factors can be observed from the analysis of the measured data. PM samples were subjected to chemical analysis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the concentrations of elements (Mg, Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb, Ni, and Zn). The seasonal variation of elements was evaluated, and the sources of PM(2.5), PM(1), and PM(2.5–10) were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). PM(2.5) (maximum concentration of 148.95 µg/m(3) over 24 h) and PM(1) (maximum concentration of 110.51 µg/m(3) over 24 h) showed the highest concentrations during the heating season, together with the elements Cd, Pb, and Zn, which showed a significant presence in these fractions. On the other hand, PM(2.5–10) (maximum concentration of 38.17 µg/m(3) over 24 h) was significantly related to the elements Cu, Sb, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, and Al. High correlation coefficients (r ≥ 0.8) were found for the elements Mg, Ca, Fe, Al, Cd, Pb, and Zn in the PM(1) fraction, Cd, Pb, and Zn in PM(2.5), and Ba, Sb, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mg, Al, and Ca in PM(2.5–10). Using PMF analysis, three major sources of PM (abrasion from tires and brakes, road dust resuspension/winter salting, and combustion processes) were identified for the PM(2.5) and PM(1) fractions, as well as for the coarse PM(2.5–10) fraction.

One set of questions involves host genetic factors that may affect disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. Objectives: We aimed to review the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, with a systematic focus on human studies. Methods: We conducted a PubMed-based search and analysis for articles relevant to host genetic factors in coronavirus. We categorized articles, summarized themes related to animal studies, and extracted data from human studies for analyses. Results: We identified 1,187 articles of potential relevance. Forty-five studies were related to human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, of which 35 involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis on respiratory infections, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small number of research subjects and loci. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility to coronavirus (of which 7 identified protective alleles), and 16 related to outcomes or clinical variables (of which 3 identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication/validation cohorts. Of the other studies, 28 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 174 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 584 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis, 16 involved study of other pathogens (not coronavirus), 321 involved other studies of coronavirus, and 18 studies were assigned to the other categories and removed. Key findings: We have outlined key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the nascent host genetic factor studies of COVID-19. Previous human studies to date have been limited by issues that may be less impactful on current endeavors, including relatively low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods.","LoPresti, Marissa; Beck, David B; Duggal, Priya; Cummings, Derek A.T.; Solomon, Benjamin D",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511629/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117788; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.30.20117788v1?rss=1,469

Suspected patients, mildly affected patients, and close contacts of confirmed cases should be placed under medical observation. No matter whether there is an etiological diagnosis or not, suspected patients should be kept in strict isolation. It is difficult to identify the source of infection completely unless compulsory measures are taken, such as door-to-door screening. Therefore, the focus of prevention is how to cut off the transmission routes. Given that droplet transmission and contact transmission appear to be the main routes of transmission of COVID-19, the general public need to refrain from going outdoors as much as possible, wear masks in public, and keep good hygiene including frequent handwashing, and wiping and disinfecting door handles and elevator buttons. It is recommended to stop using central air-conditioning because COVID-19 may also spread through aerosol transmission.","Qu, Jie-Ming; Cao, Bin; Chen, Rong-Chang",COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128240038000061; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128240038000061,469

This study aimed to examine the effect of perceived stress and social isolation on self-reported continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use and treatment adherence among sleep medicine clinic patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Between June-November 2020, 81 sleep medicine clinic patients (54.8±15.9y, 44% male, 69% Caucasian) completed an online survey that included self-reported changes in CPAP use and using CPAP as advised; and PROMIS Social Isolation and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). CPAP measures were categorized based on reported changes during the pandemic. Stepwise logistic regression was performed using SAS to determine if Social Isolation and PSS predicted change in CPAP measures. RESULTS: Among participants, 53% reported using CPAP. Out of those, 61% reported change, 16% reported no change, and 23% reported they do not know if there is a change in using CPAP as advised during the pandemic. Social Isolation predicted an increase in odds of CPAP use by a factor of 1.15 (p=0.024). PSS predicted a decrease in odds of using CPAP therapy as advised by a factor of 0.86 (p=0.049). CONCLUSION: Increases in perceived stress predicted lower odds of utilizing CPAP as advised. Increases in self-reported social isolation predicted greater odds of CPAP use in sleep medicine clinic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing stressors/coping and social isolation/support as part of routine clinical care in sleep medicine clinic patients is advised.

An observational longitudinal study was conducted in the cohort of patients admitted to four hospitals in Andalusia, Spain, from 1 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from hospital records. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate 30-day survival and multiple Cox regression models were applied. All analyses were stratified by sex. A total of 968 patients were included (54.8% men, median age 67.0 years). In-hospital mortality reached 19.1% in men and 16.0% in women. Factors independently associated with an increased hazard of death were advanced age, higher CURB-65 score and not receiving azithromycin treatment, in both sexes; active cancer and autoimmune disease, in men; cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease, in women. Disease outcomes and predictors of death differed between sexes. In-hospital mortality was higher in men, but the long-term effects of COVID-19 merit further research.

Historically, marginalized individuals have experienced reproductive oppression in multiple forms. This oppression continues in modern times through health policy and patient-clinician communication. To combat this, the framework of reproductive justice outlines four key actions: analyzing power systems, addressing intersecting oppressions, centering the most marginalized, and joining together across issues and identities. Primary care clinicians have a unique role and responsibility to carry out these four key actions in order to provide patient centered reproductive care. To translate reproductive justice into clinical practice, clinicians care can use reflective practice, the framework of cultural humility, and the concepts from the explanatory model of illness.","Shankar, Megha; Williams, Meagan; McClintock, Adelaide Hearst",J Gen Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974726/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06245-8,469

Many involve myriad assumptions and parameters which cannot be reliably calculated under current conditions. We describe machine-learning and curve-fitting based models using fewer assumptions and readily available data. Methods: Instead of relying on highly parameterized models, we design and train multiple neural networks with data on a national and state level, from 9 COVID-19 affected countries, including Indian and US states and territories. Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions. Findings: We achieve an R2 of 0.999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographically- and demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99.53% for 14 days of forecast and 99.1% for 24 days of forecast. Interpretation: We have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% - almost a fourth of the world average of 9%.","Agarwal, D.

636735,Virtual vs Online: Insight From Medical Students. Comment on “Effectiveness of Virtual Medical Teaching During the COVID-19 Crisis: Systematic Review”,2021-05-14,"Background Several municipalities in the Lombardy Region have been affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection since the earliest stages of the epidemic. To date, 89442 confirmed cases have been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases. Methods This cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the regional healthcare information system (SISS). Discussion This study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Milan (35/2020).","Pagani, G.; Bernacchia, D.; Conti, F.; Giacomelli, A.; Rondanin, R.; Scolari, V.; Boracchi, P.; Gandolfi, C.

636882,Pandemic and protest in 2020: Questions and considerations for social work research,2021-03-11,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to trisomy for all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (β-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging.","Chen, Xu-Qiao; Xing, Zhuo; Chen, Quang-Di; Salvi, Richard J.; Zhang, Xuming; Tycko, Benjamin; Mobley, William C.; Yu, Y.

Prevalent algorithms for feature extraction in pulse-like signals lack objectivity because empirical amplitude thresholds are user-defined to single out the pulses from the noisy background. Here, we use deep learning for feature extraction based on a bi-path network (B-Net). After training, the B-Net acquires the prototypical pulses and the ability of both pulse recognition and feature extraction without a priori assigned parameters. The B-Net is evaluated on simulated data sets and further applied to experimental data of DNA and protein translocation. The B-Net results are characterized by small relative errors and stable trends. The B-Net is further shown capable of processing data with a signal-to-noise ratio equal to 1, an impossibility for threshold-based algorithms. The B-Net presents a generic architecture applicable to pulse-like signals beyond nanopore currents.","Dematties, Dario; Wen, Chenyu; Pérez, Mauricio David; Zhou, Dian; Zhang, Shi-Li",ACS Nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c03842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583465/,469
638425,Six ways to get a grip on your first health education leadership role,2021-06-30,"The Covid-19 pandemic has precipitated the global race for essential personal protective equipment in delivering critical patient care. This has created a dearth of personal protective equipment availability in some countries, which posed particular harm to frontline healthcare workers’ health and safety, with undesirable consequences to public health. Substantial discussions have been devoted to the imperative of providing adequate personal protective equipment to frontline healthcare workers. The specific legal obligations of hospitals towards healthcare workers in the pandemic context have so far escaped important scrutiny. This paper endeavours to examine this overlooked aspect in the light of legal actions brought by frontline healthcare workers against their employers arising from a shortage of personal protective equipment. By analysing the potential legal liabilities of hospitals, the paper sheds light on the interlinked attributes and factors in understanding hospitals’ obligations towards healthcare workers and how such duty can be justifiably recalibrated in times of pandemic.","Chan, Hui Yun",Liverp Law Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100425/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10991-020-09270-z,469

The overarching aim of this study was therefore to assess the available evidence on the clinical effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the profiles of liver chemistries and coagulation in COVID-19 diagnosed patients. We considered all study designs including epidemiological and observational that reported liver function test abnormalities in patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medline, Embase databases and Google Scholar as well as relevant reviews were searched to identify appropriate studies from inception to 31st of August 2020. We calculated the pooled mean with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) through a random-effect model meta-analysis. A total of 35 studies with 10,692 participants were considered for the review from which 23 studies with sufficient quantitative data were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean for liver enzymes and coagulation parameters did not significantly change in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and remained within normal range. Notwithstanding potential bias from confounding factors in interpretation of data in this review, findings from the observational studies and case reports suggest that COVID-19 does not appear to have a significant impact on the transaminases or total bilirubin levels of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further controlled studies and larger sample size observational studies are needed with adequate reporting of other liver function parameters are warranted.","Bzeizi, Khalid; Abdulla, Maheeba; Mohammed, Nafeesa; Alqamish, Jehad; Jamshidi, Negar; Broering, Dieter",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012016/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89513-9,469

We observed the co-circulation of multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as “hidden reservoirs” during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave. Our results suggest that the efficacy of public health interventions is, ultimately, limited by the size and structure of epidemic reservoirs, which may warrant prioritization during vaccine deployment.","Giovanetti, Marta; Cella, Eleonora; Benedetti, Francesca; Rife Magalis, Brittany; Fonseca, Vagner; Fabris, Silvia; Campisi, Giovanni; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Angeletti, Silvia; Borsetti, Alessandra; Tambone, Vittoradolfo; Sagnelli, Caterina; Pascarella, Stefano; Riva, Alberto; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Marcello, Alessandro; Azarian, Taj; Wilkinson, Eduan; de Oliveira, Tulio; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior; Cauda, Roberto; Caruso, Arnaldo; Dean, Natalie E.; Browne, Cameron; Lourenco, Jose; Salemi, Marco; Zella, Davide; Ciccozzi, Massimo",Commun Biol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02025-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883675/,469

This evidence-based viewpoint will address two questions: (a) are individuals with underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure or diabetes) or overt disease (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease) more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and to die than those without underlying conditions? (b) does the regular use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) make patients more likely to get infected and to die of Covid-19? With a necessary cautionary note that the evidence around the links between Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease is accruing at a fast pace, to date we can conclude that: (a) the greater susceptibility of individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions to develop more severe Covid-19 with higher mortality rate is likely to be confounded, in part, by age and the type of co-morbidities. Patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease might show an excess risk; (b) neither ACE-i nor ARB are associated with greater risk of SARS-Cov2 infection, or severity or risk of death in patients with Covid-19. Patients on these drugs should not stop them, unless under strict medical supervision and with the addition of a suitable replacement medicine.","Cappuccio, Francesco P.; Siani, Alfonso",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939475320302064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595085/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475320302064?v=s5,469

Between September 2013 and December 2014, samples from 372 children aged between 1 month and 5 years were collected, and tested using multiplex real-time RT-PCR by a commercial assay for 21 respiratory pathogens. In addition, samples were screened for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae 16S rDNA using real-time PCR. The viral distribution and its association with clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. Viral pathogens were detected in 342 (91.93%) of the samples of which 28.76% were single positive and 63.17% had multiple infections. The most frequent detected viruses were rhinovirus (55.64%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (33.06%), adenovirus (25.00%), coronavirus NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E (21.50%), and metapneumovirus A/B (16.12%). Children in the youngest age group (1–3 months) exhibited the highest frequencies of infection. Related to their frequency of detection, RSV A/B was the most associated pathogen with patient’s demographic situation and clinical manifestations (p<0.05). Parainfluenza virus 1–4 and parechovirus were found to increase the risk of death (p<0.05). Adenovirus was statistically associated to the manifestation of gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). Rhinovirus infection increases the duration of oxygen support (p = 0.042). Coronavirus group was statistically associated with the manifestation of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017).

There is little known information about its outcomes in patients with severe renal dysfunction or end-stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis. METHODSA retrospective, multicenter study was conducted on patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis that were discharged after treatment for COVID-19 between April 1st and December 31st, 2020. Primary endpoints were the length of stay, mortality, maximum oxygen requirements along with the escalation of care needing mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints included change in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition. RESULTSA total of 52 charts were reviewed, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. 14 patients received remdesivir, and 14 patients did not receive remdesivir. The majority of patients were caucasian, female, with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The mean age was 65.33 +14.14 years. All the patients in the remdesivir group received dexamethasone as compared to only 30% of patients in the non-remdesivir group. There was no significant difference in C reactive protein, d dimer levels, and disposition between the two groups. Approximately 35% of the patients died, 18% required intensive ventilation, and the mean length of stay was 12.21 days. DISCUSSIONThe study demonstrated no clinically significant difference in length of stay, maximum oxygen requirements, or mortality in COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease in the remdesivir group as compared to the non-remdesivir group.

COVID-19 patients are found to have increased thrombotic risk. Despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation, many develop serious arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Emerging reports indicate COVID-19 may be considered a novel risk factor for portal vein thrombosis. Although, intra-abdominal infections are identified as risk factors, clostridium difficile colitis has not been typically seen as a risk factor for PVT. We report a case of an elderly female with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 and no prior history of cirrhosis or malignancy who presented with diarrhea due to clostridium difficile infection. She developed sudden onset severe abdominal pain during the course of hospitalization. Acute portal vein thrombosis was identified on CT imaging of the abdomen, and she improved well with therapeutic anticoagulation. Acute portal vein thrombosis usually results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors. The combination of local infection by clostridium difficile and COVID-19 coagulopathy led to development of portal vein thrombosis in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of portal vein thrombosis reported in a patient with clostridium difficile infection in the setting of COVID-19 coagulopathy. During the current pandemic, clinicians should strongly consider abdominal imaging in patients presenting with abdominal pain due to clostridium difficile infection in the setting of COVID-19 to rule out complications such as portal vein thrombosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of portal vein thrombosis prevent complications of portal hypertension and intestinal infarctions.","Rokkam, Venkata Ram Pradeep; Kutti Sridharan, Gurusaravanan; Vegunta, Rathnamitreyee; Vegunta, Radhakrishna; Boregowda, Umesha; Mohan, Babu P.",Case Rep Vasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8832638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728091/,469

Such a prediction may be helpful to the daily economic and financial market. Unlike forecasting the cryptocurrency returns, we propose a new approach to predict whether the return classification would be in the first, second, third quartile, or any quantile of the gold price the next day. In this paper, we employ the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for exploring the predictability of financial returns for the six major digital currencies selected from the list of top ten cryptocurrencies based on data collected through sensors. These currencies are Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Our study considers the pre-COVID-19 and ongoing COVID-19 periods. An algorithm that allows updated data analysis, based on the use of a sensor in the database, is also proposed. The results show strong evidence that the SVM is a robust technique for devising profitable trading strategies and can provide accurate results before and during the current pandemic.

The article examines bonding social capital and bridging social capital, with a focus on how they can potentially contribute to, or inhibit, the socio-ecological system resilience building processes in the context of climate change reality in peri-urban areas. Theoretically, the author draws on the existing social capital and resilience related literatures; empirically, the article presents findings from a study conducted in the peri-urban areas of Pugu and Kazimzumbwi forest reserves on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. The study deployed a household survey and key informant interviews. It found that both bonding and bridging social capital were strong in the research area, suggesting the feasibility of building resilience to climate change effects. Examples are given of a number of resilience building interventions that were established through synergies between social capital actors and local communities, although some doubt is cast over the sustainability of these initiatives.

663475,The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on surrogacy in India: The role of social work,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be poor in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Limited information is available on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of such patients in Arab countries. The present study aimed to address this gap. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 101 patients with ESKD who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 at King Fahad Central Hospital (single center), Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Chi-square test, independent samples t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test, and Cox regression were performed in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ESKD, 20 patients died (19.8%). Patients aged ≥ 65 years had a significant mortality risk. Mortality was higher in male patients (70%) than in female patients (30%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88%), diabetes mellitus (47%), and heart disease (17%). The presence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases along with ESKD increased the mortality risk [relative risk (RR) = 6.5 and RR = 3.8, respectively]. The most frequently reported clinical symptoms were fever (50%), shortness of breath (41%), and cough (35%). In total, 17% of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation. Most patients had bilateral lung infiltrates (88%). Hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in the deceased patients than in the surviving ones. Moreover, compared with the surviving patients, higher degree of lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, ferritin, D-dimer, blood urea nitrogen, and aspartate transaminase were detected in the deceased patients. Septic shock (20%) and respiratory failure (19%) were the most prevalent complications resulting in death. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with ESKD have an increased risk of poor outcomes and mortality. The mortality risk increases with an increase in age and the presence of other comorbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers correlate with disease severity and are associated with in-hospital mortality in this population.","Hakami, Ali; Badedi, Mohammed; Elsiddig, Mohammed; Nadeem, Mohammed; Altherwi, Nada; Rayani, Raed; Alhazmi, Akram",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s327186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475777/,469

Methods: In this mixed-method design study, an online survey collected information on parental stress levels before and during COVID-19, sources of stress, and coping strategies using open-ended questions. Qualitative answers were categorized thematically. Multiple linear regression models were built for the association between changes in stress levels (during-before COVID-19) and sources of stress for parents of children of both groups. Results: Answers of 1,827 parents were analyzed; of these, 186 (9.75%) had children with diagnosed problems. Changes in stress levels during vs. before COVID-19 were associated with the age of the parent, changes in working conditions, a total number of stressors, and distance learning of children. Stronger associations were found for parents of children with diagnoses. For example, for distance learning, the standardized beta (β) was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.37; 1.00) for parents of children without problems and β = 0.73 (0.43; 1.03) for those with problematic children. Conclusions: Parents of children with developmental disorders need specific attention in a pandemic.","Martinsone, Baiba; Tzivian, Lilian",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.704577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490186/,469
664160,Using Simulation as an Investigative Methodology in Researching Competencies of Clinical Social Work Practice: A Scoping Review,2020-09-24,"Pulmonary inflammation is a hallmark of several pulmonary disorders including acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, it has been shown that patients with hyperinflammatory phenotype have a significantly higher mortality rate. Despite this, current therapeutic approaches focus on managing the injury rather than subsiding the inflammatory burden of the lung. This is because of the lack of appropriate non-invasive biomarkers that can be used clinically to assess pulmonary inflammation. In this review, we discuss two metabolic imaging tools that can be used to non-invasively assess lung inflammation. The first method, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), is widely used in clinical oncology and quantifies flux in metabolic pathways by measuring uptake of a radiolabeled molecule into the cells. The second method, hyperpolarized (13)C MRI, is an emerging tool that interrogates the branching points of the metabolic pathways to quantify the fate of metabolites. We discuss the differences and similarities between these techniques and discuss their clinical applications.","Pourfathi, Mehrdad; Kadlecek, Stephen J.; Chatterjee, Shampa; Rizi, Rahim R.",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982768/,469

Largely ignored in this body of research is the potential role of unpaid domestic labor. The objectives of this paper were to determine whether socioeconomic disparities in mental health were present in a sample of employed, partnered mothers, and if so, identify the intervening mechanisms which contributed to the disparity. Participants for this cross-sectional study were 512 women recruited from an online research panel of residents living in Saskatchewan, Canada. Household income was the primary exposure and psychological distress was the dependent variable. Potential mediators included material deprivation, job control, job demands, work–family conflict, and the conditions of domestic labor. Descriptive analyses followed by simple and multiple mediation analyses were performed. Lower income was associated with greater distress, with material deprivation, work–family conflict, and inequity in responsibility for domestic work acting as mediators. These results suggest that in addition to more well-established mechanisms, the conditions of unpaid domestic labor, particularly how that labor is shared within households, may play a role in the genesis of mental health inequities among employed partnered mothers. Limitations of the study are discussed as are implications for future research.","Janzen, Bonnie; Hellsten, Laurie-Ann",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199194/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126402,469

Several reports suggest pregnancy does not typically increase the severity of maternal disease; however, cases of preeclampsia and preterm birth have been infrequently reported. Reports of placental infection and vertical transmission are rare. Interestingly, despite lack of SARS-CoV-2 placenta infection, there are several reports of significant abnormalities in placenta morphology.

Type I IFNs consist of IFNα, IFNβ, IFNϵ, IFNκ, IFNω, and a few others, and they all signal through a shared receptor to exert a wide range of biological activities, including antiviral, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects. Though the individual type I IFN subtypes possess overlapping functions, there is growing appreciation that they also have unique properties. In this review, we summarize some of the mechanisms underlying differential expression of and signaling by type I IFNs, and we discuss examples of differential functions of IFNα and IFNβ in models of infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmunity.","Fox, Lindsey E.; Locke, Marissa C.; Lenschow, Deborah J.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.606874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408718/,469

678331,Trends of in-hospital and 30-day mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention in England before and after the COVID-19 era,2020-07-27,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 virus is highly contagious and thus there is a potential of infecting operating staff when operating on these patients. This case series describes a method of performing open tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients while minimizing potential aerosolization of the virus using typically available equipment and supplies. METHODS: This is a case series of 18 patients who were COVID-19 positive and underwent open tracheostomy in the operating room under a negative pressure plastic hood created using readily available equipment and supplies. Patients had to be intubated for at least 14 days, be convalescing from their cytokine storm, and deemed to survive for at least 14 more days. Other indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning, respiratory failure and failed extubation attempts. RESULTS: There were 14 men and 4 women with severe SARS-CoV2 infection requiring long-term intubation since March 23 or later. The mean age was 61.7, BMI was 32.6, and the pre-tracheostomy ventilator day was 20.4. The indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning and continued respiratory with hypoxia. Failed extubation attempt rate was 16.7% and hemodialysis rate was 38.9%. All patients were hemodynamically stable, without any evidence of accelerating cytokine storm. To date there was one minor bleeding due to postoperative therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: This report describes a method of performing open tracheostomy with minimal aerosolization using readily available equipment and supplies in most hospitals.","Prabhakaran, Kartik; Malcom, Ryan; Choi, James; Chudner, Alexandra; Moscatello, Augustine; Panzica, Peter; Latifi, Rifat; Rhee, Peter",J Trauma Acute Care Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404630/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000002780,469
678675,The management of dialysis access thrombosis during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"In May, this journal published an opinion piece by one of the members of the Editorial Board, Dr. Harvey Risch, that reviewed several papers and argued that using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZ) early to treat symptomatic COVID-19 cases in high-risk patients should be broadly applied. As members of the journal's editorial board, we are strongly supportive of open debate in science, which is essential even on highly contentious issues. However, we must also be thorough in our examination of the facts and open to changing our minds when new information arises. In this commentary, we document several important errors in the manuscript by Dr. Risch, review the literature he presented and demonstrate why it is not of sufficient quality to support scale up of HCQ+AZ, and then discuss the literature that has been generated since his publication, which also does not support use of this therapy. Unfortunately, the current scientific evidence does not support HCQ+AZ as an effective treatment for COVID-19, if it ever did; and even suggests many risks. Continuing to push the view that it is an essential treatment in the face of this evidence is irresponsible and harmful to the many people already suffering from infection.","Fox, Matthew P; D'Agostino McGowan, Lucy; James, Bryan D; Lessler, Justin; Mehta, Shruti H; Murray, Eleanor J",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860038/; https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa189,469
682613,"The Pedagogical Shift During COVID 19 Pandemic: Online Medical Education, Barriers and Perceptions in Central Kerala",2020-08-19,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in COVID-19 research and determine whether these AI applications integrated heterogenous data from different sources for modeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 2 major COVID-19 literature databases, the National Institutes of Health’s LitCovid and the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 database on March 9, 2021. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, 2 reviewers independently reviewed all the articles in 2 rounds of screening. RESULTS: In the 794 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, we identified 7 key COVID-19 research areas in which AI was applied, including disease forecasting, medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and prognosis (non-imaging), drug repurposing and early drug discovery, social media data analysis, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis, and other COVID-19 research topics. We also found that there was a lack of heterogenous data integration in these AI applications. DISCUSSION: Risk factors relevant to COVID-19 outcomes exist in heterogeneous data sources, including electronic health records, surveillance systems, sociodemographic datasets, and many more. However, most AI applications in COVID-19 research adopted a single-sourced approach that could omit important risk factors and thus lead to biased algorithms. Integrating heterogeneous data for modeling will help realize the full potential of AI algorithms, improve precision, and reduce bias. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data integration in the AI applications in COVID-19 research and a need for a multilevel AI framework that supports the analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources.","Guo, Yi; Zhang, Yahan; Lyu, Tianchen; Prosperi, Mattia; Wang, Fei; Xu, Hua; Bian, Jiang",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151987/,469
683610,Clinical evaluation of an interoperable clinical decision-support system for the detection of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in critically ill children,2021-02-18,"From the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, researchers have looked to electronic health record (EHR) data as a way to study possible risk factors and outcomes. To ensure the validity and accuracy of research using these data, investigators need to be confident that the phenotypes they construct are reliable and accurate, reflecting the healthcare settings from which they are ascertained. We developed a COVID-19 registry at a single academic medical center and used data from March 1 to June 5, 2020 to assess differences in population-level characteristics in pandemic and non-pandemic years respectively. Median EHR length, previously shown to impact phenotype performance in type 2 diabetes, was significantly shorter in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group relative to a 2019 influenza tested group (median 3.1 years vs 8.7; Wilcoxon rank sum P=1.3e-52). Using three phenotyping methods of increasing complexity (billing codes alone and domain-specific algorithms provided by an EHR vendor and clinical experts), common medical comorbidities were abstracted from COVID-19 EHRs, defined by the presence of a positive laboratory test (positive predictive value 100%, recall 93%). After combining performance data across phenotyping methods, we observed significantly lower false negative rates for those records billed for a comprehensive care visit (p=4e-11) and those with complete demographics data recorded (p=7e-5). In an early COVID-19 cohort, we found that phenotyping performance of nine common comorbidities was influenced by median EHR length, consistent with previous studies, as well as by data density, which can be measured using portable metrics including CPT codes. Here we present those challenges and potential solutions to creating deeply phenotyped, acute COVID-19 cohorts.","DeLozier, Sarah; Bastarache, Lisa; Bland, Sarah; McPheeters, Melissa; Wells, Quinn; Farber-Eger, Eric; Bejan, Cosmin A.; Fabbri, Daniel; Rosenbloom, Trent; Roden, Dan; Johnson, Kevin B.; Wei, Wei-Qi; Peterson, Josh",J Biomed Inform,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001064?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103777; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838341/,469
