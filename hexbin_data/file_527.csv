7163,7163,7163,Viruses and diarrhoea in West Africa and London: a collaborative study,22.099495,7.5232964,1978-01-11,"In the chicken bursa of Fabricius (BF), the interfollicular epithelium (IFE) consists of cylindrical- and cuboidal-shaped cells. Among the cylindrical-shaped epithelial cells, mucus-producing and caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-expressing cells can be distinguished. Occasionally, the cuboidal-shaped cells also express Cav-1, which suggests that they are precursors of both mucus-producing and Cav-1-expressing cells. Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) impedes the differentiation of Cav-1-expressing cells and shifts the differentiation of cuboidal cells towards mucus-producing cells. In control birds exclusively, the IFE surface shows a mucous membrane, but after IBDV infection, the surfaces of both IFE and FAE are also covered by a mucous membrane. After IBDV infection, the cells of FAE also produce mucus, providing evidence for cell transformation. In late postinfection (pi; 28 d pi), the Cav-1 expression returned in the IFE cells, whereas the follicle (the primary lymphoid organ) underwent atrophy. The appearance of the renewed Cav-1-positive cells is similar to that of the normal basal cell, but they randomly locate in different levels of IFE, suggesting the loss of epithelial polarity. Between days 2 and 7 pi, the Cav-1 expression in the endothelial cells of the cortico-medullary capillary web is variable, which may explain the hemorrhage in several infected birds. The IBDV infection stops the Cav-1 expression and subsequently the cholesterol efflux into the bursal lumen. In the infected birds, the high cholesterol level may further worsen the clinical syndrome of IBDV.","Bódi, Ildikó; Felföldi, Balázs; Minkó, Krisztina; Benyeda, Zsófia; Nagy, Nándor; Kiss, Anna L; Palya, Vilmos; Oláh, Imre",Poult Sci,527,22
16400,16400,16400,TB and COVID-19: paying attention to diabetes mellitus,22.198322,7.6585417,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing changes in population demographics increase the relevance of dignified aging across Europe. Community-based health care (CBHC) organizations are necessary to provide sustainable strategies for organizing care for older persons in need of support. To support the digitalization of these organizations, new business models and suitable web platforms are necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study, which is part of the European Active and Assisted Living (AAL) project called “ICareCoops”, aimed to explore concepts, approaches, and workflows of CBHC organizations to achieve a comprehensive understanding of extant services offered and relevant requirements to support these services with information and computer technology (ICT) solutions. METHODS: A qualitative study with six focus groups (FGs) with 40 participants was conducted in Switzerland and Slovenia to identify potential stakeholders’ needs and requirements for the user-centered development of a web platform. Data were collected from three different stakeholder groups: (1) older persons in need of support as care receivers, (2) significant others of older persons in need of support, and (3) managers or care providers of CBHC organizations. A semistructured interview guide with open questions was used for data collection. FG sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the content of the FG sessions. To assist with further web platform development, the responses of the FG participants were translated into user stories to describe technical requirements. RESULTS: By analyzing the transcripts, five main categories were identified: (1) ICT usage behavior of users, (2) challenges of web platform usage, (3) content and technical requirements for the web platform, (4) form and services of CBHC organizations, and (5) rationales of CBHC organizations. The main issues identified were the need for seniors to have individual contact with the CBHC organization and the possibility to coordinate routine services via the web platform, such as ordering meals-on-wheels or booking a caregiver to accompany an older person to the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants showed a lack of familiarity with the usage of ICT. Nevertheless, they were open-minded regarding web platform usage to facilitate workflows and to benefit CBHC organizations. Cooperatives as an organizational model demonstrate a high potential to address users’ needs. Therefore, the web platform offers an essential tool for innovative health care models in the future. Searching for care services, contacting care providers, and communicating with care providers was preferred via personal contact and seemed to be the key element for user acceptance and for the successful implementation of a web platform like “ICareCoops” to support CBHC organizations.","Biehl, Verena; Becker, Heidrun; Ogrin, Alenka; Reissner, Alenka; Burger, Johannes; Glaessel, Andrea",J Med Internet Res,527,21
17998,17998,17998,In reply: Personal protective equipment penetration performance may be affected by temperature and humidity,22.1321,7.316137,2021-05-25,"Lactobacillus has been reported to inhibit acute lung injury (ALI). However, the molecular mechanism of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) in preventing ALI has not been identified, so we investigated whether L. casei pretreatment could inhibit the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway following ALI. ALI model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to female BALB/c mice. In L. casei LC2W group, mice were intragastrically administrated L. casei LC2W for a week, before the ALI modeling. The serum of normal BALB/c mice after intragastric administration of L. casei LC2W was used for in vitro cell assays. The serum was pre-incubated with mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) and human lung cell line (HLF-A), then LPS was added to co-incubate. Compared with ALI model group, L. casei LC2W pretreatment significantly reduced lung pathological damage, the number of neutrophils and total cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Besides, L. casei LC2W pretreatment could significantly reverse the abnormal expression of ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 in lung tissue and serum, plus, L. casei LC2W significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of IRAK-1 and NF-κB p65. In vitro, the serum decreased the up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-α in cell lines induced by LPS. In conclusion, L. casei LC2W intragastric administration pretreatment could significantly improve LPS-induced ALI in mice, probably through circulation to reach the lungs so as to inhibit the inflammatory response induced by activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhao, Lihui; Mao, Ying; Yu, Haiming; Liu, He; Wang, Chao; Liu, Jianwei; Han, Yutong; Bi, Yang; Zhang, Donghai",Indian J Microbiol,527,1

SOURCES OF INFORMATION The MeSH terms bicycle and transportation were searched in PubMed. Clinical trials, practice reviews, and systematic reviews were included. All reference lists were reviewed for additional articles. MAIN MESSAGE Climate change is a threat to health. In Canada alone, transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Active transportation, which is any form of human-powered transportation, can mitigate the health effects of the climate crisis while simultaneously improving the health of people. Physical activity improves overall well-being, as well as physical and mental health. Active transportation, particularly cycling, is a convenient way to meet physical activity targets, reduce risk of disease and all-cause mortality, and derive mental health and social benefits. Family physician advocacy for active transportation has been shown to increase cycling levels in patients compared with no physician advocacy. CONCLUSION Family physicians can help to increase the level of active transportation at the individual patient level through patient education and behaviour change counseling; at the community level through community education and political advocacy; and at the policy level through partnerships with larger organizations.","Green, Samantha; Sakuls, Peter; Levitt, Sarah",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,527,31

The aim of this study is to characterize the indications for conversion and perioperative outcomes in a large cohort of these patients at a single institution. METHODS Patients who underwent revisional surgery to convert SG to RYGB at our institution from January 2008 through January 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Eighty-nine patients with previous SG underwent conversion to RYGB as part of a planned two-stage approach to gastric bypass (n = 36), for weight recidivism (n = 11), or for complications related to SG (n = 42). Complications from SG that warranted conversion included refractory GERD (40.5%), sleeve stenosis (31.0%), gastrocutaneous (16.7%), or gastropleural (7.1%) fistula, and gastric torsion (4.1%). The mean (SD) age was 47.2 years (11.4 years) and median BMI at the time of revision was 43.2 kg/m2. A laparoscopic approach was successfully completed in 76 patients (85.4%), with an additional of four completed robotically (4.5%). The median length of stay was 3 days. Twenty-eight patients (31.5%) had complications which included surgical site infection (20.2%), re-operation (6.7%), anastomotic stricture (3.4%), and one pulmonary embolism. There were no mortalities with a median follow-up of 15 months. CONCLUSIONS Conversion of SG to RYGB is safe and technically feasible when performed for complications of SG or to enhance weight loss. This operation can be successfully performed laparoscopically with a low rate of conversion and reasonable complication profile.","Landreneau, Joshua P; Strong, Andrew T; Rodriguez, John H; Aleassa, Essa M; Aminian, Ali; Brethauer, Stacy; Schauer, Philip R; Kroh, Matthew D",Obesity surgery,527,24

We estimated the national burden and consequences of financial hardship from medical bills in individuals with CLD. APPROACH & RESULTS Using the National Health Interview Survey from 2014-18, we identified individuals with self-reported CLD. We used complex weighted survey analysis to obtain national estimates of financial hardship from medical bills and other financial toxicity measures (cost-related medication non-adherence, personal and/or healthcare related financial distress, food insecurity). We evaluated the association of financial hardship from medical bills with unplanned healthcare utilization and work productivity, accounting for differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, income, education and comorbidities. Of 3,666 (representing 5.3 million) US adults with CLD, 1,377 (representing 2.0 million; [37%, 95% CI: 35-39%]) reported financial hardship from medical bills, including 549 (representing 740,000; [14%, 95% CI: 13-16%]) who were unable to pay medical bills at all. Adults who were unable to pay medical bills had 8.4 times higher odds of cost-related medication non-adherence (aOR, 8.39 [95% CI, 5.72-12.32]), 6.3-times higher odds of financial distress (aOR, 6.33 [4.44-9.03]) and 5.6-times higher odds of food insecurity (aOR, 5.59 [3.74-8.37]), as compared to patients without financial hardship from medical bills. Patients unable to pay medical bills had 1.9-times higher odds of emergency department visits (aOR, 1.85 [1.33-2.57]), and 1.8-times higher odds of missing work due to disease (aOR, 1.83 [1.26-2.67]). CONCLUSIONS One in 3 adults with CLD experience financial hardship from medical bills, and frequently experience financial toxicity and unplanned healthcare utilization. These financial determinates of health have important implications in the context of value-based care.","Lago-Hernandez, Carlos; Nguyen, Nghia H; Khera, Rohan; Loomba, Rohit; Asrani, Sumeet K; Singh, Siddharth",Hepatology,527,27

Evidence of respirator cleaning and disinfection behaviors and practices by health care workers may inform guidance on reusable respirator use. METHODS Medical system elastomeric respirator users were surveyed about respirator cleaning and disinfection practices and perceptions via an electronic survey. Respondents were subsequently classified based on reported compliance with their assigned respirator use. To explore whether respirator cleaning and disinfection issues affected compliance with assigned device use, responses were compared between user groups and adjusted for covariates. RESULTS A total of 432 of 2,024 (21%) eligible elastomeric respirator users completed the survey. Most (>90%) reported that their respirator was clean, but only 52% reported that they always disinfect their respirators after use according to the hospital's expected practice. Only 40 respondents (9%) reported regularly cleaning the respirator with soap and water, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Reporting of suboptimal decontamination practice was not associated with assigned device compliance, however, except among providers and respiratory therapists. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE Although perceptions of cleanliness and adherence to expected decontamination practices during routine use did not appear to influence compliance with assigned respirator use overall, this did predict compliance among providers and respiratory therapists, both of whom have nonfixed workstations. Practical and effective strategies to assure easy access to and availability of clean reusable respiratory protective devices are needed to facilitate their use in health care respiratory protection programs.","Hines, Stella E; Brown, Clayton H; Oliver, Marc; Gucer, Patricia; Frisch, Melissa; Hogan, Regina; Roth, Tracy; Chang, James; McDiarmid, Melissa",Workplace health & safety,527,1

To date, the molecular and cellular bases of reconsolidation have been extensively investigated particularly within the hippocampus. However, the role of adult neurogenesis in memory reconsolidation is unclear. Here, we combined functional imaging, retroviral and chemogenetic approaches in rats to tag and manipulate different populations of rat adult-born neurons. We find that both mature and immature adult-born neurons are activated by remote memory retrieval. However, only specific silencing of the adult-born neurons immature during learning impairs remote memory retrieval-induced reconsolidation. Hence, our findings show that adult-born neurons immature during learning are required for the maintenance and update of remote memory reconsolidation.","Lods, Marie; Pacary, Emilie; Mazier, Wilfrid; Farrugia, Fanny; Mortessagne, Pierre; Masachs, Nuria; Charrier, Vanessa; Massa, Federico; Cota, Daniela; Ferreira, Guillaume; Abrous, Djoher Nora; Tronel, Sophie",Nature communications,527,1

Misdiagnosing infection leads to repeated early failures that are distressing for patients as well as surgeons. To avoid failures related to misdiagnosed prosthetic joint infections a step-wise algorithm of action is proposed and the diagnostic strength of the steps discussed.

Globally there are attempts to manage this phenomenon. However, while risk factors have been identified, there is a tendency to over accentuate the extent of their contribution. Alcohol and drug misuse, for example, are frequently reported, with limited consideration of the ED environment. By far the biggest cause of violence appears to be the presentation of conditions related to or accompanied by mental illness and the impact of queuing and crowded departments on patients and their families. This study aims to examine the extent to which ED waiting times, design and queuing are linked to ED violence. METHODS An integrative literature review was performed using CINAHL Complete and MEDLINE databases. 110 papers were initially selected, and the final analysis included 25 papers. RESULTS The literature revealed three emerging themes: the nature of emergency department violence, environmental contributory factors and its management and control. CONCLUSION The findings of this review reveal several causes of violence. Surprisingly most approaches take a victim blaming approach aimed at identifying potential perpetrators rather than taking a holistic approach to prevention that would also address environmental and societal issues. More is needed in terms of implementation of more far-reaching, practical, and effective management solutions to promote health care workers' safety and adequately support vulnerable patients.","Timmins, Fiona; Timmins, Bernard",Journal of evidence-based medicine,527,33

Each lot of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is tested for neurovirulence in animals and also for the presence of neurovirulent revertants. Mutant analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC) is used to measure the frequency of neurovirulent mutations at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome that correlate with the level of neurovirulence determined by the monkey neurovirulence test. However, MAPREC can only monitor mutations at a few genomic loci and miss mutations at other sites that could adversely affect vaccine quality. Here we propose to use massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for sensitive detection and quantification of all mutations in the entire genome of attenuated viruses. Analysis of vaccine samples and reference preparations demonstrated a perfect agreement with MAPREC results. Quantitative MPS analysis of validated reference preparations tested by MAPREC produced identical results, suggesting that the method could take advantage of the existing reference materials and be used as a replacement for the MAPREC procedure in lot release of OPV. Patterns of mutations present at a low level in vaccine preparations were characteristic of seed viruses used for their manufacture and could be used for identification of individual batches. This approach may represent the ultimate tool for monitoring genetic consistency of live viral vaccines.","Neverov, Alexander; Chumakov, Konstantin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,527,12

Failure of embryos to firmly adhere results in implantation failure and infertility. A receptive endometrial luminal epithelium is achieved through the expression of adhesion molecules in the mid-secretory phase and is a requirement for implantation. Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is an adhesion molecule localizing to the endometrial luminal epithelial cell surface in the mid-secretory/receptive phase and knockdown of CDH6 in the Ishikawa cells (receptive endometrial epithelial cell line) compromises cell integrity. However, there are no studies investigating the role of CDH6 on receptivity and infertility. This study aimed to investigate whether CDH6 is dysregulated in the endometrium of women with infertility during the receptive window and the effect of CDH6 on endometrial adhesion and receptivity. METHODS The expression and the localization of CDH6 in the human endometrium were determined by immunohistochemistry. Ishikawa cells were used to investigate the functional consequences of CDH6 knockdown on endometrial adhesive capacity to HTR8/SVneo (trophoblast cell line) spheroids in vitro. CDH6 knockdown was assessed by qPCR and immunoblotting. After CDH6 knockdown, the expression of type II cadherin family members and CDH6 functional partners were assessed by qPCR. Two-tailed unpaired student's t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate were used for statistical analysis with a significance threshold of P < 0.05. RESULTS A significant reduction of CDH6 immunolocalization was recorded in the luminal and glandular epithelium of endometrium from women with infertility (P < 0.05) compared to fertile group respective cellular compartments in the mid-secretory phase. Functional analysis using Ishikawa cells demonstrated that knockdown of CDH6 (treated with 50 nM CDH6 siRNA) significantly reduced epithelial adhesive capacity (P < 0.05) to HTR8/SVneo spheroids compared to control and other type II cadherin family members likely failed to compensate for the loss of CDH6. The expression levels of CDH6 functional partners, catenin family members were not changed after CDH6 knockdown in Ishikawa cells. CONCLUSION Together, our data revealed that CDH6 was dysregulated in the endometrium from women with infertility and altered Ishikawa cell adhesive capacity. Our study supports a role for CDH6 in regulating endometrial adhesion and implantation.","Zhou, Wei; Santos, Leilani; Dimitriadis, Evdokia",Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,527,1

The characterisation and description of chestnut populations and cultivars are crucial to develop effective conservation strategies of one of the most important Italian and European fruit and wood species. Chestnut cultivars grown in the same pedoclimatic conditions and on the same clonal rootstock were characterised with sensory, spectrophotometric, and chromatographic analysis to determine the phytochemical composition and nutraceutical properties. A multivariate approach, including principal component analysis and conditional inference tree models, was also performed. The ease of peeling, seed colour, and intensity of sweetness were the sensory descriptors that allowed us to differentiate C. sativa cultivars. Antioxidant capacity ranged from 9.30 ± 0.39 mmol Fe+2 kg-1 DW ('Bouche de Bètizac') to 19.96 ± 1.89 mmol Fe+2 kg-1 DW ('Garrone Rosso'). Monoterpenes represented the main component, reaching 88% for hybrids, followed by polyphenols (10-25% for hybrids and chestnuts, respectively). A multivariate approach showed that phenolic acids and tannins were the bioactive classes with the highest discriminating power among different genotypes, and that genotype is a significant variable (p < 0.05). In addition, most of the analysed chestnut cultivars showed a content of bioactive compounds similar to or higher than the main hazelnut, walnut, and almond varieties. Chestnut agrobiodiversity could be intended as strictly associated to the genotype effect and underlines the large variability within the genus Castanea, and therefore, the importance of in farm and ex situ conservation of local germplasm is part of a global strategy aimed at increasing the levels of agrobiodiversity.","Beccaro, Gabriele L; Donno, Dario; Lione, Guglielmo Gianni; De Biaggi, Marta; Gamba, Giovanni; Rapalino, Sabrina; Riondato, Isidoro; Gonthier, Paolo; Mellano, Maria Gabriella",Foods,527,1

Does this fraud mean that CPCs are not beneficial in models of ischemic cardiomyopathy? At least 50 studies from 26 laboratories independent of the Harvard group have reported beneficial effects of CPCs in mice, rats, pigs, and cats. The mechanism of action remains unclear. Our group has shown that CPCs do not engraft in the diseased heart, do not differentiate into new cardiac myocytes, do not regenerate dead myocardium, and thus work via paracrine mechanisms. A casualty of the misconduct at Harvard has been the SCIPIO trial, a collaboration between the Harvard group and the group in Louisville. The retraction of the SCIPIO paper was caused exclusively by issues with data generated at Harvard, not those generated in Louisville. In the retraction notice, the Lancet editors stated: ""Although we do not have any reservations about the clinical work in Louisville that used the preparations from Anversa's laboratory in good faith, the lack of reliability regarding the laboratory work at Harvard means that we are now retracting this paper.""

It is critical to understand the differential experiences within minoritized communities to ensure effective intervention and vaccine rollout. Methods: In a national online survey of U.S. adult SGM individuals, conducted between April and August 2020, 932 participants responded about COVID-19 testing, symptoms, interest in vaccination, and interest in at-home testing. Bivariate associations between these outcomes and demographic factors, including sexual orientation, gender identity, endorsing intersex traits, gender modality, race/ethnicity, and HIV status were calculated. Results: Despite 24% of the sample reporting COVID-19 symptoms, testing was relatively low at 13.3%. Transgender and bisexual/pansexual individuals were more likely to be interested in a COVID-19 vaccine and an at-home test compared with cisgender and gay/lesbian respondents, respectively. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were nearly twice as likely to report COVID-19 symptoms. Latinx individuals were less likely to be interested in a future COVID-19 vaccination and Black individuals were less likely to be interested in an at-home COVID-19 test compared with White participants. Both respondents who endorsed intersex traits and people with HIV were less likely to be interested in an at-home test compared with those who did not endorse having intersex traits and people without HIV, respectively. Conclusions: These results show critical disparities in COVID-19 symptomology and prevention interest within SGM populations that must be taken into account when designing or tailoring effective COVID-19 interventions.","Phillips, Gregory; Xu, Jiayi; Ruprecht, Megan M; Costa, Diogo; Felt, Dylan; Wang, Xinzi; Glenn, Erik Elías; Beach, Lauren B",LGBT health,527,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC and subsequently underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation for recurrent HCC within the allograft between January 1st, 2000-September 1st, 2016. Eleven patients with hepatic allograft HCC underwent twelve percutaneous thermal ablation procedures to treat 16 lesions. Patient, procedural characteristics, and local oncologic efficacy were reviewed. Complications were characterized via the Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events nomenclature [CTCAE] v4.03). RESULTS Eleven transplant recipients underwent treatment of 16 HCC tumors in their allografts during 12 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up time was 25 months (range 2-96 months). Local oncologic control was achieved in 10 of 11 tumors (91%) with imaging follow-up. One patient (8%) with Roux-en-Y biliary reconstruction developed a major complication with hepatic abscess. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of recurrent HCC in transplanted allografts can be accomplished safely with acceptable rates of local control for patients with duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction. Due to the high number of patients deemed surgically unresectable, the morbidity of surgical resection, the side effects of targeted therapies, and significant mortality associated with recurrences in the transplanted allograft, patients may benefit from percutaneous thermal ablative treatments. Further study is needed to assess the role of thermal ablation in allograft HCC recurrences as primary therapy or in a multimodality approach with emerging systemic therapies.","Welch, Brian T; Schmitz, J J; Kurup, A N; Atwell, T D; Callstrom, M R; Frey, G; Paz-Fumagalli, R; Allen, A; Watt, K; Heimbach, J; Schmit, G D",Abdominal radiology,527,23

OBJECTIVES To trace the footsteps of COVID-19 in Iran by exploring the trend in using chest CT scans and its economic impact on radiology departments. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the number of imaging examinations from 33 tertiary radiology departments in 9 large cities of Iran was collected from September 23, 2019 to March 20, 2020 (Months 1 to 6) and the corresponding months in 2018-2019. RESULTS A 50.2% increase was noted in the chest CT scan utilization in 2019-2020 compared to 2018-2019. This increase was +15%, +15%, +27%, +2%, +1% in Months 1-5 of 2019-2020, respectively. In Month 6 of 2019-2020, a 251% increase in the acquisition of chest CT scans was observed compared to the Month 6 of 2018-2019. Following negative balance of revenue from Month 1 to 5 with respect to the inflation rate, the total income in Month 6 was further 1.5% less than the same Month in 2018-19. CONCLUSION The observed peak in chest CT utilization in Month 3 prior to the surge in Month 6 could be explained by the seasonal influenza. However, unawareness about an emerging viral disease, i.e. COVID-19, might have underutilized chest CT in Months 4 and 5 before the official announcement in Month 6. The unbalanced increase in the workload of radiology departments in the shortage of cardiothoracic radiologists with the simultaneous decrease in income initiated a vicious cycle that worsened the economic repercussions of the pandemic.","Radmard, Amir Reza; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali; Montazeri, Seyed Ali; Kasaeian, Amir; Nematollahy, Nemat; Molaee Langrudi, Roghieh; Javad Rashid, Reza; Dehghan, Alireza; Hekmatnia, Ali; Shakourirad, Ali; Pezeshki Rad, Masoud; Nafisi Moghadam, Reza; Sharifian, Hashem; Enhesari, Ahmad; Aalinezhad, Marzieh; Jamalipour Soufi, Ghazaleh; Shakibafard, Alireza; Mohammadzadeh, Maryam; Jalli, Reza; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Faghihi Langroudi, Taraneh; Raoufi, Masoomeh; Abrishami, Alireza; Dehghan, Pooneh; Bahrami-Motlagh, Hooman; Hashemi, Hassan; Sanei Taheri, Morteza",Archives of Iranian medicine,527,1

Our objectives were to evaluate the anatomy of the upper lip (maxillary) frenulum, to determine if the visual anatomy of the upper lip has an effect on breastfeeding, and to determine whether the occurrence of lip tie and tongue tie are correlated. METHODS A prospective cohort study of 100 healthy newborns was examined between day of life 3-7. Surveys were completed by the mother at the time of the initial exam and 2 weeks later. The maxillary frenulum was graded based on the Stanford and Kotlow classifications by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability and relationships between tongue tie, lip tie, and the infant breastfeeding assessment tool (IBFAT) were calculated. RESULTS Inter-rater reliability showed fair agreement (κ = 0.302) using the Kotlow scale and better agreement using the Stanford classification (κ = 0.458). There was no correlation between the upper lip tie classification and breastfeeding success score. Lastly, there was a modest inverse correlation in the degree of tethering for the tongue and lip. CONCLUSIONS There was no correlation between maxillary frenulum grade and comfort with breastfeeding, pain scores, or latch. There was also no relationship between tip to frenulum length (tongue tie) and visualized lip anatomy, suggesting that tongue tie and lip tie may not cluster together in infants.

Based on the data, influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells was analyzed and potential therapeutic compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 were screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS R package ""DESeq2"" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The ""ClusterProfiler"" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity. The CMap research found that there were three compounds with a median_tau_score less than -90, namely triptolide, tivozanib and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can cause abnormal changes in a large number of molecules and related signaling pathways in human cells, among which IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways may play a key role in pathogenic process of SARS-CoV-2. Here, three compounds that may be effective for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 were screened, which would provide new options for improving treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, W-Y; Fang, Z-X; Lv, X-D; Zhou, Q-H; Yao, M; Deng, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,527,1

Reporting of data on benefits and harms of treatments in surgical RCTs should support clinical decision-making. Correct and complete reporting of the outcomes of clinical trials is mandatory to appreciate available evidence and to inform patients properly before asking informed consent. METHODS RCTs published between January 2005 and January 2017 in 15 leading journals comparing a surgical treatment with any other treatment were reviewed systematically. The CONSORT checklist, including the extension for harms, was used to appraise the publications. Beneficial and harmful treatment outcomes, their definitions and their precision measures were extracted. RESULTS Of 1200 RCTs screened, 88 trials were included. For the differences in effect size of beneficial outcomes, 68 per cent of the trials reported a P value only but not a 95 per cent confidence interval. For harmful effects, this was 67 per cent. Only five of the 88 trials (6 per cent) reported a number needed to treat, and no study a number needed to harm. Only 61 per cent of the trials reported on both the beneficial and harmful outcomes of the intervention studied in the same paper. CONCLUSION Despite CONSORT guidelines, current reporting of benefits and harms in surgical trials does not facilitate clear communication of treatment outcomes with patients.

It consists of a robot with 6 degrees of freedom that is manipulated using an operation interface to perform needle insertions under CT-guidance. The procedure includes robot positioning, needle targeting, and needle insertion.

The few studies that have compared weight stigma across different countries focus on explicit weight-biased attitudes rather than people's experiences of weight stigma. The present study conducted a multinational systematic comparison of weight stigma in six countries to assess experiences and interpersonal sources of weight stigma. SUBJECTS/METHODS Adults (N = 13,996) enrolled in WW International (formerly Weight Watchers), residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US completed identical online anonymous surveys in the dominant language for their country. Surveys assessed their history of experiencing weight stigma, the onset of stigmatizing experiences and associated distress from stigma in different time periods, and interpersonal sources of weight stigma. RESULTS More than half of participants (55.6-61.3%) across countries reported experiencing weight stigma. Participants with higher BMI were significantly more likely to report weight-stigmatizing experiences than individuals with lower BMI. In all countries, weight stigma experiences were most frequent in childhood and adolescence, with associated distress highest during these time periods. Participants in Germany reported a higher frequency of weight stigma across their whole life, but lower distress associated with stigmatizing experiences, compared to participants in the other five countries. High percentages of participants in each country experienced weight stigma from family members (76.0-87.8%), classmates (72.0-80.9%), doctors (62.6-73.5%), co-workers (54.1-61.7%), and friends (48.8-66.2%). CONCLUSIONS Weight stigma is prevalent for adults actively engaged in weight management across different Western countries. There were more similarities than differences in the nature, frequency, and interpersonal sources of people's experiences of weight stigma across the six countries in this study. Findings underscore the need for multinational initiatives to address weight stigma and interventions to support individuals engaged in weight management who experience weight mistreatment.","Puhl, Rebecca M; Lessard, Leah M; Pearl, Rebecca L; Himmelstein, Mary S; Foster, Gary D",International journal of obesity,527,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Interfering with the expression level of ECT2 in human squamous cell carcinomas KYSE140 and EC9706 cell lines, the changes of KYSE140 and EC9706 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were measured using the CCK-8 method, transwell test, and scratch test, respectively. The effects of ECT2 on the Ras homolog gene family, member A-extracellular regulated protein kinases (RhoA-ERK) signaling pathway were also observed. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of EC9706 and KYSE140 cells after ECT2 knockout were significantly reduced (p <0.05). The knockdown of ECT2 expression in ESCC cell lines suppressed the activation of RhoA-ERK signaling pathway and protein expression of VEGF and MMP9. CONCLUSIONS ECT2 could regulated the expression of VEGF and MMP9 to inhibit cells proliferation, invasion, migration and tumor development through RhoA-ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, ECT2 could be an available marker, and provide a new theoretical basis for the treatment of ESCC.","Sun, B-Y; Wei, Q-Q; Liu, C-X; Zhang, L; Luo, G; Li, T; Lü, M-H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,527,1

However, its achievement is often hindered by a poor consideration of their needs by both literature and practice. The goal of this paper is to address the point of view of local retailers by exploring their needs about innovative LM delivery services and identifying sustainable value propositions (VP). A survey was submitted to retailers operating in the limited traffic zone of Torino (Italy). The survey data were analyzed by a factor analysis using a principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the factors. A correlation analysis was also conducted between the needs and selected contextual variables. The results show that retailers accept higher costs for more reliable deliveries and stock reduction. Retailers also correlate punctuality and flexibility because flexible and on-time deliveries allow for better inventory management, higher control, and, in turn, improved customer service level. This work is one of the first research attempts to quantify local retailers’ LM delivery needs and provides guidelines about how to design value-added logistics services. Moreover, from a practical point of view, the analysis shows the main VP that managers and practitioners should consider in the development of LM initiatives.","Mangano, Giulio Zenezini Giovanni",Sustainability,527,19

Expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is abnormal in many cancers. Nevertheless, system analysis of TMPRSS2-ERG (T2E) abnormalities in metastatic thyroid cancer remains to be elucidated. METHOD Using genomic and chromatin data, we demonstrate a unique cis-regulatory landscape between non-T2E and T2E-positive metastatic thyroid cancers, including clusters of regulatory elements (COREs). We attempt to describe the effect of T2E silencing on the cis-regulatory structure in metastatic thyroid cancers and its phase with the obvious phenotype characteristics of T2E-positive metastatic thyroid cancers. RESULTS These differences were linked by the ERG (erythroblast transformation-specific related gene) co-opts of FoxA1 and HOXB13, which realized T2E specific transcription profile. The study also demonstrated the T2E-specific CORE in an ERG site of structural rearrangement, which is due to the expansion of the T2E locus and contributes to its up-expression. Ultimately, we demonstrate that T2E-specific transcription profile is the basis of vulnerability of CBF-1/RBP-Jκ pathway. In fact, CBF-1/RBP-Jκ pathway inhibits the invasion and growth of T2E-positive thyroid tumors. CONCLUSION This study indicates that the overexpression of ERG co-option has a unique cis-regulatory structure in T2E positive thyroid tumors, which induces drug dependence on CBF-1/RBP-Jκ signal. Our study solved the genetic and epigenetic variation of T2E in metastatic thyroid cancer for the first time. It is worth noting that further functional and clinical validation is needed as our study is a bioinformatics analysis.","Hu, An; Cao, Fan-Fan; Lu, Dan; Yang, Li-Yun",American journal of translational research,527,1

CVN neutralizes virus infectivity by binding to specific high-mannose oligosaccharides on the viral haemagglutinin 1 (HA1) subunit. During virus adaptation to mice in the absence of CVN treatment the virus became resistant to CVN (CVN-MR virus), as did virus passaged in cell culture in the presence of CVN (CVN-R virus). The CVN-R virus possessed a single amino acid change at position 94a (Asn94aAsp) of HA1 that eliminated this glycosylation site. The CVN-MR virus at mouse passage 7 was a mixture of clones, consisting of a single mutation (Asp225Gly) and double mutations (Asn63Ser+Asp225Gly or Asn94a+Asp225Gly), eliminating glycosylation sites. CVN did not bind well to the CVN-R and CVN-MR viruses. Propagating these viruses in cells treated with 1 mM deoxymannojirimycin (dMJ, mannosidase inhibitor) increased sensitivity to CVN, suggesting that glycans attached at other sites on HA1 that typically are not high-mannosidic became so due to dMJ treatment. Further evaluation showed that the Asp225Gly mutant virus was sensitive to the inhibitor and did not kill mice or induce weight loss. The CVN-R virus was also avirulent to mice. The double-mutant CVN-MR viruses were resistant to CVN and caused deaths and severe weight loss in mice. CVN-R virus subjected to mouse adaptation acquired the 225 mutation and a lethal phenotype. Thus, the 225 mutation in the HA receptor-binding site in combination with a loss of glycan at Asn (63 or 94a) are important for mouse adaptation in this virus. The mutations reported here causing resistance to CVN are consistent with its known mode of action.","Smee, Donald F; Wandersee, Miles K; Checketts, Melissa B; O'Keefe, Barry R; Saucedo, Carrie; Boyd, Michael R; Mishin, Vasiliy P; Gubareva, Larisa V",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,527,16

POPF occurred in 21 patients (26.3%). The median change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation was 8.33 mm in the POPF-positive group, which was significantly larger than that in the POPF-negative group (3.79 mm, P <0.001). In addition, operation time, pancreatic texture, main pancreatic duct diameter, WBC count, C-reactive protein level, and drain amylase level demonstrated significant differences between the groups. In the multivariate analysis, operation time, C-reactive protein level on POD 3, drain amylase level on POD 1, and the change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation were independent risk factors of POPF. The drastic change in pancreatic thickness before and after operation predicted POPF in this study.

SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown infectious agent. METHODS Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. RESULTS A novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based random-amplification procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase. Infected patients showed seroconversion on the Vero cells in which the virus was isolated.

The role of analgesics derived from coal-tar in the spread of the pandemic is traced in terms of the introduction of phenacetin (PN) in 1887; its nephrotoxicity; the observation of lesions characteristic of the disease by Fischer and Alzheimer; the discovery of paracetamol (PA) as the major metabolite of PN; the linking of kidney injury and dementia with high PN usage; and the failure of PN replacement by PA to halt and reverse the exponential, inexorable rise in the incidence of Alzheimer-type dementia. Fischer observed his first case before Alzheimer; it is proposed to rename the syndrome Fischer-Alzheimer disease (F-AD). Disease development: PA-metabolising enzymes are localised in the synaptic areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus, where F-AD lesions arise. The initiating chemical lesions in liver poisoning comprise covalent binding of a highly reactive product of PA metabolism to proteins; similar events are believed to occur in brain, where alterations in the antigenic profiles of cerebral proteins activate the microglia. β-Amyloid forms, and, like PA itself, induces nitric oxide synthase. Peroxynitrite modifies cerebral proteins by nitrating tyrosine residues, further challenging the microglia and exacerbating the amyloid cascade. Spontaneous reinnervation, N-acetyl cysteine administration and tyrosine supplementation may attenuate the early stages of F-AD development. CONCLUSION F-AD is primarily a man-made condition with PA as its principal risk factor.","Jones, Günther Robert Norman",Inflammation & allergy drug targets,527,17

There are few data using psychiatric diagnostic criteria and a lack of large, well-designed epidemiologic research studies in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that can render definitive results on this topic. The prevalence of major depression or a defined psychiatric illness in ESRD patients is unknown, but is probably between 5% and 10%. The prevalence of increased levels of depressive affect is greater. Estimates of the prevalence will vary according to the screening techniques used. Depression could affect medical outcomes in ESRD patients through several mechanisms. Correlational analyses suggest stressors and protective factors play roles in mediating the level of depressive affect and associated outcomes. Although early studies suggested a deleterious effect of depression on survival in ESRD patients, more recent studies had failed to confirm such findings. The use of longitudinal analyses and larger samples has confirmed an association of depressive affect and morbidity and mortality in more contemporary ESRD populations. The importance of depressive affect compared with the presence of a defined psychiatric syndrome in mediating clinically important outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease has not been determined.

Silibinin, which is a natural extract from milk thistle, has shown anti-tumor effects against various tumors. Here, we investigate whether silibinin affects the function of RHBDD1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Methods: The Oncomine database and an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were used to determine the RHBDD1 expression levels in lung cancer tissues. The associations between RHBDD1 and overall survival rate or clinicopathological parameters were respectively assessed using the Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis or Chi-squared test. CCK-8 and Transwell assays were applied to analyze cell proliferation, migration and invasion. A549 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of silibinin. RHBDD1 knockdown and overexpression were achieved via transfection with si-RHBDD1 or RHBDD1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. Western blotting was performed to measure the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Results: We found that overexpression of RHBDD1 in lung cancer tissues correlates with a poor prognosis of survival. Clinical specimen analysis showed that upregulation of RHBDD1 correlates remarkably well with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Silibinin suppresses A549 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, RHBDD1 was downregulated in silibinin-treated A549 cells.

To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese-Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline. Methods: The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world. Results: We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients' disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases. Conclusion: To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines.

MethodsIgG neutralizing antibodies against the Trimeric complex (IgG-TrimericS) were measured at four time points: at baseline, at day 21 after vaccine dose-1, at one month and three months after dose-2. Nucleocapsid antibodies were assessed to detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Waist circumference was measured to determine abdominal obesity. ResultsBetween the first and third month after vaccine dose-2, the drop in IgG-TrimericS levels was more remarkable in individuals with AO compared to those without AO (2.44 fold [95%CI: 2.22-2.63] vs 1.82 fold [95%CI: 1.69-1.92], respectively, p<0.001).

We analysed the prevalence and prognostic utility of myocardial injury, characterized by elevated cardiac troponin, in a large population of COVID-19 patients, and further evaluated separately the role of troponin T and I. METHODS: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study enrolling patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 32 Spanish hospitals. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, as recommended by international guidelines. Thirty-day mortality was defined as endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 1280 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 187 (14.6%) died during the hospitalization. Using a nonspecific sex cut-off, elevated troponin levels were found in 344 patients (26.9%), increasing to 384 (30.0%) when a sex-specific cut-off was used. This prevalence was significantly higher (42.9% vs 21.9%; P < .001) in patients in whom troponin T was measured in comparison with troponin I. Sex-specific elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with 30-day mortality, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 3.00 for total population, 3.20 for cardiac troponin T and 3.69 for cardiac troponin I. CONCLUSION: In this multicentre study, myocardial injury was a common finding in COVID-19 patients. Its prevalence increased when a sex-specific cut-off and cardiac troponin T were used. Elevated troponin was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cardiac troponin assay and cut-offs to detect myocardial injury. Hence, the early measurement of cardiac troponin may be useful for risk stratification in COVID-19.","García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Morell-García, Daniel; Rodríguez-Fraga, Olaia; Morales-Indiano, Cristian; María Lourdes Padilla Jiménez, Ana; Gutiérrez Revilla, José Ignacio; Urrechaga, Eloísa; Álamo, José María; Hernando Holgado, Ana María; Lorenzo-Lozano, María Del Carmen; Sánchez Fdez-Pacheco, Silvia; de la Hera Cagigal, Patricia; Juncos Tobarra, María Ángeles; Vílchez, Juan A; Vírseda Chamorro, Isabel; Gutiérrez Garcia, Irene; Pastor Murcia, Yolanda; Sahuquillo Frías, Laura; Altimira Queral, Laura; Nuez-Zaragoza, Elisa; Adell Ruiz de León, Juan; Ruiz Ripa, Alicia; Salas Gómez-Pablos, Paloma; Cebreiros López, Iria; Fernández Uriarte, Amaia; Larruzea, Álex; López Yepes, María Luisa; Sancho-Rodríguez, Natalia; Zamorano Andrés, María Consuelo; Pedregosa Díaz, José; Acevedo Alcaraz, Cristina; Blázquez Manzanera, Alfonso-L; Pérez Sanmartín, Sonia; Baamonde Calzada, María Del Carmen; Vera, Marina; Valera Nuñez, Elena; Canalda Campás, Magdalena; García Muñoz, Sara; Bauça, Josep Miquel; Vicente Gutiérrez, Luis; Jiménez Añón, Laura; Pérez Martínez, Alfonso; Pons Castillo, Aurelio; González Tamayo, Ruth; Férriz Vivancos, Jorge; José Alcaide Martín, María; Ferrer Díaz de Brito Fernández, Vicente; Aguadero, Vicente; García Arévalo, María Gloria; Arnaldos Carrillo, María",Eur J Clin Invest,527,24

This study compares the FRENDTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo (NanoEntec) a point of care (POCT) assay with the automated Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescent assay (Roche Diagnostics).Methods: Serum samples (n = 81) from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at different time points after the onset of symptoms were analyzed with both assays. An additional 24 serum samples with cross reactivity potential were also included.Results: The sensitivity of the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay was higher as compared to the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, especially when using the combined IgM/IgG result in samples analyzed within 6 days after the onset of symptoms (46.2% vs. 15.4%). The sensitivity of both assays increased with increasing time interval after the onset of symptoms and reached 100% for the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay in samples taken 14 days or more after symptom onset. Specificity of the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo assay was 95.8% for IgM, 91.7% for IgG and 87.5% for the combination of both.Conclusion: This study shows that the sensitivity of both assays was highly dependent on the time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 symptoms and serum sampling. Furthermore, rapid serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by means of the FRENDTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM Duo POCT assay showed a comparable diagnostic performance as the reference automated immunoassay.","De Munck, Dorien G; Peeters, Bart; Huyghe, Evelyne; Goossens, Herman; Ieven, Margareta; Matheeussen, Veerle",Acta Clin Belg,527,20

Identification of prognostic markers is vital for predicting progression and clinical practice. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, known as RNAemia, has been detected in the blood. However, the potential clinical value of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia remains unknown. We, therefore, conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as well as summary strength of RNAemia in association with disease severity and unfavorable clinical outcomes. A total of 21 studies involving 2181 patients were included. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in COVID-19 patients varied from 9.4% to 74.1%, with a pooled estimate of 34% (95% confidene interval [CI]: 26%-43%). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was associated with COVID-19 severity with odds ratio (OR) of 5.43 (95% CI: 3.46-8.53). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was a significant risk factor for unfavorable clinical outcomes (OR = 6.54, 95% CI: 3.82-11.21). The summary OR was 4.28 (95% CI: 2.20-8.33) for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 11.07 (95% CI: 5.60-21.88) for mortality. Furthermore, RNAemia was also a significant risk factor for invasive mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is associated with disease severity, ICU admission, death in COVID-19, and may serve as a clinical predictor. More prospective trials in evaluating the potential of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia as a prognostic indicator are necessary.","Tang, Kefu; Wu, Lei; Luo, Ying; Gong, Bo",J Med Virol,527,10

The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular, more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the association between ABO blood groups and the presentation and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with mild-to-moderately severe COVID-19 infections who presented in the COVID-19 unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and were enrolled between 01 June and 25 August, 2020. Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. RESULTS: The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p < 0.001).

They also describe the safe donning and doffing procedures for this protective gear. Main text: Due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the CDC has recommended ways to conserve disposable N95 masks, including re-use and extended use, and reserving N95 masks for aerosol-generating procedures. However, these were never made to be re-used. Although the modes of transmission of COVID-19 are not fully understood, based on what we know about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), droplets and aerosolized droplets contribute to the spread of this virus. More evidence from Wuhan, China, has demonstrated that COVID-19 viral particles are aerosolized and found in higher concentrations in rooms where PPE is being removed. Thus, it is best for all healthcare providers to have full aerosol protection. Conclusion: Given the shortage of PPE for aerosols, it is logical to utilize reusable elastomeric respirators with filter efficiency of 95% or higher. A single elastomeric respirator may replace hundreds to thousands of new disposable N95 masks.","Chiang, James; Hanna, Andrew; Lebowitz, David; Ganti, Latha",Int. J. Emer. Med.,527,19

We aimed to evaluate factors associated with resumption of post-operative chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer undergoing explorative laparotomy for bowel obstruction. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2009 and 2013 at Herlev Hospital, Denmark. All patients with advanced cancer were identified from a local electronic database containing all emergency laparotomies. Adult patients with mechanical bowel obstruction were included if they had any kind of cancer and had been under active oncological treatment within the last eight weeks prior to surgery. Demographic, clinical, pre-, and post-operative data were collected and reviewed manually. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for resuming oncological treatment. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients admitted with bowel obstruction and undergoing oncological treatment within eight weeks before surgery were included. Post-operatively, cancer treatment was resumed in 58% of patients. An American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score less-than III (odds ratio = 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-54.6); p = 0.001) and a performance status less-than 3 (odds ratio = 9.7 (95% CI: 1.4-67.2); p = 0.021) were associated with resuming post-operative cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ASA score and performance status are associated with resumption of cancer treatment post-operatively and should be taken into consideration when considering the treatment strategy for patients with advanced cancer and malignant bowel obstruction.

It is known that environmental and psychosocial factors are of importance. Some receptors in the Transient Receptor Potential family elicit the same symptoms when stimulated, as reported by those suffering from building-related symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare capsaicin sensitivity between people with and without skin symptoms. A second aim was to investigate perceived stress among individuals with different levels of capsaicin sensitivity. METHODS: People referred to an occupational health care unit and judged to have building-related symptoms by a physician answered a questionnaire regarding their symptoms. Solutions with different capsaicin concentrations were applied to participants' nasolabial folds. Self-reported stress and burnout were assessed using two questionnaires: the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ). RESULTS: We found that people who reported facial erythema or itching, stinging, tight or burning facial skin were more sensitive than those without symptoms and similarities with Sensitive Skin are discussed. We also found that participants who reacted to the lowest capsaicin concentrations scored significantly higher on scales for stress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS: We found associations between sensitivity to capsaicin and skin symptoms among people with building-related symptoms, as well as associations between capsaicin sensitivity and perceived stress/burnout.","Glas, Bo; Claeson, Anna-Sara",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,527,16

Stress and anxiety are the most commonly reported symptoms, along with panic behavior, fear of public events and other less impacting psychological issues. During the pandemic most affected countries have implemented online mental health interventions to deal with social distancing and isolation. To this end, it appears necessary to manage long-term impacts of the pandemic on mental health through effective evidence-based therapies, easily administered online. In the present work, mind-body interventions are discussed as an effective tool to this purpose. Particular focus is paid on the link between mental processes and gene expression, through the application of valid new class of mind-body practices: Mind-Body Transformations Therapy (MBT-T) and Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience (CPGHE). MBIs have been proven to be effective tools particularly in stress reduction as well as overall well-being promotion, in addition, they are easy to learn and administer both face-to-face and online.","Celia, G.; Cozzolino, M.",European Journal of Molecular and Clinical Medicine,527,1

Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19.Patients and methods - We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO's web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be. A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice. Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks. Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available. Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.","Basso, Trude; Dale, Håvard; Langvatn, Håkon; Lønne, Greger; Skråmm, Inge; Westberg, Marianne; Wik, Tina S; Witsø, Eivind",Acta Orthop,527,12

Some health care workers transitioned to working from home while many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data was collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time (TST) shortened in those continuing to work in-person (p<.001), whereas TST was unchanged in those working from home (p=.73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced TST and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers' mood worsened regardless of whether work was in person or remote, though TST was shorter for those working in person. Those working from home perhaps shifted sleep time to be more in line with endogenous circadian phase. Peer or other support services may be indicated to address sleep, mood, and health behaviors among health care workers during these unprecedented times.","Conroy, Deirdre A; Hadler, Nicole L; Cho, Echelle; Moreira, Aliya; MacKenzie, Chamisa; Swanson, Leslie M; Burgess, Helen J; Arnedt, J Todd; Goldstein, Cathy A",J. clin. sleep med,527,1

The model can be used to conduct a what-if analysis and estimate infection cases under different policies. For proof-of-concept, the model is simulated for a hypothetical university of 25,000 students and 3,000 faculty/staff in a U.S. college town. Simulation results show that early outbreaks are very likely, and there is no silver bullet to avoid them. Instead, a combination of policies should be carefully implemented. The results suggest (almost) full remote university operations from the beginning of the semester. In a less-preferred alternative, if universities decide to have students attend in person, they should encourage remote operations for high-risk individuals, conduct frequent rapid tests, enforce mask use, communicate with students and employees about the risks, and promote social distancing. Universities should be willing to move to remote operations if cases rise. Under this scenario, and considering implementation challenges, many universities are still likely to experience an early outbreak, and the likelihood of having a case of death is worrisome. In the long run, students and faculty react to the risks, and even if universities decide to continue operations, classes are likely to have very low in-person attendance. Overall, our analysis depicts several sources of system complexities, negative unintended consequences of relying on a single policy, non-linear incremental effects, and positive synergies of implementing multiple policies. A simulation platform for a what-if analysis is offered so marginal effectiveness of different policies and different decision-making thresholds for closure can be tested for universities of varying populations.","Ghaffarzadegan, Navid",PLoS One,527,17

One of the most common symptoms caused by COVID-19 are lung problems like pneumonia, which can be detected using X-ray images. On the other hand, the popularity of Machine Learning models has grown exponentially in recent years and Deep Learning techniques have become the state-of-the-art for image classification tasks and is widely used in the healthcare sector nowadays as support for clinical decisions. This research aims to build a prediction model based on Machine Learning, including Deep Learning, techniques to predict the mortality risk of a particular patient given an X-ray and some basic demographic data. Keeping this in mind, this paper has three goals. First, we use Deep Learning models to predict the mortality risk of a patient based on this patient X-ray images. For this purpose, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks as well as Transfer Learning techniques to mitigate the effect of the reduced amount of COVID19 data available. Second, we propose to combine the prediction of this Convolutional Neural Network with other patient data, like gender and age, as input features of a final Machine Learning model, that will act as second and final layer. This second model layer will aim to improve the goodness of fit and prediction power of our first layer. Finally, and in accordance with the principle of reproducible research, the data used for the experiments is publicly available and we make the implementations developed easily accessible via public repositories. Experiments over a real dataset of COVID-19 patients yield high AUROC values and show our two-layer framework to obtain better results than a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving close to perfect classification.","Prada, J.; Gala, Y.; Sierra, A.

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. METHODS: All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. RESULTS: The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n = 227) accepted.

We aimed to evaluate the ability of CT-based radiomics nomogram in discriminating the severity of patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 150 patients (training cohort n = 105; test cohort n = 45) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were enrolled. Two feature selection methods, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), were used to extract features from CT images and construct model. A total of 30 radiomic features were finally retained. Rad-score was calculated by summing the selected features weighted by their coefficients. The radiomics nomogram incorporating clinical-radiological features was eventually constructed by multivariate regression analysis. Nomogram, calibration, and decision-curve analysis were all assessed. RESULTS: In both cohorts, 40 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were severe and 110 patients were non-severe. By combining the 30 radiomic features extracted from CT images, the radiomics signature showed high discrimination between severe and non-severe patients in the training set [Area Under the Curve (AUC), 0.857; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.775-0.918] and the test set (AUC, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.732-949). The final combined model that integrated age, comorbidity, CT scores, number of lesions, ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, and radiomics signature, improved the AUC to 0.952 in the training cohort and 0.98 in the test cohort. The nomogram based on the combined model similarly exhibited excellent discrimination performance in both training and test cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model based on a radiomics signature derived from CT images can be a reliable marker for discriminating the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Xie, Zongyu; Sun, Haitao; Wang, Jian; Xu, He; Li, Shuhua; Zhao, Cancan; Gao, Yuqing; Wang, Xiaolei; Zhao, Tongtong; Duan, Shaofeng; Hu, Chunhong; Ao, Weiqun",BMC Infect Dis,527,26

Although potentially providing an energetic benefit through reduced maintenance and thermal costs, little is known about the cascading effects that may alter energy expenditure during activity, dive responses, and overall energy budgets for these warm water species. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energy expended during resting and swimming in both species. We found the average resting metabolic rates (RMR) for both the adult monk seal (753.8±26.1 kJ·hr-1, mean±s.e.m) and manatees (887.7±19.5 kJ·hr-1) were lower than predicted for cold water marine mammal species of similar body mass. Despite these relatively low RMRs, both total cost per stroke and total cost of transport (COTTOT) during submerged swimming were similar to predictions for comparably sized marine mammals (adult monk seal: Cost per stroke=5.0±0.2 J·kg-1·stroke-1, COTTOT=1.7±0.1 J·kg-1·m-1; manatees: Cost per stroke=2.0±0.4 J·kg-1·stroke-11, COTTOT=0.87±0.17 J·kg-1·m-1). These lower maintenance costs result in less variability in adjustable metabolic costs that occur during submergence for warm water species. However, these reduced maintenance costs do not appear to confer an advantage in overall energetic costs during activity, potentially limiting the capacity of warm-water species to respond to anthropogenic or environmental threats that require increased energy expenditure.","John, Jason S; Thometz, Nicole M; Boerner, Katharine; Denum, Laura; Kendall, Traci L; Richter, Beau P; Gaspard, Joseph C; Williams, Terrie M",J. exp. biol,527,14

Their ages ranged from 35 to 63 years (M = 46.54; SD = 5.09). The variables assessed were anxiety, depression and stress (DASS), moods (MOOD), somatization (SCL) and resilience (CD-RISC). Descriptive analyses, t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and hierarchical regressions were performed. All this by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design. RESULTS: at the beginning of the confinement parents showed low levels of emotional distress and moderate levels of positive emotionality and resilience. However, those with a prior psychological problem, who had lost their job, or had lost someone to the pandemic, showed worse emotional adjustment. Resilience was relevant in predicting anxiety-depressive symptoms, and a low level of happiness was relevant in predicting stress. Emotional symptoms improved over time, and resilience remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: the emotional impact of COVID over time is influenced by mood, mental health, and resilience. In addition, parents who had a previous health problem, had lost their job or a loved one, had a worse adjustment. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: it is important to carry out intervention programs that increase resilience, treating parents who require it, since their emotional adjustment has repercussions on the emotional adjustment of family system.","Valero-Moreno, Selene; Lacomba-Trejo, Laura; Tamarit, Alicia; Pérez-Marín, Marián; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",J. pediatr. nurs,527,13

Data on the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. OBJECTIVE: To describe the mobility level of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and to address factors associated with mobility level at the time of ICU discharge. METHODS: Single center, retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 infection were analyzed. The mobility status was assessed by the Perme Score at admission and discharge from ICU with higher scores indicating higher mobility level. The Perme Mobility Index (PMI) was calculated [PMI = &#916;Perme Score (ICU discharge-ICU admission)/ICU length of stay]. Based on the PMI, patients were divided into two groups: ""Improved"" (PMI > 0) and ""Not improved"" (PMI &#8804; 0). RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were included in this analysis. The hospital mortality rate was 16.2%. The Perme Score improved significantly when comparing ICU discharge with ICU admission [20.0 (7-28) points versus 7.0 (0-16) points; P < 0.001]. A total of 88 patients (64.7%) improved their mobility level during ICU stay, and the median PMI of these patients was 1.5 (0.6-3.4). Patients in the improved group had a lower duration of mechanical ventilation [10 (5-14) days versus 15 (8-24) days; P = 0.021], lower hospital length of stay [25 (12-37) days versus 30 (11-48) days; P < 0.001], and lower ICU and hospital mortality rate. Independent predictors for mobility level were lower age, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, and not having received renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients' mobility level was low at ICU admission; however, most patients improved their mobility level during ICU stay. Risk factors associated with the mobility level were age, comorbidities, and use of renal replacement therapy.","Timenetsky, Karina Tavares; Serpa Neto, Ary; Lazarin, Ana Carolina; Pardini, Andreia; Moreira, Carla Regina Sousa; Corrêa, Thiago Domingos; Caserta Eid, Raquel Afonso; Nawa, Ricardo Kenji",PLoS One,527,30

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report describing the presence of PE in a patient with all three aforementioned infectious co-morbidities. Presentation: A patient living with HIV with virological failure secondary to defaulting antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with hypoxia, clinical and radiological features suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with raised inflammatory markers and D-dimer levels. Management: She was commenced on prophylactic anticoagulation, supplemental oxygen and empirical antibiotics targeting CAP and pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, swabbed for COVID-19 infection and had sputa sent for Gene Xpert® TB testing. A day later, COVID-19 results returned positive and the patient was transferred to isolation and added onto dexamethasone and therapeutic anticoagulation. Sputa returned positive for mycobacterium TB a day later, and anti-tuberculosis therapy was added. She remained persistently hypoxic, with a Well's score of 3 placing her at moderate risk for PE, which prompted for a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) being ordered, which demonstrated left lower lobe subsegmental PE. Warfarin was added to her regimen. She was discharged on day 18 with a therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) and not requiring oxygen therapy. Conclusion: This scenario is relevant in low to middle-income countries. The utilisation of a raised D-Dimer in the setting of all four coexisting conditions in arriving at a definite diagnosis remains uncertain. We noted that despite our index patient being on thromboprophylaxis, she developed PE highlighting the need for increased vigilance in all COVID-19 patients, even those on prophylactic anticoagulation.","Pillay, S.; Magula, N.",Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine,527,1

Here we report cryptic transmission associated with high DV viral load among vaccinated patients on an inpatient medical-surgical ward. MethodsThis observational study included all persons diagnosed with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) from March 11, 2021 to July 31, 2021, including those tested for surveillance, admission, symptoms, and as part of an outbreak investigation in July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Cepheid). Variants were identified by MassARRAY SARS-CoV-2 Variant Panel (36-plex PCR, Agena BioScience) for most breakthrough cases after June 2021 Viral genomic sequencing was performed by the Jackson Laboratory. ResultsAn inpatient was diagnosed with asymptomatic DV infection on routine pre-discharge testing. Contact tracing detected infection in 6 of 38 patients (15.8%), 1 of 168 staff (0.6%), and 1 of 6 visitors (16.7%). Infection at the time of diagnosis was asymptomatic in 4 proximate, vaccinated patients, 1 vaccinated visitor, and 1 vaccinated employee caring for 1 undiagnosed, infected, vaccinated patient. Patients were unmasked, whereas staff wore surgical masks. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) for breakthrough infections indicated more than 1000-fold higher viral load for DV (Ct:21.7{+/-}4.3; n=15) than for earlier variants (Ct: 31.8{+/-}10.9, n=12; p=.003 (t-test)). ConclusionThese findings demonstrate transmission of DV with high viral load between vaccinated inpatients, the continued efficacy of masking and vaccination for protecting healthcare personnel, and the potential need for post-admission surveillance to prevent cryptic DV transmission.","Linsenmeyer, Katherine; Gupta, Kalpana; Madjarov, Rebecca; Charness, Michael E.",,527,5

Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing.","Choi, Wongyeong; Shim, Eunha",J Theor Biol,527,10

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included 74 clinical studies that were identified after a thorough literature search across three databases. The prevalence of CLD patients (73 studies, 24,299 patients) was 3% among all COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of CLD patients was similar in COVID-19 positive and negative population (pooled OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.60, 1.05], p = 0.10).

The analysis of these factors is based on the results of a survey conducted among a group of 937 students at the Cracow University of Economics. The study takes into consideration the changes in the attitudes and behavior of students resulting from the introduction of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The switch to distance learning resulted in a significant increase in the number of responses related to feeling ill or sick due to inadequate temperature (from 24% before a lockdown to 32% after the introduction of a lockdown). Students experienced temporary surges in their overall living costs due to the pandemic, especially during the first wave. The respondents who experienced inappropriate temperatures (inadequate heating) due to excessive costs felt ill or became sick more often than others. The study demonstrated that those who pay more for energy (defined as a surplus payment in excess of 10%) tended to be, on average, less energy-aware than others. The following indicators of energy poverty among the students were distinguished: high living costs, small degree of influence over the choice of living quarters, as well as concerns over energy efficiency and environment. The conclusions drawn from the conducted studies may be utilized to design public policies aimed at curtailing the phenomenon of energy poverty among students.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire to elicit information on socio-economic and demographic characteristics, the types of stores visited to buy food, and FI screening. The FI experience was evaluated according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate or severe FI were investigated using the logistic regression model. SETTING: São Paulo city, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Totally, 909 householders. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the households included young women working as cleaners or kitchen assistants and in sales services. One-fifth of the participants were involved in the federal cash transfer programme, called Bolsa Família. There were 92 % households with children. The most frequent experience reported was uncertainty about food acquisition or receiving more (89 %), eating less than one should (64 %), not being able to eat healthy and nutritious food (46 %), and skipping a meal (39 %). Forty-seven per cent of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI. Factors associated with moderate and severe FI were low income, being a Bolsa Família recipient, having a low level of education and living in a household without children.

RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: carrying the burden; a time of stress; and embracing change and looking to the future. CONCLUSIONS: All mothers experienced increased burden and stress. However, some also described some positive impact of lockdown conditions on them as well as on their child's well-being and behaviour. These findings are discussed in the light of the (Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 33, 2020, 1523) survey results on parental coping and suggestions for future service provision during pandemic conditions are proposed.","Rogers, Gemma; Perez-Olivas, Gisela; Stenfert Kroese, Biza; Patel, Varsha; Murphy, Glynis; Rose, John; Cooper, Vivien; Langdon, Peter E; Hiles, Steve; Clifford, Clair; Willner, Paul","JARID, J. appl. res. intellect. disabil",527,16

Recently, many studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) that can distinguish the training members of the given model from the non-members. However, existing MIAs ignore the source of a training member, i.e., the information of which client owns the training member, while it is essential to explore source privacy in FL beyond membership privacy of examples from all clients. The leakage of source information can lead to severe privacy issues. For example, identification of the hospital contributing to the training of an FL model for COVID-19 pandemic can render the owner of a data record from this hospital more prone to discrimination if the hospital is in a high risk region. In this paper, we propose a new inference attack called source inference attack (SIA), which can derive an optimal estimation of the source of a training member. Specifically, we innovatively adopt the Bayesian perspective to demonstrate that an honest-but-curious server can launch an SIA to steal non-trivial source information of the training members without violating the FL protocol. The server leverages the prediction loss of local models on the training members to achieve the attack effectively and non-intrusively. We conduct extensive experiments on one synthetic and five real datasets to evaluate the key factors in an SIA, and the results show the efficacy of the proposed source inference attack.","Hu, Hongsheng; Salcic, Zoran; Sun, Lichao; Dobbie, Gillian; Zhang, Xuyun",,527,28

Unparalleled numbers of patients with AKI and shortage of dialysis machines and operative resources prompted consideration of expanded use of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) and evaluation of the safety and efficacy of bedside surgical placement of PD catheters. STUDY DESIGN: Bedside, open PD catheter insertions were performed in early April 2020, at a large academic center in New York City. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and AKI and ambulatory patients with chronic kidney disease and impending need for RRT were included. Detailed surgical technique is described. RESULTS: Fourteen catheters were placed at the bedside over 2 weeks, 11 in critically ill COVID-19 patients and three in ambulatory patients. Mean patient age was 61.9 years (43-83), and mean body mass index was 27.1 (20-37.6); four patients had prior abdominal surgery. All catheters were placed successfully without routine radiographic studies or intraoperative complications. One patient (7%) experienced primary nonfunction of the catheter requiring HD. One patient had limited intraperitoneal bleeding while anticoagulated, which was managed by mechanical compression of the abdominal wall and temporarily holding anticoagulation. All other catheters had an adequate function at 3-18 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside placement of PD catheters is safe and effective in ICU and outpatient clinic settings. Our surgical protocols allowed for optimization of critical hospital resources, minimization of hazardous exposure to healthcare providers and a broader application of urgent-start PD in selected patients. Long-term follow-up is warranted.","Vigiola Cruz, Mariana; Bellorin, Omar; Srivatana, Vesh; Afaneh, Cheguevara",World J Surg,527,28

To date, effective treatment remains elusive. Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ), well-known antimalarial drugs effective in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, and chronic Q fever, are currently under investigation. The United States Food and Drug Administration recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization for CQ and HCQ use in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With spikes in HCQ use and demand, ethical considerations encompassing appropriate use, patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice abound. As drug experts, pharmacists are uniquely positioned to advocate for patients with chronic conditions necessitating HCQ use, assist in the appropriate prescribing of HCQ for COVID-19, and ensure patients and health care professionals are continually educated during this public health crisis. This review highlights the worldwide pandemic, describes appropriate HCQ use for chronic conditions, highlights available alternatives, and deliberates evolving ethical questions. With assistance from colleagues, state boards of pharmacy, and national organizations, pharmacists ensure the just distribution of valuable pharmaceuticals to patients having COVID-19 while supporting the needs of patients requiring HCQ for chronic conditions.","Husayn, Sameeha S; Brown, Jeremy D; Presley, Colby L; Boghean, Kelsey; Waller, Jacquelyn D",J Pharm Pract,527,20

Through a process of expert consultation, we identified and categorised, into 19 themes and 70 sub-themes, the ways in which biodiversity and its conservation has been or could be impacted by the pandemic globally; nearly 60% of which were broadly negative in impact. Subsequently, we created a compendium (see Supporting Information) of all themes and sub-themes, each with explanatory text, and in August 2020 a diverse group of experienced conservationists with expertise from across sectors and geographies assessed each sub-theme for its likely impact on biodiversity conservation globally. The 9 sub-themes ranked highest were all negative in impact. These were, in rank order: governments side-lining the environment during their economic recovery, reduced wildlife-based tourism income, increased habitat destruction, reduced government funding, increased plastic and other solid waste pollution, weakening of pro-nature regulations and their enforcement, increased illegal harvest of wild animals, reduced philanthropy, and threats to survival of conservation organisations. In combination, these impacts present a worrying future of increased threats to biodiversity conservation but reduced capacity to counter them. The highest-ranking positive impact, at 10, was the beneficial impact of wildlife trade restrictions. More optimistically, amongst impacts ranked 11 to 20, 6 were positive and 4 were negative. We hope our assessment will draw attention to the impacts of the pandemic, improving the conservation community's ability to respond to them in the future.

We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. METHODS: An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18-24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. RESULTS: The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.","Jia, Ru; Ayling, Kieran; Chalder, Trudie; Massey, Adam; Broadbent, Elizabeth; Morling, Joanne R; Coupland, Carol; Vedhara, Kavita",Public Health,527,25

They are likely even more difficult to manage in at-risk conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is limited evidence about the particular needs and recommended treatment of adolescents with EDs during the COVID-19 outbreak, in particular regarding the use of telemedicine and the involvement of the family in long distance-treatment. AIMS: We sought to discuss the advantages and problems associated with the use of multi-professional long-distance telemedicine treatment in the management of adolescents with EDs and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We gathered data about the treatment of adolescents with EDs in our pediatric ED-treatment center in Israel during the COVID-19 outbreak in the first 10 months of 2020, and compared it to the respective period in the past five years (2015–2019). Second, we described the management of four young females with anorexia nervosa (AN), treated in the ambulatory, daycare and inpatient facilities of our center during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Slightly less patients were treated in our center during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the respective period in the past five years. These patients received at that time considerably more treatment sessions from all treatment providers (psychiatrists, clinical nutritionists and psychotherapists). This was related, in part, to the extensive use of telemedicine during that period (more than as third of all sessions were carried out with telemedicine in comparison to no use of long-distance treatment in the previous years). The condition of the four adolescents with AN was compromised at the start of the COVID-19 quarantine. The use of multi-disciplinary long-distance telemedicine treatment resulted in an improvement in the condition in three of the four adolescents, living in well-organized families, with the motivation and ability to adjust to the new conditions, but not in one adolescent whose family experienced more problems. These families might require the use of face-to-face interventions even during pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: The choice of the mode of treatment for adolescents with EDs during pandemic times (telemedicine vs. face-to-face) should consider the functioning of the family.","Yaffa, Serur; Adi, Enoch-Levy; Itai, Pessach; Marit, Joffe-Milstein; Doron, Gothelf; Daniel, Stein",J Eat Disord,527,1

However, perhaps because of inadequate tools for matrix exponentiation in programming languages commonly used amongst statisticians or a belief that the necessary calculations are prohibitively expensive, statistical inference for continuous-time Markov chains with a large but finite state space is typically conducted via particle MCMC or other relatively complex inference schemes. When, as in many applications [Formula: see text] arises from a reaction network, it is usually sparse. We describe variations on known algorithms which allow fast, robust and accurate evaluation of the product of a non-negative vector with the exponential of a large, sparse rate matrix.

Method Two hundred and eighty-nine nasopharyngeal (NP) suction specimens were collected from hospitalized paediatric patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand during February 2006–2007. Nucleic acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of VP4/2 by semi-nested RT-PCR for HRV detection. Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by PCR, RT-PCR or real time PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the VP4 region were used for genotyping and phylogenetic tree construction. Result In total, 87 of 289 specimens were positive for HRV indicating an annual prevalence of 30%. Wheezing or asthma exacerbation was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected patients. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens belonged to HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Most of the HRV positive samples were HRV-C (58%). Moreover, species C was predominantly found in the paediatric population of Thailand in raining season (p <0.05). The frequency of co-infection of HRV-C with other respiratory viral pathogens was approximately 40%. Conclusion HRV-C represents the predominant species and is one of the etiologic agents in acute lower respiratory tract infection, causes of wheezing and asthma exacerbation in infants and young children in Thailand.","Linsuwanon, Piyada; Payungporn, Sunchai; Samransamruajkit, Rujipat; Posuwan, Nawarat; Makkoch, Jarika; Theanboonlers, Apiradee; Poovorawan, Yong",Journal of Infection,527,16

This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.","Day, Michael J.",Parasit Vectors,527,9

We investigated the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms 5 months after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection compared with a control cohort. METHODS: One hundred and sixty‐four SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients and 183 controls responded to an online questionnaire about symptoms and signs during the acute phase of the infection and after 4.8 ± 0.3 months. Presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, anxiety, and depression were recorded with standardized questionnaires. Stool form and presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also recorded. Any association between exposure to infection and symptoms was evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted RR values and score differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). KEY RESULTS: Fever, dyspnea, loss of smell/taste/weight, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia were reported by more than 40% of patients during the acute phase. Compared with controls, adjusted RRs for loose stools, chronic fatigue, and somatization were increased after infection: 1.88 (95% CI 0.99–3.54), 2.24 (95% CI 1.48–3.37), and 3.62 (95% CI 1.01–6.23), respectively. Gastrointestinal sequelae were greater in patients with diarrhea during the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Mild gastroenterological symptoms persist 5 months after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, in particular in patients reporting diarrhea in the acute phase. Infected patients are at increased risk of chronic fatigue and somatoform disorders, thus supporting the hypothesis that both functional gastrointestinal and somatoform disorders may have a common biological origin.","Noviello, Daniele; Costantino, Andrea; Muscatello, Antonio; Bandera, Alessandra; Consonni, Dario; Vecchi, Maurizio; Basilisco, Guido",Neurogastroenterol Motil,527,24

Methods This is an observational study of 921 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection to Hospital General Universitario Ciudad Real from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Following data were collected including patient demographic information, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization and clinical outcomes. Results The mean age was 78years, and 59.2% of patients had a history of hypertension. Patients with previous treatment with RAS inhibitor (42.4%) showed lower risk of the primary composite endpoint (mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation). Treatment with RAS inhibitor (both outpatient treatment and during hospitalization) had neither effect on mortality nor need for invasive ventilation. There were no differences in time-to-event analysis between groups. Conclusions RAS inhibitor treatment prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection was associated with lower risk of the primary composite endpoint and did not show neither impact on mortality nor need for invasive mechanical ventilation, even if these drugs were prescribed during hospitalization.","Martínez-del Río, Jorge; Piqueras-Flores, Jesús; Nieto-Sandoval Martín de la Sierra, Patricia; Negreira-Caamaño, Martín; Águila-Gordo, Daniel; Mateo-Gómez, Cristina; Salas-Bravo, Daniel; Rodríguez-Martínez, Marta",Med Clin (Engl Ed),527,32

Such bacterial and fungal strains may be colonized in different tissues and organs, including the oral cavity. Whether infection with Covid-19 could increase colonization of different bacterial strains on removable dental prostheses is unclear. Purpose The purpose of this clinical study was to compare bacterial colonization on removable dental prostheses in patients with Covid-19. Material and methods Two sex- and age-matched groups of complete-denture wearing participants (N=60) with and without a positive diagnosis for Covid-19 were enrolled in the study. Swabs were used at 2 different time intervals to sample areas of the dentures, which were then cultured and the colony smears Gram stained. Statistical analysis was conducted by using the Mann U Whitney test (α=.05). Results Streptococcus species (93.3% versus 40.0%, P=.047) and Klebsiella pneumonia (46.7% versus 13.4%, P=.036) were detected more frequently in the Covid-19 positive group. Conclusions Higher rates of bacterial colonization, especially with Streptococcus species and Klebsiella pneumonia, were detected on removable dental prostheses after Covid-19 infection.","Karimzadeh, Fazel; Sajedi, Seyed Masoud; Taram, Saman; Karimzadeh, Fathemeh",J Prosthet Dent,527,22

This has not only facilitated community spread but has also resulted in an underestimation of the true incidence of disease, a statistic which is useful for policy making aimed at controlling the current pandemic and in preparing for future outbreaks. In this perspective, we present a crowdsourced platform developed by us for the true estimation of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community, through active self-reporting and layering other authentic datasets. The granularity of data captured by this system could prove to be useful in assisting governments to identify SARS-CoV-2 hotspots in the community facilitating lifting of restrictions in a controlled fashion.","Hegde, Ajay; Masthi, Ramesh; Krishnappa, Darshan",Front Public Health,527,1

At Department of Oral Surgery and Pathology—Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, regional reference center for Covid-19—two groups of patients were determined: patients with urgent conditions (group U) and patients in follow-up (group F). Both groups were instructed to implement remote consultations using a messaging service (WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Inc., Mountain View, California, USA) to send photos. A total of 418 photos were collected by 57 patients. Thirty-four photos were obtained by five patients in the U group after surgical procedures. All patients sent photos on the established evening, except for two patients who sent two photos outside the set days. In the F group, 384 photos were collected by 52 patients. None of them sent more photos than the number that was established by the protocol. Telemedicine allowed a monitoring of all patients, reducing costs and limiting human contact, decreasing the risk of Covid-19 dissemination.","Giudice, Amerigo; Barone, Selene; Muraca, Danila; Averta, Fiorella; Diodati, Federica; Antonelli, Alessandro; Fortunato, Leonzio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,527,1

During this period, the research on the relevant topics of COVID-19 and emotional expressions published on social media can provide decision support for the management and control of large-scale public health events. The research assisted the analysis of microblog text topics with the help of the LDA model, and obtained 8 topics (“origin”, “host”, “organization”, “quarantine measures”, “role models”, “education”, “economic”, “rumor”) and 28 interactive topics. Obtain data through crawler tools, with the help of big data technology, social media topics and emotional change characteristics are analyzed from spatiotemporal perspectives. The results show that: (1) “Double peaks” feature appears in the epidemic topic search curve. Weibo on the topic of the epidemic gradually reduced after January 24. However, the proportion of epidemic topic searches has gradually increased, and a “double peaks” phenomenon appeared within a week; (2) The topic changes with time and the fluctuation of the topic discussion rate gradually weakens. The number of texts on different topics and interactive topics changes with time. At the same time, the discussion rate of epidemic topics gradually weakens; (3) The political and economic center is an area where social media is highly concerned. The areas formed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei have published more microblog texts. The spatial division of the number of Weibo social media texts has a high correlation with the economic zone division; (4) The existence of the topic of “rumor” will enable people to have more communication and discussion. The interactive topics of “rumors” always have higher topic popularity and low emotion text expressions. Through the analysis of media information, it helps relevant decision makers to grasp social media topics from spatiotemporal characteristics, so that relevant departments can accurately grasp the public's subjective ideas and emotional expressions, and provide decision support for macro-control response strategies and measures and risk communication.","Zhu, Bangren; Zheng, Xinqi; Liu, Haiyan; Li, Jiayang; Wang, Peipei",Chaos Solitons Fractals,527,1

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R(t)) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R(t), assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.
