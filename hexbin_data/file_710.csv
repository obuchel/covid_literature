Respiratory tract injuries from inhalation injury and carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytokine storm syndrome. In the case of acute respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation accompanied by cytokine storm, mortality is high and immediate adequate treatment at the emergency department is very important. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a case of acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytokine storm followed by carbon monoxide poisoning in a 34-year-old Korean male patient who was in a house fire, and was successfully treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column at emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome with cytokine storm from inhalation injury and to promote a better prognosis, we suggest that early implication of extracorporeal membranous oxygenation along with direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column even at the emergency department should be considered.","Jang, Ji Hoon; Jang, Hang Jea; Kim, Hyun-Kuk; Park, Jin Han; Kim, Hyo-Jung; Jo, Kyeong Min; Heo, Woon; Kim, Se Hun; No, Tae-Hoon; Lee, Jae Ha",J Med Case Rep,710,16

METHODS: The clinical characteristics and microbiological results of 181 patients caused by CRO infection treated with polymyxin B in the First Affiliated Hospital from July 2018 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The bacterial clearance rate, clinical efficacy, adverse drug reactions and 28 days mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of 181 patients was 49.72%, the total bacterial clearance rate was 42.0%, and the 28 day all-cause mortality rate was 59.1%. The effective rate and bacterial clearance rate in the group of less than 24 h from the isolation of CRO to the use of polymyxin B were significantly higher than those in the group of more than 24 h. Logistics multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for effective treatment of CRO with polymyxin B were APACHEII score, duration of polymyxin B treatment, combination of polymyxin B and other antibiotics, and bacterial clearance. 17 cases (9.36%) of acute kidney injury were considered as polymyxin B nephrotoxicity and 4 cases (23.5%) recovered after polymyxin B withdrawal. After 14 days of polymyxin B use, 3 cases of polymyxin B resistance appeared, and there were 2 cases of polymyxin B resistance in the daily dose 1.5 mg/kg/day group. CONCLUSION: For CRO infection, the treatment of polymyxin B should be early, combined, optimal dose and duration of treatment, which can achieve better clinical efficacy and microbial reactions, and reduce the adverse reactions and drug resistance.","Xia, G.

The etiologic agent of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infects the intestinal epithelium, with viral RNA shed in the stool, and can induce GI symptoms similar to the human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). An international surveillance epidemiology study, SECURE-IBD, reported that the standardized mortality ratio trends higher in IBD patients (1.5–1.8) and that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy correlates with poor outcome. Together these data indicate patients with IBD may represent a particularly vulnerable population during this COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Published datasets GSE75214 and GSE16879 were downloaded and expression levels of select genes were querried using RStudio. Primary human ileal spheroids (enteroids), derived from healthy donors and patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), were grown on 2D transwells until confluent. Cells were then differentiated for 3d before infection with a modified vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~0.5. Healthy enteroids were treated with 10 ng/ml of human Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) for 24h before infection via the basolateral reservoir or 5-ASA 5h before infection via the apical reservoir. 24h after infection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence or RNA expression of select genes by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: VSV-SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect both healthy and CD enteroids as determined by co-staining of GFP, indicative of virus infection, and the viral receptor ACE2. However, levels of GFP fluorescence did not correlate with ACE2 expression in CD enteroids. A subset of CD enteroids exhibited enhanced protease expression (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, CTSL), each of which correlated with higher viral RNA levels (P=0.04, P=0.002, P=0.006, respectively). In Vero E6 cells, 5-ASA inhibited the replication of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Treating healthy enteroids with 5-ASA did not have any effect on viral proliferation, while TNF-α pretreatment reduced viral RNA. 5-ASA treatment caused a reduction of ACE2 and an increase in CTSL expression. CONCLUSIONS: Host proteases, particularly the lysosomal protease CTSL, contribute to the infection of CD enteroids and may represent novel therapeutic targets in patients with IBD and COVID-19. 5-ASA modulates the expression of several epithelial genes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet does not alter viral replication in healthy enteroids.

Unfortunately, contemporary textbooks in the field of international political economy (IPE) say little about this kind of “autarkic” thought. No survey of the history of autarkic thought exists even within specialist IPE literature or in the fields of intellectual history and the history of economic thought. Filling this gap in existing scholarship, this article highlights a rich history of autarkic thought that includes the ideas of famous thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Johann Fichte, Mohandas Gandhi, and John Maynard Keynes. Three core rationales for a high degree of national self-sufficiency have been advanced in the past: (1) insulation from foreign economic influence, (2) insulation from foreign political and/or cultural influence, and (3) the promotion of international peace. At the same time, considerable disagreements have existed among autarkists about some of these rationales and their relative importance, as well as about the precise meaning of national self-sufficiency. These disagreements stemmed not just from differences in their specific goals but also from the different conditions across time and space in which autarkic thought was developed. In addition to improving understanding of the autarkic ideological tradition, this article contributes to emerging scholarship attempting to overcome Western-centrism in IPE scholarship as well as literature exploring the new politics of de-globalization in the current era.","Helleiner, Eric",,710,15

This article argues that while patents can impose certain barriers to universal access to generic COVID-19 treatments, the TRIPs regime itself is an integral part of an equitable global solution to the pandemic. More specifically, it argues that article 31bis of the TRIPs, in allowing for a cooperation strategy predicated on complementary importing and exporting of vital COVID-19 generic treatments, is key for successful pandemic suppression. By providing a normative interpretative analysis of article 31bis in light of the ethical requirements of global justice, and by responding to possible objections to its core argument, this article substantiates the ideal of multilateral solidarity among nations. In times of crisis—not only a crisis of global public health, but also a crisis of multilateralism—this complementary cooperation strategy that article 31bis allows for shows a way forward in upholding the global common good that the international legal order seeks to safeguard.","De Campos-Rudinsky, Thana C",Int Aff,710,3

The aim of our study was to assess the admission rate for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) replacement procedures in Campania, the 3rd-most-populous region of Italy, during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS AND RESULTS : Data were sourced from 16 referral hospitals in Campania from 10 March to 4 May 2020 (lockdown period) and during the same period in 2019. We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients hospitalized for CIEDs replacement procedures during the two observational periods. The number and type of CIEDs replacement procedures among patients followed by remote monitoring (RM), the admission rate, and the type of hospital admission between the two observational periods were compared. In total, 270 consecutive patients were hospitalized for CIEDs replacement procedures over the two observation periods. Overall CIEDs replacement procedures showed a reduction rate of 41.2% during COVID-19 lockdown. Patients were equally distributed for sex (P = 0.581), and both age [median 76 years (IQR: 68–83) vs. 79 years (IQR: 68–83); P = 0.497]. Cardiac implantable electronic devices replacement procedures in patients followed by RM significantly increased (IR: +211%; P < 0.001), mainly driven by the remarkable increase rate trend of both PM (IR: +475%; P < 0.001) and implantable cardiac defibrillator replacement procedures (IR: +67%, P = 0.01), during COVID-19 lockdown compared with 2019 timeframe.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic aneurysm (AA) share commons risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. Cardiac assessment before aortic abdominal aneurysm (AAA) surgery is indicated for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). The usefulness of assessment of moderate/high-risk patients is still debated. PURPOSE: the purpose of our study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of dipyridamole stress echocardiography (DSE) for the detection of CAD in patients undergoing AAA surgery with high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: From 2017th to 2019th 120 patients underwent surgery for aortic aneurysm (71 endovascular technique and 49 with open laparotomy). Of these, 74 asymptomatic patients with high cardiovascular risk underwent a pre-surgical contrast-enhanced dipyridamole stress echo (0,84 mg/kg over 6 minutes – protocol with LVO with sulfur hexafluoride), to exclude the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia, Mean follow-up was 6-24 months. RESULTS: Mean age was 77 years +/- 6.6, with male gender prevalent (83%). No complication during DSE occurred; mean SCORE risk was 9.8% +/- 2.3%, with 63% patients with very high risk. Only 1 patient showed inducible ischemia during stress echocardiography, with evidence of significant LAD stenosis; no myocardial infarction was reported at follow-up, while 1 ischemic stroke and 1 unplanned revascularization occurred. 11% of patients died, of which 50% for Sars-Cov-2 disease and 12% due to post-surgery dissection while no cardiac deaths were found. CONCLUSIONS: dipyridamole stress echo is safe in patients with surgical-class abdominal aortic aneurism; in patients with high cardiovascular risk but no symptoms reversible ischemia is rare. DSE should not be routinely performed before high-risk surgery but only in patients with cardiac symptoms.","Binno, S; Moderato, L; Capelli, P; Piepoli, MF; Scabini, M; Mosso, F; Aschieri, D",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,710,3

INTRODUCTION: The epidemic of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus rapidly spread all over the world. World Health Organization called the condition as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has become a life-threatening public health emergency internationally. COVID-19 mostly presents by respiratory tract symptoms including fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The disease progression causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pathophisyology of cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 have not been well known yet. Myocardial dysfunction may occur in cytokine-originated immune reactions. Myocardial performance index (MPI) is a feasible parameter that reflects systolic and diastolic cardiac functions. PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the MPI in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The study consisted of 40 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had mild pneumonia and had not needed intensive care treatment. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination was performed in all patients at the acute stage of infection and after clinical recovery. The average time interval between the baseline and recovery echocardiography exam was about 28 ± 3,4 days. Blood samples were studied on day 0 and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Immunofluorescence assay was used for COVID-19 antibody titers. Respiratory secretions were sent for RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: The mean age was 54 ± 11 years ( male 26 (65% ) ). Statistically significant higher MPI (0.56 ± 0.09 versus 0.44 ± 0.07, p < 0.001), longer isovolumic relaxation time (112.3 ± 13.4 versus 91.8 ± 12.1ms, p < 0.001), longer deceleration time (182.1 ± 30.6 versus 161.5 ± 43.5ms, p = 0.003), shorter ejection time (279.6 ± 20.3 versus 298.8 ± 36.8ms, p < 0.001) and higher E/A ratio (1.53 ± 0.7 versus 1.22 ± 0.4, p < 0.001), were observed during acute period of infection compared to ones after clinical recovery. Compared with basal values, no significant change in left ventricular systolic ejection fraction was observed after clinical recovery (60.3± 3.2% versus 61.7 ± 2.4%, p > 0.05). Isovolumic contraction time was similar at acute infection and after clinical recovery ( 44.3 ± 7.8 versus 40.6 ± 9.7ms, p > 0.05) CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study suggests global reversible LV dysfunction in COVID-19 patients with preserved LV systolic function based on tissue Doppler derived MPI. This could be due to isolated subclinical diastolic dysfunction. To our knowledge, this study is the first echocardiographic follow-up study that evaluated the systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in COVID -19 patients. The underlying mechanism and its clinical significance can be established by further studies.","Kaya, H; Asoglu, R; Afsin, A; Tibilli, H; Kurt, E; Kafadar, S; Gulacti, U; Kafadar, H",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,710,3

INTRODUCTION: The paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) and Kawasaki disease (KD) have overlapping features. This study aimed to describe the strain segmental analysis among both entities. METHODS: Retrospective review of strain segmental analysis within 4 weeks of presentation of symptoms among children diagnosed with PIMS-TS between April and June 2020 and a historic cohort of typical KD from the Royal Brompton Hospital, London. RESULTS: We included 33 PIMS-TS patients (23 males, 69.7%) at a mean age of 8 ± 4,9 years old and 45 KD patients (31 males, 68,9%) at a mean age of 5,8 ± 4,5 years old. PIMS-TS patients were older at presentation (p = 0.038). Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal in both groups (63,3% vs 63,5%; p= 0,89), 4/33 PIMS-TS children (12,1%) had coronary arteries abnormalities (CAA), whereas 100% of KD cohort had CAA. Both groups had a normal global longitudinal strain (GLS),but in PIMS-TS it was significantly reduced compared to the KD group (-20% vs -22%; p = 0,008). Basal segments were the most affected in PIMS-TS with significant difference in the basal anterior and anterolateral strain compared to KD (respectively -18,2% vs -23,4%; p < 0,001 and - 16,7% vs -22,7%; p < 0,001). PIMS-TS had a greater anterior, anterolateral and posterior segments involvement with a significant reduction in the anterolateral mid-wall longitudinal strain (-18,3% vs -22%; p = 0,002). Apical segments were less involved, with significant difference only in the septal and inferior apical strain (respectively p = 0.001 and p = 0,032). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data showed that after 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, all PIMS-TS patients had a normal LVEF but they had a significant reduction in GLS and different segmental involvement compared to KD cohort. We hypothesize that these findings may be related to direct myocardial damage in PIMS-TS rather than caused by coronaries perfusion abnormalities.","Piccinelli, E; Herberg, J; Kang, H; Fraisse, A; Krupickova, S; Altamar, IB; Sabatino, J; Singh, Y; Bautista-Rodriguez, C; Di Salvo, G",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,710,15

Such mass monitoring may have the effect of containing and managing the pandemic, but it has brought about prevalent concerns of privacy. Undoubtedly, China is confronted with fulfilling the task of public health surveillance while, at the same time, protecting personal privacy. However, there are three factors that have caused these balancing efforts to falter. The first factor is the lack of strong and solid legal foundations to authorize and control the surveillance while giving sufficient support for personal privacy. The second factor is the huge social mobilization that entails the involvement of a large number of different entities and individuals in the mass surveillance, for whom the general principles of privacy protection proposed by public authorities and academia may not be well understood and/or may be difficult to follow in practice. The third factor is the collectivist thinking and obedience to, and in many cases reverence for, the authority that is deeply entrenched in Chinese culture and easily overwhelms the individualism-oriented modern privacy culture. To get rid of these handicaps in a short time and, hence, to strengthen privacy would be an extravagant hope.

BACKGROUND: Repeated echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is integral in management of intensive care units (ICU) patients. Machine learning (ML) can assist by integrating whole-cardiac cycle echo data derived from flow assessment and deformation imaging, and grouping patients on the basis of patterns of cardiac dysfunction and its evolution over time. Cardiac involvement has been suggested to be important in COVID-19 outcome and echo evaluation can inform on cardiac status. We use unsupervised ML to investigate and integrate longitudinal data from the COVID-HO study (NCT04371679) to determine the potential of tracking changes in cardiac function during ICU hospitalization. METHODS: In a single-centre, COVID-19 patients (n = 38) were prospectively followed with echocardiography as part of ICU management. The endpoint was defined as death or ICU discharge. LV myocardial deformation, as well as aortic, mitral and pulmonary artery blood-pool Doppler velocity profiles were used as input for ML. Clinical data was used to validate the ML derived phenotypes. Echo data from the initial and final echo examination were used to create an output space where participants were positioned based on cardiac function blinded to outcome status. Regression was used to estimate the echo and clinical characteristics of different regions in the space. Patient trajectories in the output space were investigated for each patient. RESULTS: Endpoint was not reached in 24% (n = 9) at the time of analysis. The cohort was 68% male, aged 65 ± 12 years, and with an ICU mortality 21% (n = 8). The median spent in ICU was 10 (IQR 7-18) days. The ML analysis demonstrated a heterogeneous output space (Fig 1A) we could define a gradual change in the shape of the pulmonary outflow velocity profile, from a normal towards pulmonary hypertension (Fig 1A, x axis). Jointly with differences in diastolic function (mitral inflow fusion and A wave accentuation) defined two regions: with signs of pulmonary hypertension (gray); and with normal pulmonary pressures but LV diastolic dysfunction (yellow). Investigation of patient trajectories (Fig 1B) demonstrated the feasibility of tracking changes during ICU hospitalization, showing a shift of a patient that died in the ICU, from initial diastolic dysfunction towards pulmonary hypertension (red), and a patient shifting from a region with normal diastolic function towards pulmonary hypertension, but with a positive outcome (blue). Echo data concurs with observed dynamics (Fig 1C and 1D). CONCLUSION: ML can integrate complex, whole-cardiac cycle echo data to group heterogeneous patients based on similarity of cardiac function. Patient trajectories across the output space demonstrate the feasibility of ML for echo data-based follow-up of patients during ICU hospitalization. Further echo and clinical data integration can improve characterisation of the output space regions and better define changes in cardiac function during hospitalization.","Marti Castellote, P; Loncaric, F; Nogueira, M; Sitges, M; Stessel, B; Dubois, J; Van Halem, K; Herbots, L; Bijnens, B",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,710,3

We presented the earlier stage of research in the flipped classroom, the subsequent trends, publications status based on source title, country and institution and examined citations pattern of the publication. We also discuss the themes based on the occurrences and terms of the keywords, title and abstract of the documents. This paper also predicts the future study in the flipped classroom using Lotka’s law. We found that the pattern distribution of the author’s contribution fits with the law. We conclude by suggesting a few potential research directions on the flipped classroom. Research on flipped classroom focuses on approaches, strategies and effectiveness perceived by practitioners and learners with relatively less attention on author’s contribution and the prediction on their future and sustainable contribution and networking in guaranteeing the survival and expansion of flipped classroom approach for the coming decades.","Kushairi, Norliza; Ahmi, Aidi",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),710,15

This study was an in-depth investigation of the impact of (round-trip) car share on ownership, including forgone or delayed purchasing across different car share systems. An online survey was conducted with car share members (n = 651) and non-members (n = 290) in Melbourne, Australia. All respondents had a shared car available within a 10-min walk of their home. The first part of the paper compared member and non-member householders (socio-demographically and geographically adjusted) and found that members owned significantly fewer cars than non-members. In the second part of the paper, a quasi-longitudinal comparison of car share members was conducted. One in three households reduced car ownership, and most reductions occurred in the year prior to joining car share. Fleet-based car share members reported a larger reduction in car ownership compared to peer-to-peer car share members. Residents of inner and middle suburbs of Melbourne reported similar ""net"" reductions in car ownership, the reasons differed. Residents in densely populated inner suburbs used car share to avoid or delay car ownership while middle suburb residents used car share to avoid purchasing a second car. Findings provide valuable insights for transport policy settings which have the potential to influence car share availability and thereby support broader policy objectives to reduce dependency on private car ownership and use.","Jain, Taru; Rose, Geoffrey; Johnson, Marilyn",Transportation (Amst),710,3

Therapeutics and vaccines are in rapid development; however, none of these therapeutics are considered as absolute cure, and the potential to mutate makes it necessary to find therapeutics that target a highly conserved regions of the viral structure. RESULTS: In this study, we characterized an essential but poorly understood coronavirus accessory X4 protein, a core and stable component of the SARS-CoV family. Sequence analysis shows a conserved ~ 90% identity between the SARS-CoV-2 and previously characterized X4 protein in the database. QMEAN Z score of the model protein shows a value of around 0.5, within the acceptable range 0–1. A MolProbity score of 2.96 was obtained for the model protein and indicates a good quality model. The model has Ramachandran values of φ = − 57(o) and ψ = − 47(o) for α-helices and values of φ = − 130(o) and ψ = + 140(o) for twisted sheets. CONCLUSIONS: The protein data obtained from this study provides robust information for further in vitro and in vivo experiment, targeted at devising therapeutics against the virus.

However, the majority of currently used apps in different universities around the world are limited in their features and not very popular among students who may suffer to get useful information using traditional guiding methods. However, the importance of these apps is constantly increasing, especially in times of crises like the COVID‐19 pandemic during which people were forced to work from home and the human interaction was reduced to its minimal degree. In this paper, we present a Student Interactive Assistant Android Application with Chatbot (SIAAA‐C), which is basically a personal electronic guide that is used by students to get various and effective academic services. The app has a number of useful features including a campus map, multiple types of notifications, and most important, an efficient built in chatbot that responds to both Arabic and English written queries and covers a wide range of academic topics ranging from basic to complex. Even more, SIAAA‐C was designed to have Arabic and English interfaces to be used in the University of Jordan (UoJ), which has one of the biggest campuses in the Arabic area with more than 40,000 local and foreign students. Moreover, SIAAA‐C was practically tested in a real‐life environment by a group of UoJ students who were selected from different faculties during the pandemic peak period and the feedbacks were very promising, based on the outcomes of an evaluation survey that was answered by 102 students after a 1‐month test period.","Sweidan, Saadeh Z.; Abu Laban, Sarah S.; Alnaimat, Njood A.; Darabkh, Khalid A.",,710,8

We previously conducted a randomized controlled trial (CCOG1101) to compare quality of life (QOL) and nutritional status between Roux-en-Y (RY) and aboral pouch (AP) reconstructions for up to 1 year after total gastrectomy. However, long-term outcomes after AP reconstruction remain unclear. METHODS A prospective multicenter observational study was conducted to compare QOL, body composition, and nutritional indicators between the RY and AP reconstructions at 5 years after surgery among patients who were enrolled in the CCOG1101 trial. QOL was assessed by the PGSAS-37 questionnaires as well as the EORTC QLQ-C30 and STO22. RESULTS Sixty patients (31 for RY and 29 for AP) were recruited for analysis. There were no significant differences in baseline and perioperative characteristics between the two groups. No significant differences were found in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status and functional scales. Regarding symptom scales in the QLQ-C30 and STO22, a more favorable score for the diarrhea scale was observed in the AP group. Diarrhea was also the only item in the PGSAS-37 questionnaires in which significant benefit of AP was observed. Body weight and lean body mass continued to decrease throughout the postoperative 5 years in both groups. None of the conventional nutritional indicators using the serum samples showed significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Long-term observation suggested little benefit of AP reconstruction after total gastrectomy other than in alleviating diarrhea.","Tanaka, Chie; Kanda, Mitsuro; Murotani, Kenta; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Cho, Haruhiko; Ito, Yuichi; Matsui, Takanori; Nakayama, Hiroshi; Yamada, Takanobu; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,710,16

However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100 000 inhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, P = 0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (P = 0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class ≥2 in 68% vs. 29%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","Fabris, Enrico; Bessi, Riccardo; De Bellis, Annamaria; Gregorio, Caterina; Peratoner, Alberto; Lardieri, Gerardina; Cominotto, Franco; Vitrella, Giancarlo; Rakar, Serana; Perkan, Andrea; Sinagra, Gianfranco",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,710,16

This is the first study that has used departmental h index-and e index-based matrices to assess the academic output of neuroendovascular, neurointerventional, and interventional radiology fellowship programs across the continental US. METHODS Fellowship program listings were identified from academic and organization websites. Details for 37 programs were available. Bibliometric data for these programs were gathered from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. Citations for each publication from the fellowship's parent department were screened, and the h and e indices were calculated from non-open-surgical, central nervous system vascular publications. Variables including ""high-productivity"" centers, fellowship-comprehensive stroke center affiliation, fellowship accreditation status, neuroendovascular h index, e index ( h index supplement), h10 index (publications during the last 10 years), and departmental faculty-based h indices were created and analyzed. RESULTS A positive correlation was seen between the neuroendovascular fellowship h index and corresponding h10 index (R = 0.885; p < 0.0001). The mean, median, and highest faculty-based h indices exhibited positive correlations with the neuroendovascular fellowship h index (R = 0.662, p < 0.0001; R = 0.617, p < 0.0001; and R = 0.649, p < 0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference (p = 0.824) in the median values for the fellowship h index based on comprehensive stroke center affiliation (30 of 37 programs had such affiliations) or accreditation (18 of 37 programs had accreditation) (p = 0.223). Based on the quartile analysis of the fellowship h index, 10 of 37 departments had an neuroendovascular h index of ≥ 54 (""high-productivity"" centers); these centers had significantly more faculty (p = 0.013) and a significantly higher mean faculty h index (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The departmental h index and analysis of its publication topics can be used to calculate the h index of an associated subspecialty. The analysis was focused on the neuroendovascular specialty, and this methodology can be extended to other neurosurgical subspecialties. Individual faculty research interest is directly reflected in the research productivity of a department. High-productivity centers had significantly more faculty with significantly higher individual h indices. The current systems for neuroendovascular fellowship program accreditation do not have a meaningful impact on academic productivity.","Sonig, Ashish; Shallwani, Hussain; Levy, Bennett R; Shakir, Hakeem J; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurosurgery,710,26

METHODS The clinical and laboratory characteristics of 215 cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in the First People's Hospital of Tianmen City from January 18 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including blood cell indexes, inflammatory indexes [C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT)], liver function, cardiac function, renal function, blood coagulation function, electrolyte, chest CT scan, and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid tests. The differences of above indexes in the two groups were compared and analyzed. In addition, 55 patients with other viral pneumonia were selected as the control group who admitted to the hospital from August 1 to November 30, 2019. The changes of laboratory indexes of COVID-19 group and control group were observed. RESULTS In the 215 patients, 206 patients survived and 9 patients died. The average age of survival group was significantly lower than that in the death group, and the average length of hospital stay was significantly longer than the death group. (1) Clinical features: the proportion of underlying diseases in the death group was significantly higher than that in the survival group, such as dyspnea, sore throat, shiver, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, renal disease, and surgical history. There were no significant differences in other symptoms, signs and underlying diseases between the two group.

(3) Laboratory test indicators in COVID-19 and control groups: in COVID-19 group, WBC, NEU, LYM, platelet count (PLT), coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW-CV), standard deviation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW-SD) and Cl- were significantly lower than those in control group, NLR, CRP, K+ and CO2 were significantly higher than those in control group. CONCLUSIONS The major early symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, chest tightness and fatigue. Age and underlying disease may be the risk factors which affect the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The laboratory indexes such as WBC, NEU, LYM, CRP, PCT, LDH and Cr between death group and survival group were significantly abnormal in the early stages of COVID-19, which would have important implications for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, laboratory test indexes, including WBC, NEU, LYM, PLT, RDW-CV, RDW-SD, CRP, Cl-, K+ and CO2, also have important value in the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia.","Zhu, Mingchao; Zhu, Ya; Guo, Feibo; Zhang, Jue; Liu, Weiping; Hou, Wei",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,710,19

To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals from four different communities to estimate cumulative incidence of infection. Our results showed that 1,332 individuals (3.77%) showed positive COVID-19 antibody (either IgM or IgG). Males had a lower positivity rate than females (3.02% versus 4.52%). The antibody positivity rates showed a clear trend of increase according to patients' ages and varied among different communities. The results indicate that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Afterwards, a number of public health interventions were implemented, including lock-down, face mask ordinances, and social distancing. Studies that rely on viral RNA testing of symptomatic patients have shown that these multifaceted interventions contributed to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and delayed the epidemic's progression.

The burden is highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is need for respectful and supportive care for women, partners, and families after bereavement. OBJECTIVE To perform a qualitative meta-summary of parents' and healthcare professionals' experiences of care after stillbirth in LMICs. SEARCH STRATEGY Search terms were formulated by identifying all synonyms, thesaurus terms, and variations for stillbirth. Databases searched were AMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, BNI, CINAHL. SELECTION CRITERIA Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies that addressed parents' or healthcare professionals' experience of care after stillbirth in LMICs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Studies were screened, and data extracted in duplicate. Data were analysed using the Sandelowski meta-summary technique that calculates frequency and intensity effect sizes (FES/IES). MAIN RESULTS In all, 118 full texts were screened, and 34 studies from 17 countries were included. FES range was 15-68%. Most studies had IES 1.5-4.5. Women experience a broad range of manifestations of grief following stillbirth, which may not be recognised by healthcare workers or in their communities. Lack of recognition exacerbates negative experiences of stigmatisation, blame, devaluation, and loss of social status. Adequately developed health systems, with trained and supported staff, are best equipped to provide the support and information that women want after stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS Basic interventions could have an immediate impact on the experiences of women and their families after stillbirth. Examples include public education to reduce stigma, promoting the respectful maternity care agenda, and investigating stillbirth appropriately.

We investigated whether closure is superior to medical therapy. METHODS We performed a multicenter, superiority trial in 29 centers in Europe, Canada, Brazil, and Australia in which the assessors of end points were unaware of the study-group assignments. Patients with a patent foramen ovale and ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a peripheral thromboembolic event were randomly assigned to undergo closure of the patent foramen ovale with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder or to receive medical therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal stroke, TIA, or peripheral embolism. Analysis was performed on data for the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS The mean duration of follow-up was 4.1 years in the closure group and 4.0 years in the medical-therapy group. The primary end point occurred in 7 of the 204 patients (3.4%) in the closure group and in 11 of the 210 patients (5.2%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio for closure vs. medical therapy, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 1.62; P=0.34).

The lack of a cell culture has significantly hampered the development of effective therapies against human NoV. Clinically approved nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogues have been used successfully against RNA viruses. METHODS In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of four nucleoside analogues (2'-C-MeC, 2'-F-2'-C-MeC, β-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine [NHC] and lamivudine) on Norwalk virus (NV) RNA levels and protein expression in NV replicon-harbouring cells (HG23 cells), and their efficacy in blocking murine norovirus (MNV) replication in RAW 264.7 cells. RESULTS 2'-C-MeC and 2'-F-2'-C-MeC reduced MNV RNA levels and infectivity in RAW 264.7 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The median effective concentrations (EC(50)) of 2'-C-MeC and 2'-F-2'-C-MeC were 6.9 μM and 12.7 μM, respectively. 2'-C-MeC, 2'-F-2'-C-MeC and NHC reduced NV RNA levels and protein expression in HG23 cells. For the NV replicon, the EC(50) of 2'-C-MeC (1.3 μM) was comparable to the antiviral activity of NHC (1.5 μM) and twofold more potent than 2'-F-2'-C-MeC (3.2 μM). The combination of 2'-C-MeC/ribavirin resulted in modest synergistic activity, whereas NHC/ribavirin was antagonistic for NV replication in HG23 cells. CONCLUSIONS The antiviral activity of 2'-C-MeC against strains of two different NoV genogroups and the low EC(50) suggest that this nucleoside analogue may be effective against the more prevalent GII NoVs. In the absence of a vaccine, antiviral agents could be an effective intervention to control the spread of human NoV in populations at a high risk for NoV disease.","Costantini, Verónica P; Whitaker, Tony; Barclay, Leslie; Lee, David; McBrayer, Tamara R; Schinazi, Raymond F; Vinjé, Jan",Antiviral therapy,710,1

In August 2019, the Norwegian Red Cross commissioned a global report to conceptualise and assess what 'health in the last mile' refers to, in terms of access, needs and structural and geographical barriers and vulnerabilities, and describe how these vulnerabilities overlap in different humanitarian settings and regions. AIMS The purpose of this commentary article is to highlight the report's most important findings for an academic audience, from the perspective of the Norwegian Red Cross. DISCUSSION The aim of the report was to propose a definition and create a methodology to help identify people and populations living in the last mile of healthcare; acknowledging that these go far beyond those affected by armed conflicts and sudden onset disasters. As the report reveals, last-mile populations are not adequately reached by current universal health coverage strategies. The report highlights the key role played by local humanitarian actors in reducing barriers to access to healthcare. Local stakeholders have first-hand knowledge of the needs of populations in the last mile and on how they navigate the barriers to healthcare access. The report also addresses questions such as: Who are the people with least access to healthcare? What are their health needs and what barriers do they face? Not least, when many live without access to healthcare services, how do we determine where the last mile begins? The report proposes a definition of 'the last mile' involving converging factors that exacerbate barriers to healthcare and identifies 18 groups that are considered potential last-mile populations. Global epidemics, such as the latest COVID-19, have shown that the concept of vulnerability is continually changing. These situations can bring new vulnerable populations to the edge of the last mile which were already vulnerable and ignored before the outset of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS Millions of people do not and will not benefit from the global progress in universal health coverage under current health systems. To reach the Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 16, we need solutions to overcome the barriers they face to access basic healthcare.","Tønnessen-Krokan, Morten; Bringedal Houge, Anette",Scandinavian journal of public health,710,30

Objective To assess whether retinal layer volumes are correlated with immune cell subsets and immunoglobulin indices in the cerebrospinal fluid and whether retinal layer volumes alone or in combination with intrathecal variables are associated with worsening of disease in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational cohort study included 312 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in 2 independent cohorts (72 patients with short disease duration [cohort 1] and 240 patients with longer disease duration [cohort 2]) treated at a single German university hospital from April 15, 2013, through November 11, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures The common ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) volumes were tested for association with the immunoglobulin indices and the frequencies of immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (including B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells) (cohort 1). Volumes of GCIPL alone (cohorts 1 and 2) or GCIPL corrected for intrathecal B-cell frequencies (cohort 1) were tested for their association with worsening disability. Results A total of 312 patients (212 women [67.9%] and 100 men [32.1%]; median age, 34.0 years [interquartile range (IQR), 28.0-42.0 years]) were available for analysis. In cohort 1 (50 women [69.4%] and 22 men [30.6%]; median age, 31.0 years [IQR, 26.3-38.3 years]), with short disease durations (median, 1.0 months [IQR, 1.0-2.0 months]), low GCIPL volumes were associated with increased intrathecal B-cell frequencies (median, 1.96% [IQR, 1.45%-4.20%]) and intrathecal IgG synthesis (median cerebrospinal fluid/serum IgG index, 0.78 [IQR, 0.53-1.07]). The INL volumes correlated with the frequencies of intrathecal CD56bright natural killer cells (r = 0.28; P = .007). Individuals with low GCIPL volumes (<1.99 mm3) had a 6.4-fold risk for worsening disability during follow-up compared with patients with higher GCIPL values (95% CI, 1.7-24.2; P = .007). This finding was reproduced in cohort 2 (162 women [67.5%] and 78 men [32.5%]; median age, 34.0 years [IQR, 29.0-42.0 years]) consisting of patients with longer disease durations (median, 36.0 months [IQR, 21.0-60.0 months]) (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8; P = .02). In both cohorts, INL volumes correlated with the prospective increase in T2 lesion load and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Conclusions and Relevance Retinal layers reflect different aspects of disease activity during MS. Loss of GCIPL is associated with intrathecal B-cell immunity and constitutes an independent risk factor for worsening disability, whereas high INL volumes are associated with activity on magnetic resonance imaging in the brain parenchyma. Thus, retinal optical coherence tomography might be a means to support stratification of patients with MS for different therapeutic regimens.","Knier, Benjamin; Leppenetier, Gildas; Wetzlmair, Carmen; Aly, Lilian; Hoshi, Muna-Miriam; Pernpeintner, Verena; Biberacher, Viola; Berthele, Achim; Mühlau, Mark; Zimmer, Claus; Hemmer, Bernhard; Korn, Thomas",JAMA neurology,710,31

Still, a significant number of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) management because of life-threatening complications. Literature from the 1990s reported extremely poor prognosis for critically ill allo-HSCT patients requiring ICU management. Recent data justify the use of ICU resources in hematologic patients. Yet, allo-HSCT remains an independent variable associated with mortality. However, outcomes in allo-HSCT patients have improved over time and many classic determinants of mortality have become irrelevant. The main actual prognostic factors are the need for mechanical ventilation, the presence of GvHD and the number of organ failures at ICU admission. Recently, the development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, early ICU admission and the increased use of noninvasive ventilation, combined with time effect and general advances in hematology, in allo-HSCT procedures and in ICU management have contributed to improve general outcome. A rational policy of ICU admission triage in these patients is very hard to define, as each decision for ICU admission is a case-by-case decision at patient bedside.

Preclinical studies suggest that passive immunotherapy could be a new form of treatment for H5N1 virus infection. Here, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza A/chicken/Hatay/2004 H5N1 virus, MAb 9F4, was generated and characterized. MAb 9F4 binds both the denatured and native forms of HA. It was shown to recognize the HA proteins of three heterologous strains of H5N1 viruses belonging to clades 1, 2.1, and 2.2, respectively. By use of lentiviral pseudotyped particles carrying HA on the surface, MAb 9F4 was shown to effectively neutralize the homologous strain, Hatay04, and another clade 1 strain, VN04, at a neutralization titer of 8 ng/ml. Furthermore, MAb 9F4 also neutralized two clade 2 viruses at a neutralizing titer of 40 ng/ml. The broad cross-neutralizing activity of MAb 9F4 was confirmed by its ability to neutralize live H5N1 viruses of clade 2.2.2. Epitope-mapping analysis revealed that MAb 9F4 binds a previously uncharacterized epitope below the globular head of the HA1 subunit. Consistently, this epitope is well conserved among the different clades of H5N1 viruses. MAb 9F4 does not block the interaction between HA and its receptor but prevents the pH-mediated conformational change of HA. MAb 9F4 was also found to be protective, both prophylactically and therapeutically, against a lethal viral challenge of mice. Taken together, our results showed that MAb 9F4 is a neutralizing MAb that binds a novel and well-conserved epitope in the HA1 subunit of H5N1 viruses.","Oh, Hsueh-Ling Janice; Akerström, Sara; Shen, Shuo; Bereczky, Sándor; Karlberg, Helen; Klingström, Jonas; Lal, Sunil K; Mirazimi, Ali; Tan, Yee-Joo",Journal of virology,710,31

Early prediction for optimal treatment results has received growing attention, but there is presently a lack of evidence regarding what information such proactive management should be based on. This study protocol, therefore, presents our planned systematic review and meta-analysis on important predictive factors for health and work-related outcomes following multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS We aim to perform a synthesis of the available evidence together with a meta-analysis of published peer-reviewed original research that includes predictive factors preceding MDR. Included are prospective studies of adults with benign, chronic (> 3 months) musculoskeletal pain diagnoses who have taken part in MDR. In the studies, associations between personal and rehabilitation-based factors and the outcomes of interest are reported. Outcome domains are pain, physical functioning including health-related quality of life, and work ability with follow-ups of 6 months or more. We will use a broad, explorative approach to any presented predictive factors (demographic, symptoms-related, physical, psychosocial, work-related, and MDR-related) and these will be analyzed through (a) narrative synthesis for each outcome domain and (b) if sufficient studies are available, a quantitative synthesis in which variance-weighted pooled proportions will be computed using a random effects model for each outcome domain. The strength of the evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. DISCUSSION The strength of this systematic review is that it aims for a meta-analysis of prospective cohort or randomized controlled studies by performing an extensive search of multiple databases, using an explorative study approach to predictive factors, rather than building on single predictor impact on the outcome or on predefined hypotheses. In this way, an overview of factors central to MDR outcome can be made and will help strengthen the evidence base and inform a wide readership including health care practitioners and policymakers.

The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), Okinawa diet (OkD) and Nordic diet, derived from very different regions of the world and culinary traditions, have a large whole plant food component and are associated with reduced disease risk. This review focuses on polyphenol : microbiome interactions as one possible common mechanistic driver linking the protective effects whole plant foods against metabolic disease across healthy dietary patterns irrespective of geography. RECENT FINDINGS Although mechanistic evidence in humans is still scarce, animal studies suggest that polyphenol or polyphenol rich foods induce changes within the gut microbiota and its metabolic output of trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and small phenolic acids. These cross-kingdom signaling molecules regulate mammalian lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation and energy storage or thermogenesis, physiological processes determining obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. However, it appears that where in the intestine metabolites are produced, the microbiota communities involved, and interactions between the metabolites themselves, can all influence physiological responses, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the kinetics and site of production of microbial metabolites within the gut. SUMMARY Interactions between polyphenols and metabolites produced by the gut microbiota are emerging as a possible unifying protective mechanism underpinning diverse healthy dietary patterns signaling across culinary traditions, across geography and across domains of life.","Diotallevi, Camilla; Fava, Francesca; Gobbetti, Marco; Tuohy, Kieran",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,710,17

Although we found a high signal in the vagina on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the final diagnosis, vaginal lymphatic leakage, was established on lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphatic leakage in the vagina on lymphoscintigraphy was the key imaging feature of chylous vaginal discharge in this patient. Moreover, diffuse radioactivity was found in the abdomen and thorax on lymphoscintigraphy, which indicated the multiple cystic lymphatic malformations and intestinal lymphangiectasia combined with T2-weighted MRI.

Their narrow therapeutic index and metabolism through cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzymes can result in a drug interaction when used concomitantly with rifamycins. In clinical scenarios where concurrent therapy with an opioid and a rifamycin occurs, there is no standardized guidance for managing the interaction. OBJECTIVE To examine literature which evaluates the concomitant use of opioids and rifamycins with clinically-relevant CYP-inducing properties METHODS: A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria was performed. PubMed, Scopus, and OVID Embase were queried for studies from database inception to January 2020 related to rifamycin and opioid medications. Only full-text, peer-reviewed, English language articles addressing clinical outcomes from concomitant rifamycin and opioid therapy were included. RESULTS The review isolated 12 articles for data extraction from an original 2,260 citations identified. Rifampin (11; 92%) and rifabutin (2; 17%) were the rifamycins studied along with seven different opioids. Decreased effect of opioids with concomitant rifampin therapy manifested as withdrawal in numerous patients on methadone and a decreased analgesic effect from tramadol, morphine, and, most notably, oxycodone. Only the combinations of rifampin with buccal fentanyl and rifabutin with buprenorphine and methadone were found to have no clinically measurable interaction. CONCLUSIONS Available literature suggests that a decrease in opioid clinical effects are appreciated with concomitant rifamycin therapy. Further research is needed to focus on specific mitigation strategies beyond opioid agent selection, such as dosing adjustment recommendations.","Kinney, Eric M; Vijapurapu, Sandhya; Covvey, Jordan R; Nemecek, Branden D",Pharmacotherapy,710,1

OBJECTIVE In this paper, we have summarised the process of conducting SRs for underpinning clinical practice guidelines under the auspices of the European Association of Urology Guidelines Office. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The process involves explicit methods and the findings should be reproducible. When conducting a SR, the essential first step is to formulate a clear and answerable research question. An extensive literature search lays the foundation for evidence synthesis. Data are extracted independently by two reviewers and any disagreements are resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In SRs, data for particular outcomes in individual randomised controlled trials may be combined statistically in a meta-analysis to increase power when the studies are similar enough. Biases in studies included in a SR/MA can lead to either an over estimation or an under estimation of true intervention effect size, resulting in heterogeneity in outcome between studies. A number of different tools are available such as Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool for randomised controlled trials. In circumstances where there is too much heterogeneity, or when a review has included nonrandomised comparative studies, it is more appropriate to conduct a narrative synthesis. The GRADE tool for assessing quality of evidence strives to be a structured and transparent system, which can be applied to all evidence, regardless of quality. A SR not only identifies, evaluates, and summarises the best available evidence, but also the gaps to be targeted by future studies. CONCLUSIONS SRs and MAs are integral in developing sound clinical practice guidelines and recommendations. PATIENT SUMMARY Clinical practice guidelines should be evidence based, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential in their production. We have discussed the key steps of conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this paper.","Knoll, Thomas; Omar, Muhammad Imran; Maclennan, Steven; Hernández, Virginia; Canfield, Steven; Yuan, Yuhong; Bruins, Max; Marconi, Lorenzo; Van Poppel, Hein; N'Dow, James; Sylvester, Richard",European urology,710,27

Among these changes, asplenism or hyposplenism has been reported in patients with celiac disease. It has been reported that the risk of pneumococcal sepsis is higher in celiac patients with hyposplenism. Moreover, celiac patients present high risk of admission to hospital due to influenza. OBJECTIVE To determine the degree of awareness of COVID-19 among parents of children with celiac disease and examine the measures that they take. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study at a university hospital in the Middle Anatolian region of Turkey. METHODS The diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed through a survey conducted online among 73 parents between May and July 2020. RESULTS The mean age was 37.57 ± 6.56 years for the mothers, 41.15 ± 5.56 years for the fathers and 11.36 ± 4.36 years for the children. 90.4% of the parents reported that COVID-19 was transmitted through ""speaking, coughing, sneezing and infection of the face after contact with virus-infected surfaces"". Moreover, 78.1% indicated that they did not have any difficulty in finding gluten-free foods. CONCLUSION These parents of children with celiac disease believed that their children's risk of developing COVID-19 did not differ from that of healthy children. It was also observed that appetite and states of nervousness were higher among these children with celiac disease during lockdowns and that their sleep patterns were affected.","Bükülmez, Ayşegül; Baş, Melike Taşdelen; Çiftci, Esra",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,710,5

Although only 3 of the 20 NTDs are endemic in Canada (i.e., echinococcosis, rabies, and scabies), the Canadian research community has contributed to advancing the knowledge base of all 20 NTDs. Previous research comprehensively detailed Canadian research on 11 NTDs between 1950 and 2010 using a network analysis approach. The specific objective of the present analysis was to update the publication record over the last decade (2010-2019) to include all 20 NTDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A bibliometric analysis was conducted in Scopus and Web of Science databases (for English or French articles published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019) using appropriate search terms for each of the 20 NTDs and where at least 1 of the authors had a Canadian institution address. A 21st search was added to include publications including multiple NTDs or a discussion of NTDs in general. Following assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 reviewers independently screened all abstracts, with discordant observations rereviewed to arrive at an agreement. Duplicates were removed. RESULTS A total of 1,790 publications were retrieved (1,738 with a disease-specific NTD focus and 52 with a general NTD focus, resulting in 1,659 unique publications), giving an average of over 160 articles per year. Over 80% were classified as full-length research articles. The top 3 journals in terms of frequency were PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS ONE, and the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Authors' institutions were from all Canadian provinces. While all 20 NTDs were addressed in these publications, the 5 most commonly studied were leishmaniasis, dengue fever and chikungunya, Chagas disease, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and rabies. CONCLUSIONS Canadian researchers across the country have contributed to the evidence base of all 20 NTDs, publishing an average of over 160 publications per year between 2010 and 2019. As WHO NTD Road Map 2021-2030 rolls out globally, the Canadian research community, in collaboration with its partners and in solidarity with people living in vulnerable circumstances in endemic regions worldwide, is well positioned to meet future research challenges so that the goal of eliminating the disease burden attributable to NTDs can be achieved.","Gyorkos, Theresa W; Carabin, Hélène; Phillip, Maneesh; Benedict, Leshawn; Davis, Amy; Hatcher Roberts, Janet; Wasan, Kishor M; Ndao, Momar; Krentel, Alison",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,710,1

All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatient companions in this period. METHODS Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatient companions (InPatients Companions Management System [IPCMS]), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companions' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242 to 2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048 to 2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1 to 9 per day, with an average of 1.20 to 1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION The data obtained in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected. The experience gained in our IPCMS could also serve as a reference for other hospitals in Taiwan and worldwide.","Hung, Shih-Hsin; Kuo, Shu-Chen; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Tseng, Kuan-Jui; Sun, Ying-Chou; Ming, Jin-Lain",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,710,17

A recent theoretical model suggests that at least some of these effects are due to accelerated maturation of specific physiological systems and/or neural circuits. For example, maternal separation (MS), a model of early life adversity in rodents, accelerates maturation of memory systems, and here we examined its impact on maturation of perineuronal nets (PNNs) and parvalbumin (PV)-containing inhibitory interneurons. PNNs are specialized extracellular matrix structures suggested to be involved in stabilizing long-term memories and in the closure of a sensitive period in memory development. PV-containing inhibitory interneurons are the type of cell that PNNs preferentially surround, and are also thought to be involved in memory. In Experiment 1, with male rats, there was an increase in PNNs in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex with age from infancy to juvenility. Contrary to prediction, MS had no impact on either PNN or PV expression. The same pattern was observed in female rats in Experiment 2. Taken together, these data show that the early maturation of memory in MS infants is not due to an accelerated maturation of PNNs or PV-containing cells in either the amygdala or prefrontal cortex.","Richardson, Rick; Bowers, Jeremy; Callaghan, Bridget L; Baker, Kathryn D",Developmental cognitive neuroscience,710,5

However, there are no effective treatments for this condition. Recent research suggests that continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive brain stimulation, can reduce pain level, improve cognitive function and affective symptoms in multiple diseases or dysfunctions, including anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, sleep disorders and pain. But the potential benefits of cTBS in reducing postoperative delirium have not been investigated. Therefore, we propose determining whether cTBS can prevent and/or treat postoperative delirium in senior patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The study will be a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants (65 years old or older) undergoing scheduled orthopaedic surgery (≥2 hours, general anaesthesia) will be randomised to receive either cTBS or sham stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of the resting motor threshold. Every patient will receive 2-3 sets of stimulations during postoperative days (40 s per session, 3 sessions per set, 1 set per day). Participants will be assessed twice daily by a research assistant blinded to allocation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium measured by the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. The secondary outcomes will be the severity and duration of postoperative delirium, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, activities of daily living, length of hospital stay, discharge-to-facility or home, and rate of complication and mortality during the hospital stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval has been obtained from the ethics committee of Shanghai 10th People's Hospital. The principal investigator will submit a research progress report to the ethics committee regularly. All participants will provide written informed consent.

Brazil has been particularly impacted, registering more than 1.3 million infections and 57,000 deaths by late June 2020. Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite the descriptive and preliminary nature of these findings, results reported here suggest the need for more targeted approaches to enhance personal protection and provide greater viral testing options, especially for older, sicker and more vulnerable adults in Brazil.","Macinko, James; Seixas, Brayan V; Woolley, Natalia Oliveira; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda",Cadernos de saude publica,710,25

Simultaneously more surgeons have become acquainted with the single port techniques and sleeve gastrectomy has been regarded as an ideal field of application. Literature is scarce about operative and clinical outcomes of single port sleeve gastrectomy compared to conventional laparoscopy. The primary purpose of the study was to compare operative outcomes in the two study groups. Assessment and comparison of functional outcomes in terms of quality of life between groups was also performed. METHODS Prospective data on 130 consecutive patients who underwent randomized SI or CL sleeve gastrectomy were collected between January 2009 to December 2014. Preoperative parameters, outcomes, post-operative functional results and quality of life, according to the short-form SF-36 questionnaire, were evaluated and compared between groups. RESULTS 65 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic (CL) and 65 single incision (SI) sleeve gastrectomy. Operative time, post-operative pain, in-hospital stay, and complications were similar in the two groups. No difference emerged with respect to passage of flatus and resumption of oral intake (p = NS). Cosmetic results were excellent in SI patients with higher satisfaction rates. Post-operative quality of life was significant higher compared to baseline (p < 0.05), and comparable between the two procedures. CONCLUSIONS Single incision sleeve gastrectomy is safe, effective and comparable to the conventional laparoscopic technique in terms of outcomes. Post-operative quality of life is comparable between the two procedures.","Porta, Andrea; Aiolfi, Alberto; Musolino, Cinzia; Antonini, Ilaria; Zappa, Marco Antonio",Obesity surgery,710,1

It is not clear to what extent the current policy landscape supports leaders in managing misalignment between the needs of their organisation and the wider system, as many national structures still emphasise a focus on individual organisations. This study aims to understand how Chief Executives implement system leadership in practice when faced with decisions that benefit the system to the detriment of their own trust. Methodology: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten Chief Executives from a range of trust types to understand their perceptions and decision-making process in practice. Semantic thematic analysis was used to draw out themes in relation to how Chief Executives approach decisions which weigh up the system and organisation. Results: Themes raised by interviewees included both advantages (such as support in managing demand) and disadvantages (such as increased bureaucracy) of system leadership and practical considerations in operationalisation (such as the importance of interpersonal relationships). Interviewees endorsed system leadership in principle, but did not feel that the organisational incentives as currently structured support the implementation of system leadership in practice. This was not seen as a major challenge or impediment to effective leadership. Conclusion: As a specific policy area, a direct focus on systems leadership is not necessarily helpful. Chief Executives should be supported to make decisions in a complex environment, without a specific focus on healthcare systems as a unit of operation.","Gordon, B.; Thomas, M.

Objectives: To analyze the consequences of COVID-19 in a large cohort of AAV patients regarding occurrence, need of hospitalization, treatment at the intensive care units (ICU), or death. Methods: Data were retrieved from March 2020 to mid-January 2021 from medical records from the AAV cohort (n=233). Patients diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) were included. Data included age, gender, diagnosis, ongoing immunosuppressive medication at onset of COVID-19 or at last follow-up in non-COVID individuals. Renal involvement (ever) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were included. COVID-19 was confirmed either by a positive PCR test in the upper airways or by serology. Severe COVID-19 was defined as need of non-invasive ventilation, ICU care, and/or death. Results: The cohort comprised of 172 patients with GPA, 50 with MPA and 11 with EGPA. There were 121 females (52%). During the study period, 20 patients (8.6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age at data retrieval in all patients was 68 years (21-93), in the COVID-19 group 63 (29-93) and 68.5 (21-90) years in the non-COVID patients. Fourty-three patients in all (18%) were hospitalized during the study period of which 11 (4.7%) due to COVID-19 infection. In all, 8 deaths occurred of which 3 were related to COVID-19. At data retrieval, 110 (47%) patients were on prednisolone treatment, 10/20 (50%) in the COVID-19 group and 100 (47%) in the non-COVID-19 group (p=0.5), with significantly higher doses in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6/11 (54.5%) were on prednisolone, median dose 5 mg/day (0-50). In the total group 112 (48%) were on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and 64 (27.5%) on rituximab as maintenance therapy. Eight patients were on induction treatment with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Of the 20 COVID-19 cases, 8 had severe COVID-19. Of these, 2 were inactive without immunosuppressive treatment, 4 had stable disease with prednisolone (5-7.5 mg/day) in combination with DMARDs, and 2 were active treated with high dose prednisolone (25-50 mg/day) in combination with cyclophosphamide and rituximab (n=1) or rituximab (n=1). A higher proportion of patients had active AAV (p=0.03) in the severe COVID-19 then in the non-COVID group (10/213 patients). In the group with the severe COVID-19, 1/8 (12%) patient had rituximab as maintenance therapy, compared to 61/213 (28.6%) in the group of non-COVID-19 patients (p=0.5). Renal involvement (ever) was present in 144 patients (62%), in 6 patients (30%) with COVID-19, from which 5 (62%) were in the group of severe COVID-19 patients. Median eGFR did not differ between severe COVID-19 and remaining patients with renal involvement independently of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: We found a high rate of severe COVID-19 infection in our cohort of AAV patients which indicates risk for serious complications, especially in patients with active disease and intense immunosuppressive therapy. Maintenance therapy with rituximab did not seem to increase the risk for severe COVID-19. The findings stress the need for continued shielding and early vaccination in AAV patients.","Antovic, A.; Lövström, B.; Hugelius, A.; Borjesson, O.; Bruchfeld, A.; Gunnarsson, I.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,710,24

Mutations in the amino acid 484 of the Spike protein are particularly important and associated with some of these variants: E484K or E484Q. These mutations have been associated with evasion to neutralizing antibodies. Restriction enzyme analysis is proposed as a rapid method to detect these mutations. A search on GISAID was performed in April 2021 to detect the frequency of these two mutations in the sequence available and their association with other lineages. E484K, present in some VOCs, has emerged in several other lineages and is frequently found in recent viral isolates. A small amplicon from the Spike gene was digested with two enzymes: HpyAV, and MseI. The use of these two enzymes allows the detection of mutations at position 484, and to differentiate between these three conditions: non-mutated, and the presence of E484K or E484Q. A 100% correlation was observed with sequencing results. The proposed methodology, which allows for the screening of a great number of samples, will probably help to provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of these mutations worldwide, to select the candidates for whole-genome sequencing.","Jaspe, R.

Body-surface gastric mapping (BSGM) is a non-invasive method for the detection of gastric electrophysiological biomarkers including slow wave direction, which have correlated with symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. However, no studies have validated the relationship between gastric slow waves and body surface activation profiles. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the relationship between gastric slow waves and body-surface recordings. High-resolution electrode arrays were placed to simultaneously capture slow waves from the gastric serosa (32×6 electrodes at 4 mm resolution) and abdominal surface (8×8 at 20 mm inter-electrode spacing) in a porcine model. BSGM signals were extracted based on a combination of wavelet and phase information analyses. A total of 1185 individual cycles of slow waves assessed, out of which 897 (76%) were normal antegrade waves, occurring in 10/14 (71%) subjects studied. BSGM accurately detected the underlying slow wave in terms of frequency (r = 0.99, p = 0.43) as well as the direction of propagation (p = 0.41, F-measure: 0.92).

Cytokine release syndrome plays the key role in the pathogenesis of a range of life-threatening conditions including the acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Thus, the use of LVL could be considered as anti-cytokine therapy with a potency to prevent the complications and progression of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Objectives: We analyzed the changes in the serum concentrations of inflammatory markers (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6) in patients treated with LVL or placebo as part of a phase III multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled adaptive-design CORONA clinical study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LVL in subjects with severe COVID-19 (NCT04397562). Methods: A total of 217 patients were enrolled in the study, 206 patients were randomized, and 204 patients received the investigational product (IP, LVL or placebo). Study included men and non-pregnant women aged ≥18 years, hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, receiving standard therapy according to the national guidelines. Patients with acute respiratory failure with the need in invasive respiratory support, septic shock, multiple organ failure or life expectancy less than 24 hours could not participate in the study. The use of other monoclonal antibodies and glucocorticoids for the treatment of COVID-19 were not allowed. Subjects were stratified according to the CRP level (CRP ≤ 7 mg/L;CRP ≥ 7 mg/L) and then randomized (1:1) into 2 groups to receive LVL 324 mg or placebo. LVL/ placebo were administered as a single subcutaneous injection, investigator and patients were unaware of the received therapy. Among secondary endpoints of the study changes from baseline in ESR, CRP and IL-6 concentrations were assessed. CRP level and ESR were measured before the IP administration and on Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 29 and 30. Blood samples for the measurement of IL-6 concentration were obtained before the IP administration and then every day for 2 weeks after administration. Results: We observed the pronounced decrease of ESR in LVL group compared to Placebo group. The difference was statistically significant on Days 3 and 7: the median ESR change from baseline was -3 mm/h and +3 mm/h on Day 3, -11 mm/h and -3.1 mm/h on Day 7, in LVL and Placebo groups, respectively (p=0.0319 and p=0.0110, Days 3 and 7). The statistically significant difference in the change of CRP level was detected between the groups on Day 3: -26.6±41.9 mg/L and -19.2±58.2 mg/L in LVL and Placebo groups, respectively (p=0.0241). Numerically the same dynamics of ESR and CRP was observed over entire study period. The dynamics of IL-6 serum concentrations in LVL and Placebo groups was strikingly different. After LVL administration we detected the rapid significant increase in IL-6 concentration due to IL-6 receptors inhibition. Maximum change from baseline was observed on Day 3 (+91.9±117.7 pg/mL), on Day 14 the value was +31.9±62.7 pg/mL. In the Placebo group, the IL-6 concentration increased slightly until Day 4 (+5,1±76,5 pg/mL), and then decreased significantly (-39.2±55.1 pg/mL on Day 14) due to clinical improvement in this group. Conclusion: The significant differences in the dynamics of ESR, CRP and IL-6 after LVL administration compared to placebo confirmed the pharmacodynamic effect and its potency to prevent the excessive release of inflammatory substances in severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Lomakin, N.; Bakirov, B.; Musaev, G.; Protsenko, D.; Moiseeva, O.; Pasechnik, E.; Popov, V.; Smolyarchuk, E.; Gordeev, I.; Gilyarov, M.; Fomina, D.; Mazurov, V.; Morozova, M.; Dokukina, E.; Bogdan, D.; Lutskii, A.; Zinkina-Orihan, A.; Linkova, I.; Seleznev, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,710,16

Whether declines in VE are due to waning immunity, the Delta variant, or other causes, is debated. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 8,834,604 New York adults, comparing vaccine cohorts defined by product, age, and month of full-vaccination to age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. VE was estimated from May 1, 2021 for incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates through September 3) and hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through August 31). Results: 155,092 COVID-19 cases and 14,862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated VE for cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, and time-cohorts, from high levels beginning May 1 (1.8% Delta variant prevalence), to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), with limited changes thereafter (>95% Delta). Decreases were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18-49, 50-64 years, and [≥]65 years, respectively), and similar for Moderna (-18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) and Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively).

Among persons [≥]65 years, VE declined from May to August for Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%). VE was lower for Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%. Conclusions: Declines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE for hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines limited to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients [≥]65 years, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations.","Rosenberg, E.; Dorabwila, V.; Easton, D.; Bauer, U.; Kumar, J.; Hoen, R.; Hoefer, D.; Wu, M.; Lutterloh, E.; Conroy, M.

Using three sequential virtual sales competitions, we test our model in the immediate aftermath of the transition from live in-class learning to virtual learning brought on by COVID-19, offering an ideal setting for investigating marketing education in a time of crisis. The findings are unique, and show that how crises are managed impacts the deleterious effects of anxiety on education and learning. While anxiety had the greatest influence on class preparation, class preparation in turn was not related to class learning, class satisfaction, nor intent to pursue a sales career.

Here, we show inhibiting cyclic-GMP selective phosphodiesterase-9A (PDE9-I) suppresses established diet-induced obesity and CMS in ovariectomized female and male mice. PDE9-I reduces abdominal, hepatic, and myocardial fat accumulation, stimulates mitochondrial activity in brown and white fat, and improves CMS, without altering activity or food intake. PDE9 localizes to mitochondria, and its inhibition stimulates lipolysis and mitochondrial respiration coupled to PPARα-dependent gene regulation. PPARα upregulation is required for PDE9-I metabolic efficacy and is absent in non-ovariectomized females that also display no metabolic benefits from PDE9-I. The latter is compatible with estrogen receptor-α altering PPARα chromatin binding identified by ChIPSeq. In humans with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, myocardial expression of PPARA and its regulated genes is reduced versus control.

However, due to its nature, participants are lectured for a scheduled time-line with little necessity to interact. In particular, classroom-based training often might not provide substantial trainee interaction, which could result in apathy. To tackle this issue, we conducted empirical research to investigate the role of digital game-based learning (GBL) in employees’ training on the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). To figure out whether gameplay was a preferable training method, PlaySAFe (i.e., a 3D game) was developed within the study’s scope and tested with nine active SAFe practitioners from an industrial setting. Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have forced many to seek alternative means of teaching and learning. In particular, the findings obtained from the tests illustrate that PlaySAFe can be effectively used as a complementary tool that supports SAFe classroom-based training.

Human leucocyte antigen-DR on monocytes (mHLA-DR), HLA-ABC ratio (rHLA-ABC), and CD64 on monocytes (mCD64) were also assessed. Methods: 85 adult patients presenting with potential infection were included during the 2019 flu season in the ED of La Timone Hospital. They were divided into four diagnostic outcomes according to their clinical records: no-infection, bacterial infection, viral infection and co-infection. Results: mCD169 was elevated in patients suffering from Flu A virus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, while nCD64 was mainly found elevated in subjects with Streptococcus pneumoniae. In total, 38 (45%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infections, 11 (13%) with viral infections and 29 (34%) with co-infections. nCD64 and mCD169 showed 90% and 80% sensitivity, and 78% and 91% specificity, respectively, for identifying patients with bacterial or viral infections.

Thus, this study aimed to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 in Brazilian athletes and identify the epidemiological, clinical, athletic, life and health factors associated with the disease in these individuals. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 414 athletes from 22 different sports using an online questionnaire from August to November 2020. The association between the athletes' characteristics and COVID-19 was evaluated using a logistic regression model. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 8.5%, although only 40% of athletes reported having been tested. Being under 27 years of age (3-fold), having children (~ 5-fold), having a teammate test positive for COVID-19 (2.5-fold), and smoking (14-fold) were associated with a possible higher risk of disease. Almost 20% of athletes self-reported musculoskeletal injuries during the period of the pandemic that was studied. Athletes with a university education (P = 0.02), a profession other than sports (P < 0.001), those from a low-income family (P = 0.01), and public health system users (P = 0.04) were significantly less frequently tested for COVID-19, whereas international competitors, athletes who received a wage, and athletes who had a teammate who tested positive for COVID-19 were 2-, 3-, and 15-fold more likely to be tested for COVID-19, respectively. Approximately 26% of the athletes who tested negative or were untested reported more than three characteristic COVID-19 symptoms, and 11% of athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic.

The mechanism of thromboembolic events appears to be stimulated by excessive thrombin production, inhibition of fibrinolysis and deposition of antiphospholipids and thrombi, as well as microvascular dysfunction in multiple vascular beds. The occurrence of PE has been well demonstrated in hospitalised patients with severe disease. Very few data are available on its incidence or prevalence in non-hospitalised patients diagnosed with a milder form of the disease. Objectives. To assess the prevalence of PE in non-hospitalised patients diagnosed with mild COVID-19 who presented with raised D-dimer levels and persistent or new-onset cardiopulmonary symptoms. Methods. This was a retrospective study conducted in the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Universitas Academic Hospital, Bloemfontein, South Africa. We reviewed the studies of 65 non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 referred to the department from July 2020 to January 2021 for a perfusion-only single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) study or a ventilation/ perfusion (VQ) SPECT/CT study. All 65 patients had raised D-dimer levels with persistent, worsening or new-onset cardiopulmonary symptoms after the diagnosis of COVID-19. Results. Sixty-five patients were studied. The median (interquartile range) age was 46 (41 - 54) years and the majority (88.2%) were female. There were 22 patients (33.8%) with lung perfusion defects in keeping with PE. Two of these patients had a false-negative computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) study for PE performed the same day as their VQ SPECT/CT study. Conclusions. We confirm a high prevalence of PE in non-hospitalised patients diagnosed with mild COVID-19 who presented with raised D-dimer levels and persistent or new-onset cardiopulmonary symptoms. We recommend that irrespective of disease severity, hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 presenting with persistent or new-onset cardiopulmonary symptoms and raised D-dimer levels should be investigated further for PE.","Evbuomwan, O.; Engelbrecht, G.; Bergman, M.

A novel coronavirus, which is not related to the hitherto known coronaviruses, has been proven to be associated with the disease. Our genomic analyses strongly suggest that the new SARS-coronavirus did not emerge through mutation or recombination and that it has probably been transmitted from a so far not identified animal species to humans. Therefore, it is most likely that SARS virus is a zoonotic agent.

In this article, we review appropriate medical equipment, treatment space, and strategies to augment health professional staff in response to a massive increase in need for sustained critical care. RECENT FINDINGS There is insufficient modern healthcare experience with mass casualty respiratory failure to develop evidence-based preparedness efforts. For this reason, initial efforts to augment critical care capability in response to disasters have relied on extrapolation from the routine critical care knowledge base, military medicine, critical care transport, and expert opinion. We review recently published documents on augmenting supplies of positive pressure ventilation equipment, ongoing projects for increasing health professional staff, and infection control issues during epidemics. SUMMARY Mass casualty respiratory failure remains a largely unstudied field, but we believe informed decisions about equipment stockpiling and use, the development of creative operational concepts to increase staffing, and the careful implementation of rational infection control practices can lay a foundation for an appropriate response until additional data become available.","Daugherty, Elizabeth L; Branson, Richard; Rubinson, Lewis",Current opinion in critical care,710,22

While exhibiting a relatively similar upper body motion to the bench press, there are substantial differences in repetitions when employing similar relative loads. The objective was to examine sex-related differences in repetitions and muscle activation associated with push-ups and bench press exercises. Twenty resistance-trained participants (10 men [22 ± 6.1 years] and 10 [24 ± 5.7 years] women) performed maximum push-up and bench press repetitions with loads relative to the body mass during a push-up. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were positioned on the middle and anterior deltoids, triceps and biceps brachii, and pectoralis major muscles and their relative (normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction) activity was compared between the two exercises performed to task failure. Both females (3.5 ± 3.9 vs.15.5 ± 8.0 repetitions; p = 0.0008) and males (12.0 ± 6.3 vs. 25.6 ± 5.2 repetitions; p < 0.0001) performed 77.4% and 53.1% less bench press than push-up repetitions respectively. Males significantly exceeded females with both push-ups (p = 0.01) and bench press (p = 0.004) repetitions. Significant linear regression equations were found for females (r2 = 0.55; p = 0.03), and males (r2 = 0.66; p < 0.0001) indicating that bench press repetitions increased 0.36 and 0.97 for each push-up repetition for females and males respectively. Triceps (p = 0.002) and biceps brachii (p = 0.03) EMG mean amplitude was significantly lower during the push-up concentric phase, while the anterior deltoid (p = 0.03) exhibited less activity during the bench press eccentric phase. The sex disparity in repetitions during these exercises indicates that a push-up provides a greater challenge for women than men and regression equations may be helpful for both sexes when formulating training programs.","Alizadeh, Shahab; Rayner, Machel; Mahmoud, M Mamdouh Ibrahim; Behm, David G",Journal of sports science & medicine,710,1

ASA hypersensitivity can pose a challenge to achieving optimum medical management prior to and after neurointerventional treatment. Desensitization to ASA is well described in the allergy and cardiovascular literature, but there are no similar discussions specific to neurointervention. The purpose of our study was to describe our experience with ASA hypersensitivity management and review the relevant literature. Two cases of patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease requiring neurointervention who were successfully desensitized to their ASA hypersensitivity prior to treatment are described. The subsequent literature is reviewed. Several ASA desensitization protocols exist and have been proven to successfully treat ASA hypersensitivity and allow for ASA therapy to be safely initiated. We describe several previously published protocols. ASA desensitization is a safe and simple way to manage ASA hypersensitivity.

MATERIAL OF STUDY Between June 2005 and May 2009, we performed 22 LLR for HCC. The underlying cirrhosis was staged as Child A in 19 cases and Child B in 3. RESULTS LLR included a non anatomic resection in 15 cases and an anatomic resection in 7. A conversion to laparotomy occurred in one (4.5%) patient for hemorrhage. Mortality and morbidity rates were 0% and 18.1% (4/20). Over a mean follow-up period of 29 months (range: 19-65 months), 11 (50%) patients presented recurrence, mainly at distance from the surgical site. DISCUSSION A laparoscopic approach is more suitable when the lesion is located in the peripheral ""laparoscopic"" segments 2 to 6. Nevertheless, six resections were made in the posterosuperior segments. Although parenchymal-sparing resection is required by the presence of underlying liver disease, anatomic resection has always to be considered and pursued to reduce local recurrence. In our series the recurrence rate was similar to those reported for other laparoscopic studies and for open resection of HCC. CONCLUSIONS LLR for HCC in selected patients is a safe procedure with good short-term results. It can also be proposed in tumor locations with a difficult surgical access maintaining a low morbidity rate and good oncologic adequacy. This approach could have an impact on the therapeutic strategy of HCC complicating cirrhosis as a treatment with curative intent or as a bridge to liver transplantation.","Casaccia, Marco; Andorno, Enzo; Di Domenico, Stefano; Gelli, Maximiliano; Bottino, Giuliano; Valente, Umberto",Annali italiani di chirurgia,710,17

However, few studies are available pertaining to this problem among Chinese doctors, a special occupational population exposed to high stress, especially during the implementation of health system reform. The aim of this study was to assess anxiety disorder among Chinese doctors and clarify its risk factors. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 teaching hospitals of China Medical University. Questionnaires pertaining to anxiety disorder indicated by the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and demographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle factors, work conditions and work-related psychological status were distributed to all registered doctors during April-June 2009. There were 1,134 effective respondents (effective response rate 71.2%), and these respondents became our subjects (539 male doctors and 595 female doctors). RESULTS The average standard scores of SAS for the male and female doctors were 46.8 and 46.7. General linear model analysis indicated that SAS was associated with, in standardized estimate (β) sequence, cynicism, emotional exhaustion, professional efficacy, sleeping problem, chronic diseases and physical exercise in men and with professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, cynicism, sleeping problem, chronic diseases, job satisfaction, alcohol consumption and meals in women. Work-related psychological status contributed the most to the model R-square. CONCLUSION Chinese doctors were at considerably high risk of anxiety disorder and job burnout and sleeping problem had prominent roles. Interventions such as preventing exhaustion at work and improving sleep quality should be given attention during health care system reform with the aim of lessening anxiety disorder in doctors in China.","Sun, Wei; Fu, Jialiang; Chang, Ying; Wang, Lie",Journal of occupational health,710,1

Background COVID-19 is a fatal respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that quickly became a pandemic. Although the main symptoms of this disease include respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal manifestations have also been observed in some patients suffering from COVID-19. Pregnant women are among the most vulnerable groups in the community to infectious diseases. Methods Scientific databases were searched for articles published up to May 8, 2020. Any type of study investigating the manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women was included. Symptoms of the disease in pregnant women with an emphasis on gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed. Results The search resulted in 852 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 43 studies involving 374 women. The most common symptoms of patients were fever (59.1%) and cough (48.4%), respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms included diarrhea (4.5%), abdominal pain (1.6%), nausea (0.8%), and loss of appetite (0.3%), respectively. In studies on pregnant women with gastrointestinal symptoms, 13 fetal abortions occurred, most of which were induced abortions due to the risks posed by COVID-19.In thirty cases, and infected pregnant women reported a history of chronic pregnancy-related diseases. Conclusion COVID-19 in pregnant women, similar to the general population, can present with gastrointestinal manifestations. The gastrointestinal tract can be a potential route for infection with the novel coronavirus.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Ashtari, Sara; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,710,15

In response, the country designed and created intermediate treatment centers, known as fangcang hospitals, which are prepared quickly at low cost and with high capacity. The aim of this study is to provide health managers with an effective post-hospital discharge strategy for COVID-19 patients. METHOD: The study was conducted from April 2020 to June 2020, with a narrative case study design. Setting up a fangcang hospital was based on a narrative analysis of 2 in-depth interviews with 4 fangcang hospital managers in Iran, a field visit of these places, and a review of their protocols and guidelines. RESULT: The patient flow for screening, treatment, and follow-up includes the following: Patients will be hospitalized if their symptoms are severe. If they are infected with mild symptoms, they will be referred to a fangcang hospital and admitted there if necessary, to prevent further spread of the disease. Patients will be monitored regularly and treated with routine health services. At the end of the 14-day quarantine period, patients approved for discharge are sent home. CONCLUSION: Traditional hospitals and fangcang hospitals are working together under the supervision of the Iran University of Medical Sciences. Our experience can serve as guidance for other clinics and recovery shelters. Having guidelines in place assists health care workers and managers in responding quickly to patients' needs during times of a disaster.","Kassaeian, Saeed; Gohari, Ali; Masoumi, Gholamreza; Ghomian, Zohreh; Dehghani, Arezoo",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,710,16

It mainly affects the respiratory system, but it can also affect other systems. The gastrointestinal system has been found to be affected in many patients. This study investigated the COVID-19-related gastrointestinal manifestations and the effect of gastrointestinal involvement on the course and outcome of the disease. Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted on 140 COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction-positive symptomatic individuals admitted to Al-Shafa Hospital - Medical City Complex in Baghdad, Iraq during the period 2 March 2020 to 12 May 2020. Demographic data and clinical presentation and laboratory data were extracted from the case sheets of the patients and were also obtained from direct communication with the patients, their families, and medical staff. Results: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone were detected in 23.6% of the patients; 44.3% of the patients presented with only respiratory symptoms, and 32.1% presented with both respiratory and GI symptoms. Patients with only GI symptoms had less severe disease compared with those who had both GI and respiratory symptoms, who had more severe disease with higher mortality. Overall mortality was 8.6%, with no mortality in the GI symptoms alone group. The highest severity and mortality were in patients with both GI and respiratory symptoms (48.39 and 13.33%, respectively). Conclusions: COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms are common, and their presence alone carries a better prognosis, but their presence with respiratory symptoms is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.","Sulaiman, Tharwat; Algharawi, Ali A; Idrees, Marwan; Alzaidy, Rafid H; Faris, Kawthar; Cullingford, Graham; Rasheed, Jawad",,710,15

In order to evaluate the current status of community pharmacists' quality of life from Romania and Bulgaria during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify factors associated with their decision on being vaccinated to prevent COVID-19, an online survey involving 395 community pharmacists was conducted from 15th July 2020 to 15th August 2020. The 15D instrument was used for quality-of-life assessment. The pharmacists' recommendations for vitamin C and D intake during the COVID-19 pandemic were also analyzed in order to promote future training programs for community pharmacists. Descriptive statistics, comparative analyses between pharmacists from Romania and Bulgaria, and multiple correlation analyses were performed on the collected data. Significant differences were observed for the level of quality of life between the two groups of pharmacists according to their age; smaller values, directly correlated with their age (total 15D score and age: Spearman r = 0.168, p = 0.022), were obtained for Bulgarian pharmacists regarding sleeping, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress.

Part I observes that a superintelligence unconnected to the outside world (de-efferented) carries no threat, and that any threat from a harmful superintelligence derives from the peripheral systems to which it is connected, e.g., nuclear weapons, biotechnology, etc. Because existentially-threatening peripheral systems already exist and are controlled by humans, the initial effects of a superintelligence would merely add to the existing human-derived risk. This additive risk can be quantified and, with specific assumptions, is shown to decrease with the square of the number of humans having the capability to collapse civilization. Part II proposes that biotechnology ranks high in risk among peripheral systems because, according to all indications, many humans already have the technological capability to engineer harmful microbes having pandemic spread. Progress in biomedicine and computing will proliferate this threat. ``Savant'' software that is not generally superintelligent will underpin much of this progress, thereby becoming the software responsible for the highest and most imminent existential risk -- ahead of hypothetical risk from superintelligences. The analysis concludes that resources should be preferentially applied to mitigating the risk of peripheral systems and savant software. Concerns about superintelligence are at most secondary, and possibly superfluous.","Sotos, John G.",,710,1

Prior evidence suggests that, when people perceive uncontrollable risks to their health, they are less likely to engage in healthful behaviour. This article aims to understand the extent to which COVID-19 is perceived as an uncontrollable risk, and to assess whether this perceived risk is associated with health behaviour. Subject and methods: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 496 participants during the first UK lockdown. We assessed perceptions of COVID-19-related risk, self-reported adherence to infection control measures recommended by the UK Government, and general health behaviours. We predicted that increased perceived extrinsic mortality risk (the portion of mortality risk perceived to be uncontrollable) would disincentivise healthy behaviour. Results: Perceived threat to life was the most consistent predictor of reported adherence to infection control measures. Perceived extrinsic mortality risk was found to have increased due to the pandemic, and was associated with lower reported adherence to Government advice on diet, physical activity, and smoking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that health messages that highlight threat to life may be effective in increasing adherence to infection control, but may also lead to a reduction in health-promoting behaviours. We suggest that messages that highlight threat to life should be accompanied by statements of efficacy. Further, messages evoking feelings of concern for others may be effective in promoting compliance with anti-infection measures, without the potential for the unwelcome side-effect of discouraging healthy behaviour.

This retrospective cohort study included 3528 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 seen at a large New York City health system between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Data for neighborhood level poverty was acquired from the American Community Survey 2014-2018 and defined as the percent of residents in each ZIP code whose household income was below the federal poverty threshold (FPT): 0% to < 20% below FPT (low poverty) and > 20% below FPT (high poverty). COVID-19 positive patients who resided in high poverty areas were significantly younger, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities and were more likely to be of female gender or a racial minority when compared to individuals living in low poverty areas. Residence in a high poverty area was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization and was found to be associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality. This study suggests the existence of an unequal socioeconomic gradient in the demographic and clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients including differences in age, gender and race between poverty groups. Further studies are needed to fully assess the intersectionality of SES with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Little, Christine; Alsen, Mathilda; Barlow, Joshua; Naymagon, Leonard; Tremblay, Douglas; Genden, Eric; Trosman, Samuel; Iavicoli, Laura; van Gerwen, Maaike",J. community health,710,16

Zonisamide (ZNS) was originally developed as an antiepileptic drug. Studies have shown that ZNS suppresses ER stress-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Herein, we investigated whether ZNS improved DCM by attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis. C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneally injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and then treated with ZNS (40 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 16 weeks. We showed that ZNS administration slightly ameliorated the blood glucose levels, but significantly alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. Furthermore, ZNS administration significantly inhibited the Bax and caspase-3 activity, upregulated Bcl-2 activity, and decreased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells in heart tissues. We analyzed the hallmarks of ER stress in heart tissues, and revealed that ZNS administration significantly decreased the protein levels of GRP78, XBP-1s, ATF6, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP, and elevated Hrd1 protein. In high glucose (HG)-treated primary cardiomyocytes, application of ZNS (3 µM) significantly alleviated HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. ZNS application also suppressed activated ER stress in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, preapplication of the specific ER stress inducer tunicamycin (10 ng/mL) eliminated the protective effects of ZNS against HG-induced cardiac hypertrophy and ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that ZNS improves the cardiac diastolic function in diabetic mice and prevents T2DM-induced cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating ER stress-mediated apoptosis.","Tian, Jia-Hui; Wu, Qian; He, Yong-Xiang; Shen, Qi-Ying; Rekep, Mubarak; Zhang, Gui-Ping; Luo, Jian-Dong; Xue, Qin; Liu, Ying-Hua",Acta pharmacol.

It is suggested that a range of reactive oxygen species, including, singlet oxygen and the superoxide radical anion, derived via direct photolysis of phaeomelanin, may escape the melanocyte and cause subsequent damage to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is further suggested that (large) carbon and sulphur peroxy radicals, from oxygen addition to radicals formed by carbon-sulphur bond cleavage, may assist via damage to the cell membranes. It is also speculated that light absorption by phaeomelanin and the subsequent C-S bond cleavage, leads to release of pre-absorbed reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen and free radicals, which may also contribute to an enhanced protective effect for fair-skinned people.","Edge, Ruth; Truscott, T George",Photochem Photobiol Sci,710,16

The most prevalent motivation for the use of face coverings was to protect or respect other people, including high-risk populations and individuals. Other motivators were self-protection, responsibility, desire for control, requirements, and expert advice. Barriers included physical and social discomfort, confusion or misinformation, low perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceptions of identity and autonomy. Even among individuals who frequently wear face coverings, there are opportunities to improve compliance. Messaging should highlight how face coverings protect the wearer and others around them, normalize the use of face coverings in social settings, and emphasize requirements.

Furthermore, they are habitually exposed to large fluctuations in blood flow during physical and sedentary activities. Low-flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) provide indices of endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Age and sex both impact upper-limb FMD. However, it is unclear whether these factors also influence popliteal endothelial-dependent function. Popliteal endothelial function was compared between younger and older males and females (n=14 per group) matched for age- and sex-specific relative aerobic fitness levels (each group's normative percentile: ~45%). Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD) was also assessed as a measure of endothelial-independent vasodilation. Ageing reduced relative popliteal FMD in both males (older: 4.3±1.8% versus younger 5.7±1.9%) and females (older: 2.9±1.8% versus younger: 6.1±1.6%, both: P<0.046). FMD was also lower in older females versus older males (P=0.04). Popliteal NMD findings followed the same pattern as FMD. Compared to younger adults, relative L-FMC responses were blunted among older males (older: -1.2±1.1% versus younger: -2.2±1.0%) and females (older: -1.0±1.2% versus younger: -2.1±1.3%, both P<0.03) with no sex-differences observed in either age group (all, P>0.60). The adverse age- and sex-related (older adults only) declines in popliteal FMD were mediated, in part, by reduced vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to nitric oxide. Endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction was also attenuated with age, but unaffected by sex. Despite similar normative aerobic fitness percentiles (~45%), older adults exhibited attenuated popliteal endothelial function than their younger counterparts. This was particularly evident in older females who exhibited the lowest endothelial-dependent vasodilatory responses.","O039,; Brien, Myles W; Johns, Jarrett A; Petterson, Jennifer L; Mekary, Said; Kimmerly, Derek S",Exp Gerontol,710,16

Methods: This is a retrospective, single-center study. Hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients aged over 18 years between March 19th 2020, and May 19th 2020 were included in the study. The demographic, and clinical characteristics of patients, and factors associated with severe COVID-19 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the factors predicting the severity of COVID-19. Results: A total of 228 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were recorded. The mean age of the patients was 51±19 years, and 136 (59.6%) were men. Of the patients, 47.4% had at least one comorbidity. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality were detected in 29 (12.7%), and in 17 (7.5%) patients respectively. No mortality was detected in non-severe disease. Our results revealed that dyspnea (OR:7.449 95% CI 2.444-22.708, p&lt;0.001), fatigue (OR:5.968 96% CI 2.155-16.526, p:0.001), elevation of LDH (OR: 4.288 95% CI 1.109-16.584, p:0.035) and elevation of D-dimer (OR:3.242 95% CI 1.106-9.501, p:0.032) levels at admission were major independent predicting factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: Dyspnea, fatigue, elevation of LDH and D-dimer levels are closely related to severe disease in COVID-19. In addition to typical pneumonia signs, fatigue, LDH, and D-dimer can be used as valuable indicators at admission for distinguishing severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients in the early stage. Therefore, this may lead to improved outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In light of the steadily increasing foreign travel these infections in returning travellers are of growing importance. Older travellers and those with underlying diseases constitute a special risk group. The knowledge of pathogens endemic to foreign countries and of the respective clinical picture is essential for determining a suspected diagnosis, especially in patients not responding to a first empirical antibacterial treatment. The documentation of a thorough travel history is crucial for taking a possible exposure to specific pathogens into account and thus for guiding the diagnostic pathway. In addition to pathogens which primarily lead to an infection of the lungs, non-pulmonary infections, which can cause pulmonary symptoms, e.g. schistosomiasis and malaria also have to be considered. Two examples of infectious diseases of the lungs, which can only be acquired abroad, are melioidosis and coccidioidomycosis. While a pulmonary manifestation of melioidosis can take an acute and fulminant course associated with a high mortality rate, coccidioidomycosis primarily presents mostly as oligosymptomatic, but with a substantial latent period can lead to pulmonary manifestations that in their diversity resemble tuberculosis or malignancies.","Menner, N; Cronen, T",Pneumologe (Berl),710,1

The causative virus, SARS?CoV-2, is a betacoronavirus that binds to cells through an interaction between the viral Spike protein (S) and its receptor (ACE2) on the host cell. The S protein is a 180 kDa glycoprotein comprised of a receptor binding domain, trimerization domain, proteolytic cleavage sites, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. In addition to receptor binding, the S protein plays a key role in viral membrane fusion during the virus entry and virus induced cell-cell fusion. The cytoplasmic tail of the Spike has several conserved cysteines that have previously been shown to be palmitoylated in SARS-CoV and MERS. Recently it was reported in an interactome study (Gordon, D.E et al, 2020) that zDHHC5 and Golga7 are among the top Spike interacting proteins. These two proteins form a complex that functions as palmitoyl-transferase. To investigate the functional significance of palmitoylation on SARS-CoV-2 S protein function and viral infection, we created luciferase/ZsGreen reporter containing HIV-1 derived viral particles pseudo-typed with full length wild-type and mutant SARS CoV-2 S. Using an Acyl-PEGyl Exchange Gel-Shift (APEGS) assay, we show that Spike is palmitoylated on multiple sites. Then, a series of functional assays were carried out to examine the role of Spike palmitoylation on viral egress, viral infection, and Spike protein trimerization, cleavage and fusion. Our results support the hypothesis that palmitoylation inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS CoV2 and other corona viruses infections","Ramadan, Ahmed Deschenes Robert Roy Arunava",The FASEB Journal,710,16

As a matter of fact, clear evidence of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory aerosol would be of primary importance; at the same time, checking the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be extremely useful to control the diffusion of the disease. Up to now, many studies report SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in indoor/outdoor air samples or water/wastewater samples that can differ by order of magnitude. Unfortunately, complete information about the scientific approach of many studies is still missing, relating to: samplers and sampling materials performances, recovery tests, measurement uncertainty, robustness, detection and quantification limits, infectivity of captured virus, virus degradation during sampling, influence of sample pre-treatments (included freezing) on results, effects of inhibitors, sample alterations due to manipulation, validation of methods and processes, quality assurance according to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements. Based on the first experiences focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples such as air quality filters or impingers collection solutions, the present study describes a coherent preliminary approach to SARS-CoV-2 indoor and outdoor air sampling in order to overcome the evident lack of standardization. Three aspects are highlighted here: the first solution to assure quality and consistency to air sampling relies on the development of recovery tests using standard materials and investigating sampling materials, sampling techniques, sampling durations, sample conservation and pre-treatments; secondly, in order to overcome the shortcomings of every single sampling technique, coupling different samplers in parallel sampling could be an efficient strategy to collect more information and make data more reliable; finally, with regards to airborne virus sampling, the results could be confirmed by simplified emission and dilution models.","Robotto, Angelo; Quaglino, Paola; Lembo, David; Morello, Marcello; Brizio, Enrico; Bardi, Luisella; Civra, Andrea",Environ Res,710,24

Whether the risk extends postdischarge has been controversial. Our prospective registry included consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized within our multihospital system from 1 March to 31 May 2020. We captured demographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, medications, postdischarge thromboprophylaxis, and 90-day outcomes. Data from electronic health records, health informatics exchange, radiology database, and telephonic follow-up were merged. Primary outcome was a composite of adjudicated VTE, ATE, and all-cause mortality (ACM). Principal safety outcome was major bleeding (MB). Among 4906 patients (53.7% male), mean age was 61.7 years. Comorbidities included hypertension (38.6%), diabetes (25.1%), obesity (18.9%), and cancer history (13.1%). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 13.2%. VTE rate was 1.55%; ATE, 1.71%; &#913;CM, 4.83%; and MB, 1.73%.

With the rapid accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, however, thousands of genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 are now publicly available. To improve the tracing of the viral genomes' evolution during the development of the pandemic, we analyzed single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 121,618 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We divided these viral genomes into two major lineages (L and S) based on variants at sites 8782 and 28144, and further divided the L lineage into two major sublineages (L1 and L2) using SNVs at sites 3037, 14408, and 23403. Subsequently, we categorized them into 130 sublineages (37 in S, 35 in L1, and 58 in L2) based on marker SNVs at 201 additional genomic sites. This lineage/sublineage designation system has a hierarchical structure and reflects the relatedness among the subclades of the major lineages. We also provide a companion website (www.covid19evolution.net) that allows users to visualize sublineage information and upload their own SARS-CoV-2 genomes for sublineage classification. Finally, we discussed the possible roles of compensatory mutations and natural selection during SARS-CoV-2's evolution. These efforts will improve our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of SARS-CoV-2's genome evolution.","Tang, Xiaolu; Ying, Ruochen; Yao, Xinmin; Li, Guanghao; Wu, Changcheng; Tang, Yiyuli; Li, Zhida; Kuang, Bishan; Wu, Feng; Chi, Changsheng; Du, Xiaoman; Qin, Yi; Gao, Shenghan; Hu, Songnian; Ma, Juncai; Liu, Tiangang; Pang, Xinghuo; Wang, Jianwei; Zhao, Guoping; Tan, Wenjie; Zhang, Yaping; Lu, Xuemei; Lu, Jian",,710,1

In this study, fragment peptides of neurotensin and xenin, acetyl-neurotensin (8-13) and xenin-8-Gln, were fused together to create Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln. Following assessment of enzymatic stability, effects of Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln on in vitro beta-cell function were studied. Sub-chronic antidiabetic efficacy of Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln alone, and in combination with the clinically approved GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4, was assessed in high fat fed (HFF) mice. Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln was highly resistant to plasma enzyme degradation and induced dose-dependent insulin-releasing actions (p<0.05 to p<0.01) in BRIN-BD11 beta-cells and isolated mouse islets. Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln augmented (p<0.001) the insulinotropic actions of GIP, while possessing independent beta-cell proliferative (p<0.001) and anti-apoptotic (p<0.01) actions. Twice daily treatment of HFF mice with Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln for 32 days improved glycaemic control and circulating insulin, with benefits significantly enhanced by combined exendin-4 treatment. This was reflected by reduced body fat mass (p<0.001), improved circulating lipid profile (p<0.01) and reduced HbA1c concentrations (p<0.01) in the combined treatment group. Following an oral glucose challenge, glucose levels were markedly decreased (p<0.05) only in combination treatment group and superior to exendin-4 alone, with similar observations made in response to glucose plus GIP injection. The combined treatment group also presented with improved insulin sensitivity, decreased pancreatic insulin content as well as increased islet and beta-cell areas. These data reveal that Ac-NT/XN-8-Gln is a biologically active neurotensin/xenin fusion peptide that displays prominent antidiabetic efficacy when administered together with exendin-4.","Perry, Rachele; Craig, Sarah L; Gault, Victor A; Flatt, Peter; Irwin, Nigel",Biosci. rep,710,24

METHODS: Patients presenting to the ED between March 12 and March 28, 2020, with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 and subsequent CXR and/or CT exam were selected. Patients imaged for other reasons with findings suspicious for COVID-19 were also included. Demographics, laboratory test results, and history were extracted from the medical record. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the relationship between imaging and these factors. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients from the emergency department were analyzed (224 CXRs and 25 CTs). Of the 192 patients with COVID-19 results, 173 (90.1%) had COVID-19 RT-PCR (+). Abnormal imaging (CXR, 85.7% and/or CT, 100%) was noted in 155 (89.6%) of COVID-19 RT-PCR (+) cases.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from ""nonsevere"" toward ""nonsurvived"" via ""severe and survived"" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings may be helpful in predicting disease progression and clinical outcome of severe patients.","Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Tan, Ge; Dong, Xiang; Wang, Bin-Chen; Lin, Jun; Yan, You-Qin; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Mübeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,710,11

Methods Children aged 11?12 years and their mothers participating in a UK population-based birth cohort (Wirral Child Health and Development Study) provided mental health data between December 2019 and March 2020, and again 3 months after lockdown, 89% (N = 202) of 226 assessed pre-COVID-19. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by self- and maternal reports, and long-term vulnerability by maternal report of prior child adjustment, and maternal prenatal depression. Results The young adolescents reported a 44% (95% confidence interval [CI: 23%?65%]) increase in symptoms of depression and 26% (95% CI [12%?40%]) for post-traumatic stress disorder, with corresponding maternal reports of child symptoms of 71% (95% CI [44%?99%]) and 43% (95% CI 29%?86%). Disruptive behaviour problem symptoms increased by 76% (95% CI [43%?109%]) particularly in children without previous externalising symptoms. Both female gender and having had high internalising symptoms earlier in childhood were associated with elevated rates of depression pre-pandemic, and with greater absolute increases during COVID-19. Mothers' own depression symptoms increased by 42% (95% CI [20%?65%]), and this change was greater among mothers who had prenatal depression. No change in anxiety was observed among children or mothers. None of these increases were moderated by COVID-19-related experiences such as frontline worker status of a parent. Prior to the pandemic, rates of maternal and child depression were greater in families experiencing higher deprivation, but changed only in less deprived families, raising their rates to those of the high deprivation group. Conclusions COVID-19 has led to a marked increase in mental health problems in young adolescents and their mothers with concomitant requirements for mental health services to have the resources to adapt to meet the level and nature of the needs.","Wright, Nicola Hill Jonathan Sharp Helen Pickles Andrew",JCPP Advances,710,24

Substantial evidence now supports preliminary conclusions about transmission that can inform rational, evidence-based policies and reduce misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called ""superspreading events."" Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.","Meyerowitz, Eric A; Richterman, Aaron; Gandhi, Rajesh T; Sax, Paul E",Ann. intern. med,710,16

The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic.

Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.","Citro, Rodolfo; Pontone, Gianluca; Bellino, Michele; Silverio, Angelo; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Baggiano, Andrea; Manka, Robert; Iesu, Severino; Vecchione, Carmine; Asch, Federico Miguel; Ghadri, Jelena Rima; Templin, Christian",Trends cardiovasc. med,710,16

As a means to tackle the spread of the virus, the government opened a campaign for the public to exercise hygiene measures such as washing hands frequently and physical distancing. A few weeks later, a five-month State of Emergency (SOE) was declared, and several businesses, schools and theatre halls were closed. People were advised to work from home, including permitting telecommuting for many government officials. However, mainly due to fear of economic crisis, the government was forced to release the lockdown and mass wearing of face masks has become a requirement. As health professionals and the government insist that people make use of facemasks, it is also equally important to give guidance on how to dispose of them safely because face masks that are disposed improperly have the potential in spreading SARS-CoV-2. The urgency of this comes in people's violations of rules when it comes to disposing of masks they used. Providing awareness creation programs about the negative impact of contaminated face masks on the health of individuals and introducing laws that can prohibit improper disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPEs) are among the solutions discussed in this manuscript that could help reduce the problem.","Shiferie, Fisseha",Pan Afr Med J,710,26

This study aimed to characterize social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in São Paulo, the most populous city in Brazil and Latin America. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study, including COVID-19 deaths among São Paulo residents from March to September 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates and unadjusted rate ratios (RRs) [with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were estimated by race, sex, age group, district of residence, household crowding, educational attainment, income level and percentage of households in subnormal areas in each district. Time trends in mortality were assessed using the Joinpoint model. RESULTS: Males presented an 84% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared with females (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.79-1.90). Higher mortality rates were observed for Blacks (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.67-1.88) and mixed (RR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47) compared with Whites, whereas lower mortality was noted for Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68). A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal striking social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in São Paulo, exposing structural inequities in Brazilian society that were not addressed by the governmental response to COVID-19. Without an equitable response, COVID-19 will further exacerbate current social inequalities in São Paulo.","Ribeiro, Karina Braga; Ribeiro, Ana Freitas; de Sousa Mascena Veras, Maria Amélia; de Castro, Marcia Caldas",Int. j. epidemiol,710,4

The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is the most clinically used variable to assess such oxygenation, since it decisively influences the oxygen transported by hemoglobin (expressed by its percentage of saturation, SaO2). However, two recent studies conducted respectively in silico and using omic techniques in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could decrease the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin (which would imply that PaO2 would overestimate SaO2), and also reduce the amount of this carrier molecule. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this hypothesis in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood gases of all COVID-19 patients performed in our laboratory in two months were included, as well as those from two control groups: synchronous patients with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (SCG) and a historical group (HCG). Both SaO2 and venous saturations (SvO2) measured by cooximetry (COX) were compared separately with those calculated using the Kelman (K), Severinghaus (SV) and Siggaard-Andersen (SA) equations in each group. RESULTS: Measured and calculated SaO2 and SvO2 were practically equivalent in all groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for SaO2 in COVID-19 were 0.993 for COX-K and 0.992 for both COX-SV and COX-SA; being 0.995 for SvO2 for either COX-K, COX-SV or COX-SA. Hemoglobin and ferritin were slightly higher in COVID-19 compared to SCG and HCG (hemoglobin, p < 0.001 for both; ferritin, p < 0.05 for SCG and p < 0.001 for HCG). CONCLUSION: Under clinical conditions SARS-CoV-2 does not have an appreciable influence on the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin, nor on the levels of this carrier molecule. Therefore, PaO2 is a good marker of blood oxygenation also in COVID-19.","Pascual-Guàrdia, Sergi; Ferrer, Antoni; Díaz, Óscar; Caguana, Antonio O; Tejedor, Elvira; Bellido-Calduch, Salomé; Rodríguez-Chiaradia, Diego A; Gea, Joaquim",,710,1

Practically, this study called on the federal and state governments to effectively apply the health justice approach to eliminate healthcare discrimination for people living in low-income and marginalised communities as well as providing accessible, safe housing for the more vulnerable who need a place to self-quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure. Further practical and theoretical implications policies are discussed.","Truong, Ngoc; Asare, Andy Ohemeng",Glob Public Health,710,5

We evaluated characteristics associated with obtaining a COVID-19 test from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and receiving a positive test result for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence.","Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Purnell, Amanda L; Kiang, Mathew V; Osborne, Thomas F",Public Health Rep,710,29

We reconstructed global transmissions and potential demographic expansions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 based on genomic information. We found that intercontinental transmissions were rare in January and early February but drastically increased since late February. After world-wide implements of travel restrictions, the transmission frequencies decreased to a low level in April. We identified a total of 88 potential demographic expansions over the world based on the star-radiative networks and 75 of them were found in Europe and North America. The expansion numbers peaked in March and quickly dropped since April. These findings are highly concordant with epidemic reports and modelling results and highlight the significance of quarantine validity on the global spread of COVID-19.

Common risk factors for the development of post-extubation stridor include female gender, older age, and prolonged length of mechanical ventilation. There may be an increased incidence of post-extubation stridor in patients who require mechanical ventilation to manage the respiratory complications of COVID-19. In this case series, we analyzed nine patients from across our institution who were intubated to manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 and subsequently developed post-extubation stridor. The patients were predominantly females with prolonged intubations and multiple days of prone ventilation. While the patients in this case series possessed some of the well-described risk factors for post-extubation stridor, there may be risk factors specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that make these patients more susceptible to the complication. The cuff leak test was performed on the majority of patients in the case series and did not successfully predict successful extubation in this population. Our analysis suggests that prophylactic corticosteroids given in the 24-48 hours prior to elective extubation in female COVID-19 patients who were intubated for more than six days with consecutive days of intermittent prone ventilation may be helpful in reducing the incidence of post-extubation stridor in this population. Overall, this case series elucidates the need for exceptionally close monitoring of COVID-19 patients upon extubation for the development of stridor.","Moran, Joseph V; Godil, Sara A; Goldner, Breanna; Godil, Kareem; Aslam, Jonaid",Cureus,710,16

The co-existence of these epidemics has necessitated care practice changes, including the use of telehealth-based encounters for the diagnosis and management of opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS: We describe the development of the ""Addiction Telehealth Program"" (ATP), a telephone-based program to reduce treatment access barriers for people with substance use disorders staying at San Francisco's COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine (I&Q) sites. Telehealth encounters were documented in the electronic medical record and an internal tracking system for the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 Containment Response. Descriptive statistics were collected on a case series of patients initiated on buprenorphine at I&Q sites and indicators of feasibility were measured. RESULTS: Between April 10 and May 25, 2020, ATP consulted on the management of opioid, alcohol, GHB, marijuana, and stimulant use for 59 I&Q site guests. Twelve patients were identified with untreated OUD and newly prescribed buprenorphine. Of these, all were marginally housed, 67% were Black, and 58% had never previously been prescribed medications for OUD. Four self-directed early discharge from I&Q-1 prior to and 3 after initiating buprenorphine. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 reported continuing to take buprenorphine at the time of I&Q discharge and 1 discontinued. No patients started on buprenorphine sustained significant adverse effects, required emergency care, or experienced overdose. CONCLUSIONS: ATP demonstrates the feasibility of telephone-based management of OUD among a highly marginalized patient population in San Francisco and supports the implementation of similar programs in areas of the U.S. where access to addiction treatment is limited. Legal changes permitting the prescribing of buprenorphine via telehealth without the requirement of an in-person visit should persist beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Mehtani, Nicky J; Ristau, Jessica T; Snyder, Hannah; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon; Knight, Kelly R",Subst Abus,710,16

The present study evaluated the clinical and nutritional characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explored the relationship between risk for malnutrition at admission and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted in two hospitals in Hubei, China. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were typed as mild/moderate, severe, or critically ill. Clinical data and in-hospital death were collected. The risk for malnutrition was assessed using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) via objective parameters at admission. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled, including 66 severe patients and 41 critically ill patients. Twenty-five deaths were observed, making 8.47% in the whole population and 37.88% in the critically ill subgroup. Patients had significant differences in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory biomarkers among three types of disease severity. Patients with lower GNRI and PNI, as well as higher CONUT scores, had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the good prognostic implication of GNRI and CONUT score. The multivariate logistic regression showed that baseline nutritional status, assessed by GNRI, PNI, or CONUT score, was a prognostic indicator for in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite variant screening tools, poor nutritional status was associated with in-hospital death in patients infected with COVID-19. This study highlighted the importance of nutritional screening at admission and the new insight of nutritional monitoring or therapy.","Song, Feier; Ma, Huan; Wang, Shouhong; Qin, Tiehe; Xu, Qing; Yuan, Huiqing; Li, Fei; Wang, Zhonghua; Liao, Youwan; Tan, Xiaoping; Song, Xiuchan; Zhang, Qing; Huang, Daozheng",Nutr J,710,33

This study aims to evaluate burnout status and mood disorder of healthcare workers during this period. An online questionnaire was voluntarily answered by eligible adult employees in a COVID-19 specialized medical center. The major analysis included the burnout status and mood disorder. Factors related to more severe mood disorder were also identified. A total of 2029 participants completed the questionnaire. There were 901 (44.4%) and 923 (45.5%) participants with moderate to severe personal and work-related burnout status, respectively. Nurses working in the emergency room (ER), intensive care unit (ICU)/isolation wards, and general wards, as well as those with patient contact, had significantly higher scores for personal burnout, work-related burnout, and mood disorder. This investigation identified 271 participants (13.35%) with moderate to severe mood disorder linked to higher personal/work-related burnout scores and a more advanced burnout status. Univariate analysis revealed that nurses working in the ER and ICU/isolation wards were associated with moderate to severe mood disorder risk factors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that working in the ER (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.14-6.90) was the only independent risk factor.

Therefore, it is imperative to understand the possible outcomes of COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate pulmonary function, exercise capacity, residual radiological changes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at follow-up in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia survivors. Materials and Methods: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiologically confirmed lung injury, with no chronic lung disease prior to this infection, were included in the study. Patients' evaluation 2 months after their discharge from hospital included spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC), determination of lung volume (TLC, VC, RV) and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO, adjusted for hemoglobin), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), chest CT scan, and 36-Item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). Results: Fifty-one patients (25 men, 26 women) were included. The mean age was 56 years (SD-11,72). Eighteen patients (35.3%) had experienced moderate COVID-19, 21 (41.2%) severe COVID-19, and 12 (23.5%) were critically ill. The mean follow-up visit time after the discharge from hospital was 60 days (SD-17). Pulmonary function at follow-up was impaired in 24 (47.2%) patients. Reduced lung volume was observed in 15 (29.4%) patients, DLCO reduction in 15 (29.4%) patients, and only one patient displayed obstruction. Twelve patients out of 51 (12/51, 27.3%) showed reduced physical capacity in the 6 MWT, and 3/51 (9.1%) showed desaturation, with SO2 < 90%. Different levels of abnormality were found in 49/51 (96,1%) patients on follow-up chest CT; the median radiological score was 10.9 (SD ± 8.87, possible maximal score, 25). Ground-glass opacity was the most common radiological feature, found in 45 (88.2%) patients. The SF-36 scores demonstrated a reduction in health status across all domains, with the lowest scores for limitations in social activities because of physical problems, vitality, and general health. Conclusion: In the group of COVID-19 pneumonia survivors 2 months after hospital discharge, residual changes in the lungs on chest CT and in lung function and reduced physical and HRQoL status were found in a significant number of patients.

In the course of universal admission screening with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay at our institution, we observed that 3.9 % (44/1123) of SARS-CoV-2 positive results were negative for the envelope (E) gene target but positive for the nucleocapsid (N2) target. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate during the three-month study period was 15.4 % (1123/7285), spanning April-June 2020. The majority of patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were asymptomatic, with 29.5 % of patients symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of presentation. Asymptomatic patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were significantly younger than symptomatic patients with the same results (average 37.6 vs. 58.4, p = 0.003). Similar proportions of prior SARS-CoV-2 positivity were noted among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (38.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.82). Among the 16 asymptomatic patients with radiographic imaging performed, four (25 %) had chest radiographic findings concerning for viral pneumonia. Interestingly, we observed an E-negative, N2-positive result in one patient with a previous SARS-CoV-2 by the Xpert Xpress that occurred 71 days prior. Critically, E-negative, N2-positive results were observed in 8 symptomatic patients with a new diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, though concerns remain about extended SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in some patients, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect patients with high Ct values (including E-negative, N2-positive results) is vital for retaining maximal sensitivity for diagnostic purposes. Our data show that a finding of E-positive, N2-negative SARS-CoV-2 should not be used to rule out the presence of subclinical infection.","Khoshchehreh, Mahdi; Wald-Dickler, Noah; Holtom, Paul; Butler-Wu, Susan M",J Clin Virol,710,22

We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., social and role functioning). All groups reported worse clinical outcomes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, PSY and RHV exhibited improvements in depression and anxiety from initial to follow up, whereas CTL continued to exhibit elevated levels. There was little change in community integration measures. Our results indicate that all groups reported increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic, but vulnerable Veterans were not disproportionately affected and had better mental health resilience (i.e., for depression and anxiety) as the pandemic progressed compared to CTL. This effect could be due to the availability and utilization of VA services for PSY and RHV (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Wynn, Jonathan K; McCleery, Amanda; Novacek, Derek; Reavis, Eric A; Tsai, Jack; Green, Michael F",J Psychiatr Res,710,22

Essential oil is reported to exhibit pharmacological properties, besides its common and well-known function as aromatherapy. Therefore, this study herein aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of essential oil extracted from leaves of Garcinia atroviridis (EO-L) against PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line. The cell growth inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) and selective index (SI) values of EO-L analyses were determined as 78 µg/mL and 1.23, respectively. Combination index (CI) analysis revealed moderate synergism (CI values of 0.36 to 0.75) between EO-L and 2 deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) treatments. The treatments of PANC-1 cells with EO-L, 2-DG and EOL+2DG showed evidence of depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The molecular mechanism causing the anti-proliferative effect between EO-L and 2-DG is potentially through pronounced up-regulation of P53 (4.40-fold), HIF1&#945; (1.92-fold), HK2 (2.88-fold) and down-regulation of CYP3A5 (0.11-fold), as supported by quantitative mRNA expression analysis.

While the focus is currently on recovery from the pandemic, the disease has significantly changed the way we practice medicine and neurosurgery in New York City and the United States. Apart from the emergency cases, several health systems across the country have similarly started to perform elective surgeries. Although COVID-19 screening and testing guidelines have been proposed and adopted by many hospitals, these may not adequately protect the operating room personnel who are in proximity to the patient for prolonged periods. There are concerning reports of especially high transmission rates of COVID-19 in transmucosal head and neck procedures conducted by otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons, despite attempts at wearing what constitutes appropriate personal protective equipment. METHODS: Here, we describe a simple technique of additional draping that can be used for all cranial, endonasal, spinal, and neurointerventional cases to limit the transmission of coronavirus. RESULTS: The proposed technique offers a simple, commonly available, cost-effective alternative that avoids the use of additional retractor systems. Moreover, this technique can be used in all neurosurgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: With the rising concerns regarding airborne spread of the virus, we expect that these precautions will prove highly useful as we enter the recovery phase of this pandemic and hospitals attempt to prevent a return to widespread infection. In addition, its availability and cost effectiveness make this technique especially attractive to practical use in centers with limited resources.","D039,; Amico, Randy S; Khatri, Deepak; Kwan, Kevin; Baum, Griffin; Serulle, Yafell; Silva, Danilo; Smith, Michael L; Ellis, Jason A; Levine, Mitchell; Ortiz, Rafael; Langer, David J; Boockvar, John A",World Neurosurg,710,19

Amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant of B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the trimer (A570D and D614G) as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region (N501Y), which comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2.

Mumbai was amongst the first cities to see the increase. In this report, we use our agent based simulator to computationally study the second wave in Mumbai. We build upon our earlier analysis, where projections were made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance, infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain the second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak and valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible scenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for Mumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February and mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate after around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this observed sharp convexity. This is not an easy phenomena to replicate, and we find that explanations such as increased laxity in the population, increased reinfections, increased intensity of infections in Mumbai transportation, increased lethality in the virus, or a combination amongst them, generally do a poor job of matching this pattern. We find that the most likely explanation is presence of small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that grows rapidly thereafter and becomes a dominant strain by Mid-March. From a prescriptive view, this points to an urgent need for extensive and continuous genome sequencing to establish existence and prevalence of different virus strains in Mumbai and in India, as they evolve over time.","Juneja, Sandeep; Mittal, Daksh",,710,15

However, the association between frailty and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle-aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged &#8805;50 years hospitalized with COVID-19 (March-July 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1-9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1-3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7-9). We also computed a frailty index (0-1; frail >0.25), a well-known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit-to-managing-well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30-day and 6-month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1-1.7) and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1-1.9) and 1.5 (1.1-1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4-2.3) and 1.9 (1.5-2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6-2.7) and 2.3 (1.8-2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill. The CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty compared with the Frailty Index (area under the curve = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93-0.95) and predicted different mortality risks within age and acute morbidity groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results encourage the use of frailty, alongside measures of acute morbidity, to guide clinicians in prognostication and resource allocation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Aliberti, Márlon Juliano Romero; Szlejf, Claudia; Avelino-Silva, Vivian I; Suemoto, Claudia Kimie; Apolinario, Daniel; Dias, Murilo Bacchini; Garcez, Flavia Barreto; Trindade, Carolina B; Amaral, José Renato das Graças; de Melo, Leonardo Rabelo; de Aguiar, Renata Cunha; Coelho, Paulo Henrique Lazzaris; Hojaij, Naira Hossepian Salles de Lima; Saraiva, Marcos Daniel; da Silva, Natalia Oliveira Trajano; Jacob-Filho, Wilson; Avelino-Silva, Thiago J",J Am Geriatr Soc,710,20

ASF has led to major economic losses and adverse impacts on livelihoods of stakeholders involved in the pork food system in many European and Asian countries. While the epidemiology of ASF virus (ASFV) is fairly well understood, there is neither any effective treatment nor vaccine. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the spread of ASFV in China by integrating the data of pork import/export, transportation networks, and pork distribution centers. We first empirically analyze the overall spatiotemporal patterns of ASFV spread and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of a number of geographic distance measures. These empirical analyses of ASFV spread within China indicate that the first occurrence of ASFV has not been purely dependent on the geographical distance from existing infected regions. Instead, the pork supply-demand patterns have played an important role. Predictions based on a new distance measure achieve better performance in predicting ASFV spread among Chinese provinces and thus have the potential to enable the design of more effective control interventions.","Yang, Jiannan; Tang, Kaichen; Cao, Zhidong; Pfeiffer, Dirk U; Zhao, Kang; Zhang, Qingpeng; Zeng, Daniel Dajun",Chaos,710,24

It easily accumulates in organisms and is transmitted along the food chain or food web for long distances and long periods of time. The experiment was designed to assess the TBBPA pollution levels in marine environments via environmental sample testing and risk assessment. TBBPA levels in seawater and zooplankton samples at each station (n = 38) were detected, whereafter the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and risk quotient (RQ) were calculated to evaluate the potential bioaccumulation and ecological risk of TBBPA to zooplankton, respectively. The results showed that TBBPA was widely detected in surface seawater and zooplankton samples in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, with levels ranging from ND (non-detected) to 0.46 µg/L and ND to 9.83 µg/kg (wet weight), respectively. In both the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, the distance from the shore was one of the main factors affecting the TBBPA concentration in seawater, regardless of visibility. The BAF was significantly correlated with the TBBPA content in zooplankton samples (P < 0.01), which ranged from 372.32 to 29,941.55, indicating that TBBPA exhibits an obvious bioaccumulation risk to marine zooplankton. The ecological risk assessment indicated that TBBPA levels in seawater pose a high ecotoxicity risk to zooplankton (RQ > 1). This finding suggests that both the significant bioaccumulation of TBBPA in marine ecosystems and its potential ecological risks cannot be ignored.","Gong, Wenjing; Wang, Junjian; Cui, Wen; Zhu, Liyan",,710,16

However, not all of this damage is attributable to the disease itself; much of it has occurred due to the prevailing misinformation around COVID-19. This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. Subject and methods: For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. Results: We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media. Conclusion: This review identified the nature and pattern of misinformation during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks, which could potentially be used to address misinformation during the ongoing COVID-19 or any future pandemic.","Chowdhury, Nashit; Khalid, Ayisha; Turin, Tanvir C",Z Gesundh Wiss,710,16

As hospitalized patients' respiratory function deteriorates, many will require endotracheal intubation. Airway management of infected patients risks aerosolization of viral-loaded droplets that pose serious hazards to the anesthesiologist and all health care personnel present. The addition of an enclosure barrier during airway management minimizes the hazard by entrapping the droplets and possibly the aerosols within an enclosed space adding additional protection for health care workers. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different barrier enclosure techniques during tracheal intubation and extubation.","Ibrahim, Mohamed; Khan, Ejaz; Babazade, Rovnat; Simon, Michelle; Vadhera, Rakesh",A A Pract,710,1

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate neighborhood-level deprivation and English language proficiency effect on disproportionate outcomes seen in racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in Minnesota between March 4, 2020, and August 19, 2020 PATIENTS: Polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 patients EXPOSURES: Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and primary language MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity, using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis as a marker of severity. Logistic and competing-risk regression models assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race, effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 5577 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included; 866 (n = 15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 vs. 40.4 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (n = 425 [49.1%] vs. 2049 [43.5%], p = 0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n = 381), 19.9% (n = 172), 18.6% (n = 161), and 11.8% (n = 102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity: Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). ADI was not associated with hospitalization. Non-English-speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes. Non-English-speaking accounts for differences across and within minority populations. These results support the ongoing need to determine the mechanisms that contribute to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity among minority groups.","Ingraham, Nicholas E; Purcell, Laura N; Karam, Basil S; Dudley, R Adams; Usher, Michael G; Warlick, Christopher A; Allen, Michele L; Melton, Genevieve B; Charles, Anthony; Tignanelli, Christopher J",J. gen. intern. med,710,24

It alerts on the risk of ignoring the female dimension of the current crisis and of resorting again to austerity programs that, like the ones enacted after the 2008 crisis, would hit women and mothers disproportionally harder than other groups. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data from the British Household Panel Survey on female participation and account for gendered constraints and enablers missed by mainstream economics. Using a sequential empirical approach, the authors simulate various welfare policy scenarios that address factors, such as childcare costs, personal and social nudges, that could help women back into the labor market in the aftermath of a crisis. Findings: The authors found that incentive-type interventions, such as subsidies, promote female labor market participation more effectively than punishment-austerity type interventions, such as benefits' cuts. Policies oriented to alleviate childcare constraints can be sustainable and effective in encouraging women back to work. Considering factors wider than the standard economic variables when designing labor market policies may provide fruitful returns. Originality/value: The sequential methodology enables to estimate current and counterfactual incomes for each female in the sample and to calculate their prospective financial gains and losses in changing their labor market status quo, from not employed into employed or vice-versa. Welfare policies affect these prospective gains and losses and, by interacting with other factors, such as education, number and age of children and social capital, prompt changes in women's labor market choices and decision. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cagliesi, G.; Hawkes, D.",International Journal of Social Economics,710,15

SF soldiers make up a disproportionate 60% of all Special Operations casualties. The objective of this study was to better understand SCI incidence in the SF, its mechanisms of acquisition, and potential areas for intervention by addressing key issues pertaining to protective equipment and body armor use. METHODS: An electronic survey questionnaire was formulated with the close collaboration of US board-certified neurosurgeons from the Mount Sinai Hospital and Cleveland Clinic Departments of Neurosurgery, retired military personnel of the SF, and operational staff of the Green Beret Foundation. The survey was sent to approximately 6000 SF soldiers to understand SCI diagnosis and its associations with various health and military variables. RESULTS: The response rate was 8.2%. Among the 492 respondents, 94 (19.1%) self-reported an SCI diagnosis. An airborne operation was the most commonly attributed cause (54.8%). Moreover, 87.1% of SF soldiers reported wearing headgear at the time of injury, but only 36.6% reported wearing body armor, even though body armor use has significantly increased in post-9/11 SF soldiers compared with that in their pre-9/11 counterparts. SCI was significantly associated with traumatic brain injury, arthritis, low sperm count, low testosterone, erectile dysfunction, tinnitus, hyperacusis, sleep apnea, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Only 16.5% of SF soldiers diagnosed with SCI had been rescued via medical evacuation (medevac) for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A high number of SF soldiers self-reported an SCI diagnosis. Airborne operations landings were the leading cause of SCI, which coincided with warfare tactics employed during the Persian Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other conflicts. A majority of SCIs occurred while wearing headgear and no body armor, suggesting the need for improvements in protective equipment use and design. The low rate of medevac rescue for these injuries may suggest that medical rescue was not attainable at the time or that certain SCIs were deemed minor at the time of injury.","Kessler, Remi A; Bhammar, Ansh; Lakomkin, Nikita; Shrivastava, Raj K; Rasouli, Jonathan J; Steinberger, Jeremy; Bederson, Joshua; Hadjipanayis, Constantinos G; Benzil, Deborah L",J Neurosurg Spine,710,24

We emphasize how critical smell is and how the widespread loss of smell due to COVID-19 will impact human-system interaction. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 reduces the sense of smell in people who contract the disease. Thus far, olfaction has received relatively little attention from human factors/ergonomics professionals. While smell is not a primary means of human-system communication, humans rely on smell in many important ways related to both quality of life and safety. METHOD: We briefly review and synthesize the rapidly expanding literature through September 2020 on the topic of smell loss caused by COVID-19. We interpret findings in terms of their relevance to human factors/ergonomics researchers and practitioners. RESULTS: Since March 2020 dozens of articles have been published that report smell loss in COVID-19 patients. The prevalence and duration of COVID-19-related smell loss is still under investigation, but the available data suggest that it may leave many people with long-term deficits and distortions in sense of smell. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the human factors/ergonomics community could become more aware of the importance of the sense of smell and focus on accommodating the increasing number of people with reduced olfactory performance. APPLICATION: We present examples of how olfaction can augment human-system communication and how human factors/ergonomics professionals might accommodate people with olfactory dysfunction. While seemingly at odds, both of these goals can be achieved.","Cameron, E Leslie; Møller, Per; Karn, Keith S",Hum Factors,710,30

METHODS: Presidents of SINC, LICE, and AITN endorsed three members per each society to formulate recommendations: classification of the degree of urgency of EEG clinical indications, management and behavior of physicians and neurophysiology technologists, hygiene and personal protection standards, and use of technical equipment. RESULTS: Scientific societies endorsed a paper conveying the recommendation for EEG execution in accordance with clinical urgency, setting (inpatients/outpatients), status of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (positive, negative and uncertain), and phase of governmental restrictions (phase 1 and 2). Briefly, in phase 1, EEG was recommended only for those acute/subacute neurological symptoms where EEG is necessary for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy. Outpatient examinations should be avoided in phase 1, while they should be recommended in urgent cases in phase 2 when they could prevent an emergency room access. Reduction of staff contacts must be encouraged through rescheduling job shifts. The use of disposable electrodes and dedicated EEG devices for COVID-19-positive patients are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: During the different phases of COVID-19 pandemic, the EEG should be reserved for patients really benefiting from its execution in terms of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and avoidance of emergency room access.","Grippo, Antonello; Assenza, Giovanni; Scarpino, Maenia; Broglia, Lidia; Cilea, Rosalia; Galimberti, Carlo Andrea; Lanzo, Giovanni; Michelucci, Roberto; Tassi, Laura; Vergari, Maurizio; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Mecarelli, Oriano",Neurol Sci,710,16

This article provides insights for public agents in the Brazilian municipalities to deal with the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed the actions taken by city halls of the 52 Brazilian municipalities at least thirty days since the first confirmed case of COVID-19. We used a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to identify the combinations of contextual factors and public actions that reduced COVID-19 transmission during the critical initial stage. The empirical results show three main paths to guide policy-making: (1) a plural collaboration path involving public and private sectors, operating in a fragile health system; (2) a public action path providing aid programs through intense collaboration inside public bureaucracy; and (3) a resource-based path relying on a well-structured health system.","Ito, Nobuiuki Costa; Pongeluppe, Leandro Simões",Rev. adm. pública (Online),710,1

Methods: In this retrospective study, moderate and severe disease was defined according to the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of 172 patients with laboratory-confirmed moderate COVID-19 were collected when they were admitted to the Cancer Center of Wuhan Union Hospital between February 13, 2020 and February 25, 2020. This cohort was followed to March 14, 2020. The outcomes, being discharged as mild cases or developing into severe cases, were categorized into two groups. The data were compared and analyzed with univariate logistic regression to identify the features that differed significantly between the two groups. Based on machine learning algorithms, a further feature selection procedure was performed to identify the features that can contribute the most to the prediction of disease severity. Results: Of the 172 patients, 112 were discharged as mild cases, and 60 developed into severe cases. Four clinical characteristics and 18 laboratory findings showed significant differences between the two groups in the statistical test (P<0.01) and univariate logistic regression analysis (P<0.01). In the further feature selection procedure, six features were chosen to obtain the best performance in discriminating the two groups with a linear kernel support vector machine. The mean accuracy was 91.38%, with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.94. The six features included interleukin-6, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, chest distress and calcium level. Conclusions: With the data collected at admission, the combination of one clinical characteristic and five laboratory findings contributed the most to the discrimination between the two groups with a linear kernel support vector machine classifier. These factors may be risk factors that can be used to perform a prognostic prediction regarding the severity of the disease for patients with moderate COVID-19 in the early stage of the disease.","Zhao, Chen; Bai, Yan; Wang, Cencen; Zhong, Yanyan; Lu, Na; Tian, Li; Cai, Fucheng; Jin, Runming",Int J Med Sci,710,20

No study has evaluated the relationship between VAP and mortality in this population, or compared this relationship between SARS-CoV-2 patients and other populations. The main objective of our study was to determine the relationship between VAP and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: Planned ancillary analysis of a multicenter retrospective European cohort. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. Univariable and multivariable marginal Cox's regression models, with cause-specific hazard for duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, were used to compare outcomes between study groups. Extubation, and ICU discharge alive were considered as events of interest, and mortality as competing event. FINDINGS: Of 1576 included patients, 568 were SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 482 influenza pneumonia, and 526 no evidence of viral infection at ICU admission. VAP was associated with significantly higher risk for 28-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.16-2.47), p = 0.006), and influenza groups (1.75 (1.03-3.02), p = 0.045), but not in the no viral infection group (1.07 (0.64-1.78), p = 0.79). VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation in the SARS-CoV-2 group, but not in the influenza or no viral infection groups. VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of ICU stay in the 3 study groups. No significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to VAP between the 3 groups, suggesting that the impact of VAP on mortality was not different between study groups. INTERPRETATION: VAP was associated with significantly increased 28-day mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, did not significantly modify the relationship between VAP and 28-day mortality.

Neuropsychologists have sought to establish new guidelines and care models using telehealth neuropsychology (teleNP) services. The need to adapt to remote technology became the most difficult challenge to date for existing practice models. Results: Primary considerations for transitioning to teleNP include scope and limitations of the telehealth modality, informed consent for telehealth services, patient privacy and confidentiality, test security, and validity of telehealth assessments. Given timelines for fully re-opening clinical settings, access to traditional models of neuropsychological care remains unclear. These considerations will remain relevant even upon return to an in-office practice, as many assessment models will likely continue with teleNP to some extent. Specialists will need to consider the unique needs of their populations in ensuring quality care, as diagnostic differences and patient age will impact participation in teleNP. Conclusions: As the COVID-19 pandemic lingers, teleNP presents an opportunity as well as a challenge for neuropsychologists looking to provide patient care in the context of social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions. In this transformative time, the field of neuropsychology has opportunities to advance beyond traditional settings and focus on alternative delivery of patient care.","Hewitt, Kelsey C; Rodgin, Sandra; Loring, David W; Pritchard, Alison E; Jacobson, Lisa A",Clin Neuropsychol,710,25

There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation.

However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 3·7% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection. COVID-19 has highlighted major issues in the capacity and resilience of the health and care system. We recommend an independent review to examine the precise amount of additional funds that are required to better equip the UK to withstand further acute shocks and major threats to health.","Charlesworth, Anita; Anderson, Michael; Donaldson, Cam; Johnson, Paul; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair; McKee, Martin; Mossialos, Elias; Smith, Peter; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael",Lancet,710,33

In particular, in the current epidemiological situation caused by COVID-19 pandemic, swift and accurate prediction of disease diagnosis with machine learning algorithms could facilitate identification and care of vulnerable clusters of population, such as those having multi-morbidity conditions. In order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are imperative. First, with respect to data collection and representation, we face severe problems due to multitude of formats and lack of coherency prevalent in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This causes hindrance in extraction of valuable information contained in EHRs. Currently, no universal global data standard has been established. As a useful solution, we develop and publish a Python package to transform public health dataset into an easy to access universal format. This data transformation to an international health data format facilitates researchers to easily combine EHR datasets with clinical datasets of diverse formats. Second, machine learning algorithms that predict multiple disease diagnosis categories simultaneously remain underdeveloped. We propose two novel model architectures in this regard. First, DeepObserver, which uses structured numerical data to predict the diagnosis categories and second, ClinicalBERT_Multi, that incorporates rich information available in clinical notes via natural language processing methods and also provides interpretable visualizations to medical practitioners. We show that both models can predict multiple diagnoses simultaneously with high accuracy.","Franz, Leopold; Shrestha, Yash Raj; Paudel, Bibek",,710,16

In the field of respiratory diseases, specific clinical models such as sheep and cotton rat for bronchiolitis, or ferret and Syrian hamster for influenza and Covid-19, have been successfully developed, however, in these species, the toolbox for biological analysis remains scarce. In this view the porcine medical model is appearing as the third, intermediate, choice, between murine and primate. Herein we would like to present the pros and cons of pig as a model for acquired respiratory conditions, through an immunological point of view.

One challenge has been to promptly recognise non-COVID-19 conditions. Cognitive bias due to the availability heuristic may cause difficulties in reaching the correct diagnosis. Confirmation bias may also affect imaging interpretation.

To help mitigate bias, there is no substitute for thoughtful clinical assessment and critical appraisal when evaluating new information and formulating the differential diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS: The availability heuristic during the recent pandemic may lead to cognitive bias in favour of COVID-19 diagnosis and delayed recognition of other conditions, especially in patients presenting with similar non-specific features.Confirmation bias towards COVID-19 can also affect the interpretation of pulmonary imaging which is central to the investigation of cases with suspected pneumonitis.Diagnostic bias can be mitigated by recognition and allowing time for a thorough clinical history and methodical examination of the patients.","Zieda, A.; Sbardella, S.; Patel, M.; Smith, R.

Previous studies predominantly focused on its place of origin, Wuhan, causing over estimation of the disease severity due to selection bias. We analyzed 465 confirmed cases in Zhejiang province to determine the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of COVID-19. METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management data from qRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 17, 2020, to January 31, 2020, were collected, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis for independent predictors of severe/critical-type COVID-19 and bioinformatic analysis for features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among 465 COVID-19 patients, median age was 45 years, while hypertension, diabetes, and chronic liver disease were the most common comorbidities.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman reported blurry vision OS 1 month after a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Left eye fundus examination revealed multiple peripapillary atrophic lesions, adjacent to a larger diffuse, ill-defined, yellow-whitish deep amoeboid-like patch, involving the peripapillary region and extending temporally to the fovea. Multimodal imaging including fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography was consistent with serpiginous choroiditis. A complete systemic work-up was performed to exclude potential infectious or inflammatory etiologies. The active choroidal lesions responded to high dose corticosteroids, with functional improvement. Immunomodulatory therapy with methotrexate was initiated for long-term management. CONCLUSION: Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare but important sight-threatening condition that has been previously associated to viral infections, which seem to have a role in the induction and/or perpetuation of choroidal inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to have played a role as a possible trigger for intraocular inflammation in this case. Therefore, COVID-19 patients reporting visual symptoms should be carefully evaluated in order to obtain adequate ophthalmological management to avoid irreversible visual damage.","Providência, Joana; Fonseca, Cristina; Henriques, Filipe; Proença, Rui",Eur J Ophthalmol,710,16

These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

The Israeli defense force deployed further means to contain the disease, including putting units in quarantine, physical distancing and using masks, gowns and disinfectants when in contact with suspected patients. METHODS: We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) tests to screen for patients among asymptomatic soldiers within units participating in civilian aid or in close contact with known patients, using personal protective equipment. Positive results were repeated and followed with serological testing to verify the nature of results. RESULTS: Between April and May 2020, we screened a total of 1,453 soldiers in 13 different units. We found 11 false positive results, leading to unnecessary measures until resolution, and three true positive results (0.2%). All true positive results had unreported symptoms concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 disease. These results led to the resolution of this screening policy. CONCLUSION: Screening asymptomatic army personnel in this setting with rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is not warranted and leads to unnecessary false positive results. Efforts should be directed at identifying symptomatic patients.","Tsur, Adili; Furer, Arik; Avramovich, Eva; Karp, Erez; Twig, Gilad; Bader, Tarif; Almakias, Miki; Fink, Noam",Mil. med,710,1

We have chosen four foci, each of which contributes to the formation of a historical and theoretical context. First, we embed representations of death within a broad horizon informed by history of religion and cultural history. Beginning with early Christianity's ascent in a cult of the dead and, later, a cult of saints, to the change from burials inside the church to graveyards, we track the coinciding weakening of representations of the afterlife in the modern era. This naturally leads to a discussion of two prior cases in which an epidemic has elicited reactions from Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark: The Cholera epidemic of 1853 and the Spanish Flu in 1918-20. Then we expand our line of inquiry to a more general discussion of how major theories in the Study of Religion have modelled the relation between religion, death and suffering. Following a short introduction to how the human consciousness of death has been conceived as a major causal factor in both the emergence and maintenance of religious beliefs and institutions by major theoreticians of religion, we discuss a number of more recent psychological and sociological theories, that have informed the theoretical foundation of our investigation. In order to capture the praxis dimension of religion, we shortly discuss the particular role of ritual, before, finally presenting the 16 research questions that informed the construction of our survey. © 2021 Aarhus Universitet.

GC-MS with Cold EI is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold sample compounds in the SMB in a fly-through ion source (hence the name Cold EI). GC-MS with Cold EI improves all the performance aspects of GC-MS, enables the analysis of Cannabinoids with OH groups without derivatization, while providing enhanced molecular ions for improved identification, and enables internal quantitation without calibration. We found over 50 cannabinoid compounds including a new one with a Cold EI mass spectrum very similar to delta 9-THC as well as relatively large cannabinoids with molecular weight above m/z = 400. Because the analysis was universal in full scan and not targeted, we found impurities such as bromo CBD and fluticasone propionate and could monitor the formation of oxidized CBD during decarboxylation. In addition, GC-MS with Cold EI enabled nontargeted full analysis of terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpinols in cannabis extracts with good internal quantitation. GC-MS with Cold EI further served with very good sensitivity for the concentration determination of delta 9-THC in CBD-related products. Finally, cannabis drugs such as EP-1 used in Israel for treatment of epilepsy and for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were analyzed for their full cannabinoids content for learning on the entourage effect and for drug activity optimization.","Amirav, Aviv; Neumark, Benny; Margolin Eren, Ksenia J; Fialkov, Alexander B; Tal, Noam",J Mass Spectrom,710,16

Medical, clinical, and scientific efforts have focused on searching for new prevention and treatment strategies. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering focused on using stem cells (SCs) have become a promising tool, and the regenerative and immunoregulatory capabilities of mesenchymal SCs (MSCs) and their exosomes have been demonstrated. Moreover, it has been essential to establishing models to reproduce the viral life cycle and mimic the pathology of COVID-19 to understand the virus's behavior. The fields of pluripotent SCs (PSCs), induced PSCs (iPSCs), and artificial iPSCs have been used for this purpose in the development of infection models or organoids. Nevertheless, some inconveniences have been declared in SC use;for example, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is highly expressed in MSCs, so it is important to continue investigating the employment of SCs in COVID-19, taking into consideration their advantages and disadvantages. In this review, we expose the use of different kinds of SCs and their derivatives for studying the SARS-CoV-2 behavior and develop treatments to counter COVID-19.","Mata-Miranda, M.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzymes have received a good deal of attention as possible pathways involved in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis. As the experiments seeking to find potential medications acting on these pathways are being conducted in the early phases, having an ecological worldview on the relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 disease and the genetic differences in the genes involved in the RAS system could be valuable for the field. In this regard, we conducted a meta-analysis study of the prevalence of ACE (I/D) genotype in countries most affected by the COVID-19. In the meta-analysis, 48,758 healthy subjects from 30 different countries were evaluated in 116 studies, using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The I/D allele frequency ratio was pooled by a random-effect model. The COVID-19 prevalence data of death and recovery rates were evaluated as the latitudes for the meta-regression analysis. Our results demonstrated that with the increase of the I/D allele frequency ratio, the recovery rate significantly increased (point estimate: 0.48, CI 95%: 0.05-0.91, p = 0.027). However, there was no significant difference in the case of death rate (point estimate: 1.74, CI 95%: 4.5-1.04, p = 0.22). This ecological perspective coupled with many limitations does not provide a direct clinical relevance between the COVID-19 and RAS system, but it shows potential pathophysiological associations. Our results raise concerns about ethnic and genetic differences that could affect the effectiveness of the currently investigated RAS-associated medications in different regions.","Hatami, Naser; Ahi, Salma; Sadeghinikoo, Alireza; Foroughian, Mahdi; Javdani, Farshid; Kalani, Navid; Fereydoni, Mostafa; Keshavarz, Pouyan; Hosseini, Ava",Endocrine,710,16

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed in the aforementioned tissues. However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that the complement system was one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells. Infection of respiratory epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 generated activated complement component C3a and could be blocked by a cell-permeable inhibitor of complement factor B (CFBi), indicating the presence of an inducible cell-intrinsic C3 convertase in respiratory epithelial cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the interferon-JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system and NF-&#954;B as the main drivers of their expression. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, normalized interferon signature genes and all complement gene transcripts induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cell lines, but did not affect NF-&#954;B-regulated genes. Ruxolitinib, alone or in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, inhibited C3a protein produced by infected cells. Together, we postulate that combination therapy with JAK inhibitors and drugs that normalize NF-&#954;B-signaling could potentially have clinical application for severe COVID-19.","Yan, Bingyu; Freiwald, Tilo; Chauss, Daniel; Wang, Luopin; West, Erin; Mirabelli, Carmen; Zhang, Charles J; Nichols, Eva-Maria; Malik, Nazish; Gregory, Richard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Ghidelli-Disse, Sonja; Kolev, Martin; Frum, Tristan; Spence, Jason R; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Alysandratos, Konstantinos D; Kotton, Darrell N; Pittaluga, Stefania; Bibby, Jack; Niyonzima, Nathalie; Olson, Matthew R; Kordasti, Shahram; Portilla, Didier; Wobus, Christiane E; Laurence, Arian; Lionakis, Michail S; Kemper, Claudia; Afzali, Behdad; Kazemian, Majid",Sci. immunol,710,20

Although the psychological effects of home confinement in children have been described, there is a lack of longitudinal research examining the impact of the confinement over time. The present study analyzes the evolution of the psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents from three European countries with different restrictions. Parents of 624 Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years old completed the ""Impact Scale of COVID-19 and Home Confinement on Children and Adolescents"" two, five, and eight weeks after the lockdown. Results show a different pattern for each country. Children from Italy, the first European country that applied a lockdown, were better adapted than Spanish and Portuguese children the first two weeks after confinement but they were more psychologically impacted by home confinement at the eight-week assessment. Portuguese children, who followed a general duty of home confinement, were the best adapted to the situation, with no significant differences over time. A significant change was found in anxiety symptoms in Spanish children, with a decrease at the last assessment. Findings suggest that long confinements and hard restrictions affect children, so prevention measures should be applied during confinements to prevent psychological problems in children.","Orgilés, Mireia; Francisco, Rita; Delvecchio, Elisa; Espada, José P; Mazzeschi, Claudia; Pedro, Marta; Morales, Alexandra",Child psychiatry hum. dev,710,16

Formal one-parameter deformations of generalized Rota-Baxter systems are discussed from cohomological points of view.

In our institution, CTCA availability was increased in January 2020, and subsequently, expanded further to replace all exercise testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to assess the impact of increased utilisation of CTCA on length of stay in patients presenting with chest pain in the prepandemic era and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Study design was retrospective. Patients referred for cardiology review between October 2019 and May 2020 with chest pain and/or dyspnoea were broken into three cohorts: a baseline cohort, a cohort with increased CTCA availability and a cohort with increased CTCA availability, but after the national lockdown due to COVID-19. Coronary angiography and revascularisation, length of stay and 30-day adverse outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 513 patients (35.3% female) presented over cohorts 1 (n=179), 2 (n=182), and 3 (n=153). CTCA use increased from 7.8% overall in cohort 1% to 20.4% in cohort 3. Overall length of stay for the patients undergoing CTCA decreased from a median of 4.2 days in cohort 1 to 2.5 days in cohort 3, with no increase in 30 days adverse outcomes. Invasive coronary angiogram rates were 45.8%, 39% and 34.2% across the cohorts. 29.6% underwent revascularisation in cohort 1, 15.9% in cohort 2 and to 16.4% in cohort 3.

Then, this study uses a coding method to score, evaluate and compare the selection of more than 120 open health data portals supported by organizations in more than 100 countries or regions that are in the World's top confirmed cases of COVID-19 as released by the World Health Organization. Findings At present, open health data portals have shortcomings with regard to UX. Different types of open health data portals vary significantly in the dimensions of technical experience and functional experience, but the differences in the dimensions of aesthetic experience, emotional experience and content experience are not significant. Originality/value The constructed open health data portal evaluation indicator framework introduces users' actual application needs and proposes optimization suggestions for the portal to meet the needs of users to quickly obtain, reliable and accurate health data.","Wu, D.; Ma, L.; Zhang, H.",Electronic Library,710,24

However, policies that pressurize parents to vaccinate their children can undermine traditional clinical ethics standards (e.g. autonomy and informed consent). The aim of this paper is to argue that the ethical impact of vaccination mandates can only be determined in the context of the clinical encounter. Public debate on the topic tends to be general in nature and, as a result, issues that require clarification to help sustain the trust of service users are underexamined. In addition, ethical debates are hampered by a toxic dichotomy in the public sphere between those (anti-vaccinators) who claim a move away from parental choice is necessarily a serious ethical violation;and others (often health scientists) who neglect serious consideration of ethical issues. This predicament permits flawed ethical claims to be made, and to remain unchallenged. Despite this, ethical concerns ? including those relating to trust and individual freedom ? are fundamental to sustaining confidence in vaccination. This has recently been highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic which made accessing childhood vaccinations harder, leading to a further decline in uptake. The pandemic has also revealed the strength of public feeling towards infection control measures that restrict peoples? freedoms. In this paper I argue that to minimize the ethical disruption associated with the use of vaccination mandates, it is essential to focus more attention on their impact in the clinic and to accurately identify the drivers of such tensions.","Williamson, Laura",Clinical Ethics,710,12

ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical ACE-angiotensin â ¡ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.

In order to develop therapeutic interventions against this condition, one promising strategy is to target spike, the trimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that the virus uses to recognise and bind its host cells. Here we use a metainference cryo-electron microscopy approach to determine the opening pathway that brings spike from its inactive (closed) conformation to its active (open) one. The knowledge of the structures of the intermediate states of spike along this opening pathway enables us to identify a cryptic pocket that is not exposed in the open and closed states. These results underline the opportunities offered by the determination of the structures of the transient intermediate states populated during the dynamics of proteins to allow the therapeutic targeting of otherwise invisible cryptic binding sites.","Brotzakis, Z.

Medicine is not personal, health care professionals often have their hands tied by payers, and geography has too much influence on the quality of care available. This has to end, especially since we have the technology to create a truly patient-focused, whole-person approach-one that treats physical and mental health equally and meets people where they are in every sense. Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher quality, decentralized care that-when needed-brings specialty care to the masses. Other technologies have an important role, too.

A total of 80 serum samples from vaccinees acquired at different time points after vaccination was assessed. While positive or borderline serological response in the anti-spike protein assay was observed for all samples (90% both IgG and IgA, 6.3% IgA only, 3.8% borderline IgG only), only a single case of a falsely positive IgM was observed for the anti-nucleocapsid assay as expected due to this assay's specificity. Positive anti-spike protein antibodies were already detectable in the second week after the first dose of vaccination, with higher titers after the second dose of the vaccine. In conclusion, the combined application of anti-spike protein-based serology and anti-nucleocapsid-based serology will provide a useful option for the discrimination of vaccination response and natural infection.","Dörschug, Anja; Frickmann, Hagen; Schwanbeck, Julian; Yilmaz, Elif; Mese, Kemal; Hahn, Andreas; Groß, Uwe; Zautner, Andreas E",Diagnostics (Basel),710,15

Within only a few weeks, the outbreak took on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries. It was a significant issue to prevent and control COVID-19 on both national and global scales due to the dramatic increase in confirmed cases worldwide. Government guidelines provide a fundamental resource for communities, as they guide citizens on how to protect themselves against COVID-19, however, they also provide critical guidance for policy makers and healthcare professionals on how to take action to decrease the spread of COVID-19. We aimed to identify the differences and similarities between six different countries' (US, China, South Korea, UK, Brazil and Haiti) government-provided community and healthcare system guidelines, and to explore the relationship between guideline issue dates and the prevalence/incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: To make these comparisons, this exploratory qualitative study used document analysis of government guidelines issued to the general public and to healthcare professionals. Documents were purposively sampled (N = 55) and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The major differences in the evaluation and testing criteria in the guidelines across the six countries centered around the priority of testing for COVID-19 in the general population, which was strongly dependent on each country's healthcare capacity. However, the most similar guidelines pertained to the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and methods to prevent its contraction. CONCLUSION: In the initial stages of the outbreak, certain strategies were universally employed to control the deadly virus's spread, including quarantining the sick, contact tracing, and social distancing. However, each country dealt with differing healthcare capacities, risks, threats, political and socioeconomic challenges, and distinct healthcare systems and infrastructure. Acknowledging these differences highlights the importance of examining the various countries' response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a nuanced view, as each of these factors shaped the government guidelines distributed to each country's communities and healthcare systems.","Yoo, Ji Youn; Dutra, Samia Valeria Ozorio; Fanfan, Dany; Sniffen, Sarah; Wang, Hao; Siddiqui, Jamile; Song, Hyo-Suk; Bang, Sung Hwan; Kim, Dong Eun; Kim, Shihoon; Groer, Maureen",BMC Public Health,710,16

Design and settingUK-wide longitudinal qualitative study comprising online interviews and focus groups with email follow-up. Method50 participants were recruited from a previous qualitative study of the lived experience of long Covid (n = 23) and online support groups for people with persistent neurological problems following Covid-19 (n = 27). In remotely-held focus groups, participants were invited to describe their cognitive symptoms and comment on others accounts. Individuals were followed up by email 4-6 months later. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded in NVIVO. They were analysed by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in general practice, clinical neuroscience, the sociology of chronic illness and service delivery, and checked by three people with lived experience of brain fog. Results84% of participants were female and 60% were White British ethnicity. Most had never been hospitalised for Covid-19. Qualitative analysis revealed the following themes: mixed views on the appropriateness of the term brain fog; rich descriptions of the experience of neurocognitive impairments (especially executive function, attention, memory and language), accounts of how the illness fluctuated--and in some but not all cases, resolved--over time; the profound psychosocial impact of the condition on relationships, personal and professional identity; self-perceptions of guilt, shame and stigma; strategies used for self-management; challenges accessing and navigating the healthcare system; and participants search for physical mechanisms to explain their symptoms. ConclusionThese qualitative findings complement research into the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for neurological symptoms after Covid-19. Services for such patients should include: an ongoing therapeutic relationship with a clinician who engages with the illness in its personal, social and occupational context as well as specialist services that are accessible, easily navigable, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary.

There are various models of early integration, which may be classified based on setting of care and method of palliative care referral. Most successful randomized controlled trials of early palliative care have used a model of specialized teams providing in-person palliative care in free-standing or embedded outpatient clinics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has become a prominent model for palliative care delivery. This model of care has been well received by patients and palliative care providers, although evidence to date is limited. Despite evidence from trials that routine early integration of palliative care into oncology care improves patient outcomes, referral to palliative care still occurs mostly according to the judgment of individual oncologists. This hinders equitable access to palliative care and to its known benefits for patients and their caregivers. Automated referral based on triggering criteria is being actively explored as an alternative. In particular, routine technology-assisted symptom screening, combined with targeted needs-based automatic referral to outpatient palliative care, may improve integration and ultimately increase quality of life.","Mathews, Jean; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla",Curr Treat Options Oncol,710,29

It has always represented a permanent concern and a public health challenge over the course of human history, because of its severe epidemiological, and economic-financial implications. The present review aims at over-viewing the impact of tuberculosis on the Israeli healthcare system, its temporal trend and evolution, stratified according to ethnicities and minorities, the need of establishing new facilities and implementing screening techniques, public health strategies and diagnostic tests, following massive immigration waves from countries characterized by a high incidence rate of tuberculosis during the fifties-sixties until the nineties, and the policies implemented by the Israeli government in the control, management and treatment of tuberculosis, as well as the role played by Israeli prominent scientists in discovering new druggable targets and finding bioactive compounds and bio-molecules in the fight against tuberculosis. Israel represents a unique, living laboratory in which features of developed and developing countries mix together. This country as a case-study of immigrant, pluralistic society underlines the importance of adopting a culturally-sensitive community intervention approach. The understanding of the subtle interplay between race/ethnic host and pathogen factors, including the role of gene variations and polymorphisms can pave the way for a personalized treatment and management of tuberculosis patients, contributing to the development of new tools for targeted tuberculosis therapeutics, immunodiagnostics and vaccination products.","Bragazzi, N L; Martini, M; Mahroum, N",J Prev Med Hyg,710,20

Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation has resulted in the need for tracheostomy in some patients. The purpose of this international survey was to assess optimal timing, technique and outcome for this intervention. METHODS: An online survey was generated. Otorhinolaryngologists from both the United Kingdom and Abroad were polled with regards to their experience of tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive ventilated patients. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 50 respondents from 16 nations. The number of ventilated patients totalled 3403, on average 9.7% required a tracheostomy. This was on average performed on day 14 following intubation. The majority of patients were successfully weaned (mean 7.4 days following tracheostomy). CONCLUSION: The results of this brief survey suggest that tracheostomy is of benefit in selected patients. There was insufficient data to suggest improved outcomes with either percutaneous vs an open surgical technique.","D039,; Souza, Ayman; Simo, Ricard; Souza, Alwyn; Vaz, Francis; Prior, Andrew; Kanegaonkar, Rahul",Head neck,710,11

METHODS: This was a pooled analysis encompassing 3 pexidartinib-treated TGCT cohorts: 1) a phase 1 extension study (NCT01004861; 1000 mg/d; n = 39), 2) ENLIVEN patients randomized to pexidartinib (1000 mg/d for 2 weeks and then 800 mg/d; n = 61), and 3) ENLIVEN crossover patients (NCT02371369; 800 mg/d; n = 30). Eligible patients were 18 years old or older and had a histologically confirmed TGCT that was unresectable and symptomatic. Efficacy endpoints included the best overall response (complete or partial response) and the duration of response (DOR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and the tumor volume score (TVS). The safety assessment included the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and hepatic laboratory abnormalities (aminotransferase elevations and mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity). The data cutoff was May 31, 2019. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with TGCT received pexidartinib (median treatment duration, 19 months; range, 1 to 76+ months); 54 (42%) remained on treatment at the end of the analysis (26 months after initial data cut of March 2017). The RECIST overall response rate (ORR) was 60%; the TVS ORR was 65%. The median times to response were 3.4 (RECIST) and 2.8 months (TVS), with 48 of the responding patients (62%) achieving a RECIST partial response by 6 months and with 72 (92%) doing so by 18 months. The median DOR was reached for TVS (46.8 months). Reported TEAEs were mostly low-grade, with hair color changes being most frequent (75%). Most liver abnormalities (92%) were aminotransferase elevations; 4 patients (3%) experienced mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity (all within the first 2 months of treatment), which was reversible in all cases (recovery spanned 1-7 months).

We show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by human and mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 restriction occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation, indicating a restrictive capacity distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx&#934; motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into infection enhancers. In sum, we uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal SARS-CoV-2 restriction.","Shi, Guoli; Kenney, Adam D; Kudryashova, Elena; Zani, Ashley; Zhang, Lizhi; Lai, Kin Kui; Hall-Stoodley, Luanne; Robinson, Richard T; Kudryashov, Dmitri S; Compton, Alex A; Yount, Jacob S",EMBO J,710,22

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing Abs are especially sought. Here, we report a possibly novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.7 × 10-12 M to 6.7 × 10-15 M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC50 < 6.7 × 10-12 M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara Garcia; Liu, Hui; Huynh, Daniel; Shelley, Greg; Keller, Evan T; Emmer, Brian T; Sherman, Emily; Ginsburg, David; Kennedy, Andrew A; Tai, Andrew W; Wobus, Christiane; Mirabeli, Carmen; Lanigan, Thomas M; Samaniego, Milagros; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Prak, Eline T Luning; Platt, Jeffrey L; Cascalho, Marilia",JCI insight,710,16

METHODS: A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the target population. The survey covered demographic and academic profile, general knowledge, preventive measures and perception about COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables, which were compared by type of institution and current year of enrolment using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 833 valid responses were received over 10 days. Students were able to identify the incubation period, main symptoms and contagious routes of the disease but struggled in recognising the name of the virus responsible for the pandemic. Hand washing before and after a dental appointment with a patient (97.7%) followed by the use of barriers to protect mucosa (97.2%) were the more frequently recognised measures to prevent COVID-19 spread in the dental office. As for the perception of COVID-19, 73.2% of the dental students perceived the disease as severe, whilst only 11.1% of them thought that COVID-19 is severe only for people presenting risk factors. Dental student's knowledge and perception were associated with the type of institution and year of enrolment. CONCLUSION: In summary, the dental students demonstrated an acceptable general knowledge about COVID-19, but dental schools will need to address gaps in knowledge, preventive measures, and perceptions to ensure a safer return to in person activities.","Aragão, Maria Gerusa Brito; Gomes, Francisco Isaac Fernandes; Pinho Maia Paixão-de-Melo, Letícia; Corona, Silmara Aparecida Milori",Eur. j. dent. educ,710,18

Using immunoinformatic methods, T-cell epitopes from spike, membrane, and envelope were selected for maximal HLA-binding potential, coverage of HLA diversity, coverage of circulating virus, and minimal potential cross-reactivity with self. Direct restimulation of PBMCs collected from SARS-CoV-2 convalescents confirmed 66% of predicted epitopes, whereas only 9% were confirmed in naive individuals. However, following a brief period of epitope-specific T-cell expansion, both cohorts demonstrated robust T-cell responses to 97% of epitopes. HLA-DR3 transgenic mouse immunization with peptides co-formulated with poly-ICLC generated a potent Th1-skewed, epitope-specific memory response, alleviating safety concerns of enhanced respiratory disease associated with Th2 induction. Taken together, these epitopes may be used to improve our understanding of natural and vaccine-induced immunity, and to facilitate the development of T-cell-targeted vaccines that harness pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity.","Meyers, L.

This study presents changes in CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO2 and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO2 exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O3 increased (p < 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO2 decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p < 0.05) were observed for NO2 (43%), PM10 (20%), and PM2.5 (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O3 concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p < 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO2 decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO2 decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO2 and PM2.5 emissions despite increases in O3, resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O3 within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles.","Hernández-Paniagua, Iván Y; Valdez, S Ivvan; Almanza, Victor; Rivera-Cárdenas, Claudia; Grutter, Michel; Stremme, Wolfgang; García-Reynoso, Agustín; Ruiz-Suárez, Luis Gerardo",Front Public Health,710,21

To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to multiple hospitals in the United States between March 2020 and July 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for study outcomes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for the effects of demographics and co-morbid conditions. RESULTS: Four hundred twelve patients were included in the study. Three hundred fourteen patients (76.3%) did not receive aspirin, while 98 patients (23.7%) received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days prior to admission. Aspirin use had a crude association with less mechanical ventilation (35.7% aspirin vs. 48.4% non-aspirin, p=0.03) and ICU admission (38.8% aspirin vs. 51.0% non-aspirin, p=0.04), but no crude association with in-hospital mortality (26.5% aspirin vs. 23.2% non-aspirin, p=0.51). After adjusting for 8 confounding variables, aspirin use was independently associated with decreased risk of mechanical ventilation (adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007), ICU admission (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85, p=0.005), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p=0.02). There were no differences in major bleeding (p=0.69) or overt thrombosis (p=0.82) between aspirin users and non-aspirin users. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin use may be associated with improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial is needed to assess whether a causal relationship exists between aspirin use and reduced lung injury and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Chow, Jonathan H; Khanna, Ashish K; Kethireddy, Shravan; Yamane, David; Levine, Andrea; Jackson, Amanda M; McCurdy, Michael T; Tabatabai, Ali; Kumar, Gagan; Park, Paul; Benjenk, Ivy; Menaker, Jay; Ahmed, Nayab; Glidewell, Evan; Presutto, Elizabeth; Cain, Shannon; Haridasa, Naeha; Field, Wesley; Fowler, Jacob G; Trinh, Duy; Johnson, Kathleen N; Kaur, Aman; Lee, Amanda; Sebastian, Kyle; Ulrich, Allison; Peña, Salvador; Carpenter, Ross; Sudhakar, Shruti; Uppal, Pushpinder; Fedeles, Benjamin T; Sachs, Aaron; Dahbour, Layth; Teeter, William; Tanaka, Kenichi; Galvagno, Samuel M; Herr, Daniel L; Scalea, Thomas M; Mazzeffi, Michael A",,710,20

In 2017, urban neuropsychologists and a pediatrician practicing in a rural region of New Mexico started to develop a teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) consultation service model to efficiently triage and determine a clinical course of action. This pilot project, aimed at expanding clinical access to specialized pediatric services in rural areas, evolved over the course of 2 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHOD: Providers earned the trust of the local community, gained understanding of pertinent sociocultural factors, and acquired knowledge of the clinical and educational concerns for the children residing in the rural community. The application of a culturally informed approach that highlights the importance of community participation and collaboration steered the decision to implement a TeleNP consultation model. By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated. RESULTS: We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine. We propose a clinical service decision tree with specific criteria to help guide providers on how to triage cases in order to increase access to specialized healthcare. CONCLUSION: The success of implementing a TeleNP consultation service hinges upon ongoing care coordination between providers, clerical staff, patients, and families with clear goals and expectations, maintenance of legal and ethical standards, and development of specific administrative and clinical processes supporting the use of TeleNP.","Sherwood, Andrea R; MacDonald, Beatriz",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,710,1

We tested whether risk communication messages that specify risks involved are associated with increased intentions to comply with public health advice during a pandemic. We conducted an anonymous online survey of the U.K. and U.S. public between April 24 and May 12, 2020. Participants (N = 2087) rated 14 COVID-related symptoms in terms of perceived severity and induced worry. They were then asked about their intention to practise social distancing in response to three public health messages: the standard U.K. government message: ""Most people will experience only mild symptoms""; the standard message ""unpacked"" by listing six of those symptoms as examples; and ""Most people will not require hospitalisation."" The unpacked message resulted in the highest intention to comply with social distancing (b = .22 [.04, .40], p = .02) and there was no interaction with country. Worry about symptoms was an independent predictor of intention to comply (b = .02 [.01, .03], p < .001). In the days before lockdown amidst a raging pandemic, the U.K. and U.S. governments sought to reassure the public.

Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation. Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19. The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (""Spanish flu"" 1918, ""Asian flu"" 1956 and ""the Hong Kong flu"" 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines. The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response. According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting ""lung crash"" until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.","Ietto, Giuseppe",Med Hypotheses,710,1

Some reports suggest that COVID-19 patients thatundergo an endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) should be considered potential superspreaders given the manipulationarea during the procedures and aerosols production while drilling over the paranasal sinuses. The number of direct andindirect tests for COVID-19 diagnosis are limited in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) and the time to obtain resultsmay vary between 5 and 10 days. Consequently, screening processes for all patients that require an EEA are limited in mostinstitutions in LMICs. Given this context, it is of utmost importance the development of different tools to decrease thetransmission of the virus. Objective: Develop a mask for patient placement during EEA that is easy to use, inexpensive, sterilizable, and reusable. Methods and Results: An initial model was designed based on the need to decrease the aerosols produced during drilling toredirect these particles to a container to prevent contamination of the mucosa of all health caregivers in the operatingroom. The mask was developed to cover both nose and mouth, while allowing proper endotracheal tube insertion andfixation based on a two-piece mount: a casted skin contact surface and a 3D printed mount for instrumentation andnegative pressure. Three holes were modeled in the mask: (1) one for the endotracheal tube (in the silicone surface), (2)one for surgical instrumentation (slightly larger, located in the middle allowing placement of a translucent sterile cover), and(3) a small one at the top that enables a suction line connection to create negative pressure ([ Fig. 1 ]). Patient's skincontact surface was created by means of a room-temperature vulcanizing silicone surface. Three anchor points for straps toadjust the mask to the patient's head for long periods of time without producing injuries. The 3D model was designed onAutodesk Fusion 360 and Meshmixer ( Fig. 2 ) and was built with polylactic acid (PLA) using a 3D printer (PRUSA IK3 MK3s,Prague, Czech Republic) in Bogota, Colombia. Tests were performed at the Microsurgical and Endoscopic Training laboratory,including ultraviolet (UV) light verification of fluorescein spread after bone drilling, chemical and heating sterilization, andsuction of aerosols produced by an electronic cigarette. The anatomical structure of the design was based on the masksused for anesthetic induction in a routine fashion and the senior surgeons' criteria when performing EEAs for anterior andmiddle fossa lesions. The measurements of the mask were standardized for adult patients. Conclusion: This study describes the development of a mask to improve the safety of endonasal endoscopic proceduresreducing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 between the patient and the surgeon, providing a rapid prototype of a low-cost mask.","Ordonez-Rubiano, E.

Evidence supporting its quality and safety is required. AIMS: Assess the efficacy and safety of telephone clinics in delivering care to established oncology patients and assess patient and health professionals' preference (telephone vs face-to-face clinics). METHODS: Retrospective chart audit in the month preceding and month following introduction of telephone clinics at the Gold Coast University hospital and a patient and health professional questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 1212 clinical encounters occurred in the month post the introduction of telephone clinics (vs 1208 encounters prior). There were no statistically significant differences in 24-h (18 vs 22, p = 0.531) or 7-day admissions (50 vs 46, p = 0.665) comparing encounters in the month prior to the introduction of telephone clinics vs the month post, but there was a statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality post systemic therapy in favour of the post-telephone clinic period (7 vs 0 patients, p = 0.008). Of the 222 patients who undertook the questionnaire, 42.3% preferred telephone clinics (95% CI 35.97-48.97), 25.2% preferred face-to-face clinics (95% CI 19.92-31.39) and 32.4% did not prefer one method over another. Of the 24 health professionals who undertook the questionnaire, 70.8% felt patients preferred phone clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, patients and clinicians viewed telephone clinics favourably.

To quantitatively assess these mitigation methods, we formulate an agent-based model of customer movement in a supermarket (which we represent by a network) with a simple virus transmission model based on the amount of time a customer spends in close proximity to infectious customers (which we call the exposure time).

Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus infected cells within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, Felix; Neufeldt, Christopher J; Cerikan, Berati; Prasad, Vibhu; Pape, Costantin; Laketa, Vibor; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Cortese, Mirko",J. virol,710,30

A microsimulation model was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among railway travelers and evaluated the effects of various NAT strategies. An extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was built to forecast local transmission during the Spring Festival period under different scenarios of testing strategies. The total number of infections, testing burden, and medical expenditure were calculated to devise an optimal strategy during the Spring Festival travel rush.

Based on these findings, this review recommends 1) greater exploration of community-based lifestyle interventions with high quality diabetes indicators (such as fasting blood glucose) in ethnic South Asian American communities, 2) expanding beyond traditional modalities of group-based lifestyle interventions and exploring the use of technology and interventions integrated with passive, active, and individualized components, and 3) development of research on diabetes prevention among second generation South Asians Americans.","Ali, Shahmir H; Misra, Supriya; Parekh, Niyati; Murphy, Bridget; DiClemente, Ralph J",Prev Med Rep,710,16

Over the past years there was a rise in reported incidents of respiratory disease in pigs in Norway, despite population wide freedom from Aujeszky´s disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine respiratory corona virus and enzootic pneumonia. The main objective of this study was to investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in conventional Norwegian fattening pig herds. The study included 14 herds. In seven herds with reported outbreaks of acute respiratory disease, data on clinical signs was recorded and samples for laboratory examination were collected. Diagnostic protocols were compared by parallel analysis of clinically healthy pigs from seven non-outbreak herds. RESULTS: The most commonly reported clinical signs were sudden deaths and dyspnea. An average compartment morbidity of 60%, mortality of 4% and case fatality of 9% was recorded in the outbreak herds. Post-mortem examinations revealed acute lesions resembling porcine pleuropneumonia in all 28 pigs investigated from the outbreak herds and in 2 of the 24 (8%) pigs from the non-outbreak herds. Chronic lesions were recorded in another 2 pigs (8%) from the non-outbreak herds. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was isolated from lungs and/or pleura from all tested pigs (n = 28) in the outbreak herds, and from 2 out of 24 pigs (8%) in the non-outbreak herds, one pig with an acute and another pig with a chronic infection. No other significant bacterial findings were made. Seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies was detectable in all outbreak herds analyzed and in six out of seven non-outbreak herds, but the risk ratio for seroconversion of individual pigs was higher (risk ratio 2.3 [1.50- 3.43 95% CI; P < 0.001]) in the outbreak herds. All herds tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and negative for influenza A viruses on oral fluid RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The main etiological pathogen found during acute outbreaks of respiratory disease was A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8. All pigs from outbreak herds had typical lesions of acute porcine pleuropneumonia, and only A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was identified. Co-infections were not found to impact disease development.","Cohen, Liza Miriam; Grøntvedt, Carl Andreas; Klem, Thea B; Gulliksen, Stine Margrethe; Ranheim, Birgit; Nielsen, Jens Peter; Valheim, Mette; Kielland, Camilla",Acta Vet Scand,710,20

OBJECTIVES: To present a model for rapid palliative care workforce expansion under crisis conditions, using supervised advanced psychiatry trainees to provide primary palliative services in the acute care and emergency setting. METHODS: In response to the New York City COVID-19 surge, advanced psychiatry trainees at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center were rapidly trained and redeployed to a newly formed psychiatry-palliative care liaison team. Under the supervision of consultation-liaison psychiatrists (who also served as team coordinators), these trainees provided circumscribed palliative care services to patients and/or their families, including goals-of-care discussions and psychosocial support. Palliative care attendings remained available to all team members for more advanced and specialized supervision. RESULTS: The psychiatry-palliative care liaison team effectively provided palliative care services during the early phase and peak of New York City's COVID-19 crisis, managing up to 16 new cases per day and provided longitudinal follow-up, thereby enabling palliative care specialists to focus on providing services requiring specialist-level palliative care expertise. CONCLUSION: By training and supervising psychiatrists and advanced psychiatry trainees in specific palliative care roles, palliative care teams could more effectively meet markedly increased service needs of varying complexity during the COVID-19 crisis. As new geographic regions experience possible COVID-19 surges in the coming months, this may serve as a model for rapidly increasing palliative care workforce.","Shalev, Daniel; Nakagawa, Shunichi; Stroeh, Oliver M; Arbuckle, Melissa R; Rendleman, Rebecca; Blinderman, Craig D; Shapiro, Peter A",J Pain Symptom Manage,710,16

METHODS: Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients' history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC = 0.95 ± 0.029 (95%CI: 0.95-0.96), accuracy = 0.88 ± 0.046 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89), sensitivity = 0.88 ± 0.066 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9) and specificity = 0.89 ± 0.07 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9)). CONCLUSION: Combination of radiomic features and clinical data can effectively predict outcome in COVID-19 patients.

Increasingly, tall buildings (TB) are common features of the urban landscape, yet their impact on urban air flow and dispersion is not well understood, and their effects are not appropriately captured in parameterisation schemes. Here, hardware models of areas within two global mega-cities (London and Beijing) are used to analyse the impact of TB on flow and transport in isolated and cluster settings. Results show that TB generate strong updrafts and downdrafts that affect street-level flow fields. Velocity differences do not decay monotonically with distance from the TB, especially in the near-wake region where the flow is characterised by recirculating winds and jets. Lateral distance from an isolated TB centreline is crucial, and flow is still strongly impacted at longitudinal distances of several TB heights. Evaluation of a wake-flow scheme (ADMS-Build) in the isolated TB case indicates important characteristics are not captured. There is better agreement for a slender, shorter TB than a taller non-cuboidal TB. Better prediction of flow occurs horizontally further away and vertically further from the surface. TB clusters modify the shape of pollutant plumes. Strong updrafts generated by the overlapping wakes of TB clusters lift pollutants out of the canopy, causing a much deeper tracer plume in the lee of the cluster, and an elevated plume centreline with maximum concentrations around the TB mean height. Enhanced vertical spread of the pollutants in the near-wake of the cluster results in overall lower maximum concentrations, but higher concentrations above the mean TB height. These results have important implications for interpreting observations in areas with TB. Using real world ceilometer observations in two mega-cities (Beijing and Paris), we assess the diurnal seasonal variability of the urban boundary layer and evaluate a mixed layer height (MLH) empirical model with parameters derived from a third mega-city (London). The MLH model works well in central Beijing but less well in suburban Paris.

Findings have consistently identified an increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with diabetes. Osteopontin, a cytokine-like matrix-associated phosphoglycoprotein, is elevated in diabetes and drives the expression of furin, a proprotein convertase implicated in the proteolytic processing and activation of several precursors, including chemokines, growth factors, hormones, adhesion molecules, and receptors. Elevated serum furin is a signature of diabetes mellitus progression and is associated with a dysmetabolic phenotype and increased risk of diabetes-linked premature mortality. Additionally, furin plays an important role in enhancing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by promoting its entry and replication in the host cell. Here, we hypothesize that diabetes-induced osteopontin and furin protein upregulation results in worse outcomes in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to the roles of these protein in promoting viral infection and increasing metabolic dysfunction. Thus, targeting the osteopontin-furin axis may be a plausible strategy for reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients with diabetes.","Adu-Agyeiwaah, Yvonne; Grant, Maria B; Obukhov, Alexander G",,710,20

But the mechanism for such protection is not clear. Here, we report that in damaged proximal tubules of high-fat diet-fed ApoE-knockout mice, a model of non-proteinuric DKD, ATP production shifted from lipolysis to ketolysis dependent due to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice. Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition-associated renoprotection is mediated by an elevation of KBs that in turn corrects mTORC1 hyperactivation that occurs in non-proteinuric and proteinuric DKD.","Tomita, Issei; Kume, Shinji; Sugahara, Sho; Osawa, Norihisa; Yamahara, Kosuke; Yasuda-Yamahara, Mako; Takeda, Naoko; Chin-Kanasaki, Masami; Kaneko, Tatsuroh; Mayoux, Eric; Mark, Michael; Yanagita, Motoko; Ogita, Hisakazu; Araki, Shin-Ichi; Maegawa, Hiroshi",Cell metab,710,32

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) emerges as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity due to the constellation of metabolic alterations it entails. This review outlines the impact MAFLD exerts on COVID-19 severity in obese subjects, besides the possible mechanistic links to the poor outcomes. The data collected showed that MAFLD patients had poorer COVID-19 outcomes than non-MAFLD obese subjects. MAFLD is generally accompanied by impaired glycemic control and systemic arterial hypertension, both of which can decompensate during the COVID-19 clinical course. Also, MAFLD subjects had higher plasma inflammatory marker concentrations than non-MAFLD subjects, which might be related to an intensified cytokine storm syndrome frequently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation and death. In conclusion, MAFLD represents a higher risk than obesity for COVID-19 severity, resulting in poor outcomes and even progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Hepatologists should include MAFLD subjects in the high-risk group, intensify preventive measurements, and prioritize their vaccination.","Vasques-Monteiro, Isabela Macedo Lopes; Souza-Mello, Vanessa",World J Gastroenterol,710,1

The main method of treatment of OA, apart from pharmacotherapy and surgery, is comprehensive rehabilitation. Advances in medical technology have resulted in the possibility of using computer-assisted interventions in rehabilitation.

It includes ten randomized controlled trials focused on the application of games and biofeedback in the rehabilitation of patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis. There are no conclusive reports that interventions based on VR are more effective than standard physical therapy. Moreover, evidence regarding patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is very scarce. The effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation is unclear, although interventions based on VR are promising in view of pain management, postural and proprioception training.

The residual tumor in CS is usually treated with adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), but there is little information concerning SRS as an initial treatment for CS-invading NFPA. In this study, we investigated the tumor control rate and clinical outcomes of the patients who received primary gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for CS-invading NFPA. METHODS: This was a single-institute retrospective analysis of 11 patients. CS invasion of tumor was categorized using the modified Knosp grading system. The median tumor volume and maximal diameter were 1.6 cm3 (range 0.4-6.5) and 17.2 mm (range 11.6-23.3), respectively. The median clinical follow-up period was 48.5 months (range 16.4-177.8). The median prescription dose at tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 11-25) and median prescription isodose was 50% (range 45-50). The maximum radiation dose to optic chiasm and optic nerve were 7.2 Gy (range 3.4-9.2) and 7.5 Gy (range 4.5-11.5), respectively. RESULTS: Tumor control was achieved in all patients. The median tumor volume and maximal diameter at last follow-up were 0.4 cm3 (range 0.1-2.3) and 11.4 mm (range 4.7-19.5), respectively. The median volume reduction rate was 52% (range 33-88). Six patients showed downgrading of modified Knosp grade after GKRS. No patients developed GKRS-related complications such as hypopituitarism or visual disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: SRS may be an alternative primary treatment option for CS-invading NFPA if there is no urgent and absolute indication for surgery such as optic apparatus compression.","Lee, Won Jae; Cho, Kyung-Rae; Choi, Jung-Won; Kong, Doo-Sik; Seol, Ho Jun; Nam, Do-Hyun; Lee, Jung-Il",Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,710,13

METHODS: The research was developed with the Fulni-ô people in the municipality of Águas Belas, Agreste of Pernambuco, Northeast of Brazil. In order to do this, we applied snowball sampling to select the participants. Data from potentially useful game species were obtained from lists and semi-structured interviews to register their particular kind of uses, capture periods (daytime, night, or both), preferences, and perceived abundance. The hunters who allowed their game meat captured to be weighed and identified were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Our records pointed to a vast repertoire of potentially hunting animals. However, we did not verify relationships between the abundance, seasonality, and biomass of the animals that were hunted by the Fulni-ô. We observed a total of 209,866 (kg) of game meat hunted in the studied group, belonging to 23 species, distributed in three taxonomic groups, the birds being the most representative group with 59% of total reported. CONCLUSION: Such consumption by the group is well below in terms of biomass when compared to other ethnic or local groups in other regions of Brazil, or in Caatinga areas, characterizing an activity much more of cultural character than subsistence. Also, the use of game meat among the Fulni-ô seems to be actively directed to the preferred species, suggesting that in the case of an urbanized indigenous community, where other sources of income are available, the demand for game meat is lower when compared to other ethnic groups.","da Silva, Josivan Soares; do Nascimento, André Luiz Borba; Alves, Rômulo Romeu Nóbrega; Albuquerque, Ulysses Paulino",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,710,29

The mortality rate may increase up to 25% in solid malignancies. In parallel to increased mortality rates among cancer patients, safety concerns regarding cancer treatment has increased over time. However, there were contradictory results for the cancer treatment during pandemic. In this study, we assessed the effect of cancer treatment on the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched on September 01, 2020. Primary end-points were severe disease and death in the cancer patients treated within the last 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. Quality of included studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The generic inverse-variance method was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for each outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included for this meta-analysis. Chemotherapy within the last thirty days before COVID-19 diagnosis increased the risk of death in cancer patients after adjusting for confounding variables (OR: 1.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-2.71). However, severe COVID-19 risk did not increase. Furthermore, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy did not increase the severe disease and death risk in cancer patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy increased the risk of death from COVID-19 in cancer patients. However, there was no safety concern for immunotherapy, targeted therapies, surgery and radiotherapy.","Yekedüz, Emre; Utkan, Güngör; Ürün, Yüksel",Eur J Cancer,710,20

To minimise infection risk, many people have been switched from intravenous to subcutaneous biologics including biosimilars. DESIGN: The survey was designed to understand comparative economic issues related to the intravenous infusion vs subcutaneous biologic administration routes for infliximab. The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Acquisition costs of medicines were not included due to data not being available publicly. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Semi structured single telephone interviews were carried out with twenty key stakeholders across the National Health Service(NHS) from 35clinical/42pharmacy/28commissioning roles. The interviews were undertaken virtually during April 2020 From interview(n=20) results a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. RESULTS: Key findings included evidence of significant variation in local infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% lower in the subcutaneous compared to infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times/reduced risk of COVID‐19 infection plus reduced patient ‘out of pocket’ costs. However, this was to some extent offset by increased pressure on home‐care and community/primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from infusion to subcutaneous routes is currently driven by the COVID‐19 pandemic in many services. A case for biologics (infusion vs subcutaneous) must be made on accurate real‐world economic analysis. In an analysis of direct/indirect costs, excluding medicine acquisition costs, subcutaneous administration appears to be the more cost saving option for many patients even without the benefit of industry funded home‐care.","Heald, Adrian; Bramham‐Jones, Steven; Davies, Mark",Int J Clin Pract,710,26

The aim of the current study was to identify respiratory coinfections in Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital and to identify its genetic resistance pattern using the respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The study included 40 patients, 32 males (80%) and 8 (20%) females with a mean age of 59.3 ± 12.6. Half of the patients had respiratory bacterial coinfections documented by pneumonia (PN) panel. The most common isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (10/20, 50%), followed by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumanni complex (7/20, 35%). Regarding genetic resistance, thirteen (13/20, 65%) isolates were proven extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Thirteen (13/20, 65%) isolates were proven carbapenemase-producing organisms testing positive for New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), oxacillinase β-lactamases (OXA-48), and Verona Integron-Encoded Metallo-β-Lactamase (VIM) (7/20, 35%; 5/20, 25%; 1/20, 5%, respectively).

We conducted a scoping review to map published interventions aimed at improving access to eyecare for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups residing in high-income countries. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for studies that described an intervention to promote access to eyecare for the target population. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts followed by review of the full text of potentially relevant sources. For included studies, data extraction was carried out independently by two authors. Findings were summarised using a combination of descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We screened 5220 titles/abstracts, of which 82 reports describing 67 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the USA (90%), attempted to improve access for Black (48%) or Latinx (28%) communities at-risk for diabetic retinopathy (42%) and glaucoma (18%). Only 30% included the target population in the design of the intervention; those that did tended to be larger, collaborative initiatives, which addressed both patient and provider components of access. Forty-eight studies (72%) evaluated whether an intervention changed an outcome measure. Among these, attendance at a follow-up eye examination after screening was the most common (n=20/48, 42%), and directly supporting patients to overcome barriers to attendance was reported as the most effective approach. Building relationships between patients and providers, running coordinated, longitudinal initiatives and supporting reduction of root causes for inequity (education and economic) were key themes highlighted for success. CONCLUSION: Although research evaluating interventions for non-dominant, non-Indigenous ethnic groups exist, key gaps remain. In particular, the paucity of relevant studies outside the USA needs to be addressed, and target communities need to be involved in the design and implementation of interventions more frequently.","Hamm, Lisa M; Yashadhana, Aryati; Burn, Helen; Black, Joanna; Grey, Corina; Harwood, Matire; Peiris-John, Roshini; Burton, Matthew J; Evans, Jennifer R; Ramke, Jacqueline",BMJ Glob Health,710,1

Support for mitigation efforts and negative affect (anxiety, fear, depression, and insecurity) were measured to examine the consequences of fatalism toward COVID-19. Results showed that the fatalistic messaging condition increased fatalism whereas the optimistic message reduced it. The effects of the messaging manipulation were also apparent in the downstream measures of support for mitigation and negative affect through the mediator of fatalism toward COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: Objective of the study was to perform a literature search and summarise the clinical features and prognosis of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) infected with COVID-19 from the published articles. SETTING: India. METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL and MEDLINE were systematically searched using specific keywords. The study assessed 2747 scientific studies involving COVID-19 and SCI for possible inclusion in a meta-analysis of SCI and SARS-COV-2. Studies involving persons with SCI who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal or throat swab polymerase chain reaction were included. RESULTS: Out of 2747 articles, 11 articles (206 participants), including six case reports, were included in this review. Fever was the most frequently observed symptom of COVID-19 infection in the SCI population. C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocytopenia were common abnormal laboratory parameters. The most common radiological finding in COVID-19 infection was ground glass opacities in lung fields. Prophylactic/therapeutic anticoagulation was given in a significant number of SCI persons infected with COVID-19. Persons with SCI who were diagnosed early showed good outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few studies published on COVID-19 and SCI populations since 2019, this study determined fever, elevated CRP, lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities, which indicated inflammation, compromised immune response, and lung edema, as the main clinical features of COVID-19 infection in SCI population. Though COVID-19 infection reported an increased number of deaths in few studies, a significant number of SCI populations with positive RT-PCR were treated successfully and discharged at home.","Barman, Apurba; Roy, Sankha Subhra; Sasidharan, Sreeja Kamala; Sahoo, Jagannatha",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,710,22

The purpose of this study was to assess the incorporation of synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits in a tertiary university-based ophthalmology clinic for low-income and uninsured patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: The records of 18 patients who were due for an in-person visit in the medically underserved patient clinic at our institute were reviewed. Patients considered high risk of ocular morbidity progression were approved to proceed with an in-person visit. Patients with non-urgent visit indications were attempted to be contacted by telephone to be offered a telemedicine telephone visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. RESULTS: Clinical triage by an attending ophthalmologist determined that 17 patients (94.4%, n = 18) had visit indications appropriate for evaluation by telemedicine. Six patients (35.3%, n = 17) were successfully contacted and offered a telemedicine visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. All 6 patients accepted, scheduled, and completed a telemedicine visit. Eleven patients (64.7%, n = 17) were not able to be successfully contacted to offer and schedule either a telemedicine visit or a postponed in-person office visit. Patients who were not able to be successfully contacted were on average younger in age and more likely to be female, Hispanic/Latino, from Latin America, with a preferred language of Spanish. CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits can be successfully incorporated in a tertiary university-based setting for low-income and uninsured patients.

Offices and emergency departments (EDs) were the first responders to the pandemic, followed by medical wards and intensive care unit (ICUs). Worldwide efforts sprouted to coordinate proper response by increasing surge capacity and optimizing diagnosis and containment. Within the complex scenario of the outbreak, the medical community shared scientific research and implemented best‐guess imaging strategies in order to save time and additional staff exposures. Early publications showed agreement between chest computed tomography (CT) and lung sonography: widespread ground‐glass findings resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on CT of COVID‐19 patients matched lung ultrasound signs and patterns. Well‐established accuracy of bedside sonography for lung conditions and its advantages (such as no ionizing radiation; low‐cost, real‐time bedside imaging; and easier disinfection steps) prompted a wider adoption of lung ultrasound for daily assessment and monitoring of COVID‐19 patients. Growing literature, webinars, online materials, and international networks are promoting lung ultrasound for the same purpose. We propose 11 lung ultrasound roles for different medical settings during the pandemic, starting from the out‐of‐hospital setting, where lung ultrasound has ergonomic and infection control advantages. Then we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID‐19 care pathways. Finally, we present outpatient use of lung ultrasound to aid follow‐up of positive case contacts and of those discharged from the hospital.","Boero, Enrico; Schreiber, Annia; Rovida, Serena; Vetrugno, Luigi; Blaivas, Michael",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,710,17

Split bowel preparation results in optimal cleansing. This study assessed the bowel preparation regimes advised by endoscopy units across the UK, and correlated the differences with outcomes. METHODS: Trusts in the UK were surveyed, with data requested between January 2018 and January 2019, including: the type and timing of preparation, pre-endoscopy diet, adequacy rates and polyp detection. Trusts were grouped according to the timing of bowel preparation. χ(2) test was used to assess for differences in bowel preparation adequacy. RESULTS: Moviprep was the first line bowel preparation in 79% of trusts. Only 7% of trusts advised splitting bowel preparation for all procedures, however, 91% used split bowel preparation for afternoon procedures. Trusts that split preparation for all procedures had an inadequacy rate of 6.7%, compared with 8.5% (p<0.001) for those that split preparation for PM procedures alone and 9.5% (p<0.001) for those that provided day before preparation for all procedures. Morning procedures with day-before preparation had a higher rate of inadequate cleansing than afternoon procedures that received split preparation (7.7% vs 6.5 %, p<0.001). The polyp detection rate for procedures with adequate preparation was 37.1%, compared with 26.4% for those that were inadequate. CONCLUSION: Most trusts in the UK do not provide instructions optimising the timing of bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. This correlated with an increased rate of inadequate cleansing. Splitting bowel preparation is likely to reduce the impacts of poor cleansing: missed lesions, repeat colonoscopies and significant costs.","Archer, Thomas; Shirazi-Nejad, Ahmad Reza; Al-Rifaie, Ammar; Corfe, Bernard M; Riley, Stuart; Thoufeeq, Mo",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,710,12

Among unsettled controversies is whether tobacco smoking increases or protects from severe COVID‐19. Several epidemiological studies reported reduced COVID‐19 hospitalizations among smokers, while other studies reported the opposite trend. Some authors assumed that smokers have elevated airway expression of ACE2, the cell recognition site of the SARS‐Cov‐2 spike protein, but this suggestion remains unverified. We therefore performed data mining of two independent NCBI GEO genome‐wide RNA expression files (GSE7894 and GSE994) and report that in both data sets, current smokers and never smokers have, on average, closely similar bronchial epithelial cell mRNA levels of ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2, coding for a serine protease priming SARS‐Cov‐2 for cell entry, and ADAM17, coding for a protease implicated in ACE2 membrane shedding. In contrast, the expression levels of TMPRSS4, coding for a protease that primes SARS‐CoV‐2 for cell entry similarly to TMPRSS2, were elevated in bronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with never smokers, suggesting that higher bronchial TMPRSS4 levels in smokers might put them at higher SARS‐Cov‐2 infection risk. The effects of smoking on COVID‐19 severity need clarification with larger studies. Additionally, the postulated protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide, which may presumably reduce the risk of a “cytokine storm” in infected individuals, deserve assessment by controlled clinical trials.","Voinsky, Irena; Gurwitz, David",Drug Dev Res,710,21

This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. METHODS: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March–July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. RESULTS: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","Oakley, Bethany; Tillmann, Julian; Ruigrok, Amber; Baranger, Aurélie; Takow, Christian; Charman, Tony; Jones, Emily; Cusack, James; Doherty, Mary; Violland, Pierre; Wroczyńska, Agnieszka; Simonoff, Emily; Buitelaar, Jan K; Gallagher, Louise; Murphy, Declan G M",BMJ Open,710,6

Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a regression model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. Materials and Methods: We applied machine learning techniques and provided a visualization of potential regions with high densities of COVID-19 as a risk map. We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in ""Dados do Bem"", an app-based symptom tracker in use in Brazil. Results: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4 - 4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5 - 2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). From the 287,714 users still not tested, our model estimated that only 34.5% are potentially infected, thus reducing the need for extensive testing of all registered users. The model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the state of Goias and found that of the 465 users selected, 52% tested positive. Conclusions: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies.","DANTAS, L.

Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others.

We described a rare case of left ventricular (LV) free wall perforation by an RV lead and the management of this complication.

New lead implantation was performed on the next day, but pacing failure occurred again on the second post-operative day (POD). We found the lead perforation on the fluoroscopy during temporary pacemaker insertion. Computed tomography scan and transthoracic echocardiogram showed that the added lead perforated through both the septum and LV free wall. A new lead was inserted on the fourth POD, and an off-pump open chest surgery for extraction of the penetrating lead was performed uneventfully on the 20th POD. DISCUSSION: We considered that some features of the lead (SelectSecure 3830-69, Medtronic) may be related to this complication, as the lead was very thin, had a non-retractable bare screw and was inserted with a dedicated delivery catheter.

We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral–host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3′ end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.","Zhang, Liguo; Richards, Alexsia; Barrasa, M.

Administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential treatment option during SARS-CoV-2, initially gained popularity, but later, its safe usage became questionable due to its cardiovascular safety, largely stemming from instances of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19. Moreover, in the setting of rheumatic diseases, in which patients are usually on HCQ for their primary disease, there is a need to scale the merits and demerits of HCQ usage for the treatment of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we aim to address the association between usage of HCQ and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and SCOPUS databases were used to review articles in English ranging from case reports, case series, letter to editors, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, observational studies and randomized control trials. HCQ is a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. As opposed to the reduction in CVD with HCQ in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases, safe usage of HCQ in COVID-19 patients is unclear; whereby, it is observed to result in QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes even in patients with no underlying cardiovascular comorbidity. This is occasionally associated with sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; hence, its clinical efficacy needs further investigation by large-scale clinical trials.

Previous phylogenetic analyses show its closest known evolutionary relative to be a virus detected in bats (RaTG13), with a common assumption that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a zoonotic ancestor via recent genetic changes (likely in the Spike protein receptor binding domain – or RBD) that enabled it to infect humans. We used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine the Spike-RBD’s functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus with RaTG13, dating to at least 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 likely possessed a latent capacity to bind to human cellular targets (though this may not have been sufficient for successful infection) and emphasizes the importance to expand the cataloging and monitoring of viruses circulating in both human and non-human populations.","Brintnell, Erin; Gupta, Mehul; Anderson, Dave W",bioRxiv,710,20

Since most lifestyle choices are habitual and a response to environmental cues, rather than rational and deliberate choices, nationwide policies targeting the context in which lifestyle behaviours occur may be highly effective in the prevention of CVD.

With an observed discordance between the concept and practice of altruism, and increasing attention to ‘pathologic altruism’, the role of altruism is blurred in present day medical care. In this background, the required balance of altruistic attitude which needs to be fostered in medical students needs clarity. This problem may be best addressed by the practicing clinicians. The objectives of this study were to explore clinicians’ understanding of altruism in the clinical context and to identify the key concepts of altruism which they felt, must be included in clinical practice. METHODS: It was an exploratory qualitative study to identify clinicians’ understanding of altruism and the key practice points for altruism. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted from 18 clinicians through Zoom and transcribed using Otter. Open coding of interview transcripts was done using Atlas ti 8 and grouped by commonalities under sub themes and themes. RESULTS: The main concepts regarding the clinicians’ understanding of altruism were prioritizing patients’ interest above oneself, favouring patients beyond routine duty and organized team work for practicing altruism. The essential practice areas identified for altruism were finding a balance between altruistic tendency and self/family life, identifying one’s individual capacity for altruism, establishing teamwork for developing a workplace altruistic attitude, and facilitating patients beyond routine duty. CONCLUSIONS: Altruism is an important professionalism attribute for clinicians, however prioritizing patients interest requires a balanced approach so that it is effective and sustainable. Workplace altruistic cultures may be better promoted through organized team-based approach rather than individual efforts.

Determinative beliefs regarding the 1918 pandemic include that infections were expressed as primary viral pneumonias and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, that pandemic-related deaths were the end states of the natural progression of disease caused by the pandemic strain, and that bacterial superinfections caused relatively fewer deaths in 1918 than in subsequent pandemics. In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specific vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on. Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between influenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic. Countermeasures (eg, vaccination against pneumococcal and meningococcal disease before a pandemic; mass uses of antibiotic(s) with broad spectrums of activity against common bacterial respiratory pathogens during local epidemics) designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of influenza-bacterial interactions should be major focuses of pandemic-related research, prevention, and response planning.","Brundage, John F",Lancet Infect Dis,710,16

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), making RdRp an excellent target for antiviral agents. RdRp is a multi-subunit complex composed of 3 viral proteins named nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 that ensure the ~30 kb RNA genome’s transcription and replication. The main strategies employed so far for the overproduction of RdRp consist of expressing and purifying the three subunits separately before assembling the complex in vitro. However, nsp12 shows limited solubility in bacterial expression systems and is often produced in insect cells. Here, we describe an alternative strategy to co-express the full SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in E. coli, using a single plasmid. Characterization of the purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shows that it forms a complex with the expected (nsp7)(nsp8)(2)(nsp12) stoichiometry. RNA polymerization activity was measured using primer-extension assays showing that the purified enzyme is functional. The purification protocol can be achieved in one single day, surpassing in speed all other published protocols. Our construct is ideally suited for screening RdRp and its variants against very large chemical compounds libraries and has been made available to the scientific community through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene ID: 165451).","Madru, Clément; Tekpinar, Ayten Dizkirici; Rosario, Sandrine; Czernecki, Dariusz; Brûlé, Sébastien; Sauguet, Ludovic; Delarue, Marc",PLoS One,710,22

Whether Chinese customers have the intention of using motion-sensing games to improve their health status in the home environment will directly determine the commercial potential of the relevant industry in the Chinese market. In order to understand the motives of users and explore the market possibility and prospects of the game industry, this study adopts empirical research and structural equation modeling to construct a motivation model of Chinese consumers toward motion-sensing gameplay behavior in the household environment. We distributed 515 questionnaires to conduct a survey; 427 valid responses have been received, and 203 data, which meet the inclusion criteria of the required game experience, have been analyzed by SPSS25.0 and AMOS25.0. A structural equation model for the gameplay motivation has been constructed. The result shows that the three functional motivators, exercise (Path efficient = 0.40, p < 0.01), entertainment (Path efficient = 0.27, p < 0.01), and social interaction (Path efficient = 0.36, p < 0.01) of home motion-sensing games have a significantly positive impact on the user’s intention to play. Furthermore, the diversity and the time-and-place flexibility variables exert an important positive influence on the users’ gameplay behavior through their effects on the three main functional motive variables. To sum up, (1) exercise, (2) entertainment, and (3) social interaction are the main functional motivations of the Chinese consumers’ gameplay behaviors; (4) diversity and (5) time-and-place flexibility are the two main attribute motivators.

Una mirada hacia el futuro",17.465698,-0.16391559,2021-03-27,"The determination of critical facilities in supply chain networks has been attracting the interest of the Operations Research community. Critical facilities refer to structures including bridges, railways, train/metro stations, medical facilities, roads, warehouses, and power stations among others, which are vital to the functioning of the network. In this study we address a trilevel optimization problem for the protection of depots of utmost importance in a routing network against an intelligent adversary. We formulate the problem as a defender-attacker-defender game and refer to it as the trilevel r-interdiction selective multi-depot vehicle routing problem (3LRI-SMDVRP). The defender is the decision maker in the upper level problem (ULP) who picks u depots to protect among m existing ones. In the middle level problem (MLP), the attacker destroys r depots among the (m–u) unprotected ones to bring about the biggest disruption. Finally, in the lower level problem (LLP), the decision maker is again the defender who optimizes the vehicle routes and thereby selects which customers to visit and serve in the wake of the attack. All three levels have an identical objective function which is comprised of three components. (i) Operating or acquisition cost of the vehicles. (ii) Traveling cost incurred by the vehicles. (iii) Outsourcing cost due to unvisited customers. The defender aspires to minimize this objective function while the attacker tries to maximize it. As a solution approach to this trilevel discrete optimization problem, we resort to a smart exhaustive enumeration in the ULP and MLP. For the LLP we design a metaheuristic algorithm that hybridizes Variable Neighborhood Descent and Tabu Search techniques adapted to the Selective MDVRP (SMDVRP). The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated on 33 MDVRP benchmark instances existing in the literature and 41 SMDVRP instances generated from them. Numerical experiments on a large number of 3LRI-SMDVRP instances attest that our comprehensive method is effective in dealing with the defender-attacker-defender game on multi-depot routing networks.","Ehsan Hesam Sadati, Mir; Aksen, Deniz; Aras, Necati",Comput Oper Res,710,26

A unique finding among COVID-19 patients was a decline of eosinophil levels (eosinopenia). However, results from previous studies on the relationship between eosinopenia and disease severity were inconsistent. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between eosinopenia and COVID-19 mortality as well as the clinical conditions that could potentially lead to mortality. Methods One hundred ninety patients diagnosed as moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 at hospital admission were enrolled. Data collected from patients’ medical records on the second day after hospital admission included medical histories, clinical symptoms, chest images of computed tomography (CT), laboratory examinations, and outcomes. Results Eosinophil levels were significantly lower in patients with critical disease, when compared to those with moderate and severe diseases. After controlled for confounding factors, i.e., age, gender, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, a progressive decline of eosinophil levels was independently associated with mortality. Moreover, eosinophil levels significantly and positively correlated with platelet and D-dimer levels but significantly and inversely correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. Conclusions Eosinopenia, if progressively worsening, indicates that COVID-19 patients may progress to critical disease and have a significantly higher chance of mortality. Additionally, eosinopenia correlates with biomarkers of coagulation disorder and those of tissue damage in kidney, liver, and other tissues.","Yan, Bingdi; Yang, Junling; Xie, Yan; Tang, Xiaolei",World Allergy Organ J,710,16

An important source of infection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a greater risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection than the general population. Globally, thousands of HCWs have lost their lives due to COVID-19 infection. AIM: Identify Incidence Rate and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 infection among health workers in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study carried from March to November 2020. HCWs selected by a Complete Enumeration Survey method. Data analyzed in frequencies and percentage tables. To test the differences, post hoc after chi-square-(χ(2)) tests were used. RESULTS: As of November 30, 2020, a total of 57,159 HCWs tested positive with COVID-19. Their median age was 34 years, and 53% were male. Nurses were the most infected HCWs category (36%). The most common source of infection was from the community (78%). The majority of HCWs who acquired the infection from healthcare facilities got the infection from another HCW (63%). There was a significant difference between community and healthcare-acquired COVID-19 in relation to gender (P < 0.001) nationality (P < 0.001) job categories (P < 0.001) three age groups (<26: P = 0.012, 26–35 and 36–45: P < 0.001), and among HCWs who worked in MOH and private healthcare facilities (P < 0.001). The total number of reported deaths among HCWs during the study period was 198, with a case fatality rate of (0.35%). CONCLUSION: This study findings show that infected HCWs characteristics were similar to the previous studies and indicate incidence rates of 10% among COVID-19 infected HCWs in Saudi Arabia. Analysis of the infection status of HCWs is critical, to understand their needs and challenges, improve protective measures, and provide effective recommendations for policymakers.","Al Bujayr, Anfal A.; Aljohar, Bashaier A.; Bin Saleh, Ghada M.; Alanazi, Khalid H.; Assiri, Abdullah M.",J Infect Public Health,710,33
