METHODS: A total of 346 regional journals (59 natural science, 118 engineering, 44 agriculture, fisheries, and oceanography, and 125 medical and pharmacy) and 141 international journals (32 natural science, 43 engineering, 12 agriculture, fisheries, and oceanography, 54 medical and pharmacy) were included in this analysis, which applied the journal review by the Korea Federation of Science and Technology. Websites of the journals and the submitted publication data in 2019 were reviewed. RESULTS: Except for a few journals, all of the journals were published by academic societies. Basic information of journals was well displayed by both offline and online. Most of the 346 regional journals were published in Korean language or mixed with English but 77 (22.3%), mostly medical, were in English. One-third (n = 104) journals published less than 40 articles while 9 published over 200, and 261 journals (75.4%) received less than 100 submissions in 2018. Most (n = 298, 86.1%) of them were enlisted in the Korean Citation Index (KCI). Editorial board members performed manuscript editing in 171 (49.4%) journals, and most of the journals paid < 50,000,000 won for publishing costs. Of 141 international journals, 138 (97.9%) were published in English and all of them published overseas submissions. Forty-one (29.1%) journals accepted < 20% of submissions but 58 (41.1%) accepted 100%. Of them, 124 (87.9%) were indexed in the KCI, 93 (66.0%) in the Web of Science, 120 in Scopus, and 62 in PubMed. Editorial board members in 38 (27.0%) journals took responsibility of manuscript editing. Publishing cost of 79 (56.0%) journals was < 50,000,000 won. Only 157 (32.2%) of total 487 journals, mostly medical, documented gendered innovation in their instruction to authors. CONCLUSION: Most of the Korean science and technology journals keep global standard of editing and publishing. Their offline and online visibility is acceptable but most regional journals are small and of low academic impact while international journals are globally indexed and acknowledged. Korean scholarly journals should invite more and better articles to keep quality publication.","Hong, Sung-Tae; Youn, Ho Shik",J Korean Med Sci,600,1

MAP is an intracellular pathogen with a possible zoonotic potential since it has been successfully isolated from the intestine and blood of Crohn’s disease patients.Since no cure is available, after the detection of the disease, animal culling is the sole applicable containment strategy. However, the difficult detection of the disease in its subclinical form, facilitates its spread raising the need for the development of effective diagnosis and vaccination strategies. The prompt identification and isolation of the infected animals in the subclinical stage would prevent the spread of the infection.In the present study, an immunoinformatic approach has been used to investigate the immunogenic properties of 10 MAP proteins. These proteins were chosen according to a previously published immunoproteomics approach. For each previously-described immunoreactive protein, we predicted the epitopes capable of eliciting an immune response by binding both B-cells and/or class I MHC antigens. The retrieved peptide sequences were analyzed for their specificity and cross-reactivity. The final aim is to employ the discovered peptides sequences as a filtered library useful for early-stage diagnosis and/or to be used in novel multi-subunit or recombinant vaccine formulations.","Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Greco, Viviana; Piras, Cristian; Arrigoni, Norma; Ricchi, Matteo; Britti, Domenico; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola",Pathogens,600,1

However, several tissues and cells have been described to possess an intrinsic RAS that acts locally through different paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. In the male reproductive system, several components of this system have been observed in various organs and tissues, such as the testes, spermatozoa and seminal fluid. Some functions attributed to this local RAS are maintenance of seminal plasma electrolytes, regulation of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, and sperm functions. However, their specific actions in these locations are not fully understood. Therefore, a deep knowledge of the functions of the RAS at both the testicular and seminal levels could clarify its roles in male infertility and sperm physiology, and the different RAS elements could be used to design tools enabling the diagnosis and/or treatment of male infertility.","Gianzo, Marta; Subirán, Nerea",Int J Mol Sci,600,1

Today, surveys of population genomic diversity are revealing extensive loss-of-function and gene content variation, yet the adaptive significance of much of this variation remains unknown. Here we examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive loss of function through the lens of population genomics and consider the challenges and opportunities of studying adaptive loss-of-function alleles using population genetics models. We discuss how the theoretically expected existence of allelic heterogeneity, defined as multiple functionally analogous mutations at the same locus, has proven consistent with empirical evidence and why this impedes both the detection of selection and causal relationships with phenotypes. We then review technical progress towards new functionally explicit population genomic tools and genotype-phenotype methods to overcome these limitations. More broadly, we discuss how the challenges of studying adaptive loss of function highlight the value of classifying genomic variation in a way consistent with the functional concept of an allele from classical population genetics.","Monroe, J.

This phenomenon is a common feature of many human disorders, such as cardiovascular disease. Many of the risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and obesity, are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, involving an elevated oxidative stress burden (either due to enhanced ROS production or decreased antioxidant protection). There are many therapeutic options to treat oxidative stress-associated cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies have focused on the utility of antioxidant supplementation. However, whether antioxidant supplementation has any preventive and/or therapeutic value in cardiovascular pathology is still a matter of debate. In this review, we provide a detailed description of oxidative stress biomarkers in several cardiovascular risk factors. We also discuss the clinical implications of the supplementation with several classes of antioxidants, and their potential role for protecting against cardiovascular risk factors.","Cammisotto, Vittoria; Nocella, Cristina; Bartimoccia, Simona; Sanguigni, Valerio; Francomano, Davide; Sciarretta, Sebastiano; Pastori, Daniele; Peruzzi, Mariangela; Cavarretta, Elena; D’Amico, Alessandra; Castellani, Valentina; Frati, Giacomo; Carnevale, Roberto; Group, SMiLe",Antioxidants (Basel),600,1

In addition, several polyphenols, such as phloretin, also have potential antiviral effects, making these compounds potential ingredients of biofunctional foods. A promising source for the extraction of phloretin is a by-product of apple production—apple tree leaves. Focusing on green technologies, the first aim of the present study was to optimize the direct ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions to gain the maximum yield of phloretin from air-dried apple leaves. For the optimization of process parameters, we applied the response surface method with Box–Behnken design. The optimal extraction conditions were extraction time 14.4 min, sonication amplitude 10% and 10 g of sample per 100 mL solvent (70% ethanol, w/w). Using these conditions, we assessed the content of individual and total polyphenolic compounds along with antioxidant activity in the leaves of different autumn and winter apple cultivars grown in Estonia. The analyses were carried out with chromatographic (HPLC-DAD-MS/MS) and spectrophotometric methods. The phloretin concentration ranged from 292 to 726 µg/g and antioxidant activity from 6.06 to 11.42 mg GA eq./g, these being the highest in the local winter cultivars ‘Paide taliõun’ and ‘Tellissaare’, respectively.","Ben-Othman, Sana; Kaldmäe, Hedi; Rätsep, Reelika; Bleive, Uko; Aluvee, Alar; Rinken, Toonika",Antioxidants (Basel),600,1

METHODS: In this cost of illness study, direct medical cost was calculated based on cost items related to outpatient visits, laboratory and radiological tests, hospitalizations/interventions, drug treatment, adverse events and metastasis. Indirect cost was calculated based on lost productivity due to early retirement, morbidity and premature death resulting from the illness, the value of lost productivity due to time spent by family caregivers and cost of formal caregivers. RESULTS: Cost analysis revealed the total per patient annual direct medical cost for small cell lung cancer to be €8772), for non-small-cell lung cancer to be €10,167. Total annual direct medical cost was €497.9 million, total annual indirect medical cost was €1.1 billion and total economic burden of lung cancer was €1.6 billion. Hospitalization/interventions (41%) and indirect costs (68.6%) were the major cost drivers for total direct costs and the overall economic burden of lung cancer, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate per patient direct medical costs of small cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer to be substantial and comparable, indicating the substantial economic burden of lung cancer in terms of both direct and indirect costs. Our findings indicate that hospitalization/interventions cost item and indirect costs were the major cost drivers for total direct costs and the overall economic burden of lung cancer, respectively.

The presence of livestock, such as cattle, which are used as blood meal hosts by some malaria vectors, may impact malaria parasite transmission dynamics. The presence of livestock may provide sufficient blood meals for the vectors, thereby reducing the frequency of vectors biting humans. Alternatively, the presence of cattle may enhance the availability of blood meals such that infectious mosquitoes may survive longer, thereby increasing the risk of malaria transmission. This study assessed the effect of household-level cattle presence and distribution on the abundance of indoor and outdoor resting malaria vectors. METHODS: Houses with and without cattle were selected in Chikwawa district, southern Malawi for sampling resting malaria vectors. Prokopack aspirators and clay pots were used for indoor and outdoor sampling, respectively. Each house was sampled over two consecutive days. For houses with cattle nearby, the number of cattle and the distances from the house to where the cattle were corralled the previous night were recorded. All data were analysed using generalized linear models fitted with Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The malaria vectors caught resting indoors were Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus s.s. Outdoor collections consisted primarily of An. arabiensis. The catch sizes of indoor resting An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) were not different in houses with and without cattle (P = 0.34). The presence of cattle near a house was associated with a reduction in the abundance of indoor resting An. funestus s.l. (P = 0.04). This effect was strongest when cattle were kept overnight ≤ 15 m away from the houses (P = 0.03). The blood meal hosts varied across the species. CONCLUSION: These results highlight differences between malaria vector species and their interactions with potential blood meal hosts, which may have implications for malaria risk. Whereas An. arabiensis remained unaffected, the reduction of An. funestus s.s. in houses near cattle suggests a potential protective effect of cattle. However, the low abundance of mosquitoes reduced the power of some analyses and limited the generalizability of the results to other settings. Therefore, further studies incorporating the vectors’ host-seeking behaviour/human biting rates are recommended to fully support the primary finding.

Telemedicine is critical for neuro-oncology patients who may be at an increased risk of infection, yet require continuity of care. An important aspect of neuro-oncology care includes neuropsychological assessment, which can be challenging to complete outside of a structured testing environment. Teleneuropsychology (TNP) has been explored under proctored conditions and proven feasible and reliable. Conducting TNP visits directly to the patients’ home (DTH-TNP) had minimal study prior to the pandemic, but was implemented to reduce COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: We used surveys to examine patient acceptance and clinician feasibility of DTH-TNP at two regionally diverse medical institutions routinely providing neuropsychological assessments services to neuro-oncology patients from April to August 2020, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). RESULTS: 45 patients voluntarily responded (MGH=30, VCU=15) and 98 percent (MGH=100%, VCU=93%) of respondents were satisfied with the DTH-TNP experience. Nine percent (MGH=7%, VCU=13%) reported challenges (e.g., technological issues) during the appointment. Eighty-nine percent (MGH=90%, VCU=87%) would recommend the virtual visit to others. Patients perceived reduced risk of infection (MGH=77%, VCU=87%) and time traveling to clinic (MGH=87%, VCU=80%) as favorable aspects of DTH-TNP. 43 clinician surveys collected at MGH indicated that clinicians were able to achieve the goal of their appointment in 91% of clinical encounters. Common issues reported by clinicians included trouble connecting (7%) to the telemedicine platform and environmental disruptions (12%). DISCUSSION: This preliminary data suggests neuro-oncology patients and clinicians find DTH-TNP to be an acceptable and feasible practice, while also recognizing its limitations. This study is limited in that voluntary patient surveys are subject to bias. These results suggest that further study of DTH-TNP (e.g., reliability, validity, and limitations) for neuro-oncology patients is warranted.

During this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period, COVID-19 infection symptoms following chemotherapy due to immune compromise could mimic chemotherapy associated side effects. Differentiation on time is needed for correct management. CASE REPORT: A 50-year old male with clinical history of ocular lymphoma underwent HD-MTX therapy. Before admission, his routine COVID-19 test was negative. After receiving HD-MTX, he developed fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The symptoms resolved before discharge. Next day after discharge, he developed diarrhea, fatigue, subjective fever and feeling cold. His temperature was normal. His symptoms have been persistent for 4-5 days and have resolved gradually and spontaneously. Family members have had no symptoms. The patient denies COVID-19 contact history. The above symptoms were considered adverse effects from chemotherapy. The patient did not seek medical attention. Prior to admission for next cycle of HD-MTX, COVID-19 test was found positive. Chemotherapy was on hold. The patient started home quarantine. The patient has been doing well and practiced COVID-19 infection precaution at home. DISCUSSION: The fatigue, nausea and vomiting during HD-MTX treatment are adverse effects from chemotherapy while the diarrhea, fatigue, subjective fever and chills developed after discharge are symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Our case highlights the importance of keeping in mind and differentiating between side effects from chemotherapy and symptoms of COVID-19 viral infection in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy.","Du, Senxi; Hrachova, Maya; Kong, Xiao-Tang",Neuro Oncol,600,1

With the development of functional genomics and bioinformatics, lots of genes and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to disease resistance and (or) economic traits in pigs have been identified, which provides the targets for genetic improvement by genome editing. Base editors (BEs), combining Cas9 nickase and cytidine or adenine deaminase, achieve all four possible transition mutations (C-to-T, A-to-G, T-to-C, and G-to-A) efficiently and accurately without double strand breaks (DSBs) under the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence of NGG. However, the NGG PAM in canonical CRISPR-Cas9 can only cover approximately 8.27% in the whole genome which limits its broad application. In the current study, hA3A-BE3-NG system was constructed with the fusion of SpCas9-NG variant and hA3A-BE3 to create C-to-T conversion at NGN PAM sites efficiently. The editing efficiency and scope of hA3A-BE3-NG were confirmed in HEK293T cells and porcine fetal fibroblast (PFF) cells. Results showed that the efficiency of hA3A-BE3-NG was much higher than that of hA3A-BE3 on NGH (H = A, C, or T) PAM sites (21.27 vs. 2.81% at average). Further, nonsense and missense mutations were introduced efficiently and precisely via hA3A-BE3-NG in multiple pig economic trait-related genes (CD163, APN, MSTN, and MC4R) in PFF cells by one transfection. The current work indicates the potential applications of hA3A-BE3-NG for pyramid breeding studies in livestock.","Wang, Yu; Bi, Dengfeng; Qin, Guosong; Song, Ruigao; Yao, Jing; Cao, Chunwei; Zheng, Qiantao; Hou, Naipeng; Wang, Yanfang; Zhao, Jianguo",Front Genet,600,1

However, its relaxant activity in the aorta, uterus and ileum smooth muscle has not been investigated. This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the effect of caffeic acid on smooth muscle from different organs (aorta, uterus and ileum), and the contractions of this different organ were induced by different agonists. The organ bath technique was used, where the organs were placed in different cuvettes with 10 mL of Tyrode solution for 1 h to stabilize, then, myometrial, intestinal strip and aortic ring contractions were evoked using different contractile agonists (KCl 60 mM, PHE, OT 10-2 IU/mL, CCh 10-6 M and BaCl2 0.1-30 mM); increasing concentrations of caffeic acid (0.03-7 mM) were administered in the experimental preparations. In the presence of KCl (60 mM), caffeic acid caused relaxations with the following EC50 values: 2.7 ± 0.26 mM/mL (aorta), 5.7 ± 0.71 mM/mL (uterus) and 2.1 ± 0.39 mM/mL (ileum). When in the presence of different agonists, PHE (0.1 μM) for the aorta, OT (10-2 IU/mL) for the uterus and CCh (10-6 M) for the ileum, caffeic acid caused relaxations with EC50 values of: 2.7 ± 0.31 mM/mL; 2.2 ± 0.34 mM/mL and 2.0 ± 5.3 mM/mL, respectively. The inhibitory effect of caffeic acid on serotonergic (aorta and uterus) and muscarinic receptors (uterus and ileum), as well as its possible involvement with L-type Ca2+ channels, was also observed. This study reports the pharmacological characterization of caffeic acid on smooth muscle from different organs, for which caffeic acid was more potent in the ileum. A diverse understanding of its performance as a possible therapeutic product is attributed to its relaxant effect.","de Alencar Silva, Andressa; Pereira-de-Morais, Luís; Rodrigues Silva, Renata Evaristo; de Menezes Dantas, Débora; Brito Milfont, Cícera Georgia; Gomes, Maria Franciele; Araújo, Isaac Moura; Kerntopf, Marta Regina; Alencar de Menezes, Irwin Rose; Barbosa, Roseli",Chemico-biological interactions,600,1

METHOD AND MATERIALS This split-mouth controlled randomized clinical study was performed on ten childrens, aged from 4 to 6 years, who needed complete oral rehabilitation under general anesthesia and had one pair or two pairs of their primary molars requiring pulpotomy. After pulp therapy, the teeth were randomly assigned to Figaro or PMC crown groups. Modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used to evaluate crown retention, marginal integration, crown discoloration, secondary caries, and gingival status, at 3 and 6 months. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test with Monte Carlo (MC) correction and McNemar (McN) test at a significance level of .05. RESULTS Ten patients (three boys, 30%; seven girls, 70%) with a mean age of 4.65 ± 0.709 years participated in this study. At 3 months follow-up, there was no significant difference between the groups, but at 6 months follow-up, Figaro crowns showed significant changes from intact crown to either chipped or large loss, whereas all PMCs were found intact (χ2 = 14.545, P[MC] = 0.000). There was also significant deterioration in Figaro crowns' color after 6 months (χ2[McN] = 8.1, P = .004).

The aim of this study is the validation and application of a web-survey, addressed to nursing students and nurses, in order to evaluate the degree of accuracy and the knowledge on the correct positioning of the 12-leads ECG. METHODS The study was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. The survey comprised 30 items, mainly multiple-choice questions. The participants were 484 nurses and nursing students. In the study, no exclusion criteria were adopted, but fill in the questionnaire any nurse on duty during the data collection period and/or any nursing student during the data collection period. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS v. 9.4. In the study, no exclusion criteria were adopted. RESULTS A total of 484 nursing students and nurses comprising of 149 males (30.79%) and 335 females (69.21%) responded. In full findings showed good psychometric properties and good reliability. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the study is 0.76 (number of items = 17, number of obs= 484). The mean age of responders was 32.01 (Standard deviation (SD) 9.63). A logistic multivariate regression demonstrated significant differences. CONCLUSIONS It is evident from our findings and those from other countries, that more education is required to ensure that mistaken interpretation, misdiagnosis, patient mismanagement and/or inappropriate procedures due to 12 leads ECG misplacement does not occur.","Giannetta, Noemi; Campagna, Giuseppe; Di Muzio, Flavio; Di Simone, Emanuele; Dionisi, Sara; Di Muzio, Marco",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,600,28

Here, authors propose a radiographic classification of COICA that can be used as a guide to determine the technical success and safety of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic COICA and to assess the changes in systemic blood pressure following successful revascularization.METHODSThe radiographic images of 100 consecutive subjects with COICA were analyzed. A new classification of COICA was proposed based on the morphology, location of occlusion, and presence or absence of reconstitution of the distal ICA. The classification was used to predict successful revascularization in 32 symptomatic COICAs in 31 patients, five of whom were female (5/31 [16.13%]). Patients were included in the study if they had a COICA with ischemic symptoms refractory to medical therapy. Carotid artery occlusion was defined as 100% cross-sectional occlusion of the vessel lumen as documented on CTA or MRA and confirmed by digital subtraction angiography.RESULTSFour types (A-D) of radiographic COICA were identified. Types A and B were more amenable to safe revascularization than types C and D. Recanalization was successful at a rate of 68.75% (22/32 COICAs; type A: 8/8; type B: 8/8; type C: 4/8; type D: 2/8). The perioperative complication rate was 18.75% (6/32; type A: 0/8 [0%]; type B: 1/8 [12.50%]; type C: 3/8 [37.50%], type D: 2/8 [25.00%]). None of these complications led to permanent morbidity or death. Twenty (64.52%) of 31 subjects had improvement in their symptoms at the 2-6 months' follow-up. A statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was noted in 17/21 (80.95%) patients who had successful revascularization, which persisted on follow-up (p = 0.0001). The remaining 10 subjects in whom revascularization failed had no significant changes in SBP (p = 0.73).CONCLUSIONSThe pilot study suggested that our proposed classification of COICA may be useful as an adjunctive guide to determine the technical feasibility and safety of revascularization for symptomatic COICA using endovascular techniques. Additionally, successful revascularization may lead to a significant decrease in SBP postprocedure. A Phase 2b trial in larger cohorts to assess the efficacy of endovascular revascularization using our COICA classification is warranted.","Hasan, David; Zanaty, Mario; Starke, Robert M; Atallah, Elias; Chalouhi, Nohra; Jabbour, Pascal; Singla, Amit; Guerrero, Waldo R; Nakagawa, Daichi; Samaniego, Edgar A; Mbabuike, Nnenna; Tawk, Rabih G; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Novakovic, Roberta L; White, Jonathan; Schirmer, Clemens M; Brott, Thomas G; Shallwani, Hussain; Hopkins, L Nelson",Journal of neurosurgery,600,1

The worldview hypotheses that underlie NDS and WS-CAM (contextual, organismic, interactive-integrative - Pepper, 1942) overlap with each other, but differ fundamentally from those of biomedicine (formistic, mechanistic). Differing views on the nature of causality itself lead to different types of study designs. Biomedical efficacy studies assume a simple direct mechanistic cause-effect relationship between a specific intervention and a specific bodily outcome, an assumption less relevant to WS-CAM outcomes. WS-CAM practitioners do not necessarily treat a symptom directly. Rather, they intervene to modulate an intrinsic central imbalance of the person as a system and to create a more favorable environmental context for the emergence of health, e.g., with dietary changes compatible with the constitutional type. The rebalancing of the system thereby fosters the emergence of indirect, diffuse, complex effects throughout the person and the person's interactions with his/her environment. NDS theory-driven study designs thus have the potential for greater external and model validity than biomedically driven efficacy studies (e.g., clinical trials) for evaluating the indirect effects of WS-CAM practices. Potential applications of NDS analytic techniques to WS-CAM include characterizing different constitutional types and documenting the evolution and dynamics of whole-person healing and well-being over time. Furthermore, NDS provides models and methods for examining interactions across organizational scales, from genomic/proteomic/metabolomic networks to individuals and social groups.","Bell, Iris R; Koithan, Mary; Pincus, David",Forschende Komplementarmedizin,600,1

Although children and adolescents have been largely spared from the more severe symptoms associated with the disease, global health organizations such as the United Nations have suggested that COVID-19 may have the longest and most severe impact on children and adolescents due to the socioeconomic, physical, psychological impacts associated with the disease itself and the measures taken to stop transmission, such as physical distancing. This paper provides an overview of the evolutionary basis for community, and the ways that social and physical distancing measures to contain COVID-19 threaten the important social learning and support that community provides.

Each year, millions of pilgrims visit Makkah. These numbers impact both routine health care delivery and disaster response. This study aimed to evaluate hospitals' disaster plans in the city of Makkah. METHODS Study investigators administered a questionnaire survey to 17 hospitals in the city of Makkah. Data on hospital characteristics and three key domains of disaster plans (general evaluation of disaster planning, structural feasibility of the hospitals, and health care worker knowledge and training) were collated and analyzed. RESULTS A response rate of 82% (n=14) was attained. Ten (71%) of the hospitals were government hospitals, whereas four were private hospitals. Eleven (79%) hospitals had a capacity of less than 300 beds. Only nine (64%) hospitals reviewed their disaster plan within the preceding two years. Nine (64%) respondents were drilling for disasters at least twice per year. The majority of hospitals did not rely on a hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) to develop their Emergency Operations Plan. Eleven (79%) hospitals had the Hospital Incident Command Systems (HICS) present in their plans. All hospitals described availability of some supplies required for the first 24 hours of a disaster response, such as: N95 masks, antidotes for nerve agents, and antiviral medications. Only five (36%) hospitals had a designated decontamination area. Nine (64%) hospitals reported ability to re-designate inpatient wards into an intensive care unit (ICU) format. Only seven (50%) respondents had a protocol for increasing availability of isolation rooms to prevent the spread of airborne infection. Ten (71%) hospitals had a designated disaster-training program for health care workers. CONCLUSIONS Makkah has experienced multiple disaster incidents over the last decade. The present research suggests that Makkah hospitals are insufficiently prepared for potential future disasters. This may represent a considerable threat to the health of both residents and visitors to Makkah. This study demonstrated that there is significant room for improvement in most aspects of hospital Emergency Operations Plans, in particular: reviewing the plan and increasing the frequency of multi-agency and multi-hospital drills.

Eligible studies investigated the effect of foot orthoses or insoles on running economy (using indirect calorimetry) or running performance. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were computed and meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Index. Nine studies met the criteria and were included: five studies investigated the effect of foot orthoses on running economy and four investigated insoles. Foot orthoses were associated with small negative effects on running economy compared to no orthoses (SMD 0.42 [95% CI 0.17,0.72] p = 0.007). Shock absorbing insoles were also associated with negative effects on running economy, but an imprecise estimate (SMD 0.26 [95% CI -0.33,0.84] p = 0.83).

There are a number of studies in individual raptor species but those data have not been systematically evaluated to understand raptor-wide lead exposure and effects at a pan-European scale. To critically assess the extent of this problem, we performed a systematic review compiling all published data on lead in raptors (1983-2019) and, through a meta-analysis, determined if there was evidence for differences in exposure across feeding traits, geographical regions, between hunting and non-hunting periods, and changes over time. We also reviewed the impact of lead on raptors and the likely main source of exposure. We examined 114 studies that were unevenly distributed in terms of time of publication and the countries in which studies were performed. Peer-reviewed articles reported data for 39 raptor species but very few species were widely monitored across Europe. Obligate (vultures) and facultative scavengers (golden eagle, common buzzard and white-tailed sea eagle) accumulated the highest lead concentrations in tissues and generally were the species most at risk of lead poisoning. We found no evidence of a spatial or decadal trend in lead residues, but we demonstrated that high lead blood levels relate to hunting season. Exposure at levels associated with both subclinical and lethal effects is common and lead from rifle bullets and shot is often the likely source of exposure. Overall, our review illustrates the high incidence and ubiquity of lead contamination in raptors in Europe. However, we did not find studies that related exposure to quantitative impacts on European raptor populations nor detailed studies on the impact of mitigation measures.

Datasets of these genomes assembled from multiple hospitals can give critical clues to regional or national trends in infection. Herein, we report a lineage summary based on data collected from hospitals located in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We performed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing of specimens from 198 patients with COVID-19 at 13 collaborating hospitals located in the Kanto region. Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions were performed to differentiate and classify the viral lineages. More than 90% of the identified strains belonged to Clade 20B, which has been prevalent in European countries since March 2020. Only two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) were found to be predominant in Japan. However, one sample from a COVID-19 patient admitted to a hospital in the Kanto region in November 2020 belonged to the B.1.346 lineage of Clade 20C, which has been prevalent in the western United States since November 2020. The patient had no history of overseas travel or any known contact with anyone who had travelled abroad. Consequently, the Clade 20C strain belonging to the B.1.346 lineage appeared likely to have been imported from the western United States to Japan across the strict quarantine barrier. B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214 lineages were found to be predominant in the Kanto region, but a single case of the B.1.346 lineage of clade 20C, probably imported from the western United States, was also identified. These results illustrate that a decentralized network of hospitals offers significant advantages as a highly responsive system for monitoring regional molecular epidemiologic trends.","Abe, Kodai; Shimura, Takako; Takenouchi, Toshiki; Iwasaki, Yuka W; Ishizu, Hirotsugu; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Uno, Shunsuke; Gotoh, Jun; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Takeuchi, Yuriko; Katayama, Junpei; Nozaki, Hiroyuki; Fujii, Susumu; Seki, Shikou; Nakamura, Morio; Uda, Kazuhiro; Misumi, Takahiko; Ishihara, Jun; Yamada, Kenichiro; Kanai, Toshio; Murai, Shinji; Araki, Kazuhiro; Ebihara, Tamotsu; Siomi, Haruhiko; Hasegawa, Naoki; Kitagawa, Yuko; Amagai, Masayuki; Suematsu, Makoto; Kosaki, Kenjiro",The Keio journal of medicine,600,1

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) advises opportunistic AF screening among patients aged ≥ 65 years. Considering this, the aim herein, was compare the feasibility of two different systems of smartphone-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to identify AF among those without a previous arrhythmia history. METHODS Prospective AF screening was conducted at six pharmacies using Kardia Mobile and Hartmann Veroval 2 in 1. A single-lead ECG was acquired by the placement of fingers on the pads. A cardiologist evaluated findings from both devices. RESULTS Atrial fibrillation was identified in 3.60% and previously unknown AF was detected in 1.92% of the study participants. Sensitivity and specificity of the Kardia application in detecting AF were 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4-88.2%) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.7-99.5%), and for Veroval 10.0% (95% CI 0.23-44.5%) and 94.96% (95% CI 92.15-96.98%), accordingly. Inter-rater agreement was k = 0.088 (95% CI 1.59-16.1%). CONCLUSIONS Mobile devices can detect AF, but each finding must be verified by a professional. The Kardia application appeared to be more user-friendly than Veroval. Cardiovascular screening using mobile devices is feasible at pharmacies. Hence it might be considered for routine use.","Zaprutko, Tomasz; Zaprutko, Joanna; Sprawka, Józefina; Pogodzińska, Monika; Michalak, Michał; Paczkowska, Anna; Kus, Krzysztof; Nowakowska, Elżbieta; Baszko, Artur",Cardiology journal,600,30

METHODS We conducted a 2-arm randomized controlled trial testing a theory-based, community-informed, Web-accessible computer role-playing game intervention. Control condition received a list of resources. Primary hypotheses were high levels of implementation success, game demand, and game acceptability. RESULTS We randomized 240 SGMYs aged 14-18 years into the intervention (n = 120) or control (n = 120) conditions. Participants completed baseline (100%), 1-month follow-up (T2; 73.3%), and 2-month follow-up (T3; 64.4%) surveys. Among intervention participants, 55.8% downloaded and played the game. Of those who played, 46.2% reported a desire to play it again, and 50.8% would recommend it. Game acceptability exceeded hypothesized benchmarks, wherein participants reported high positive affect (M = 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13, 2.58), low negative affect (M = 2.75; 95% CI: 2.55, 2.95), low tension/annoyance (M = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.98, 3.39), and high competence (M = 2.23; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.43) while playing the game. In multivariable intent-to-treat analyses of 38 secondary/tertiary outcomes, intervention participants reported significantly larger reductions than control participants in cyberbullying victimization (T2 b = -.28; 95% CI: -.56, -.01), binge drinking frequency (T2 b = -.39; 95% CI: -.71, -.06), and marijuana use frequency (T3 b = -2.78; 95% CI: -4.49, -1.08). CONCLUSIONS We successfully implemented a Web-accessible game trial with SGMY. The game-based intervention was feasible and acceptable to SGMY, and preliminary results show it improved several health-related behaviors.

Using a murine model of viral encephalitis (murine cytomegalovirus, MCMV) we have previously shown that post-encephalitic brains are maintained in an inflammatory state consisting of glial cell reactivity, retention of brain-infiltrating tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cells, and long-term persistence of antibody-producing cells of the B-lineage. Here, we report that this neuroinflammation occurs concomitantly with accumulation and retention of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and is exacerbated following their ablation. However, the extent to which these Tregs function to control neuroimmune activation following MCMV encephalitis is unknown. In this study, we used Foxp3-diphtheria toxin receptor-GFP (Foxp3-DTR-GFP) transgenic mice, which upon administration of low-dose diphtheria toxin (DTx) results in the specific depletion of Tregs, to investigate their function. We found treatment with DTx during the acute phase of viral brain infection (0-4 dpi) resulted in depletion of Tregs from the brain, exacerbation of encephalitis (i.e., increased presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells), and chronic reactive phenotypes of resident glial cells (i.e., elevated MHC Class II as well as PD-L1 levels, sustained microgliosis, and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression on astrocytes) versus untreated, infected animals. This chronic proinflammatory environment was associated with reduced cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory tasks (Barnes Maze) by convalescent animals. These data demonstrate that chronic glial cell activation, unremitting post-encephalitic neuroinflammation, and its associated long-term neurological sequelae in response to viral brain infection are modulated by the immunoregulatory properties of Tregs.

We present our experience with the expanded endonasal endoscopic approach to the skull base in an institution where, previously, a traditional transsphenoidal approach with a surgical microscope had been used. PATIENTS We performed a retrospective review to identify patients who underwent expanded endonasal endoscopic surgery and analyzed demographic, pathological, and operative data with particular attention to repair of the skull base defects in 55 procedures performed on 49 patients. We compared the outcomes of 10 primary operations in which we repaired skull base defects using only autologous or allogeneic tissue grafts and 39 primary operations in which we used a vascularized mucoperichondrial nasal septal flap with or without a layered autologous tissue graft. RESULTS Primary expanded endonasal endoscopic procedures were performed in 49 patients with sellar pathology (33 pituitary adenomas, 4 Rathke's cleft cysts, 1 pituicytoma, 1 pituitary metastasis) and non-sellar pathology (3 meningiomas, 3 clival chordomas, 1 clival mucocele, 1 craniopharyngioma, and 2 esthesioneuroblastomas). Postoperative CSF leakage occurred following 5 of the 49 primary operations (10.2%). This occurred in 2 of 10 primary operations (20.0%) in which the skull base defect was repaired using only autologous and/or allogeneic tissue grafts, necessitating a total of 3 operative CSF leak repairs in those 2 patients. The remaining 3 postoperative CSF leaks occurred in the 39 primary operations (7.7%) in which skull base repair was performed using a mucoperichondrial nasal septal flap, necessitating operative repair in 2 of those patients. CONCLUSION The repair of skull base defects created during expanded endonasal endoscopic surgery is improved by use of a mucoperichondrial nasal septal flap combined with a layered autologous tissue graft. When CSF leakage occurs despite nasal septal flap closure, the site of the leakage may be easier to localize and repair.","Munich, Stephan A; Fenstermaker, Robert A; Fabiano, Andrew J; Rigual, Nestor R","Journal of neurological surgery.

In order to prevent premature interruption of folding, ERAD regulators and effectors such as EDEM1 and OS-9 are selectively cleared from the ER in so-called EDEMosomes to downregulate the degradative activity. The mechanism by which EDEM1 and OS-9 are subjected to rapid turnover, also known as ERAD tuning, shows similarities with, but is clearly distinct from, macroautophagy. Positive strand RNA coronaviruses (CoVs) such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), induce in infected cells the formation of autophagosome-like, double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) to which their replication and transcription complexes are anchored.

METHODS One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to the MVL group (n = 40), the PVL group (n = 40), and the DL group (n = 40). Nasotracheal intubation was performed using MVL, PVL, or DL, according to group assignments. The primary outcome was TTI and secondary outcomes were glottic view, ease of intubation, and bleeding. RESULTS The TTI was significantly shorter in the MVL group than in the DL group (45 sec vs 57 sec; difference in means: - 12; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 21 to - 3; P = 0.01). The percentage of glottic opening and Cormack Lehane grade were significantly superior in the MVL and the PVL groups compared with the DL group (both P < 0.001). The intubation difficulty scale and numeric rating scale regarding ease of intubation were also significantly lower in the MVL and PVL groups than in the DL group (all P < 0.007). The incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in the MVL group than in the DL group (3 vs 15, relative risk 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.64; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study showed that both MVL and PVL provided better visualization of the glottis and easier intubation, with less additional manipulation than DL during nasotracheal intubation in simulated difficult airways. Additionally, use of the MVL significantly shortened the TTI compared with the DL.

A total of 113 Spanish fathers with a mean age of 35.72 years (SD = 3.84 years) participated. In general, there was a decline in the dyadic adjustment of the fathers until 6-12 months after childbirth, after which their level of adjustment remained stable until 13-24 months. We observed different patterns when analyzing the evolution by subgroups formed based on these different variables, previous experience of paternity, and anxiety. The intrinsic differences between fathers should also be considered because these differences can influence the way in which men face the parental process as well as the evolution of the quality of their relationship with their partner.","Escribano, Silvia; Oliver-Roig, Antonio; Richart-Martínez, Miguel",Am J Mens Health,600,1

This study aimed to develop and validate a multimodal screening tool that aids in predicting the disease confirmation in emergency situations and patients with OHCA during a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter observational study of adult patients with OHCA in Daegu, Korea. To identify the potential predictors that could be used in screening tools in the emergency department, we applied logistic regression to data collected from March 1 to March 14. The prediction performance of the screening variables was then assessed and validated on the data of patients with OHCA who were treated between February 19 and March 31, 2020. General patient characteristics and hematological findings of the COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive groups were compared. We also evaluated confirmation test criteria as predictors for COVID-19 positivity in patients with OHCA. RESULTS: Advanced age, body temperature, and abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) revealed significant predictive ability in the derivation cohort. Of the 184 adult patients with OHCA identified in the validation cohort, 80 patients were included in the analysis. Notably, 9 patients were positive and 71 were negative on the COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Five patients (55.6%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a fever before OHCA, and 12 (16.9%) of the COVID-19-negative group had a fever before OHCA (P = 0.018). Eight patients (88.9%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a CXR indicating pneumonic infiltration. Of the criteria for predicting COVID-19, fever or an abnormal CXR had a sensitivity of 100% (65.4 - 100) and a specificity of 22.5% (13.5 - 34.0). CONCLUSION: The screening tools that combined fever or abnormal CXR had a good discriminatory ability for COVID-19 infection in adult patients with OHCA. Therefore, during the COVID-19 outbreak period, it is recommended to suspect COVID-19 infection and perform COVID-19 test if patients present with a history of fever or show abnormal findings in postmortem CXR.","Kim, Changho; Yeo, In Hwan; Kim, Jong Kun; Cho, Yeonjoo; Lee, Mi Jin; Jung, Haewon; Cho, Jae Wan; Ham, Ji Yeon; Lee, Suk Hee; Chung, Han Sol; Mun, You Ho; Lee, Sang Hun; Kim, Yang Hun",,600,20

The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 to almost every country on the globe and the failure to contain the infections have contributed to fear and panic worldwide. The lack of available and efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines has further worsened the situation. For these reasons, it cannot be overstated that an accelerated effort for the development of novel drugs and vaccines is needed. In this context, novel approaches in both gene therapy and vaccine development are essential. Previous experience from SARS-and MERS-coronavirus vaccine and drug development projects have targeted glycoprotein epitopes, monoclonal antibodies, angiotensin receptor blockers and gene silencing technologies, which may be useful for COVID-19 too. Moreover, existing antivirals used for other types of viral infections have been considered as urgent action is necessary.

In a separate analysis, 3 specimens (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal) were collected from 182 unique patients presenting to the emergency department with suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 and were tested utilizing Abbott ID NOW. To further characterize each assay, relative limits of detection were evaluated utilizing positive nasopharyngeal patient samples. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas. The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for all 3 assays. All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results.

Methods Review of the literature related to acceptable delays for treatment of common orthopaedic conditions, experience of healthcare professionals from low resource communities and expertise of experienced surgeons. Results Guidelines for the management of cancellations of elective surgeries during a period of resource reallocation are proposed. Elective cases must not be postponed indefinitely as adverse outcomes may result. Triage of waiting lists should include continuous monitoring of the patient and close communication with families despite social distancing and travel restrictions. Telehealth becomes a necessity. Common orthopaedic conditions are triaged into four groups according to urgency and safe and acceptable delay. Categories proposed are Emergent (life and limb threatening conditions), Urgent (with-in seven days), Semi-elective (postponed for three months) and Elective (postponed for three to 12 months). In total, 25 common orthopaedic conditions are reviewed and categorized. Conclusion Given the uncertainty within healthcare during a pandemic, it is necessary to determine acceptable delays for elective conditions. We report our experience in developing guidelines and propose categorizing elective cases into four categories, based on the length of delay. Telemedicine plays a key role in determining the gravity of each situation and hence the amount of delay. These guidelines will assist others dealing with elective cases in the midst of a crisis. This paper initiates a coordinated effort to develop a consensus statement on safe delays.","Keshet, Doron; Bernstein, Mitchell; Dahan-Oliel, Noemi; Ouellet, Jean; Pauyo, Thierry; Rabau, Oded; Saran, Neil; Hamdy, Reggie",J.

However, there has hardly been any focus on precarity which is the term that encapsulates the instability in people's lives. That is, a negative outcome can overspread to other decisions and measures of well-being. Studying precarity necessitates a shift in focus - from the point of view of the decision-maker to the perspective of the decision subject. This centering of the subject is an important direction that unlocks the importance of parting with aggregate measures to examine the long-term effects of decision making. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a modeling framework that simulates the effects of compounded decision-making on precarity over time. Through our simulations, we are able to show the heterogeneity of precarity by the non-uniform ruinous aftereffects of negative decisions on different income classes of the underlying population and how policy interventions can help mitigate such effects.","Nokhiz, Pegah; Ruwanpathirana, Aravinda Kanchana; Patwari, Neal; Venkatasubramanian, Suresh",,600,17

This paper continues the prior work by proposing a novel model where intents are continuous points placed in a specialist Intent Space that yields several advantages. First, the continuous representation enables to investigate relationships between the seen intents. Second, it allows any unseen intent to be reliably represented given limited quantities of data. Finally, this paper will show how the proposed model can be augmented with unseen intents without retraining any of the seen ones.

The number of reported infected people and its consequent death toll herald relative inadequacies in the quality and extent of the measures in curbing the COVID-19 transmission cycle. This study was conducted to investigate knowledge, attitude, precautionary practices and degree of fear related to COVID-19 in a sample of Iranian population. This study was conducted among 457 residents of Kurdistan Province, Iran, through social networks and social media (WhatsApp and Telegram). Knowledge, attitude and practice and fear of COVID-19 were collected using valid tools. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with binary outcome attitudes, practices and continuous variables knowledge and fear of COVID-19, respectively. The mean (SD) age of participants was 37.86 (10.42); of them, 252 (55.1%) were men, and more than two-thirds were married (74.8%). About 10% of the respondents were in believed that COVID-19 could create a type of social stigma. Level of knowledge about COVID-19 in 77.8% of the study attendees was acceptable, and 352 of them (70%) were confident that the virus would eventually be successfully controlled in the world, but only 252 of the attendants (50%) had confidence about successful control of COVID-19 in Iran. Applying multiple logistic regression, knowledge (OR: 1.18, p = 0.028) and fear (OR: 1.04, p = 0.028) of COVID-19 were associated with positive attitude towards controllability of COVID-19.

Deep learning helps to learn the behaviour of an entity through methods of recognising and interpreting patterns. Despite its limitless potential, the mystery is how deep learning algorithms make a decision in the first place. Explainable AI (XAI) is the key to unlocking AI and the black-box for deep learning. XAI is an AI model that is programmed to explain its goals, logic, and decision making so that the end users can understand. The end users can be domain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data scientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is affected by the decisions of an AI model. Chest CT has emerged as a valuable tool for the clinical diagnostic and treatment management of the lung diseases associated with COVID-19. AI can support rapid evaluation of CT scans to differentiate COVID-19 findings from other lung diseases. However, how these AI tools or deep learning algorithms reach such a decision and which are the most influential features derived from these neural networks with typically deep layers are not clear. The aim of this study is to propose and develop XAI strategies for COVID-19 classification models with an investigation of comparison. The results demonstrate promising quantification and qualitative visualisations that can further enhance the clinician's understanding and decision making with more granular information from the results given by the learned XAI models.","Ye, Qinghao; Xia, Jun; Yang, Guang",,600,5

This study aimed to compare the level of anxiety and depression in the same pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The pregnant women continuing pregnancy who participated in the first study which was undertaken to clarify the factors associated with mental health of pregnant women before the COVID-19 pandemic, were included for the current study during the outbreak. Anxiety and depression symptoms of the same pregnant women were evaluated by using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms II and Beck Anxiety Inventory twice before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 63 pregnant women completed questionnaires. The mean age of the women and the mean gestational age was 30.35±5.27 years and 32.5±7 weeks, respectively. The mean total IDAS II score was found to increase from 184.78±49.67 (min: 109, max: 308) to 202.57±52.90 (min: 104, max: 329) before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. According to the BAI scores the number of patients without anxiety (from 10 to 6) and with mild anxiety (from 31 to 24) decreased and patients with moderate (from 20 to 25) and severe anxiety (from 2 to 8) increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that obesity and relationship with her husband are the best predictors of IDAS II scores. Conclusions This study indicated that COVID-19 outbreak affects the mental health of pregnant women negatively which leads to adverse birth outcomes. The level of anxiety and depression symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 infection significantly increased. Healthcare professionals should establish comprehensive treatment plans for pregnant women who are highly vulnerable population to prevent mental trauma during the infectious disease outbreaks.","Ayaz, Reyhan; Hocaoglu, Meryem; Günay, Taner; Yardimci, Oguz Devrim; Turgut, Abdulkadir; Karateke, Ates",J Perinat Med,600,31

This is the basic question discussed in this essay, within a philosophical/existential context. The central argument is that the concept of death is problematic and, following Levinas, the author holds that death cannot lead to nothingness. This accords with the teaching of all religious traditions, which hold that there is life beyond death, and Plato's and Aristotle's theories about the immortality of the soul. In modernity, since the Enlightenment, God and religion have been placed in the margin or rejected in rational discourse. Consequently, the anthropocentric promethean view of man has been stressed and the reality of the limits placed on humans by death deemphasised or ignored. Yet, death remains at the centre of nature and human life, and its reality and threat become evident in the spread of a single virus. So, death always remains a mystery, relating to life and morality.","Kokosalakis, Nikos",Society,600,1

OBJECTIVES: We sought to summarize the studies published to date regarding the antiviral activity of zinc in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to compare the outcomes of hospitalized patients receiving zinc supplementation and those treated with standard care. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Data relating to 1474 patients included in four studies were analyzed. Survival to hospital discharge was 56.8% in the zinc group, compared to 75.9% in the non-zinc group (P=0.88). In-hospital mortality was 22.3% in the zinc group, compared to 13.6% for the standard care group (P=0.16). Length of hospital stay was 7.7(3.7) days in the zinc group and 7.2(3.9) days in the standard treatment group (P<0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.9(1.7) days in the zinc group and 5.8(1.9) days in the standard care group (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Zinc supplementation did not have any beneficial impact on the course of COVID-19 evaluated as survival to hospital discharge and in-hospital mortality.

Government agencies and medical institutions have encouraged people to use medical information technology (MIT) to manage their conditions and promote personal health. In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly important to contain disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting their intention to use this platform. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use. Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""strongly disagree"" (1 point) to ""strongly agree"" (5 points). Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software. RESULTS: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected (female: 219/350, 62.6%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0%; university-level education: 228/350, 65.1%; occupation as student: 195/350, 56.6%; average monthly income <NT $30,000 [<US $1054.89]: 230/350, 65.7%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4%; and health status perceived as ""good"": 171/350, 48.9%). Five indicators, including chi-square test (X2310=2.63), goodness-of-fit index (0.85), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (0.81), comparative fit index (0.91), and root mean square error of approximation (0.07), were calculated. The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated that the most important factor affecting respondents' behavioral intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07). CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation model with a strong goodness of fit. The results of our analysis are consistent with the technology acceptance model. Through the diverse value-added services of MHB, Taiwan's experience in pandemic prevention with smart technology can facilitate future responses to unknown, emerging infectious diseases.","Tsai, Wen-Hsun; Wu, Yi-Syuan; Cheng, Chia-Shiang; Kuo, Ming-Hao; Chang, Yu-Tien; Hu, Fu-Kang; Sun, Chien-An; Chang, Chi-Wen; Chan, Ta-Chien; Chen, Chao-Wen; Lee, Chia-Cheng; Chu, Chi-Ming",J Med Internet Res,600,14

We aimed to assess the national impact of COVID-19 on the prescribing of systemic anticancer treatment in England, immediately after lockdown and after the introduction of new treatments to reduce patient risk. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis using data from a central National Health Service England web database mandated for clinicians to register intention to start all new systemic anticancer treatments approved for use in England since 2016. We analysed the monthly number of treatment registrations in April, 2020, after the implementation of societal lockdown on March 23, 2020, and after implementation of treatment options to reduce patient risk such as oral or less immunosuppressive drugs, in May and June, 2020. We compared the number of registrations in April-June, 2020, with the mean number of registrations and SD during the previous 6 months of unaffected cancer care (September, 2019, to February, 2020). We calculated the percentage change and absolute difference in SD units for the number of registrations overall, by tumour type, and by type and line of therapy. FINDINGS: In April, 2020, 2969 registrations were recorded, representing 1417 fewer registrations than in the control period (monthly mean 4386; 32% reduction, absolute difference 4·2 SDs, p<0·0001). In May, 2020, total registrations increased to 3950, representing a 10% reduction compared with the control period (absolute difference 1·3 SDs, p<0·0001). In June, 2020, 5022 registrations were recorded, representing a 15% increase compared with the control period (absolute difference 1·9 SDs; p<0·0001]). INTERPRETATION: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in systemic anticancer treatment initiation in England. However, following introduction of treatment options to reduce patient risk, registrations began to increase in May, 2020, and reached higher numbers than the pre-pandemic mean in June, 2020, when other clinical and societal risk mitigation factors (such as telephone consultations, facemasks and physical distancing) are likely to have contributed. However, outcomes of providing less treatment or delaying treatment initiation, particularly for advanced cancers and neoadjuvant therapies, require continued assessment.

Although several mobile applications have been developed previously for contact tracing, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, personal data, or require infrastructures such as WiFi APs. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, an early proposal for privacy-sensitive contact tracing. CONTAIN is a privacy-oriented bluetooth-based mobile digital contact tracing framework that does not rely on any infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of personally identifiable information. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if and when they have been within a short distance of someone that is infected. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by CONTAIN. We also present a simulation study utilizing an empirical trace dataset which shows that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an infected user by turning on the app in more crowded settings. © 2021 IFIP.","Hekmati, A.; Ramachandran, G.; Krishnamachari, B.","17th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, IM 2021",600,6

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does exercise at various intensities produce aerosols in significant quantities? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this experimental study, subjects were eight healthy volunteers (six men, two women) who were 20 to 63 years old. The 20-minute test protocol of 5 minutes rest, four 3-minute stages of exercise at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of age-predicted heart rate reserve, and 3 minutes active recovery was performed in a clean, controlled environment. Aerosols were measured by four particle counters that were place to surround the subject. RESULTS: Age averaged 41 ± 14 years. Peak heart rate was 173 ± 17 beat/min (97% predicted); peak maximal oxygen uptake was 33.9 ± 7.5 mL/kg/min; and peak respiratory exchange ratio was 1.22 ± 0.10. Maximal ventilation averaged 120 ± 23 L/min, while cumulative ventilation reached 990 ± 192 L. Concentrations increased exponentially from start to 20 minutes (geometric mean ± geometric SD particles/liter): Fluke >0.3 μm = 66 ± 1.8 → 1605 ± 3.8; 0.3-1.0 μm = 35 ± 2.2 → 1095 ± 4.6; Fluke 1.0-5.0 μm = 21 ± 2.0 → 358 ± 2.3; P-Trak anterior = 637 ± 2.3 → 5148 ± 3.0; P-Trak side = 708 ± 2.7 → 6844 ± 2.7; P-Track back = 519 ± 3.1 → 5853 ± 2.8. All increases were significant at a probability value of <.05. Exercise at or above 50% of predicted heart rate reserve showed statistically significant increases in aerosol concentration. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest exercise testing is an aerosol-generating procedure and, by extension, other activities that involve exercise intensities at or above 50% of predicted heart rate reserve. Results can guide recommendations for safety of exercise testing and other indoor exercise activities.","Sajgalik, Pavol; Garzona-Navas, Andres; Csécs, Ibolya; Askew, J.

Our major aim was to identify common baseline clinical features that could help recognise adult patients at high risk of having COVID-19. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of all the evidence available at LitCovid, until 23 March 2020. SETTING: Studies conducted in any setting and any country were included. PARTICIPANTS: Studies had to report the prevalence of sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms and comorbidities specifically in adults with a diagnosis of infection by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 1572 publications were published on LitCovid. We have included 56 articles in our analysis, with 89% conducted in China and 75% containing inpatients. Three studies were conducted in North America and one in Europe. Participants’ age ranged from 28 to 70 years, with balanced gender distribution. The proportion of asymptomatic cases were from 2% to 79%. The most common reported symptoms were fever (4%–99%), cough (4%–92%), dyspnoea/shortness of breath (1%–90%), fatigue (4%–89%), myalgia (3%–65%) and pharyngalgia (2%–61%), while regarding comorbidities, we found cardiovascular disease (1%–40%), hypertension (0%–40%) and cerebrovascular disease (1%–40%). Such heterogeneity impaired the conduction of meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The infection by COVID-19 seems to affect people in a very diverse manner and with different characteristics. With the available data, it is not possible to clearly identify those at higher risk of being infected with this condition. Furthermore, the evidence from countries other than China is, at the moment, too scarce.","Ferreira-Santos, Daniela; Maranhão, Priscila; Monteiro-Soares, Matilde",BMJ Open,600,20

Environmental management strategies that reduce/eliminate vector breeding sites combined with improved personal prevention strategies can help to significantly reduce transmission of these infections. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of residents in Western Jamaica regarding control of mosquito vectors and protection from mosquito bites. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2010 among patients or family members of patients waiting to be seen at hospitals in Western Jamaica. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic factors and KAPs regarding vector-borne diseases. KAP scores were calculated and categorized as high or low based on number of correct/positive responses. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of KAP and linear regression analysis conducted to determine if knowledge and attitude scores predicted practice scores. RESULTS: Three-hundred and sixty-one people (85 males and 276 females) participated in the study. Most participants (87%) scored low on knowledge and practice items (78%). Conversely, 78% scored high on attitudes items. By multivariate logistic regression, housewives were 82% less likely to have high attitude scores than laborers, and homeowners were 65% less likely to have high attitude scores than renters. Participants from households with 1–2 children were 3.4 times more likely to have high attitude scores compared to those from households with no children. Participants from households ≥5 people were 65% less likely to have high practice scores compared to those from households with <5. By multivariable linear regression knowledge and attitude scores were significant predictors of practice score. CONCLUSION: The study revealed poor knowledge of vector-borne diseases and poor prevention practices among participants. It identified specific groups that can be targeted with vector-control and personal protection interventions to decrease transmission of the infections.","Alobuia, Wilson M; Missikpode, Celestin; Aung, Maung; Jolly, Pauline E",Annals of Global Health,600,5

However, it has mostly taken the form of ad hoc surveys, or has focused on adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals. In 2006 a Blue Ribbon Panel was convened by the U.S. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to discuss the potential utility of a national companion animal health surveillance system. Such a system could provide fundamental information about disease occurrence, transmission and risk factors; and could facilitate industry-supported pharmaco-epidemiological studies and post-market surveillance. Disease WatchDog, a prospective national disease surveillance project, was officially launched in January 2010 to capture data on diseases in dogs and cats throughout Australia. Participation is encouraged by providing registrants real-time disease maps and material for improved communication between veterinarians and clients. From January to mid-November 2010, an estimated 31% of veterinary clinics Australia-wide joined the project. Over 1300 disease cases – including Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Distemper, Canine Hepatitis, Feline Calicivirus, Feline Herpesvirus, and Tick Paralysis – were reported. In New South Wales alone, 552 CPV cases in dogs were reported from 89 postcode locations. New South Wales data was scanned using the space–time permutation test. Up to 24 clusters (P < 0.01) were identified, occurring in all months except March. The greatest number of clusters (n = 6) were identified in April. The most likely cluster was identified in western Sydney, where 36 cases of CPV were reported from a postcode in February. Although the project is still in its infancy, already new information on disease distribution has been produced. Disease information generated could facilitate targeted control and prevention programs.","Ward, M.P.; Kelman, M.",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,600,29

METHODS: The COVID-19 patients were selected using the convenience sampling method. Perceived-stigma level was evaluated using the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Frequency was used to describe the general information and disease investigation status of COVID-19 patients; mean and standard deviation were used for describing stigma levels, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (nonparametric test) was applied for pairwise comparison. Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test for grade data, and Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner test for multiple comparative analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed, and statistically significant indicators in single-factor analysis were included to investigate the independent factors of stigma. The p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: SIS score of the 122 COVID-19 patients averaged 57.37±9.99 points. There were statistically significant differences in perceived-stigma levels among patients of different ages (p = 0.008), occupation (p <0.001), marital status (p = 0.009), and disease severity (p = 0.020). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the main influencing factor of stigma (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The overall perceived-stigma level of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the epidemic was moderate. Younger, unmarried, and severely ill patients had a higher level of perceived-stigma, with age being the main factor. More attention should be given to the young COVID-19 patients.","Lin, Bihua; Zhong, Guiqin; Liang, Zeyan; Huang, Jianying; Wang, Xiaofang; Lin, Yanjuan",PLoS One,600,2

Programs with residential components have been particularly impacted as they try to keep infection from spreading in facilities and contributing to further community spread of the virus. This crisis highlights the ongoing daily trade-offs that organizations must weigh as they balance the risks and benefits of individual patients with those of the group of patients, staff and the community they serve. MAIN BODY: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced provider organizations to make individual facility level decisions about how to manage patients who are COVID-19 positive while protecting other patients, staff and the community. While guidance documents from federal, state, and trade groups aimed to support such decision making, they often lagged pandemic dynamics, and provided too little detail to translate into front line decision making. In the context of incomplete knowledge to make informed decisions, we present a way to integrate guidelines and local data into the decision process and discuss the ethical dilemmas faced by provider organizations in preventing infections and responding to COVID positive patients or staff. CONCLUSION AND COMMENTARY: Provider organizations need decision support on managing the risk of COVID-19 positive patients in their milieu. While useful, guidance documents may not be capable of providing support with the nuance that local data and simulation modeling may be able to provide.","Johnson, Kimberly A.; Keough, Carolyn; Hills, Holly; Vermeer, Wouter; Lengnick-Hall, Rebecca; McNulty, Moira; McGovern, Mark; Brown, Hendricks",Addict Sci Clin Pract,600,1

METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal, descriptive study was undertaken to review all patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca, Spain, during 1 March–31 December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2567 patients received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Eighty-six patients from endemic areas were included. Seven patients had strongyloidiasis. Five patients were female.

The ability of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host. In this study, we sought to understand the immunological basis for the fatal encephalitis following infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM, in contrast with the more attenuated MHV-A59. Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes. In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFNβ mRNA relative to IFNγ mRNA. This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection. Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFNγ production and antiviral activity. MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of macrophages in the brain on day 7 compared to MHV-A59 infection. These observations indicate that differences in the severity of viral encephalitis may reflect the differential ability of viruses to stimulate innate immune responses within the CNS and subsequently the character of infiltrating leukocyte populations.","Rempel, Julia D.; Murray, Shannon J.; Meisner, Jeffrey; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Virology,600,1

A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify the relationship between risk factors, therapeutic interventions and the composite outcome variable. RESULTS: A total of 1292 patients (56.1% male) were included. Two hundred and twenty-five (17.4%) died and 327 (25.3%) reached the main outcome variable.

Sensitivity analysis using different alternative logistic regression models identified consistently the ratio admissions/hospital beds as a predictor of the outcome [OR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02–1.11)]. CONCLUSION: These findings may help to identify patients at hospital admission with a higher risk of death and may urge healthcare authorities to implement policies aimed at reducing deaths by increasing the availability of hospital beds.","Pérez-de-Llano, Luis; Romay-Lema, Eva María; Baloira-Villar, Adolfo; Anchorena, Christian; Torres-Durán, María Luisa; Sousa, Adrián; Corbacho-Abelaira, Dolores; Paz-Ferrin, José; Diego-Roza, Carmen; Vilariño-Maneiro, Laura; Marcos, Pedro J.; Montero-Martínez, Carmen; de la Iglesia-Martínez, Fernando; Riveiro-Blanco, Vanessa; Rodríguez-Núñez, Nuria; Abal-Arca, José; Bustillo-Casado, María; Golpe, Rafael",PLoS One,600,10

However, there is a paucity of research in this field in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship of binary gender identity (female/male) with beliefs, attitudes, and pandemic-related practices in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: This study is based on a cross-sectional, voluntary response survey. Patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 5 and June 7, 2020 were invited to participate. All patients were tested within a large community healthcare system that serves patients through eight hospitals and hundreds of clinics across Washington State. Bivariate associations between gender and various demographics were tested using Chi-squared and Student's t-tests. We examined associations between gender and pandemic-related beliefs, attitudes, and practices using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for potential confounding factors. Results: Females were more likely than males to agree that they (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.14–2.00) or their families (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.31–2.33) were threatened by SARS-CoV-2, or that their own behavior could impact transmission (aOR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.49–3.15). Similarly, females were more likely to agree that social distancing (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.19–2.46), handwashing (aOR = 3.27, 95% CI 2.06–5.21), and masking (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.02–1.94) were necessary to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread. Females were significantly less likely to visit outside of their social distancing circle (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.47–0.81), but among those who did, practices of social distancing (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.89–2.23), remaining outdoors (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.56–1.40), and masking (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.74–1.93) were comparable to males, while females practiced handwashing more than males (aOR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.33–3.34). Conclusions: Our study suggests that gender disparate beliefs, attitudes, and practices existed in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Efforts should be tailored to encourage males to engage with mitigation efforts in ongoing pandemic-related public health campaigns.","Pflugeisen, Bethann Mangel; Mou, Jin",Front Public Health,600,21
