324,324,324,Combination strategies for pandemic influenza response - a systematic review of mathematical modeling studies,15.666839,6.687157,2009-12-10,"BACKGROUND: Individual strategies in pandemic preparedness plans may not reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: We searched modeling publications through PubMed and associated references from 1990 to 30 September 2009. Inclusion criteria were modeling papers quantifying the effectiveness of combination strategies, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. RESULTS: Nineteen modeling papers on combination strategies were selected. Four studies examined combination strategies on a global scale, 14 on single countries, and one on a small community. Stochastic individual-based modeling was used in nine studies, stochastic meta-population modeling in five, and deterministic compartmental modeling in another five. As part of combination strategies, vaccination was explored in eight studies, antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment in 16, area or household quarantine in eight, case isolation in six, social distancing measures in 10 and air travel restriction in six studies. Two studies suggested a high probability of successful influenza epicenter containment with combination strategies under favorable conditions. During a pandemic, combination strategies delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Combination strategies remained effective at high reproductive numbers compared with single strategy. Global cooperative strategies, including redistribution of antiviral drugs, were effective in reducing the global impact and attack rates of pandemic influenza. CONCLUSION: Combination strategies increase the effectiveness of individual strategies. They include pharmaceutical (antiviral agents, antibiotics and vaccines) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (case isolation, quarantine, personal hygiene measures, social distancing and travel restriction). Local epidemiological and modeling studies are needed to validate efficacy and feasibility.","Lee, Vernon J; Lye, David C; Wilder-Smith, Annelies",BMC Med,153,22
514,514,514,Factors Affecting Intention to Receive and Self-Reported Receipt of 2009 Pandemic (H1N1) Vaccine in Hong Kong: A Longitudinal Study,15.948683,6.4699116,2011-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination was a core component for mitigating the 2009 influenza pandemic (pH1N1). However, a vaccination program's efficacy largely depends on population compliance. We examined general population decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination using a modified Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal study, collecting data before and after the introduction of pH1N1 vaccine in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested if a modified TPB had explanatory utility for vaccine uptake among adults. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 896 subjects who completed both the baseline and the follow-up surveys, 7% (67/896) reported being “likely/very likely/certain” to be vaccinated (intent) but two months later only 0.8% (7/896) reported having received pH1N1 vaccination. Perception of low risk from pH1N1 (60%) and concerns regarding adverse effects of the vaccine (37%) were primary justifications for avoiding pH1N1 vaccination. Greater perceived vaccine benefits (β = 0.15), less concerns regarding vaccine side-effects (β = −0.20), greater adherence to social norms of vaccination (β = 0.39), anticipated higher regret if not vaccinated (β = 0.47), perceived higher self-efficacy for vaccination (β = 0.12) and history of seasonal influenza vaccination (β = 0.12) were associated with higher intention to receive the pH1N1 vaccine, which in turn predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.30). Social norm (β = 0.70), anticipated regret (β = 0.19) and vaccination intention (β = 0.31) were positively associated with, and accounted for 70% of variance in vaccination planning, which, in turn subsequently predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.36) accounting for 36% of variance in reported vaccination behaviour. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Perceived low risk from pH1N1 and perceived high risk from pH1N1 vaccine inhibited pH1N1 vaccine uptake. Both the TPB and the additional components contributed to intended vaccination uptake but social norms and anticipated regret predominantly associated with vaccination intention and planning. Vaccination planning is a more significant proximal determinant of uptake of pH1N1 vaccine than is intention. Intention alone is an unreliable predictor of future vaccine uptake.","Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak; Fielding, Richard",PLoS One,153,22
779,779,779,Influenza A H1N1 2009 (Swine Flu) and Pregnancy,16.016369,6.2885957,2011-09-23,"The Influenza A H1N1 pandemic (A H1N1) occurred between June 2009 and August 2010. Although the pandemic is now over, the virus has emerged as the predominant strain in the current seasonal influenza phase in the northern hemisphere. The A H1N1 influenza is a novel strain of the influenza A virus and is widely known as swine flu. The virus contains a mixture of genetic material from human, pig and bird flu virus. It is a new variety of flu which people have not had much immunity to. Much has been learnt from the Pandemic of 2009/2010 but the messages about vaccination and treatment seem to be taken slowly by the clinical profession. Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery. The median duration of illness is around seven days. This influenza typically affects the younger age group i.e. from the ages of 5–65 years. Current experience shows that the age group experiencing increased morbidity and mortality rates are in those under 65 years of age. Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters. In the United Kingdom, twelve maternal deaths were reported to be associated with the H1N1 virus during the pandemic and clear avoidable factors were identified (Modder, Review of Maternal Deaths in the UK related to A H1N1 2009 influenza (CMACE). www.cmace.org.uk, 2010). The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate (Yates et al. Health Technol Assess 14(34):109–182, 2010). There continues to be a low uptake of the flu vaccine and commencement of antiviral treatment for pregnant women.","Lim, Boon H.; Mahmood, Tahir A.",J Obstet Gynaecol India,153,1
2166,2166,2166,Meta-analyses including non-randomized studies of therapeutic interventions: a methodological review,15.610183,6.662234,2016-03-22,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of meta-analyses including data from non-randomized studies for therapeutic evaluation. We aimed to systematically assess the methods used in meta-analyses including non-randomized studies evaluating therapeutic interventions. METHODS: For this methodological review, we searched MEDLINE via PubMed, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 for meta-analyses including at least one non-randomized study evaluating therapeutic interventions. Etiological assessments and meta-analyses with no comparison group were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed the general characteristics and key methodological components of the systematic review process and meta-analysis methods. RESULTS: One hundred eighty eight meta-analyses were selected: 119 included both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) and 69 only NRSI. Half of the meta-analyses (n = 92, 49 %) evaluated non-pharmacological interventions. “Grey literature” was searched for 72 meta-analyses (38 %). An assessment of methodological quality or risk of bias was reported in 135 meta-analyses (72 %) but this assessment considered the risk of confounding bias in only 33 meta-analyses (18 %). In 130 meta-analyses (69 %), the design of each NRSI was not clearly specified. In 131 (70 %), whether crude or adjusted estimates of treatment effect for NRSI were combined was unclear or not reported. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed in 182 meta-analyses (97 %) and further explored in 157 (84 %). Reporting bias was assessed in 127 (68 %). CONCLUSIONS: Some key methodological components of the systematic review process—search for grey literature, description of the type of NRSI included, assessment of risk of confounding bias and reporting of whether crude or adjusted estimates were combined—are not adequately carried out or reported in meta-analyses including NRSI.","Faber, Timor; Ravaud, Philippe; Riveros, Carolina; Perrodeau, Elodie; Dechartres, Agnes",BMC Med Res Methodol,153,22
2595,2595,2595,Participant retention practices in longitudinal clinical research studies with high retention rates,15.772872,6.722203,2017-02-20,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for improving cohort retention in longitudinal studies. Our objective was to identify cohort retention strategies and implementation approaches used in studies with high retention rates. METHODS: Longitudinal studies with ≥200 participants, ≥80% retention rates over ≥1 year of follow-up were queried from an Institutional Review Board database at a large research-intensive U.S. university; additional studies were identified through networking. Nineteen (86%) of 22 eligible studies agreed to participate. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews, participants provided retention strategies based on themes identified from previous literature reviews. Synthesis of data was completed by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: The most commonly used retention strategies were: study reminders, study visit characteristics, emphasizing study benefits, and contact/scheduling strategies. The research teams were well-functioning, organized, and persistent. Additionally, teams tailored their strategies to their participants, often adapting and innovating their approaches. CONCLUSIONS: These studies included specialized and persistent teams and utilized tailored strategies specific to their cohort and individual participants. Studies’ written protocols and published manuscripts often did not reflect the varied strategies employed and adapted through the duration of study. Appropriate retention strategy use requires cultural sensitivity and more research is needed to identify how strategy use varies globally.","Abshire, Martha; Dinglas, Victor D.; Cajita, Maan Isabella A.; Eakin, Michelle N.; Needham, Dale M.; Himmelfarb, Cheryl Dennison",BMC Med Res Methodol,153,22
4161,4161,4161,Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era,15.725832,6.205292,2019-11-18,"IMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; ≥50 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study support having high targets for 2-dose measles vaccine coverage, particularly among school-aged children in the United States.","Gastañaduy, Paul A.; Funk, Sebastian; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Rota, Paul A.; Gambhir, Manoj; Grenfell, Bryan; Paul, Prabasaj",JAMA Pediatr,153,1

7197,7197,7197,MERS: What is the current situation in Saudi Arabia?,15.862554,6.55866,2018-09-15,"A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1,239 replacements (544 transitions, 695 transversions), the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval 50 to 56) compared with the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared with that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, the available data have the power to verify the “conservative transitions” hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.","Stoltzfus, Arlin; Norris, Ryan W.",Mol Biol Evol,153,22

We reviewed the literature on infectious diseases of 34 large (maximum body mass of adults >20 kg) terrestrial carnivore species, 18 of which are considered to be threatened in the wild, and examined reports of antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) and cases of infection, mortality and population decline. Of 52 diseases examined, 44% were viral, 31% bacterial and the remainder were protozoal or fungal. Many infections were endemic in carnivores and/or infected multiple taxonomic families, with the majority probably occurring via inhalation or ingestion. Most disease studies consisted of serological surveys for disease antibodies, and antibody detection tended to be widespread implying that exposure to micro‐organisms was common. Seroprevalence was higher in tropical than temperate areas, and marginally higher for infections known to occur in multiple carnivore groups. Confirmation of active infection via micro‐organism recovery was less common for ursids than other taxonomic groups. Published descriptions of disease‐induced population decline or extinction were rare, and most outbreaks were allegedly the result of direct transmission of rabies or canine distemper virus (CDV) from abundant carnivore species to less‐common large carnivores. We conclude that the threat of disease epidemics in large carnivores may be serious if otherwise lethal infections are endemic in reservoir hosts and transmitted horizontally among taxa. To prevent or mitigate future population declines, research efforts should be aimed at identifying both the diseases of potential importance to large carnivores and the ecological conditions associated with their spread and severity.","Murray, Dennis L.; Kapke, Cynthia A.; Evermann, James F.; Fuller, Todd K.",Anim Conserv,153,1
10582,10582,10582,Perspectives on Fatigue from the Study of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Related Conditions,16.060257,6.461403,2010-05-31,"The principal component analysis based on the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues is applied to DNA and RNA polymerases to assign the sequence motifs for the polymerization activities of these proteins. After the reconfirmation of the sequence motifs of families A and B of DNA polymerases indicated previously, it elucidates the sequence motifs for the polymerization activity of DNA polymerase III (family C) by the similarity to the polymerization center of multimeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases. This identification proceeds to clarify the sequence motifs for polymerization activities of primases; eukaryotic and archaebacterial primases carry motifs similar to those of family C, while the motifs of eubacterial primase fall into the category of the motifs in family B DNA polymerases such as α, δ, ϵ and II. This finding means that DNA dependent RNA polymerases are also divided into groups corresponding to three families, A, B and C, because the monomeric DNA dependent RNA polymerases in phages are reconfirmed to carry sequence motifs similar to those of family A DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the three families of polymerization motifs are found to fall within the variation range of polymerization motifs displayed by many RNA dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting a close evolutionary relation between them. The sequence motifs for polymerization activities of reverse transcriptase and telomerase seem to be the intermediate between family A DNA polymerase and some RNA dependent RNA polymerases, e.g., from Leviviridae. On the contrary, the sequence fragments similar to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily including DNA polymerase β are not found in any RNA dependent RNA polymerase, suggesting their other lineage of polymerization motifs.","Otsuka, Jinya; Kikuchi, Norihiro; Kojima, Shinji",,153,1

Using an animal model, we show that an alcohol-associated context elevates entry into a fluid port triggered by a conditioned stimulus (CS) that predicted alcohol (CS-triggered alcohol-seeking). This effect persists across multiple sessions and, after it diminishes in extinction, the alcohol context retains the capacity to augment reinstatement. Systemically administered eticlopride and chemogenetic inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons reduce CS-triggered alcohol-seeking. Chemogenetically silencing VTA dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core reduces CS-triggered alcohol-seeking, irrespective of context, whereas silencing VTA dopamine terminals in the NAc shell selectively reduces the elevation of CS-triggered alcohol-seeking in an alcohol context. This dissociation reveals new roles for divergent mesolimbic dopamine circuits in the control of responding to a discrete cue for alcohol and in the amplification of this behaviour in an alcohol context.","Valyear, Milan D.; Glovaci, Iulia; Zaari, Audrey; Lahlou, Soraya; Trujillo-Pisanty, Ivan; Andrew Chapman, C.; Chaudhri, Nadia",Nat Commun,153,1

No study has been conducted of the choroid in relation to the retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (RGC-IPL). We sought to measure choroidal thickness in chronic LHON and to correlate thickness changes with the RGC-IPL. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Chronic LHON, 11778 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, patients (26 eyes; mean age: 35.1 ± 16.1 years) were prospectively recruited at Doheny Eye Center, University of California Los Angeles from March 2016 to July 2017. Age-matched healthy controls (27 eyes; mean age: 32.4 ± 11.1 years) were enroled for comparison. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging was performed in chronic LHON patients and compared with age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: The macular choroid was significantly thinner in chronic LHON (250.5 ± 62.2 μm) compared with controls (313.9 ± 60.2 μm; p < 0.0001). The peripapillary choroid was also significantly thinner in chronic LHON (135.7 ± 51.4 μm) compared with controls (183.0 ± 61.8 μm, p < 0.001). Choroidal thickness strongly correlated with retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in both the macular (R(2) = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.84) and peripapillary regions (R(2) = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31–0.70). Choroidal thickness was also significantly correlated with macular RGC-IPL thickness (R(2) = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26–0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal thinning in chronic LHON correlated strongly with both RNFL and RGC-IPL thicknesses.

Despite international and national laws permitting availability, opioid access remains inadequate, particularly in South, Southeast, East and Central Asia. AIM: To review evidence of perceptions and experiences of regulatory enablers and barriers to opioid access in South, Southeast, East and Central Asia. DESIGN: Systematic review of post-2000 research according to PRISMA guidelines. Data were subjected to critical interpretive synthesis. International, national and sub-national barriers were organised developing a conceptual framework of opioid availability. DATA SOURCES: PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library. CINAHL, Complete and ASSIA from 2000 until 20th May 2019. RESULTS: 21/14097 studies included: quantitative n = 15, qualitative n = 3 and mixed-methods n = 3. Four barrier/enabler themes were developed: Legal, regulatory, socio-political; lack of laws explicitly enabling opioid access, restrictive international controls and clinician prescribing concerns. Opioid availability; limited availability, poor policymaker and clinician education regarding opioid benefits, poor continuity of supply. Opioid Accessibility; medicine costs, distance to prescribing centres. Prescribing; extensive bureaucratic barriers, lack of human resources for prescribing. We present a novel framework of a self-perpetuating model of inadequate opioid provision. The Single Convention on Narcotics provides the context of restrictive laws and negative attitudes amongst policymakers. A consequent lack of prescribers and clinicians’ negative attitudes at sub-national levels, results in inadequate access to and use of opioids. Data of inadequate consumption informs annual requirement estimates used by the International Narcotics Control Board to determine future opioid availability. CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory and socio-political actions unintentionally limit opioid access. International and national laws explicitly enabling opioid access are required, to assuage concerns, promote training and appropriate prescribing.","Clark, Joseph; Gnanapragasam, Sam; Greenley, Sarah; Pearce, Jessica; Johnson, Miriam",Palliat Med,153,16

The low incidence of vascular complications in GCK-MODY makes it a natural paradigm for interrogating molecular mechanisms promoting vascular health under prolonged hyperglycemia. Clinical rate of misdiagnosis has remained high, and a reliable serum lipid biomarker that precedes genetic screening can facilitate correct diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we comprehensively quantitated 565 serum lipids from 25 classes in 105 subjects (42 nondiabetic controls, 30 GC K-MODY patients, 33 drug-naïve, and newly-onset T2D patients). At false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, several phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and plasmalogen PCs were specifically increased in GCK-MODY, while triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs) were reduced. Correlation matrices between lipids uncovered coregulation between plasmalogen PCs (PCps) and glycerolipid precursors was distinctly enhanced in GCK-MODY compared to T2D. Strengthened positive correlations between serum PCps and circulating HDLs was specifically observed in hyperglycemic subjects (i.e. T2D and GCK-MODY) compared to normglycemic controls, suggesting that HDL-PCps may elicit distinct physiological effects under hyperglycemia. Amongst GCK-MODY patients, individuals harboring variants of GCK mutations with elevated PCps also exhibited higher HDLs. Isolated HDLs displayed localized increases (p < 0.05) in very-long-chain PUFA-PCs and PCps in GCK-MODY. Protein analyses revealed elevated levels of HDL-resident ATGL (P = 0.003) and CEPT1 (P < 0.0001), which mediate critical steps of PCps production along the TAG-DAG-PC axis, in GCK-MODY relative to T2D. A panel of four lipids differentiated GCK-MODY from T2D with AUC of 0.950 (95% CI 0.903–9.997). This study provides the first evidence that enhanced recruitment of CEPT1 and ATGL onto HDLs essentially underlie the atheroprotective profiles associated with GCK-MODY. Resultant increases in the production of HDL-PCps and PUFA-PCs provides an active, circulating form of protection towards the vasculature of GCK-MODY, thereby lowering the incidence of vascular complications despite chronic exposure to hyperglycemia since birth.","Wang, Xiaojing; Lam, Sin Man; Cao, Mingjun; Wang, Tong; Wang, Zhixin; Yu, Miao; Li, Bowen; Zhang, Huabing; Ping, Fan; Song, Guangyao; Feng, Kai; Zhang, Qian; Xu, Jianping; Zhou, Liyuan; Deng, Mingqun; Zhai, Xiao; Xiao, Xinhua; Shui, Guanghou",Redox Biol,153,31

The molecular target of our analysis was the GMC oxidoreductase from Penicillium expansum involved in the biosynthesis of patulin, a mycotoxin that can contaminate many foods, especially fruits and fruit-based products. The employed in silico/in vitro/in vivo assays described in our study proved the effectiveness of our strategy and in particular of two small molecules, 6-hydroxycoumarin (structurally related to umbelliferon, an already characterized patulin synthase inhibitor) and meticrane (an already approved drug) in reducing patulin accumulation. Our findings highly recommend the mentioned ligands to be subjected to further analysis for being used in the next future in place of other more toxic compounds, in postharvest treatments based on dipping or drenching methods. ABSTRACT: Flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent glucose methanol choline oxidoreductase (GMC oxidoreductase) is the terminal key enzyme of the patulin biosynthetic pathway. GMC oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidative ring closure of (E)-ascladiol to patulin. Currently, no protein involved in the patulin biosynthesis in Penicillium expansum has been experimentally characterized or solved by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, nothing is known about P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase substrate-binding site and mode of action. In the present investigation, a 3D comparative model for P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase has been described. Furthermore, a multistep computational approach was used to identify P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase residues involved in the FAD binding and in substrate recognition. Notably, the obtained 3D comparative model of P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase was used for performing a virtual screening of a chemical/drug library, which allowed to predict new GMC oxidoreductase high affinity ligands to be tested in in vitro/in vivo assays. In vitro assays performed in presence of 6-hydroxycoumarin and meticrane, among the highly affinity predicted binders, confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition (17–81%) of patulin production by 6-hydroxycoumarin (10 µM–1 mM concentration range), whereas the approved drug meticrane inhibited patulin production by 43% already at 10 µM. Furthermore, 6-hydroxycoumarin and meticrane caused a 60 and 41% reduction of patulin production, respectively, in vivo on apples at 100 µg/wound.","Tragni, Vincenzo; Cotugno, Pietro; De Grassi, Anna; Cavalluzzi, Maria Maddalena; Mincuzzi, Annamaria; Lentini, Giovanni; Sanzani, Simona Marianna; Ippolito, Antonio; Pierri, Ciro Leonardo",Biology (Basel),153,1

Selecting the ideal questionnaire for this purpose may be challenging for researchers. This study aims to review which questionnaires are used to evaluate telemedicine services in the studies, which are most common, and what aspects of telemedicine evaluation do they capture. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched in August 2020 to retrieve articles. Data extracted from the final list of articles included author/year of publication, journal of publication, type of evaluation, and evaluation questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were included in this study. The questionnaire was used for evaluating the satisfaction (49%), usability (34%), acceptance (11.5%), and implementation (2%) of telemedicine services. Among telemedicine specific questionnaires, Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) (19%), Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) (13%), and Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ) (5.5%), were respectively most frequently used in the collected articles. Other most used questionnaires generally used for evaluating the users’ satisfaction, usability, and acceptance of technology were Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) (5.5%), Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) (5.5%), System Usability Scale (SUS) (5.5%), Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) (5.5%), and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (3.5%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Employing specifically designed questionnaires or designing a new questionnaire with fewer questions and more comprehensiveness in terms of the issues studied provides a better evaluation. Attention to user needs, end-user acceptance, and implementation processes, along with users' satisfaction and usability evaluation, may optimize telemedicine efforts in the future.","Hajesmaeel-Gohari, Sadrieh; Bahaadinbeigy, Kambiz",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,153,1

Infections (such as influenza) spread from person to person, and people are rarely confined to a single area. Therefore, creating a regional influenza prediction model should consider the flow of people between different areas. Although various regional flu prediction models have previously been proposed, they do not consider the flow of people among areas. In this study, we propose a method that can predict the geographical distribution of influenza patients using commuting data to represent the flow of people. To elucidate the complex spatial dependence relations, our model uses an extension of the graph convolutional network (GCN). Additionally, a prediction interval for medical institutions is proposed, which is suitable for cyclic time series. Subsequently, we used the weekly data of flu patients from health authorities as the ground-truth to evaluate the prediction interval and performance of influenza patient prediction in each prefecture in Japan. The results indicate that our GCN-based model, which used commuting data, considerably improved the predictive accuracy over baseline values both temporally and spatially to provide an appropriate prediction interval. The proposed model is vital in practical settings, such as in the decision making of public health authorities and addressing growth in vaccine demand and workload. This paper primarily presents a GCN as a useful means for predicting the spread of an epidemic.","Murayama, Taichi; Shimizu, Nobuyuki; Fujita, Sumio; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",PLoS One,153,1

Children with intellectual disability, especially adolescents, have a higher risk of being overweight/obese and having poor HRPF levels. Therefore, more interventions are needed to help this population attain their optimal health levels. However, there has been relatively limited research on this population compared with on their typically developing peers. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing and examining the success of a physical activity (PA) intervention for the target population. METHODS: The proposed study will be a 12-week, school-based randomized controlled trial. The participants (N=48) will be recruited from special schools for students with mild intellectual disability and then randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG) or the wait-list control group (CG). During the intervention period, the participants in the IG will receive a fun game–based moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) training program (2 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session, for a total of 24 sessions). The intensity of the activities will increase in a progressive manner. Participants in the CG will receive no program during the study period, but the same PA program will be provided to them after the completion of the study. To observe and evaluate the sustaining effects of the intervention, follow-up testing will be scheduled for the participants 12 weeks after the intervention concludes. The study outcomes will include primary outcomes (obesity- and fitness-related outcomes) and a secondary outcome (blood pressure). All of the measurements will be taken at 3 time points. After the follow-up tests, the same PA training program will be provided to the participants in the CG. RESULTS: This study is ongoing. The participants were recruited from October 2020 to November 2020. The total duration of the study is 13 months. Study results are expected at the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study is expected to reduce obesity and improve HRPF levels in children with intellectual disability. If proven effective, the intervention will be made accessible to more special schools and mainstream schools with students with intellectual disability. Furthermore, the study can serve as an example for international researchers, policy makers, and members of the public who are seeking to tackle the problem of obesity and poor HRPF among children with intellectual disability.

Patients with TNBC have poor overall survival because of limited molecular therapeutic targets. Recently, exosomes have been recognized as key mediators in cancer progression, but the molecular components and function of TNBC-derived exosomes remain unknown. The main goal of this study was to reveal the proteomic landscape of serum exosomes derived from ten patients with TNBC and 17 healthy donors to identify potential therapeutic targets. Using a tandem mass tag–based quantitative proteomics approach, we characterized the proteomes of individual patient-derived serum exosomes, identified exosomal protein signatures specific to patients with TNBC, and filtered out differentially expressed proteins. Most importantly, we found that the tetraspanin CD151 expression levels in TNBC-derived serum exosomes were significantly higher than those exosomes from healthy subjects, and we validated our findings with samples from 16 additional donors. Furthermore, utilizing quantitative proteomics approach to reveal the proteomes of CD151-deleted exosomes and cells, we found that exosomal CD151 facilitated secretion of ribosomal proteins via exosomes while inhibiting exosome secretion of complement proteins. Moreover, we proved that CD151-deleted exosomes significantly decreased the migration and invasion of TNBC cells. This is the first comparative study of the proteomes of TNBC patient–derived and CD151-deleted exosomes. Our findings indicate that profiling of TNBC-derived exosomal proteins is a useful tool to extend our understanding of TNBC, and exosomal CD151 may be a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.","Li, Sipeng; Li, Xinya; Yang, Siqi; Pi, Hao; Li, Zheyi; Yao, Pengju; Zhang, Qi; Wang, Qingsong; Shen, Pingping; Li, Xizhou; Ji, Jianguo",Mol Cell Proteomics,153,1

While proper treatment requires adequate recognition of airway obstruction, caretakers are often struggling with this judgment, consequently leading to insufficient or late treatment and an unnecessary discomfort of the patient. Digital technologies may serve to support parental decision taking. The aim of the present pilot study is to acquire data on the feasibility of recruitment and observation procedures for a randomized controlled trial on the impact of a digital wheeze detector in a home management setting of pre-school wheezing. METHODS: This single-armed pilot study enrolled patients with a doctor’s diagnosis of wheezing aged 9 to 72 months. Participants were asked to use a digital wheeze detector (WheezeScan, Omron Healthcare, Japan) 2×/day for 30 days and record the child’s respiratory symptoms, detection of wheezing, and medication intake via an electronic diary (eDiary) app. Demographic and clinical data were collected at the recruitment visit. The asthma control test and the Parent Asthma Management Self-Efficacy Scale (PAMSES) were assessed both, at recruitment and follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty families were recruited and completed the monitoring. All but one completed the follow-up after 30 days. The recruitment procedures were feasible, and adherence to daily monitoring reached an average of 81%. The use of the wheeze detector was rated as uncomplicated. Parents detected wheezing without digital support in only 22/708 (3.1%) of the recorded events. By contrast, the wheeze detector indicated an airway obstruction in 140/708 (19.8%) of the recordings. CONCLUSION: In parallel to feasible recruitment procedures, we observed good usability of the wheeze detection device and high adherence to eDiary recording. The positive outcomes show that the WheezeScan may empower parents by increasing their capacity for wheeze detection. This deserves to be investigated in a larger randomized controlled trial.","Dramburg, Stephanie; Dellbrügger, Ellen; van Aalderen, Wim; Matricardi, Paolo Maria",Pilot Feasibility Stud,153,1

Predicting who is likely to develop anaphylaxis is still an inexact science. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) shows promise as a biomarker involved in peanut allergy, as nitric oxide plays a role in inhibiting mast cell degranulation which is relevant in anaphylaxis, where mast cell degranulation plays a mediator role. The aim of this study was to assess the change in FeNO in children during peanut challenge. METHODS: Thirty-six children aged from 5 to 17 years were recruited for open-labelled peanut challenge. Participants had skin prick test to peanut performed, and serum collected for Ara h2 specific IgE and peanut specific IgE. FeNO was measured by portable device (NIOX VERO) prior to and throughout the peanut challenge. RESULTS: When grouped according to reaction type at peanut challenge (anaphylaxis, clinical allergy not anaphylaxis and tolerant), there were significant differences in the mean change in FeNO measurement between the anaphylaxis group and the clinical allergy, not anaphylaxis group (p = 0.005), and between the anaphylaxis group and tolerant group (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FeNO decreased more significantly in those who subsequently developed anaphylaxis than in those with clinical allergy, not anaphylaxis or negative peanut challenge (tolerance). As a bedside test that can be used in children, it has potential for further research into mechanisms of anaphylaxis in food allergy and potentially assists in predicting an imminent anaphylactic reaction in some patients.

In each paper, coaching led to an improvement in clinical and non-clinical health outcomes. CONCLUSION: The training provided to health coaches varied and in some cases was not reported. Inconsistencies in reports led to difficulties when comparing study outcomes. Therefore, conclusions about the modality providing the greatest improvement in patient outcomes and the most pragmatic health coaching modality are not possible.

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in exogenous surfactant, and clinical trials are investigating surfactant therapy in COVID-19 respiratory disease. There is biological plausibility of benefit from surfactant, and patients who are early in their disease and do not meet full ARDS diagnostic criteria may respond differently, and perhaps more favourably, to surfactant therapy. Clinical trials that investigate patients with severe ARDS have a high likelihood of reproducing already known findings of surfactant therapy and systematically exclude patients who might exhibit a novel response to exogenous surfactant.","Schlegelmilch, Michael P.",,153,16

While there had been a shift by some persons to utilize digital solutions to mitigate the effects of the imposed social isolation, many facilities did not have sufficient information regarding available solutions to implement institutional strategies to support social connectedness through digital solutions. To support our partners in evidence-based policy-making we conducted a scoping review to identify existing virtual technology solutions, apps, and platforms feasible to promote social connectedness among persons residing in a long-term care facility context during times of lockdown such as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial identification of relevant literature involved a combination of keywords and subject headings searches within 5 databases (PubMed, CINAHL EBSCO, PsychINFO EBSCO, Embase OVIDSP, and Web of Science ISI). DistillerSR was used to screen, chart and summarize the data. There is growth in the availability of technologies focused on promoting health and well-being in later life for persons in long-term care facilities however a gap remains in widespread uptake. We will describe the breadth of technologies identified in this review and discuss how they vary in utility in smaller scale facilities common in rural areas. Of the technologies that can be used to mitigate the impacts of social isolation felt by long-term care residents, many “solutions” depend on stable highspeed internet, which remains a challenge in rural and northern areas.","Freeman, Shannon; Abgoji, Aderonke; Koopmans, Alanna; Ross, Christopher",Innov Aging,153,12

However, there are few reports available regarding the feasibility and safety of these studies in low-age population. This study is aimed at evaluating the safety, feasibility, and value of colonic TET in 3-7 years old children. METHODS: All patients aged 3-7 years who underwent colonic TET in our center for WMT or medication were prospectively evaluated. The feasibility and safety of TET were evaluated. A questionnaire was completed by the children's parents to evaluate the children's response to the colonic TET as well as the parent's satisfaction. RESULTS: Forty-seven children were included (mean age 5 years). TET was implemented into the colon of all the patients, and the success rate of the procedure was 100%. The median retention time of TET tube within the colon was 6 (IQR 5-7) days in 45 patients with tube falling out spontaneously, and the maximum retention time was up to 21 days. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that endoscopic clip number (P = 0.009) was an independent contributing factor for the retaining time of tube. With increase in the number of large clips, the retention time of TET tube was prolonged. No discomfort was reported during injection of the microbiota or medication suspension through the TET tube. During the follow-up, no severe adverse events were observed. All children's parents were satisfied with TET. Interestingly, the proportion of children's parents choosing TET as the delivery way of WMT increased from 29.79% before to 70.21% after TET (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, demonstrates that colonic TET is a novel, safe, and convenient colonic delivery way for WMT and medication in children aged 3-7 years.","Zhong, Min; Buch, Heena; Wen, Quan; Long, Chuyan; Cui, Bota; Zhang, Faming",Gastroenterol Res Pract,153,1

Contaminants such as harmful gas, particulate matter and residual material generated in factories are the main causes of air pollution. Therefore, there is a need for strict control of contaminants occurring in the factory. In this paper, we propose a new platform using the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to monitor the air quality without restriction of space. The proposed platform provides a service that collects data in real-time through the IoT sensor device based on LoRa (Long Range) based on the contaminant generated in the factory and transmits the encrypted data to the cloud through the transaction technology of the blockchain. Using this platform, air pollution generated in factories can be managed in real-time and data integrity can be preserved. Through this study, it is possible to measure and monitor contaminants generated in the air and use them as important data to improve and overcome environmental problems caused by air pollution.","Han, Yohan; Jeong, Jongpil",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,153,1

We propose a theoretical framework that links trust, trustworthiness and inequality. The key feature is that agents do not necessarily observe the entire income distribution but base their assessment on reference groups (i.e. they might hold a biased view of reality). In this framework the negative impact of inequality on interpersonal trust is related to the individual-specific perception of inequality. This has important implications for the empirical analyses since researchers typically do not observe perceptions but only objective measures of inequality (e.g. the Gini coefficient). We show that the use of the latter is appropriate only under restrictive assumptions and in general will result in an underestimation of the true effect. An unbiased estimate of the effect of inequality on trust can be obtained with a measure of individual-specific perceptions of inequality. Survey data support our framework. Perceptions of higher inequality exert a strong negative effect on trust.

The most recent storm, Yaas, has had a wide-spread impact on coastal areas, with high-intensity wind, rainfall, and, most significantly, inundation in Odisha and West Bengal coastal region. Yaas formed over east central Bay of Bengal as a depression and gradually intensified to VSCS and finally made landfall near Balasore of Odisha coast, with a wind speed of 130–140 km/h. on 26th May, 2021. The present study is, therefore, aimed to characterize the cyclone Yaas and to investigate the expansion of cyclonic inundation in different sector of coastal West Bengal. Several space-borne data sets were employed in this study, including GPM data to illustrate precipitation variability, Sentinel-1 images for inundation mapping, and Sentinel-2 data to determine MNDWI for both pre- and post-cyclonic periods.

To investigate what distance practices in secondary mathematics education have emerged and how teachers experienced them, we set out online questionnaires in Flanders—the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium—, Germany, and the Netherlands. The questionnaire focused on teaching practices, teacher beliefs, didactics, and assessment. Data consisted of completed questionnaires by 1719 mathematics teachers. Results show that the use of video conferencing tools increased massively, while the use of mathematics-specific tools that teachers used before the lockdown reduced substantially. Further findings are that teachers' confidence in using digital technologies increased remarkably during the lockdown and that their experiences and beliefs only marginally impacted their distance learning practices. Also, we observed some differences between the three countries that might be explained by differences in educational policies and in technological facilities and support. For future research, it would be relevant to investigate long-term changes in teachers’ practices, as well as students’ views and experiences related to the teacher’s practices.","Drijvers, Paul; Thurm, Daniel; Vandervieren, Ellen; Klinger, Marcel; Moons, Filip; van der Ree, Heleen; Mol, Amy; Barzel, Bärbel; Doorman, Michiel",Educ Stud Math,153,31

In a number of endemic countries and settings, interruption of schistosome transmission has been achieved. In others, Schistosoma infections continue to challenge program managers at different levels, from the complexity of the transmission cycle, over limited treatment options and lack of field-friendly accurate diagnostics, to controversy around adequate intervention strategies. We conducted a landscape analysis on parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination approaches with the aim to identify evidence-based strategies, core components and key concepts for achieving and sustaining schistosomiasis control and for progressing elimination efforts towards interruption of transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 118 relevant publications were identified from Web of Science, Pubmed and the grey literature and reviewed for their content. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 epidemiologists, program managers, policymakers, donors and field researchers. Available evidence emphasizes the need for comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies consisting of multiple complementary interventions that must be sustained over time by political commitment and adequate funding in order to reach interruption of transmission. Based on the findings of this landscape analysis, we propose a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination. Before deployment, the proposed interventions will require review, evaluation and validation in the frame of an expert consultation as a step towards adaptation to specific contexts, conditions and settings. Field testing to ensure local relevance and effectiveness is paramount given the diversity of socio-ecological and epidemiological contexts.","Monnier, Nora; Barth-Jaeggi, Tanja; Knopp, Stefanie; Steinmann, Peter",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,153,1

Several biomarkers have been proposed to predict COVID-19 severity, but no definite interpretative criteria have been established to date for stratifying risk. Objective: To evaluate six serum biomarkers (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, albumin, ferritin and cardiac troponin T) for predicting COVID-19 severity and to define related cut-offs able to aid clinicians in risk stratification of hospitalized patients. Design: A retrospective study of 427 COVID-19 patients was performed. Patients were divided into groups based on their clinical outcome: non-survivors vs. survivors and patients admitted to intensive care unit vs. others. ROC curves and likelihood ratios were employed to define predictive cut-offs for evaluated markers. Results: Marker concentrations at peak were significantly different between groups for both selected outcomes. At univariate logistic regression analysis, all parameters were significantly associated with higher odds of death and intensive care. At the multivariate analysis, high concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and low concentrations of albumin in serum remained significantly associated with higher odds of death, while only low lactate dehydrogenase activities remained associated with lower odds of intensive care admission. The best cut-offs for death prediction were >731 U/L for lactate dehydrogenase and ≤18 g/L for albumin, while a lactate dehydrogenase activity <425 U/L was associated with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.10 for intensive treatment. Conclusions: Our study identifies which biochemistry tests represent major predictors of COVID-19 severity and defines the best cut-offs for their use.","Aloisio, Elena; Chibireva, Mariia; Serafini, Ludovica; Pasqualetti, Sara; Falvella, Felicia S; Dolci, Alberto; Panteghini, Mauro",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,153,0

Electron-donating substituents at positions C2 and C7 of pyrene allow significant triplet generation because of the symmetrically forbidden transition between the ground state and the lowest singlet excited state, which leads to accumulation of triplet excitons in the dopant chromophore. This also leads to a small ground state absorption coefficient and induces greater absorption of sky-blue wavelengths when triplet excitons of the chromophore accumulate. Consequently, molecular glass doped with the designed chromophore displays stronger OL characteristics compared with those of the rare element-containing glass that previously demonstrated the greatest OL performance under continuous sky-blue irradiance at sunlight power levels. The described approach to developing cost-effective, state-of-the-art OL materials is crucial for nonlinear optical applications working at a large scale under sunlight or room lights.","Kamatsuki, Takuya; Bhattacharjee, Indranil; Hirata, Shuzo",The journal of physical chemistry letters,153,12

These viral sequences or 'viromes' encode viruses that populate the Earth's oceans [2, 3] and terrestrial environments [4, 5], where their infections impact life across diverse ecological niches and scales [6, 7], including humans [8-10]. Most viruses have yet to be isolated and cultured [11-13], and surprisingly few efforts have explored what analysis of available data might reveal about their nature. Here, we compiled and analyzed seven decades of one-step growth and other data for viruses from six major families, including their infections of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic hosts [14-191]. We found that the use of host cell biomass for virus production was highest for archaea at 10%, followed by bacteria at 1% and eukarya at 0.01%, highlighting the degree to which viruses of archaea and bacteria exploit their host cells. For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells. Furthermore, healthy and infected host cells were remarkably similar in the time they needed to multiply themselves or their virus progeny. Specifically, the doubling time of healthy cells and the delay time for virus release from infected cells were not only correlated (r = 0.71, p < 10-10, n = 101); they also spanned the same range from tens of minutes to about a week. These results have implications for better understanding the growth, spread and persistence of viruses in complex natural habitats that abound with diverse hosts, including humans and their associated microbes.","Jin, Tianyi; Yin, John",Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,153,1

We thereby carried out an emergency surveillance study in a Chinese city of Qingdao. METHODS Pharyngeal swab samples were collected from four targeted groups and tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Each laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 case or cluster was investigated, and the hemagglutinin genes of some of the viruses were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 140 pandemic H1N1 cases including 92 from 7 clusters were identified in the four targeted groups. None of them developed into severe infections. Meanwhile, 103 cases of seasonal influenza (98 H3N2 and 5 H1N1) and 10 clusters of seasonal H3N2 influenza were also identified. Among them, 38 pandemic H1N1 and two seasonal H3N2 influenza cases were air travellers, suggesting that air travel facilitates the spread of pandemic and seasonal influenza even in the northern hemisphere summer. In addition, it was found that pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 influenza viruses co-circulated in two clusters.

Physiological effects of various anesthetic agents have been studied at length. Very little is known about potential effects of anesthesia on brain structure. In this study we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging to compare the white matter microstructure of healthy control subjects under sevoflurane anesthesia with their awake state. Fractional Anisotropy, a white mater integrity index, transiently decreases throughout the brain during sevoflurane anesthesia and then returns back to baseline. Other DTI metrics such as mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were increased under sevoflurane anesthesia. Although DTI metrics are age dependent, the transient changes due to sevoflurane were independent of age and sex. Volumetric analysis shows various white matter volumes decreased whereas some gray matter volumes increased during sevoflurane anesthesia. These results suggest that sevoflurane anesthesia has a significant, but transient, effect on white matter microstructure. In spite of the transient effects of sevoflurane anesthesia there were no measurable effects on brain white matter as determined by the DTI metrics at 2 days and 7 days following anesthesia. The role of white matter in the loss of consciousness under anesthesia will need to be studied and MRI studies with subjects under anesthesia will need to take these results into account.","Tang, Cheuk Y; Wang, Victoria X; Lun, Min Yin; Mincer, Joshua S; Ng, Johnny C; Brallier, Jess W; Schwartz, Arthur E; Ahn, Helen; McCormick, Patrick J; Nir, Tommer; Delman, Bradley; Sano, Mary; Deiner, Stacie G; Baxter, Mark G",PloS one,153,4

The development of intrahepatic carcinoma is described in both conditions, but the reported incidence varies extensively. Potential risk factors for the malignant transformation were not described. Furthermore, conservative or surgical treatment is performed depending on the extent of cystic malformation, hepatic dysfunction and structural hepatic changes, but little is known about which treatment should be offered to patients with CD or CS and cancer. AIM To further investigate the malignant transformation in these conditions. METHODS A systematic review of the current literature until January 2019 was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A search using Medline (PubMed) was performed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms ""caroli disease"", ""caroli syndrome"", ""tumor"", ""malignant"", and ""cholangiocarcinoma"". Only human studies published in English were used for this systematic review. The following parameters were extracted from each article: year of publication, type of study, number of patients, incidence of malignant tumor, duration of symptoms, age, sex, diagnostics, identification of tumor, surgical therapy, survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS Twelve retrospective studies reporting the courses of 561 patients (53% females) were included in this systematic review. With a mean age of 41.6 years old (range 23 to 56 years old), patients were younger than other populations undergoing liver surgery. Depending on the size of the study population the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varied from 2.7% to 37.5% with an overall incidence of 6.6%. There were only few detailed reports about preoperative diagnostic work-up, but a multimodal work-up including ultrasound of the liver, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used in most studies. Disease duration was variable with up to several years. Most patients had episodes of cholangitis, sepsis, fever or abdominal pain. Tumor detection was an incidental finding of the surgical specimen in most cases because it is currently often impossible to detect tumor manifestation during preoperative diagnostics. Liver resection or liver transplantation was performed depending on the extent of the biliary pathology and additional alterations of the liver structure or function. No postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was reported, but chemotherapy was administered in selected cases of tumor recurrence. Overall survival rates after one year were low at 36% and a high recurrence rate of up to 75% during the observation period. CONCLUSION Only few retrospective studies reported a low tumor incidence. Despite the high rate of mortality and tumor recurrence, definite surgical treatment should be offered as soon as possible.","Fahrner, René; Dennler, Sandra Gc; Inderbitzin, Daniel",World journal of gastroenterology,153,31

Theoretically, asthmatic patients should have increased susceptibility and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a deficient antiviral immune response and the tendency for exacerbation elicited by common respiratory viruses. However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. Certain aspects of type 2 immune response, including type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, etc.) and accumulation of eosinophils, might provide potential protective effects against COVID-19. Furthermore, conventional therapeutics for asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, might also reduce the risks of asthmatics suffering infection of the virus through alleviating inflammation or enhancing antiviral defense.

Recent studies show that a shortening of the abstinence period could be beneficial mostly in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) patients. OBJECTIVE retrospective study to verify the efficacy of a second semen sample after a short abstinence to treat severe OAT infertile patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS 127 couples treated between May 2014 and May 2018 were divided into two groups. Study Group 1 (75 cycles): severe OAT characteristics: count < 0.2x106 /ml no progressive motility; count ≥ 0.2x106 /ml and no total or progressive motility; 0% normal morphology; a second semen sample was requested after abstinence of two hours. Control Group 0 (52 cycles): normozoospermic or mild OAT; only one sample was requested. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection was utilized in all cases. RESULTS all semen parameters were significantly different between Group 0 vs both samples of Group 1 (P<.001), excluding volume between Group 0 and 1st sample of Group 1 (P=.682). The comparison between 1st and 2nd samples from Group 1 showed significant differences in volume, total and progressive motility and morphology (P<.001, P<.001, P<.020) but not in total sperm count (P= .970). Fertilization, pregnancy rate/transfer, implantation and miscarriage rates were 85.9% and 61.1% (P< .001), 30.6% and 35.8% (P= .700), 17.5% and 24.0 (P= .292), 20.0% and 25.0% (P= .017) in Group 0 and Group 1 respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION the results show that a short abstinence in severe OAT patients allows us to obtain sperm with better motility. The request for a second semen sample in couples with extreme semen parameters is a valid and simple strategy that helps to achieve the same probability of pregnancy compared to a Control Group. Furthermore, it allows us to utilize fresh sperms avoiding the need to resort to cryopreserved reserves or testicular surgery.","Ciotti, Patrizia Maria; Calza, Nilla; Zuffa, Silvia; Notarangelo, Leonardo; Nardi, Elena; Damiano, Giuseppe; Cipriani, Linda; Porcu, Eleonora",Andrology,153,5

In this study, in vitro assays revealed antagonistic activity among these organisms, with B. gladioli demonstrating strong inhibition of B. glumae and B. plantarii. Strains of B. glumae and B. plantarii that express green fluorescent protein were constructed and used for cocultivation assays with B. gladioli, which confirmed the strong inhibitory activity of B. gladioli. Cell-free supernatants from each species were tested against cultures of counterpart species to evaluate the potential to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate the inhibitory activity of B. gladioli on B. glumae and B. plantarii in rice, rice plant assays were performed and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were developed for in planta bacterial quantification. The results indicated that coinoculation with B. gladioli leads to significantly reduced disease severity and colonization of rice tissues compared with single inoculation with B. glumae or B. plantarii. This study demonstrates the interactions among three rice-pathogenic Burkholderia species and strong antagonistic activity of B. gladioli in vitro and in planta.

New scales and tools have been developed to measure these mental health effects. This narrative review assesses the psychometric properties of these scales and tools and methodological aspects of their development. METHODS PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 15 May 2020 to 15 August 2020. This search used three groups of terms (""tool"" OR ""scale"" AND ""mental"" OR ""psychological""; AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus""). The identified scales were further evaluated for their psychometric properties and methodological aspects of their development. RESULTS Though the studies developing these scales (n = 12) have demonstrated their robust psychometric properties, some methodological concerns are noteworthy. Most of the scales were validated using internet-based surveys, and detailed descriptions of the mode of administration, sampling process, response rates, and augmentation strategies were missing. CONCLUSIONS The heterogeneous and inadequate reporting of methods adopted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the identified scales can limit their utility in clinical and research settings. We suggest developing guidelines and checklists to improve the design and testing, and result in reporting of online-administered scales to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ransing, Ramdas; Dashi, Elona; Rehman, Sajjadur; Mehta, Varun; Chepure, Ashish; Kilic, Ozge; Hayatudeen, Nafisatu; Orsolini, Laura; Vahdani, Bita; Adiukwu, Frances; Gonzalez-Diaz, Jairo M; Larnaout, Amine; Pinto da Costa, Mariana; Grandinetti, Paolo; Soler-Vidal, Joan; Bytyçi, Drita Gashi; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Nofal, Marwa; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Ramalho, Rodrigo",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,153,29

However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.","Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Hornik, Robert",Journal of health communication,153,7

Telemedicine refers to remote or non-face-to-face medical attention, a new method of administering medical care by accredited professionals, which optimises resources and increases their scope. One drawback for child teleneurology is that our diagnoses require direct observation of the child and carrying out an examination as though playing a game. Mainly in the youngest stages, a new patient evaluated by telemedicine can be more difficult to diagnose and manage, and therefore some neuropaediatricians have chosen to carry out only follow-up visits, medication management and outcome reviews. Telemedicine, however, also has many benefits, such as the possibility of giving rapid advice, coordination among professionals and reaching the patient where and when it is difficult for classical medicine to do so. The aim of this article is to review the possible indications of telemedicine in child neurology, starting out from the fact that we should never delay the diagnosis of something that can be treated, both at the present time and in an eventual situation of resurgence of the pandemic. The advance of telemedicine will depend on the implementation of technology, on solving legal and security/privacy issues, on its clinical outcomes and on the extent to which patients demand and accept these virtual visits.","García-Pérez, A",Revista de neurologia,153,24

Iodine deficiency in the regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia adjacent to nuclear power plants became a factor in increased uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland in children and after 5 years led to an epidemic of thyroid cancer. Optimal iodine intake could become a kind of vaccination, which sharply reduces the risk of developing thyroid cancer, as has happened after the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. Endemic goiter was eliminated 50 years ago, but returned to the country in the early 1990s after the collapse of iodized salt production and has not been eliminated to this day due to the lack of a legislative framework for mandatory salt iodization. The actual average consumption of iodine by residents of Russia is from 40 to 80 mcg per day, which is 23 times less than the recommended norm. Mild and moderate iodine deficiency was detected throughout the Russian Federation, and it is more typical for the the rural population. The iodine deficiency has the greatest negative effect on the psychomotor development of the child during the critical period the first 1000 days of life from the moment of conception to the end of the second year of life.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission chain is interrupted when screening and diagnosis can be performed on a large scale by identifying asymptomatic or moderately symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited due to inadequate access to complex, expensive equipment and reagents, which has impeded efforts to reduce the spread of virus transmission. Recently, the development of several diagnostic platforms based on the CRISPR-Cas system has reduced the dependence on RT-PCR. The first CRISPR-based diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The biosensing systems have several important features that make them suitable for point-of-care tests, including the speed of design and synthesis of each platform in less than a few days, an assay time of 1-2 h, and the cost of materials and reagents less than one dollar per test. The HUDSON-SHERLOCK and STOPCovid biosensing systems, as field-deployable and rapid diagnostic tests, can detect low-copy viruses in body fluids without nucleic acid extraction and with minimal equipment.

In the face of this threat, the Sustainable Developmental Goals that call on the global community to -leave no one behind‖ may become a blurred vision unless we adopt a wider lens away from the tunnel vision that currently plagues health systems around the globe. This paper therefore exposes how SRH may become collateral damage in the face of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Previous disease outbreaks diverted attention from critical SRH services, including antenatal care, safe abortions, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. Governments, policy makers, health system gatekeepers and civil society organisations should not allow the COVID-19 phobia to bar women and adolescent girls from accessing SRH services. In fact, the global and South African response to the COVID-19 pandemic must protect everyone's rights, particularly in the health care context. Gender considerations and a human rights approach must be embedded in ensuring the accessibility and availability of SRH services.","Govender, Desiree; Naidoo, Saloshni; Taylor, Myra",African journal of reproductive health,153,1

Not only is it difficult to identify and recruit these individuals, but their ability to participate in research projects can be limited by their medical condition. As such, sample sizes are small, and considerable time (e.g., 2 years) is required to complete a study. To address limitations inherent to laboratory-based neuropsychological research, we developed a protocol for online neuropsychological testing (PONT). We describe the implementation of PONT and provide the required information and materials for recruiting participants, conducting remote neurological evaluations, and testing patients in an automated, self-administered manner. The protocol can be easily tailored to target a broad range of patient groups, especially those who can be contacted via support groups or multisite collaborations. To highlight the operation of PONT and describe some of the unique challenges that arise in online neuropsychological research, we summarize our experience using PONT in a research program involving individuals with Parkinson's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. In a 10-month period, by contacting 646 support group coordinators, we were able to assemble a participant pool with over 100 patients in each group from across the United States. Moreover, we completed six experiments (n > 300) exploring their performance on a range of tasks examining motor and cognitive abilities. The efficiency of PONT in terms of data collection, combined with the convenience it offers the participants, promises a new approach that can increase the impact of neuropsychological research.","Saban, William; Ivry, Richard B",Journal of cognitive neuroscience,153,16

However, little is understood about how population adaptation changes across time, how sexual vs. asexual reproduction contribute to the spread of pathogens in wild populations and how diversity measured with neutral and selectively important markers correlates across years. Here, we report results from a long-term study of epidemiological and genetic dynamics within several natural populations of the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction. Using pathogen isolates collected from three populations of wild flax (L. marginale) spanning 16 annual epidemics, we probe links between pathogen population dynamics, phenotypic variation for infectivity and genomic polymorphism. Pathogen genotyping was performed using 1567 genome-wide SNP loci and sequence data from two infectivity loci (AvrP123, AvrP4). Pathogen isolates were phenotyped for infectivity using a differential set. Patterns of epidemic development were assessed by conducting surveys of infection prevalence in one population (Kiandra) annually. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed host population and ecotype as key predictors of pathogen genetic structure. Despite strong fluctuations in pathogen population size and severe annual bottlenecks, analysis of molecular variance revealed that pathogen population differentiation was relatively stable over time. Annually, varying levels of clonal spread (0-44.8%) contributed to epidemics. However, within populations, temporal genetic composition was dynamic with rapid turnover of pathogen genotypes, despite the dominance of only four infectivity phenotypes across the entire study period. Furthermore, in the presence of strong fluctuations in population size and migration, spatial selection may maintain pathogen populations that, despite being phenotypically stable, are genetically highly dynamic.","Susi, Hanna; Burdon, Jeremy J; Thrall, Peter H; Nemri, Adnane; Barrett, Luke G",PLoS pathogens,153,7

This study investigates bacterial contamination rate on surfaces of mechanical ventilator systems and bedside equipment. An experimental study evaluates the effectiveness of 75% alcohol in killing bacteria on surfaces. METHODS Surface swab sampling was conducted on ventilator systems and patient bedside equipment for detection of bacterial contamination. Surfaces of ventilator systems, such as faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps, were swab sampled at 0.5, 8, and 24 hours after initial disinfection using a solution containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and pasteurization. The 75% alcohol aerosol was sprayed on the surfaces of faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps on ventilator systems at 24 hours after initial disinfection, and then bacterial levels on the surfaces were evaluated. RESULTS Detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus were measured on the handrails of mechanical ventilators (64.7%), Y-pieces of breathing circuits (86.7%), and resuscitators (60.0%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified on the surfaces of Y-pieces (6.7%) and water traps (13.3%) of breathing circuits, and also on suction systems (6.7%) and resuscitators (13.3%). The positive rate for total bacterial count was clearly increased on the surfaces of faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps at 8 hour following disinfection by 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and pasteurization. Concentrations of S. aureus on surfaces decreased following treatment with 75% alcohol. However, considerable P. aeruginosa growth on water trap surfaces was observed after treatment with 75% alcohol. CONCLUSIONS The surfaces of ventilator systems, including faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps, must be disinfected frequently (at least every 8 h) to control bacterial growth. Disinfection using 75% alcohol spray with air drying effectively decreased S. aureus on ventilator system surfaces.","Sui, Yi-Shan; Wan, Gwo-Hwa; Chen, Ya-Wen; Ku, Hsiang-Lin; Li, Li-Pien; Liu, Chiu-Hsin; Mau, Huei-Shin",Respiratory care,153,22

SILS combines in part the cosmetic advantage and decrease parietal trauma of natural orifice surgery, but allow operative realization with standard and validated laparoscopic instruments. We report here the first clinical transumbilical SILS sigmoidectomy for benign disease. METHOD Preliminary experience with transumbilical single incision laparoscopic surgery (or embryonic natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery) sigmoidectomy in a female patient (34 years, BMI 22 kg/m(2)) with sigmoid stenosis caused by nodular endometriosis was reported. Transumbilical SILS treatment of pelvic endometriosis was performed during the same operation through cauterization. RESULTS Transumbilical single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was feasible with conventional laparoscopic instruments. The combined uses of straight and articulated laparoscopic instruments allow the avoidance of transparietal sling suture for exposition. Operative time for sigmoidectomy and endometriosis therapy was 125 min. No intra-operative or postoperative complications were recorded. SILS achieved excellent cosmetic results and may be associated with accelerated recovery. CONCLUSION Transumbilical single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy is feasible by experienced laparoscopic surgeons using conventional laparoscopic instruments and staplers. The combined uses of strait and articulated instruments allow transumbilical SILS sigmoidectomy without the need for additional incision or transparietal sling suture. SILS sigmoidectomy may have the clinical advantage over NOTES of offering the safety of laparoscopic colectomy and the avoidance of vaginal access.

This systematic review synthesizes the current evidence about the QoL of individuals with EB. METHODS We included observational studies with people of all age groups, both sexes, and any EB type. Studies with qualitative methodology, chapters of books, meeting proceedings, and abstracts were excluded. RESULTS In this study, 12 articles comprising 745 individuals were included. More than half of the articles observed lower QoL in individuals with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) or junctional EB (JEB). Three articles indicated that EB affected QoL more in women than in men, and one article identified that children with EB suffered more than adults with the disease. Pain was frequently reported. Seven articles identified difficulty in sports, two identified a need for bathing assistance, and three identified eating difficulties. Additionally, participants reported that family relationships and friendships were affected, and they experienced feelings of anxiety and depression. Some of the instruments used evaluated QoL in general dermatologic conditions, and one was specific to EB. CONCLUSION QoL is more affected in people who have RDEB and JEB. Regarding sex and age, women and children need special care in their monitoring. It is necessary that guidelines on pain management be more disseminated and put into practice. Future studies should use standardized specific instruments to assess the QoL in EB individuals, while considering the particularities of the different age groups.","Togo, C C G; Zidorio, A P C; Gonçalves, V S S; Hubbard, L; de Carvalho, K M B; Dutra, E S","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",153,16

IBD or Gumboro disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality of infected animals and is responsible for major economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. IBD is characterized by a massive loss of IgM-bearing B lymphocytes and the destruction of the bursa of Fabricius. The molecular bases of IBDV pathogenicity are still poorly understood; nonetheless, an exacerbated cytokine immune response and B cell depletion due to apoptosis are considered main factors that contribute to the severity of the disease. Here we have studied the role of type I interferon (IFN) in IBDV infection. While IFN pretreatment confers protection against subsequent IBDV infection, the addition of IFN to infected cell cultures early after infection drives massive apoptotic cell death. Downregulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), or nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) expression drastically reduces the extent of apoptosis, indicating that they are critical proteins in the apoptotic response induced by IBDV upon treatment with IFN-α. Our results indicate that IBDV genomic dsRNA is a major viral factor that contributes to the triggering of apoptosis. These findings provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms of IBDV-induced immunosuppression and pathogenesis in chickens.IMPORTANCE IBDV infection represents an important threat to the poultry industry worldwide. IBDV-infected chickens develop severe immunosuppression, which renders them highly susceptible to secondary infections and unresponsive to vaccination against other pathogens. The early dysregulation of the innate immune response led by IBDV infection and the exacerbated apoptosis of B cells have been proposed as the main factors that contribute to virus-induced immunopathogenesis. Our work contributes for the first time to elucidating a potential mechanism driving the apoptotic death of IBDV-infected cells upon exposure to type I IFN. We provide solid evidence about the critical importance of PKR, TNF-α, and NF-κB in this phenomenon. The described mechanism could facilitate the early clearance of infected cells, thereby aiding in the amelioration of IBDV-induced pathogenesis, but it could also contribute to B cell depletion and immunosuppression. The balance between these two opposing effects might be dramatically affected by the genetic backgrounds of both the host and the infecting virus strain.","Cubas-Gaona, Liliana L; Diaz-Beneitez, Elisabet; Ciscar, Marina; Rodríguez, José F; Rodríguez, Dolores",Journal of virology,153,19

OBJECT To report our single Institution experience with sacral DAVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients admitted from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2016 with a diagnosis of sacral DAVFs, treated by endovascular embolisation or surgical clipping. Clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, treatment results and follow-up were analysed. RESULTS We identify 13 patients with sacral DAVFs supplied by lateral sacral arteries. Clinical presentation was characterised by different degrees of motor weakness and sphincter disturbances. In all patients, spinal MRI showed spinal cord hyperintensities with enhancement and prominent perimedullary vessels. Selective internal iliac angiography was mandatory to identify the exact location of the fistula. A complete embolisation was achieved in eight patients performing a single endovascular embolisation and in three patients performing a single surgical disconnection: two patients required combined procedures. Follow-up imaging showed a complete resolution of the spinal cord hyperintensities in 81% of patients and a reduction of the intramedullary enhancement in 91%. Gait improvement was observed in 73% of patients, while remaining stable in 27%. Sphincter disturbances improved in 36% of patients and remained stable in 64%. CONCLUSION Awareness of sacral location of DAVFs is critical because standard spinal angiography will not identify sacral supplies, unless internal iliac arteries are properly examined. In our experience, the endovascular treatment show results comparable to surgery when the fistula point is correctly disconnected.","Gioppo, Andrea; Faragò, Giuseppe; Giannitto, Caterina; Caputi, Luigi; Saladino, Andrea; Acerbi, Francesco; Ciceri, Elisa",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,153,19

CASE REPORT A baby was born with a large skin defect due to huge lumbar myeloschisis and kyphosis, which was repaired 2 days after birth using Limberg's skin flap at the peak of kyphosis. Skin ischemia around the tip of the flap gradually enlarged and resulted in a large skin ulcer. We performed negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using a Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.®) therapy system for 4 weeks which shrank the ulcer remarkably. Subsequently, a pedicle skin flap without graft was performed to cover the rest of the ulcer, which adapted well without CSF leakage postoperatively. CONCLUSION A combination treatment of NPWT and skin plastic surgery was successfully performed for a very young infant with spina bifida. NPWT could be another useful option for the treatment of ulcer following spina bifida repair surgery, though surgeons should carefully confirm that there is no CSF leakage before and during the procedure.","Katano, Hiroyuki; Toriyama, Kazuhiro; Nishikawa, Yusuke; Ito, Koichi; Morita, Akimichi; Kamei, Yuzuru; Yamada, Kazuo",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,153,24

AIMS The current study was designed to determine the incidence and types of bacteria present in the synovial fluid of native knee joints from adult patients with diagnoses of septic arthritis and OA. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were enrolled between October 2010 and January 2013. Synovial fluid samples from the affected knee were collected and evaluated with both traditional microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction-electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (molecular diagnostics [MDx]) to prospectively characterize the microbial content. Patients were grouped by diagnosis into one of two cohorts, those with clinical suspicion of septic arthritis (n = 44) and those undergoing primary arthroplasty of the knee for OA (n = 21). In all cases where discrepant culture and MDx results were obtained, we performed species-specific 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a confirmatory test. RESULTS MDx testing identified bacteria in 50% of the suspected septic arthritis cases and 29% of the arthroplasty cases, whereas culture detected bacteria in only 16% of the former and 0% of the latter group. The overall difference in detection rates for culture and MDx was very highly significant, p-value = 2.384 × 10-7. All of the culture-positive cases were typed as Staphylococcus aureus. Two of the septic arthritis cases were polymicrobial as was one of the OA cases by MDx. FISH testing of the specimens with discordant results supported the MDx findings in 91% (19/21) of the cases, including one case where culture detected S. aureus and MDx detected Streptococcus agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS MDx were more sensitive than culture, as confirmed by FISH. FISH only identifies bacteria that are embedded or infiltrated within the tissue and is thus not susceptible to contamination. Not all suspected cases of septic arthritis contain bacteria, but a significant percent of patients with OA, and no signs of infection, have FISH-confirmed bacterial biofilms present in the knee.","Palmer, Michael P; Melton-Kreft, Rachael; Nistico, Laura; Hiller, N Louisa; Kim, Leon H J; Altman, Gregory T; Altman, Daniel T; Sotereanos, Nicholas G; Hu, Fen Z; De Meo, Patrick J; Ehrlich, Garth D",Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,153,33

Lung function trajectories are set in early life and childhood deficits may predispose to non-communicable respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in later years. Potential risk factors are common in many sub-Saharan African (sSA) countries; adverse antenatal environments cause in utero growth restriction and prematurity; HIV and respiratory infections, including TB are common; exposure to air pollution is widespread, including household air pollution from biomass fuel use, traffic-related pollution in rapidly expanding cities, and tobacco smoke exposure.

For promoting the optimization of infection prevention measures by identifying acts and situations with high risk of infection, we conducted a survey and analysis to understand the detailed process of infection spread in these cases. METHODS A structured interview was conducted for the special training participants on their health status, changes in symptoms, training methods, and behavior history in their private lives. Additionally, a patrol of the training facility was carried out to understand the training environment, and antibody tests were conducted on the close contacts for more accurately grasping the spread of infection, by identifying subclinical infected persons. RESULTS Within 10 days of COVID-19 onset in the first patient, 15 of the 19 original training participants developed symptoms, and 14 patients tested positive for RT-PCR. PCR tests were also performed on four patients who did not develop the disease - two were positive and negative, each. The two negatives turned positive on a later antibody test, suggesting that there was an asymptomatic infection. In addition, all five patients who participated in the training for only a day developed symptoms and tested positive for PCR in a few days. Of the 64 people who underwent testing for antibodies as close contacts, all but one who was living together with a patient were negative on antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS The onset of COVID-19 occurred after the start of practice-based training continuously; therefore, the practice-based training was thought to be the main cause of the transmission. We speculate that the main factors behind the rapid spread of infection are as follows: during practice-based training, increased ventilation made it difficult to wear a mask; repeated loud vocalizations at close range; and the training pair was not fixed. Physical training without shouting and desk work, however, did not possess the risk of COVID-19, and avoiding certain situations at high risk of respiratory infections may have significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If personnel become infected with SARS-CoV-2, emergency measures should be devised by identifying patients and close contacts and facilitating the investigation of their behavioral history. Furthermore, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of infection control measures is necessary by ascertaining potentially infected persons by performing PCR tests, antigen tests, antibody tests, etc. in combination.","Tsushita, Keitaro; Kobayashi, Syoko; Uno, Saori; Urano, Yuko; Ikedo, Mayumi",Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,153,19

Hormonal pathways play important roles in some cancers. This study investigated the association of CRC expression of neurotensin (NTS), NTS receptors 1 and 3 (NTSR1 and NTSR3) and clinical outcomes. Methods: A prospective cohort study which quantifies the protein expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in human CRCs using immunohistochemistry. Expression levels were then compared with clinico-pathological outcome including histological grade, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled with median follow-up of 44.0 months. There was significantly higher expression of NTS in cancer tissue in CRC with higher T stages (p < 0.01), N stages (p = 0.03), and AJCC clinical stages (p = 0.04). There was significantly higher expression of NTS, NTSR1 and NTSR3 in cancer tissue compared to surrounding normal epithelium (median H-score 163.5 vs 97.3, p < 0.01). There was significantly shorter DFS in individuals with CRC with high levels of NTS compared to lower levels of NTS (35.8 months 95% CI 28.7-42.8 months vs 46.4 months 95% CI 42.2-50.5 months, respectively, p = 0.02). Above median NTS expression in cancer tissue was a significant risk factor for disease recurrence (HR 4.10, 95% CI 1.14-14.7, p = 0.03). Discussion: The expression of NTS and its receptors has the potential to be utilised as a predictive and prognostic marker in colorectal cancer for postoperative selection for adjuvant therapy and identify individuals for novel therapies targeting the neurotensinergic pathways. Conclusions: High NTS expression appears to be associated with more advanced CRC and worse DFS.","Qiu, Shengyang; Nikolaou, Stella; Zhu, Jie; Jeffery, Peter; Goldin, Robert; Kinross, James; Alexander, James L; Rasheed, Shahnawaz; Tekkis, Paris; Kontovounisios, Christos",Biomolecules,153,1

Here, we compared the fusogenic capacities between homologous and heterologous pairs of NiV and HeV glycoproteins. Importantly, to accurately measure their fusogenic capacities, as these depend on glycoprotein cell surface expression (CSE) levels, we inserted identical extracellular tags to both fusion (FLAG tags) or both attachment (hemagglutinin [HA] tags) glycoproteins. Importantly, these tags were placed in extracellular sites where they did not affect glycoprotein expression or function. NiV and HeV glycoproteins induced comparable levels of homologous HEK293T cell-cell fusion. Surprisingly, however, while the heterologous NiV F/HeV G (NF/HG) combination yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype, the heterologous HeV F/NiV G (HF/NG) combination yielded a hyperfusogenic phenotype. Pseudotyped viral entry levels primarily corroborated the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein pairs analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed G and F chimeras that allowed us to map the overall regions in G and F that contributed to these hyperfusogenic or hypofusogenic phenotypes. Importantly, the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein combinations negatively correlated with the avidities of F-G interactions, supporting the F/G dissociation model of henipavirus-induced membrane fusion, even in the context of heterologous glycoprotein pairs.IMPORTANCE The NiV and HeV henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases. The formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) is a hallmark of henipaviral infections and is caused by fusion of cells coordinated by interactions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We found via various assays that viral entry and syncytium formation depend on the viral origin of the glycoproteins, with HeV F and NiV G promoting higher membrane fusion levels than their counterparts. This is important knowledge, since both viruses use the same bat vector species and potential coinfections of these or subsequent hosts may alter the outcome of disease.","Bradel-Tretheway, Birgit G; Zamora, J Lizbeth Reyes; Stone, Jacquelyn A; Liu, Qian; Li, Jenny; Aguilar, Hector C",Journal of virology,153,33

Leading cardiac societies recommend exercise as an integral part of cardiovascular rehabilitation because it reduces the morbidity and mortality of patients with CAD. Continuous low-intensity exercise using shortening muscle actions (concentric, CON) is a common training modality during cardiovascular rehabilitation. However, a growing clinical interest has been recently developed in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for stable patients with CAD. Exercise performed with lengthening muscle actions (eccentric, ECC) could be tolerated better by patients with CAD as they can be performed with higher loads and lower metabolic cost than CON exercise. OBJECTIVE We developed a clinical protocol on a soft robot to compare cardiovascular and muscle effects of repeated and work-matched CON versus ECC pedaling-type interval exercise between patients with CAD during cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study aims to ascertain whether the developed training protocols affect peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), peak aerobic power output (Ppeak), and parameters of muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) during exercise, and anaerobic muscle power. METHODS We will randomize 20-30 subjects to either the CON or ECC group. Both groups will perform a ramp test to exhaustion before and after the training period to measure cardiovascular parameters and SmO2. Moreover, the aerobic skeletal muscle power (Ppeak) is measured weekly during the 8-week training period using a simulated squat jump and a counter movement jump on the soft robot and used to adjust the training load. The pedaling-type interval exercise on the soft robot is performed involving either CON or ECC muscle actions. The soft robotic device being used is a closed kinetic chain, force-controlled interactive training, and testing device for the lower extremities, which consists of two independent pedals and free footplates that are operated by pneumatic artificial muscles. RESULTS The first patients with CAD, who completed the training, showed protocol-specific improvements, reflecting, in part, the lower aerobic training status of the patient completing the CON protocol. Rehabilitation under the CON protocol, more than under the ECC protocol, improved cardiovascular parameters, that is, VO2peak (+26% vs -6%), and Ppeak (+20% vs 0%), and exaggerated muscle deoxygenation during the ramp test (248% vs 49%). Conversely, markers of metabolic stress and recovery from the exhaustive ramp test improved more after the ECC than the CON protocol, that is, peak blood lactate (-9% vs +20%) and peak SmO2 (+7% vs -7%). Anaerobic muscle power only improved after the CON protocol (+18% vs -15%). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates the potential of the implemented CON and ECC protocols of pedaling-type interval exercise to improve oxygen metabolism of exercised muscle groups while maintaining or even increasing the Ppeak. The ECC training protocol seemingly provided a lower cardiovascular stimulus in patients with CAD while specifically enhancing the reoxygenation and blood lactate clearance in recruited muscle groups during recovery from exercise.

In this study, we elucidated the potential mechanisms of aerobic exercise in ameliorating kidney injury following myocardial infarction (MI). In vivo, wildtype and alcat1 knockout mice were used to establish the MI model, and subjected to six-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. In vitro, Normal Rat Kidney (NRK) cells treated with H2O2 and recombinant human Irisin (rhIrisin) were used for exploring potential mechanisms. Our results showed that Irisin expression was up-regulated by aerobic exercise in kidneys after MI, while ALCAT1 was reduced. In alcat1 knockout mice, we found that ALCAT1 involved in the progressions of oxidative stress and apoptosis in impaired kidney tissues of MI mice, but aerobic exercise reversed these changes. Furthermore, in vitro, we observed that Irisin inhibited both H2O2-treatment or overexpression of alcat1-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in NRK cells, partially via AMPK-Sirt1-PGC-1α pathway. These findings reveal that aerobic exercise participates in alleviating the levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis in impaired kidney tissues following MI, partially via activating FNDC5/Irisin-AMPK-Sirt1-PGC-1α signaling pathway and inhibiting ALCAT1 expression.","Wu, Fangnan; Li, Zhuo; Cai, Mengxin; Xi, Yue; Xu, Zujie; Zhang, Zezhou; Li, Hangzhuo; Zhu, Wanyu; Tian, Zhenjun",Free radical biology & medicine,153,1

Whether PCOS is more common in mental health conditions than in the general population is less clear. A systematic review investigating this question may provide clarity regarding whether increased prevalence of PCOS is seen in particular mental health disorders, and thus, whether screening female mental health patients for PCOS is warranted. AIMS To systematically synthesise and review research examining rates of PCOS in mental health disorders. METHODS Peer-reviewed articles assessing the prevalence of PCOS within a sample of reproductive-aged females with a diagnosis of Axis I or II mental health disorder were included. Key studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed and Web of Science. RESULTS Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, assessing rate of diagnosed PCOS in samples with bipolar disorder (n = 7), autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n = 2), bulimia nervosa (n = 1), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 1). Overall, there was limited evidence of elevated rates of PCOS in bipolar disorder, compared with population estimates or healthy control group rates. In ASD, bulimia nervosa, and PTSD samples, significantly increased rates of PCOS were reported compared with healthy control samples, although studies were relatively small. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights complexities and methodological considerations in this area of research. There are a limited number of studies assessing PCOS in mental health samples, and thus, important areas of future research have been identified.

When the outer surface of an FFR becomes contaminated, it presents a contact transmission risk to the wearer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) doff FFRs by grasping the straps at the back of the head to avoid contact with the potentially contaminated surface. Adherence to proper doffing technique is reportedly low due to numerous factors including difficulty in locating and grasping the straps. This study compares the impact of tabs placed on FFR straps to controls (without tabs) on proper doffing, ease of use and comfort, and reduction of transfer of contamination to the wearer. Utilizing a fluorescent agent as a tracer to track contamination from FFRs to hand and head areas of 20 human subjects demonstrated that there was no difference in tabbed FFR straps and controls with respect to promoting proper doffing (p = 0.48), but did make doffing easier (p = 0.04) as indicated by 7 of 8 subjects that used the tabs. Seven of the 20 subjects felt that FFRs with tabs were easier to remove, while only 2 of 20 indicated that FFRs without tabs were easier to remove. Discomfort was not a factor for either FFR strap type. When removing an FFR with contaminated hands, the use of the tabs significantly reduced the amount of tracer transfer compared to straps without tabs (p = 0.012). FFRs with tabs on the straps are associated with ease of doffing and significantly less transfer of the fluorescent tracer.","Strauch, Amanda L; Brady, Tyler M; Niezgoda, George; Almaguer, Claudia M; Shaffer, Ronald E; Fisher, Edward M",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,153,16

A recent study found that the rs2011404 variant of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl-transferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) is a marker of susceptibility to ATDH. The present study aimed to validate this relationship in an Eastern Chinese Han anti-TB treatment population. METHODS A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted among anti-TB treatment patients in four regions of Jiangsu. ATDH was diagnosed based on the criteria from the Chinese Society of Hepatology and the updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between rs2011404 genotypes and the risk of ATDH using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and smoking, drinking, hepatoprotectant use and liver diseases as covariates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 202 ATDH cases and 808 controls were matched according to age, sex and treatment history. After correcting for potential confounding factors, conditional logistic regression analysis indicated no significant differences in genotypes between the two groups (CC vs. TC: OR = 0.933, 95% CI: 0.457-1.905, p = 0.849). Subgroup analysis suggested that patients carrying the CC genotype at rs2011404 in UGT1A4 were at a reduced risk of moderate or severe liver injury (OR = 0.293, 95% CI: 0.093-0.921, p = 0.036). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Based on a 1:4 individual matched case-control study, possessing the CC genotype at rs2011404 of the UGT1A4 gene reduces the risk of moderate or severe liver injury in Eastern Chinese Han patients receiving anti-TB treatment. Further research is warranted to explain the role of the UGT1A4 gene and its contribution to individual differences in susceptibility to ATDH.","Zhu, Jia; Liu, Wenpei; Zhang, Meiling; Lu, Lihuan; Pan, Hongqiu; He, Xiaomin; Wang, Nannan; Yang, Miaomiao; Yi, Honggang; Tang, Shaowen",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,153,14

This procedure has not been reported using the laparoscopic or robotic approach. Although this technique, in low-volume centres, could lead to an increased risk of morbidity, in high-volume centres morbidity and mortality are similar to those of the standard D2 lymphadenectomy. Robotic surgery could overcome the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, especially in the removal of posterior nodal stations. In this report we describe the feasibility of fully robotic interaortocaval lymphadenectomy, following similar steps to those of the traditional open approach. METHODS The procedure was a total gastrectomy with oesophago-jejunal Roux-en-Y reconstruction in a 73 year-old male patient with clinically advanced (cT3) gastric adenocarcinoma, located in the lesser curvature (middle-upper third). The da Vinci® Si HD with a double-docking robot set-up was employed. RESULTS The histological specimen examination showed a pT4aN3bM0, Borrmann type III, intestinal histotype, G3 gastric adenocarcinoma. No involvement of resection margins was found (R0 resection). The numbers of total harvested and positive nodes were 57 and 41, respectively; the number of harvested interaortocaval nodes was 14, and all of them were negative for tumour involvement. Operative time for lymphadenectomy was comparable with that of the traditional open approach. The postoperative period was uneventful and hospital stay was 11 days. CONCLUSIONS Robotic-assisted interaortocaval lymphadenectomy is a feasible technique in high-volume centres for gastric cancer surgery, and should be considered in curative surgery for selected advanced cases, especially for the high-risk group of lymph node metastases in the posterior area.","Roviello, Franco; Piagnerelli, Riccardo; Ferrara, Francesco; Caputo, Edda; Scheiterle, Maximilian; Marrelli, Daniele",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,153,1

Objectives: We conducted a phone survey among 123 OPWH with substance use disorders (SUD) in Kyiv in May 2020 to learn if these older adults may continue HIV and SUD therapy while coping with the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: Data from the survey demonstrated that while OPWH with SUD maintained HIV and SUD therapy throughout Covid-19 lockdown, social support is critical to avoiding treatment interruption for OPWH with SUD. Conclusions/Importance: During reopening, reduction of support may lead to OPWH feeling even more isolated.

This means a consolidation of these kinds of drugs in the pharmaceutical arena, paving the way in the coming years for the approval of others for diverse medical indications. Here the TIDES approved in 2019 are analyzed in terms of chemical structure, medical target, mode of action, and adverse effects.","Al Shaer, Danah; Al Musaimi, Othman; Albericio, Fernando; de la Torre, Beatriz G",Pharmaceuticals,153,1

We report the effects of experience and innovation on outcomes in minimally invasive esophagectomy. METHODS Esophageal resections for cancer from 2007 to 2016 at Levine Cancer Institute at Carolinas Medical Center (Charlotte, NC) were reviewed. During this time, three changes in technique were made to improve outcomes: vascular evaluation of the gastric conduit to improve anastomotic healing (beginning at case #63), one-stage approach to permit access to abdomen and chest through one draped surgical field (case #82), and adoption of a lung-protective anesthetic protocol (case #101). Mortality, operative time, complications, and length of stay were analyzed relative to these interventions using GLM regression. RESULTS 200 patients underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy. There were no mortalities at 30 days, and no change in mortality rate at 60 and 90 days. Anastomotic leak decreased significantly after the introduction of intraoperative vascular evaluation of the gastric conduit (3.6 vs 19.4%). Operative time decreased with adoption of a one-stage approach (416 vs 536 min). Pulmonary complications decreased coincident with a change in anesthetic technique (pneumonia 6 vs 28%). Lymph node harvest increased over time. Length of stay was driven primarily by complications and decreased with operative experience. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative complications, operative time, and length of stay decreased with case experience and alterations in surgical and anesthetic technique. We believe that adoption of the techniques and technology described herein can reduce complications, reduce hospital stay, and improve patient outcomes.","Lorimer, Patrick D; Motz, Benjamin M; Boselli, Danielle M; Reames, Mark K; Hill, Joshua S; Salo, Jonathan C",Annals of surgical oncology,153,1

Adding a defibrillation coil in the coronary sinus (CS) or its branches can result in substantial reductions in the mean DFT. However, data regarding acute success and long-term stability remain lacking. We report our experience with this bailout strategy. Methods Patients with elevated DFT at implantation (safety margin at implantation <10 J) and those with failed ICD shocks for ventricular arrhythmias (VA) referred for high DFT underwent placement of an additional defibrillation coil in the CS. DFT testing was performed at the completion of the implantation procedure. External potentially reversible factors were excluded. High-output devices were systematically used. Results Four patients with high DFT at implantation and two with several failed shock attempts underwent placement of a defibrillation coil in the CS. Mean age was 41.8 (23-78). They presented a mean LVEF of 21% (15-30), QRS-complex duration of 109.8 milliseconds (87-168), body surface area of 1.96 m2 (1.45-2.58), and a mean R wave of 16.3 mV (8-27). Defibrillation coil implantation in the CS (final shocking configuration of right ventricle as anode and left ventricle (LV) plus can as cathode) was associated with successful DFT testing in all. Three patients had a concomitant LV lead for biventricular pacing. During a mean follow-up of 54.67 months (10-118), two patients experienced successful ICD shocks for VA (one of them also presented inappropriate shocks because of the fast conducting atrial fibrillation). Conclusions Positioning of a defibrillation coil in the CS can result in a substantial reduction in mean DFT and associates with optimal long-term stability.","Rodríguez-Mañero, Moisés; Kreidieh, Bahij; Ibarra-Cortez, Sergio H; Álvarez, Paulino; Schurmann, Paul; Dave, Amish S; Valderrábano, Miguel",Journal of arrhythmia,153,1

A decade ago, the idea of offering patients ready access to their clinical notes was a fringe idea. Today, information transparency in health care is a pressing legislative and regulatory issue in the United States and elsewhere. The 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 requires that clinicians and health care organizations give patients electronic access to the information in their electronic medical records. Rules to enact this legislative priority by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services substantially expanded the types of information that must be easily accessible to patients and exchanged among clinicians in electronic form. A growing body of research supports the notion that sharing transparent medical records, including clinical notes with patients, can help to strengthen communication, trust in clinicians, and patient engagement. Patients receiving dialysis may receive particular benefits from this greater transparency due to their increased risk for fragmented care. In the paper, we review the decade of research focused on the effects of sharing clinical notes with patients and the implications for improved engagement and care.","DesRoches, Catherine M",Seminars in dialysis,153,0

For coronaviruses, it was long speculated that replication of the giant RNA genome and transcription of multiple subgenomic mRNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism may require host cofactors. To search for such cellular proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out by using the nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a bait protein, leading to the identification of DDX1, a cellular RNA helicase in the DExD/H helicase family, as a potential interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays with cells coexpressing the two proteins and with IBV-infected cells. Furthermore, the endogenous DDX1 protein was found to be relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in IBV-infected cells. In addition to its interaction with IBV nsp14, DDX1 could also interact with the nsp14 protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting that interaction with DDX1 may be a general feature of coronavirus nsp14. The interacting domains were mapped to the C-terminal region of DDX1 containing motifs V and VI and to the N-terminal portion of nsp14. Manipulation of DDX1 expression, either by small interfering RNA-induced knockdown or by overexpression of a mutant DDX1 protein, confirmed that this interaction may enhance IBV replication. This study reveals that DDX1 contributes to efficient coronavirus replication in cell culture.","Xu, Linghui; Khadijah, Siti; Fang, Shouguo; Wang, Li; Tay, Felicia P L; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,153,10

This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS We conducted an age-matched case-control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age ≥ 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2-64.5] yr). The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0-359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9-29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.6).

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the ocular coil. The pharmacokinetics of the ketorolac-loaded ocular coil versus eye drops were tested in New Zealand White rabbits by repetitive sampling for 28 days. Efficacy of the ocular coil was also tested in New Zealand White rabbits. Ocular inflammation was induced where after the ocular coil was inserted, or eye drops, or no treatment was provided. The total protein concentration and cytokine levels were measured in tears, aqueous humor, and plasma at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, and 28 d. Four h after inserting the ocular coil in the eye, ketorolac levels in aqueous humor and plasma were higher in the ocular coil group than in the eye drop group. Ketorolac released from the ocular coil could be detected up to 28 d in tears, up to 4 d in aqueous humor and up to 24 h in plasma. After inducing inflammation, both the ocular coil and eye drops were able to suppress prostaglandin E2, TNFα and IL-6 levels in aqueous humor and plasma as compared to the group that received no treatment. To conclude, the ocular coil facilitated a sustained release of the drug and showed similar therapeutic benefit in suppressing post-operative inflammation as eye drops.","Bertens, Christian J F; Gijs, Marlies; Dias, Aylvin A J; van den Biggelaar, Frank J H M; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; Sethu, Swaminathan; Nuijts, Rudy M M A",Drug delivery,153,13

Here, we will discuss whether there is a correlation between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces and diarrhoea, the relevance of gastrointestinal symptoms in disease diagnosis and transmission, and how COVID-19 can impact the gut microbial balance. RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been reported in faeces or rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients with and without diarrhoea, suggesting faecal shedding can occur independently of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the presence of the virus in the intestine can persist beyond its presence in the respiratory tract, with some reports suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 in the faeces can be infectious.COVID-19 can impact the gut microbiota causing an enhancement of biosynthesis pathways that favour the expansion of bacterial pathogens in the inflamed gut, and causing a decline in commensals involved in the human immune response. SUMMARY Gastrointestinal symptoms may be the first indication of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 in faeces can potentiate routes of disease transmission, particularly as the high viral loads reported in patients with severe illness suggest virus replication in the intestine may be possible.","Moura, Ines B; Buckley, Anthony M; Wilcox, Mark H",Current opinion in gastroenterology,153,31

Recently, we showed that DDX3X specifically recognizes the HCV 3' untranslated region (UTR), leading to the activation of IKK-α and a cascade of lipogenic signaling to facilitate lipid droplet biogenesis and viral assembly (Q. Li, V. Pene, S. Krishnamurthy, H. Cha, and T. J. Liang, Nat Med 19:722-729, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3190). The interaction of DDX3X with HCV core protein seems to be dispensable for its proviral role. In this study, through systematic imaging and biochemical and virologic approaches, we identified a dynamic association between DDX3X and various cellular compartments and viral elements mediating multiple functions of DDX3X in productive HCV infection. Upon HCV infection, the HCV 3'UTR interacts with DDX3X and IKK-α, which redistribute to speckle-like cytoplasmic structures shown to be stress granules (SGs). As viral proteins accumulate in infected cells, DDX3X granules together with SG-associated proteins redistribute and colocalize with HCV core protein around lipid droplets (LDs). IKK-α, however, does not relocate to the LD but translocates to the nucleus. In HCV-infected cells, various HCV nonstructural proteins also interact or colocalize with DDX3X in close proximity to SGs and LDs, consistent with the tight juxtaposition of the replication complex and the assembly site at the surface of LDs. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of DDX3X and multiple SG components markedly inhibits HCV infection. Our data suggest that DDX3X initiates a multifaceted cellular program involving dynamic associations with HCV RNA and proteins, IKK-α, SG, and LD surfaces for its crucial role in the HCV life cycle. IMPORTANCE DDX3X is a proviral host factor for HCV infection. Recently, we showed that DDX3X binds to the HCV 3'UTR, activating IKK-α and cellular lipogenesis to facilitate viral assembly (Q. Li et al., Nat Med 19:722-729, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3190). Here, we report associations of DDX3X with various cellular compartments and viral elements that mediate its multiple functions in the HCV life cycle. Upon infection, the HCV 3'UTR redistributes DDX3X and IKK-α to speckle-like cytoplasmic structures shown to be SGs. Subsequently, interactions between DDX3X, SG, and HCV proteins facilitate the translocation of DDX3X-SG complexes to the LD surface. HCV nonstructural proteins are shown to colocalize with DDX3X in close proximity to SGs and LDs, consistent with the tight juxtaposition of the HCV replication complex and assembly site at the LD surface. Our data demonstrate that DDX3X initiates a multifaceted cellular program involving dynamic associations with HCV elements, IKK-α, SGs, and LDs for its critical role in HCV infection.","Pène, Véronique; Li, Qisheng; Sodroski, Catherine; Hsu, Ching-Sheng; Liang, T Jake",Journal of virology,153,17

The spectroscopic properties of the chromophores carrying the triplet state have been interpreted on the basis of a delved analysis of the recently solved crystallographic structures of FCP. The results point toward a photoprotective role for two fucoxanthin molecules exposed to the exterior of the FCP monomers. This shows that FCP has adopted a structural strategy different from that of related light-harvesting complexes from plants and other microalgae, in which the photoprotective role is carried out by two highly conserved carotenoids in the interior of the complex.","Agostini, Alessandro; Büchel, Claudia; Di Valentin, Marilena; Carbonera, Donatella",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

For example, the win ratio can combine the time to death with the number of occurrences of a non-fatal outcome such as CV-related hospitalizations (CVHs) in a single hierarchical composite endpoint. The win ratio can provide greater statistical power to detect and quantify a treatment difference by using all available information contained in the component outcomes.

The foxglove aphid (FA: Aulacorthum solani Kaltenbach) is an important insect pest that causes serious yield losses in soybean. The FA resistance gene Raso2 from wild soybean PI 366121 was previously mapped to a 13 cM interval on soybean chromosome 7. However, fine-mapping of Raso2 was needed to improve the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection (MAS) and to eventually clone it. The objectives of this study were to fine-map Raso2 from PI 366121 using Axiom® 180 K SoyaSNP array, to confirm the resistance and inheritance of Raso2 in a different background, and to identify candidate gene(s). The 105 F4:8 recombinant inbred lines were used to fine-map the gene and to test antibiosis and antixenosis of Raso2 to FA. These efforts resulted in the mapping of Raso2 on 1 cM interval which corresponds to 77 Kb containing eight annotated genes based on the Williams 82 reference genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1). Interestingly, all nonsynonymous substitutions were in Glyma.07g077700 which encodes the disease resistance protein containing LRR domain and expression of the gene in PI 366121 was significantly higher than that in Williams 82. In addition, distinct SNPs within Glyma.07g077700 that can distinguish PI 366121 and diverse FA-susceptible soybeans were identified. We also confirmed that Raso2 presented the resistance to FA and the Mendelian inheritance for single dominant gene in a different background. The results of this study would provide fundamental information on MAS for development of FA-resistant cultivars as well as functional study and cloning of the candidate gene in soybean.","Kim, Ki-Seung; Kim, Ji-Min; Jung, Jiyeong; Shin, Ilseob; Park, Sumin; Lee, Ju Seok; Jeong, Soon-Chun; Lee, Jeong-Dong; Jung, Jin Kyo; Ha, Bo-Keun; Kang, Sungtaeg",TAG.

Recently, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were recognized to drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a common principle for organizing cellular membraneless organelles (MLOs). ATP, the universal energy currency for all living cells, mysteriously has concentrations of 2-12 mM, much higher than required for its previously-known functions. Only recently, ATP was decoded to behave as a biological hydrotrope to inhibit protein LLPS and aggregation at mM. We further revealed that ATP also acts as a bivalent binder, which not only biphasically modulates LLPS driven by IDRs of human and viral proteins, but also bind to the conserved nucleic-acid-binding surfaces of the folded proteins. Most unexpectedly, ATP appears to act as a hydration mediator to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization as well as to enhance folding of proteins without significant binding. Here, this review focuses on summarizing the results of these biophysical studies and discussing their implications in an evolutionary context. By linking triphosphate with unique hydration property to adenosine, ATP appears to couple the ability for establishing hydrophobic, π-π, π-cation and electrostatic interactions to the capacity in mediating hydration of proteins, which is at the heart of folding, dynamics, stability, phase separation and aggregation. Consequently, ATP acquired a category of functions at ~mM to energy-independently control protein homeostasis with diverse mechanisms, thus implying a link between cellular ATP concentrations and protein-aggregation diseases.

In a controlled lab environment, physicians are paid by capitation and allocate limited resources to several patients. This implies a trade-off between physicians' profits and patients' health benefits. We vary levels of resource scarcity and patient characteristics systematically and observe that most subjects in the role of physician devote a relatively stable share of budget to patient treatment, implying that they provide fewer services when they face more severe budget constraints.

Objective To assess the health care activities in the ""peak"" of the pandemic during 3 months. Materials and Methods we collected data from the electronic health record. Results There were a total of 293 medical appointments from 131 patients (221 face-to-face), that decreased by 16.7% compared to the same period in 2019 (352 appointments). The medical appointments were scheduled to evaluate the continuity of systemic treatment or modifications (95 patients; 72.5%), follow-up (17; 12.9%), first-time consultation (12; 9.1%), and assess paraclinical studies (7; 5.3%). The patients were on hormone therapy (81 patients; 74%), chemotherapy (CT) (21; 19%), and anti-HER2 therapies (9; 8%). New twenty treatments were initiated. Of the 14 patients that were on adjuvant/neoadjuvant CT, 9 (64.3%) continued with the same regimen with the addition of prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), and 5 (35.7%), who were receiving weekly paclitaxel, continued the treatment with no changes. Of the seven patients that were on palliative CT, 2 (28.5%) continued the treatment with the addition of G-CSF, 3 (42.8%) continued with weekly capecitabine or paclitaxel with no treatment changes, and 2 (28.5%) changed their treatment regimen (a less myelosuppressive regimen was selected for one and due to progression of the disease in the other patient). The ninety patients who were receiving adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative criteria hormone therapy and/or anti-HER2 therapies, continued the treatment with no changes. Conclusions The evidence suggests that, although medical appointments decreased by approximately 17%, we could maintain healthcare activities, continued most of the treatments while the most modified was CT with G-CSF to avoid myelosuppression.","Castillo, Cecilia; Camejo, Natalia; Amarillo, Dahiana; Rodriguez, Florencia; Vitureira, Florencia; Krygier, Gabriel; Delgado, Lucía",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,153,1

In this study, we report a novel library of aminoglycoside-derived lipopolymers nanoparticles (LPNs) for the simultaneous delivery of different molecular cargoes including nucleic acids and small-molecules. The LPN library was screened for transgene expression efficacy following delivery of plasmid DNA, and lead LPNs that showed high transgene expression efficacies were characterized using hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. LPNs demonstrated significantly higher efficacies for transgene expression than 25 kDa polyethyleneamine (PEI) and lipofectamine, including in presence of serum. Self-assembly of these cationic lipopolymers into nanoparticles also facilitated the delivery of small molecule drugs (e.g. doxorubicin) to cancer cells. LPNs were also employed for the simultaneous delivery of the small-molecule histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor AR-42 together with plasmid DNA to cancer cells as a combination treatment approach for enhancing transgene expression. Taken together, our results indicate that aminoglycoside-derived LPNs are attractive vehicles for simultaneous delivery of imaging agents or chemotherapeutic drugs together with nucleic acids for different applications in medicine and biotechnology.","Godeshala, Sudhakar; Miryala, Bhavani; Dutta, Subhadeep; Christensen, Matthew D; Nandi, Purbasha; Chiu, Po-Lin; Rege, Kaushal",Journal of materials chemistry.

Laparoscopic DP, with its division at the pancreatic neck (subtotal pancreatectomy [STP]), is more challenging because there are major vascular structures, such as the celiac axis, coronary vein, and superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein-portal vein (SMV-SV-PV) confluence around the pancreatic neck portion to be dissected. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ten patients underwent laparoscopic STP with pancreatic division at the level of SMV-SV-PV confluence for benign and borderline pancreatic disease. RESULTS Three patients were male and 7 were female, with a median age of 60 years (range, 28-73). All patients had benign or borderline malignant tumors in the body near the neck of the pancreas, with a median tumor size of 3 cm (range, 1-9.2). The operation time was a median of 287.5 minutes (range, 160-480). The intraopeative bleeding was a median of 300 mL (range, 100-700). Spleen preservation was carried out in 8 patients. Compared with open DP with the division of the pancreatic neck, a more frequent rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.004), longer operation time (P = 0.006), and early postoperative recovery presented by early intake of a soft diet (P = 0.001) and earlier discharge (P = 0.03) were significantly more frequent in the laparoscopic STP group. In a comparative study with laparoscopic DP, the longer segment of resected pancreas (P < 0.001), smaller amount of blood loss (P = 0.019), and high rate of spleen preservation (P = 0.019) were also noted in the laparoscopic STP group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic DP with division of the pancreatic neck is considered feasible and safe.","Kang, Chang Moo; Choi, Sung Hoon; Hwang, Ho Kyoung; Kim, Dong Hyun; Yoon, Chang Ik; Lee, Woo Jung",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In the last 15 years, we have witnessed the emergence of two zoonotic, highly pathogenic HCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Replication of HCoV is regulated by a diversity of host factors and induces drastic alterations in cellular structure and physiology. Activation of critical signaling pathways during HCoV infection modulates the induction of antiviral immune response and contributes to the pathogenesis of HCoV. Recent studies have begun to reveal some fundamental aspects of the intricate HCoV-host interaction in mechanistic detail. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of host factors co-opted and signaling pathways activated during HCoV infection, with an emphasis on HCoV-infection-induced stress response, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immunity. The cross talk among these pathways, as well as the modulatory strategies utilized by HCoV are also discussed.

Twenty-four-hour ILV on noncontrast computed tomography has greater availability and potentially allows earlier estimation of functional outcome. We aimed to assess lesion growth 24 hours after stroke onset and compare the associations of 24-hour and 1-week ILV with functional outcome. METHODS We included 228 patients from MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), who received noncontrast computed tomography at 24-hour and 1-week follow-up on which ILV was measured. Relative and absolute lesion growth was determined. Logistic regression models were constructed either including the 24-hour or including the 1-week ILV. Ordinal and dichotomous (0-2 and 3-6) modified Rankin scale scores were, respectively, used as primary and secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Median ILV was 42 mL (interquartile range, 21-95 mL) and 64 mL (interquartile range: 30-120 mL) at 24 hours and 1 week, respectively. Relative lesion growth exceeding 30% occurred in 121 patients (53%) and absolute lesion growth exceeding 20 mL occurred in 83 patients (36%). Both the 24-hour and 1-week ILVs were similarly significantly associated with functional outcome (both P<0.001). In the logistic analyses, the areas under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristic curves were similar: 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.90) and 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.91) for including the 24-hour and 1-week ILV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Growth of ILV is common 24-hour poststroke onset. Nevertheless, the 24-hour ILV proved to be a valuable secondary outcome measure as it is equally strongly associated with functional outcome as the 1-week ILV.

Internalized EGF-receptor is either recycled or degraded, which fate is regulated in part by Ras interference 1 (RIN1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIN1, a Ras effector protein and Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, controls several signaling molecules leading to the modulation of the telomerase activity; thus, allowing proper cell proliferation. We report that expression of RIN1 completely blocked proliferation of MCF-12 A and MCF-7 cells, while partially inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the C-terminal region of RIN1 selectively plays a critical role in the inhibition of the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, this inhibitory effect was specifically affected by the independent expression of RIN1:Vsp9 and RIN1:RA domains. Additionally, endogenous level of expression of RIN1 was decreased in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with non-tumorigenic MCF-12 A cells. We observed that expression of RIN1:R94A mutant blocked the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, while expression of RIN1:Y561F and RIN1:R629A mutants completely reversed the inhibitory effect of RIN1:WT. Consistent with our observations, we found that expression of RIN1:WT in MDA-MB-231 cells diminished both protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activities while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were unaffected, but it produced downregulation of cellular-myelocytomatosis (c-Myc), erythroblast transformation specific (Ets2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activities. Inversely, expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) was inhibited whereas expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) was increased in cells expressing RIN1. Interestingly, expression of RIN1 blocked telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression, which correlated with the downregulations of c-Myc, Ets-2 and Stat3 activation. Taken together these findings indicate that RIN1 is a critical player in the modulation of the telomerase activity as well as hTERT expression in MDA-MB-231 cells upon EGF stimulation.","Zhang, W; Veisaga, M L; Barbieri, M A",Experimental cell research,153,1

This study investigated possible sex differences in central and peripheral fatigue in the knee extensors and plantar flexors resulting from a 110-km ultra-trail-running race. METHODS Neuromuscular function of the knee extensors and plantar flexors was evaluated via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical nerve stimulation before and after an ultra-trail-running race in 20 experienced ultraendurance trail runners (10 females and 10 males matched by percent of the winning time by sex) during maximal and submaximal voluntary contractions and in relaxed muscle. RESULTS Maximal voluntary knee extensor torque decreased more in males than in females (-38% vs -29%, P = 0.006) although the reduction in plantar flexor torque was similar between sexes (-26% vs -31%). Evoked mechanical plantar flexor responses decreased more in males than in females (-23% vs -8% for potentiated twitch amplitude, P = 0.010), indicating greater plantar flexor peripheral fatigue in males. Maximal voluntary activation assessed by TMS and electrical nerve stimulation decreased similarly in both sexes for both muscle groups. Indices of knee extensor peripheral fatigue and corticospinal excitability and inhibition changes were also similar for both sexes. CONCLUSIONS Females exhibited less peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors than males did after a 110-km ultra-trail-running race and males demonstrated a greater decrease in maximal force loss in the knee extensors. There were no differences in the magnitude of central fatigue for either muscle group or TMS-induced outcomes. The lower level of fatigue in the knee extensors and peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors could partly explain the reports of better performance in females in extreme duration running races as race distance increases.","Temesi, John; Arnal, Pierrick J; Rupp, Thomas; Féasson, Léonard; Cartier, Régine; Gergelé, Laurent; Verges, Samuel; Martin, Vincent; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,153,19

Reviews were included if they assessed the safety of TCS in atopic eczema and searched >1 database using a reproducible search strategy. Review quality was assessed using version 2 of 'A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews' (AMSTAR 2 tool). RESULTS 38 systematic reviews included, 34 low/critically low quality. Treatment and follow-up were usually short (2-4 weeks). KEY FINDINGS TCS versus emollient/vehicle: No meta-analyses identified for skin-thinning. Two 2-week randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found no significant increased risk with very potent TCS (0/196 TCS vs 0/33 vehicle in children and 6/109 TCS vs 2/50 vehicle, age unknown). Biochemical adrenal suppression (cortisol) was 3.8% (95% CI 2.4% to 5.8%) in a meta-analysis of 11 uncontrolled observational studies (any potency TCS, 522 children). Effects reversed when treatment ceased.TCS versus topical calcineurin inhibitors: Meta-analysis showed higher relative risk of skin thinning with TCS (4.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 22.28, n=4128, four RCTs, including one 5-year RCT). Eight cases in 2068 participants, 7 using potent TCS. No evidence of growth suppression.Once daily versus more frequent TCS: No meta-analyses identified. No skin-thinning in one RCT (3 weeks potent TCS, n=94) or biochemical adrenal suppression in two RCTs (up to 2 weeks very potent/moderate TCS, n=129).TCS twice/week to prevent flares ('weekend therapy') versus vehicle: No meta-analyses identified. No evidence of skin thinning in five RCTs. One RCT found biochemical adrenal suppression (2/44 children, potent TCS).

There is a paucity of evidence guiding surgeons to an optimal method for measuring intraoperative LLD and minimizing postoperative LLD. The primary objective of this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to determine which of 3 intraoperative methods used at the authors' institution was best correlated to postoperative radiographic LLD. From 2011 to 2012, 81 patients undergoing either primary (75) or revision (6) THA with an anterolateral (Watson-Jones) approach were prospectively randomized and received intraoperative measurement of LLD via 1 of 3 methods: abductor shuck (AS), tranosseous pins with calibrated caliper (TP), or patella electrocardiogram (EKG) leads (PL). Intraoperative measurements of LLD were compared to clinical and radiographic postoperative measurements of LLD, and absolute differences and correlation coefficients were calculated for each method. Overall, the mean LLD preoperatively was 8.09 mm, and mean radiographic LLD postoperatively was 4.20 mm. The AS method was associated with the highest correlation to postoperative radiographic LLD (R=0.360; P<.05), whereas the other methods had mildly positive but statistically insignificant correlations (TP R=0.275; P>.05; PL R=0.301; P>.05). The AS method best correlates to postoperative radiographic LLD among the 3 techniques, although all methods were positively correlated.

Complications associated with laparoscopy are often related to entry. Life-threatening complications include injury to the bowel, bladder, major abdominal vessels, and an anterior abdominal-wall vessel. Other less serious complications can also occur, such as post-operative infection, subcutaneous emphysema and extraperitoneal insufflation. There is no clear consensus as to the optimal method of entry into the peritoneal cavity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the benefits and risks of different laparoscopic techniques in gynaecological and non-gynaecological surgery. SEARCH METHODS This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. In addition, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PsycINFO were searched through to February 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials were included when one laparoscopic entry technique was compared with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted independently by the first three authors. Differences of opinion were registered and resolved by the fourth author. Results for each study were expressed as odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS The review included 28 randomised controlled trials with 4860 individuals undergoing laparoscopy and evaluated 14 comparisons. Overall there was no evidence of advantage using any single technique in terms of preventing major vascular or visceral complications. Using an open-entry technique compared to a Veress Needle demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of failed entry, Peto OR 0.12 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.92). There were three advantages with direct-trocar entry when compared with Veress Needle entry, in terms of lower rates of failed entry (Peto OR 0.21, 95% Cl 0.14 to 0.31), extraperitoneal insufflation (Peto OR 0.18, 95% Cl 0.13 to 0.26), and omental injury (Peto OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.55).There was also an advantage with radially expanding access system (STEP) trocar entry when compared with standard trocar entry, in terms of trocar site bleeding (Peto OR 0.31, 95% Cl 0.15 to 0.62). Finally, there was an advantage of not lifting the abdominal wall before Veress Needle insertion when compared to lifting in terms of failed entry, without an increase in the complication rate (Peto OR 4.44, 95% CI 2.16 to 9.13). However, studies were limited to small numbers, excluding many patients with previous abdominal surgery and women with a raised body mass index who may have unusually high complication rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS An open-entry technique is associated with a significant reduction in failed entry when compared to a closed-entry technique, with no difference in the incidence of visceral or vascular injury.Significant benefits were noted with the use of a direct-entry technique when compared to the Veress Needle. The use of the Veress Needle was associated with an increased incidence of failed entry, extraperitoneal insufflation and omental injury; direct-trocar entry is therefore a safer closed-entry technique.The low rate of reported complications associated with laparoscopic entry and the small number of participants within the included studies may account for the lack of significant difference in terms of major vascular and visceral injury between entry techniques. Results should be interpreted with caution for outcomes where only single studies were included.","Ahmad, Gaity; O'Flynn, Helena; Duffy, James M N; Phillips, Kevin; Watson, Andrew",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,153,33

Methods: We included eligible patients who underwent MT from the ANGEL registry study (2015-2017) in China. Subjects in the current analysis were dichotomized into two groups according to whether adequate heparinization during MT was performed. In the heparinization group, unfractionated heparin was infused at 50-100 IU/Kg at first and additional 1,000 IU at intervals of an hour during the operation. Safety outcomes (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [sICH], ICH and distal embolization) and efficacy outcomes (artery recanalization and functional outcomes at 3-month follow-up) were compared between groups. Results: We included 619 patients from the entire cohort of 917 patients. The average age of them was 63.9 ± 13.7 years, 269 (43.5%) were treated with heparinization during MT. Heparinization during MT didn't significantly influence recanalization rates, total ICH and long-term mortality (adjusted p > 0.05 for all). But sICH and distal embolization occurred more frequently (9.3 vs. 5.1%, adjusted p = 0.02; 7.1 vs. 3.1%, adjusted p = 0.04, respectively), while functional independence appeared less likely (39.8 vs. 47.4%, adjusted p = 0.01) in heparinization group than that in non-heparinization group. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that heparinization during MT was an independent predictor for sICH (Odds ratio 2.36 [1.19-4.67], p = 0.01) in addition to cardio-embolism stroke and posterior circulation stroke (PCS), and an independent predictor for poor outcome (Odds ratio 1.79 [1.23-2.59], p < 0.01) besides age, bridging intravenous thrombolysis, admission NIHSS, drinking and PCS. Conclusion: Heparinization during MT may be associated with increased risk of safety outcomes over sICH and distal embolization, as well as efficacy outcomes over long-term poor outcome. Further randomized controlled trials are needed.","Yang, Ming; Huo, Xiaochuan; Gao, Feng; Wang, Anxin; Ma, Ning; Liebeskind, David S; Wang, Yongjun; Miao, Zhongrong",Frontiers in neurology,153,1

The primary aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study was to compare the effects of single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) procedures regarding postoperative pain. METHODS Ninety adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in the study. Patients were randomized to either SILC or CLC. Patient characteristics, postoperative abdominal and shoulder pain scores, rescue analgesic use, and intraoperative and early postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS A total of 83 patients completed the study. Patient characteristics, postoperative abdominal and shoulder pain scores and rescue analgesic requirement were similar between each group except with the lower abdominal pain score in CLC group at 30th minute (P = 0.04). Wound infection was seen in 1 patient in each group. Nausea occurred in 13 of 43 patients (30%) in the SILC group and 8 of 40 patients (20%) in the CLC group (P > 0.05). Despite ondansetron treatment, 6 patients in SILC group and 7 patients in CLC group vomited (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION In conclusion, in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, SILC or CLC techniques does not influence the postoperative pain and analgesic medication requirements. Our results also suggest that all laparoscopy patients suffer moderate and/or severe abdominal pain and nearly half of these patients also suffer from some form of shoulder pain.","Yilmaz, Huseyin; Arun, Oguzhan; Apiliogullari, Seza; Acar, Fahrettin; Alptekin, Husnu; Calisir, Akın; Sahin, Mustafa",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,153,16

The majority of these trials are designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of candidate therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 to prevent death among populations of hospitalized patients with advanced disease. Yet, emerging epidemiological evidence now indicates that the majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2, while still infectious, experience minimal or mild disease symptomology.

The C-MAC® Video-Stylet (VS; Karl-Storz Germany), a hybrid between a flexible and a rigid intubation endoscope, has been recently introduced. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of the VS compared to a VL (C-MAC Macintosh blade, Karl-Storz Germany) with regards to the learning curve for each device and its ability to manage a simulated difficult airway manikin. This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover study involving twenty-one anesthesia residents performing intubations on a Bill 1™ (VBM, Germany) airway manikin model. After a standardized introduction, six randomized attempts with VL and VS were performed on the manikin. This was followed by intubation in a simulated difficult airway (cervical collar and inflated tongue) with both devices in a randomized fashion. The primary end-point of this study was the total time to intubation. All continuous variables were expressed as the median [interquartile range] and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to compare both devices at each trial. All reported p values are two sided. The median total time to intubation on a simulated difficult airway was faster with the VS compared to VL (17 [13.5-25] sec vs 23 [18.5-26.5] sec, respectively; 95% CI; P = 0.031). Additionally, on a normal airway manikin, the VS has a comparable learning curve to the VL. In this manikin-based study, the novel VS was comparable to the VL in terms of learning curve in a normal airway. In a simulated difficult airway, the total time to intubation, though likely not clinically relevant, was faster with the VS to the VL. However, given the above findings, this study justifies further human clinical trials with the VS to see if similar benefits-faster time to intubation and similar learning curve to VL-are replicated clinically.","Pius, James; Noppens, Ruediger R",PloS one,153,16

Paediatric and neonatal trainees were randomly assigned to determine which method they began with (no device, Pedi-Cap or a Neo-Stat). The participants used each method for a period of 3 min. They were video-recorded to determine the amount of effective ventilations delivered and the overall percentage efficiency of each method. Efficacy of ventilation was determined by comparing the number of manual ventilations delivered with the number of times chest rise was observed in the video recording. There were 19 paediatric trainees who provided a total of 7,790 ventilations, and 93% were deemed effective. The percentage of effective ventilations with the T-piece resuscitator alone, the PediCap and the NeoStat were 90, 94 and 96%, respectively. The difference was greatest in the first minute (T-piece resuscitator alone 87.5%, PediCap 94%, NeoStat 96%). Two thirds preferred the Neo-Stat.

We analysed whether perioperative bilateral BIS monitoring may detect abnormalities before the onset of POD in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS In a prospective observational study, 81 patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included. Bilateral Bispectral Index (BIS)-monitoring was applied during the pre-, intra- and postoperative period, and BIS, EEG Asymmetry (ASYM), and Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR) were recorded. POD was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, and patients were divided into a delirium and non-delirium group. RESULTS POD was detected in 26 patients (32%). A trend towards a lower ASYM was observed in the delirium group as compared to the non-delirium group on the preoperative day (ASYM = 48.2 ± 3.6% versus 50.0 ± 4.7%, mean ± sd, p = 0.087) as well as before induction of anaesthesia, with oral midazolam anxiolysis (median ASYM = 49.5%, IQR [47.4;51.5] versus 50.6%, IQR [49.1;54.2], p = 0.081). Delirious patients remained significantly (p = 0.018) longer in a burst suppression state intraoperatively (107 minutes, IQR [47;170] versus 44 minutes, IQR [11;120]) than non-delirious patients. Receiver operating analysis revealed burst suppression duration (area under the curve = 0.73, p = 0.001) and BSR (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.009) as predictors of POD. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative assessment of BSR may identify patients at risk of POD and should be investigated in further studies. So far it remains unknown whether there is a causal relationship or rather an association between intraoperative burst suppression and the development of POD.

Objective To evaluate neonatal outcomes in relation to maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants Nationwide, prospective cohort study based on linkage of the Swedish Pregnancy Register, the Neonatal Quality Register, and the Register for Communicable Diseases. Ninety-two percent of all live births in Sweden between March 11, 2020, and January 31, 2021, were investigated for neonatal outcomes by March 8, 2021. Infants with malformations were excluded. Infants of women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were matched, directly and using propensity scores, on maternal characteristics with up to 4 comparator infants. Exposures Maternal test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures In-hospital mortality; neonatal resuscitation; admission for neonatal care; respiratory, circulatory, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and hematologic disorders and their treatments; length of hospital stay; breastfeeding; and infant test positivity for SARS-CoV-2. Results Of 88 159 infants (49.0% girls), 2323 (1.6%) were delivered by mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean gestational age of infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers was 39.2 (SD, 2.2) weeks vs 39.6 (SD, 1.8) weeks for comparator infants, and the proportions of preterm infants (gestational age <37 weeks) were 205/2323 (8.8%) among infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and 4719/85 836 (5.5%) among comparator infants. After matching on maternal characteristics, maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was significantly associated with admission for neonatal care (11.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.70) and with neonatal morbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome (1.2% vs 0.5%; OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.50-3.84), any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2.0%; OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.90), and hyperbilirubinemia (3.6% vs 2.5%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.90). Mortality (0.30% vs 0.12%; OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.99-6.57), breastfeeding rates at discharge (94.4% vs 95.1%; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05), and length of stay in neonatal care (median, 6 days in both groups; difference, 0 days; 95% CI, -2 to 7 days) did not differ significantly between the groups. Twenty-one infants (0.90%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the neonatal period; 12 did not have neonatal morbidity, 9 had diagnoses with unclear relation to SARS-CoV-2, and none had congenital pneumonia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2005 and March 2010, 47 (52 sessions) patients with non-resectable liver tumors were treated and their tumors (55 primary carcinomas and 65 metastases, 1-12) were isolated from adjacent organs by laparoscopic liver mobilization and packing. Stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) comprised body fixation, contrast-enhanced CT, 3-D planning, navigation, needle placement, control CT of needle positions (with image fusion), thermal ablation and control CT (with image fusion). Liver packing was removed laparoscopically thereafter. Complications, primary success and local recurrence rates were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 120 liver lesions with a median size of 2.4 cm (range 1-15 cm) were treated. Laparoscopic packing could be performed in all patients. The primary success rate of ablation was 91.6% (110/120) and the local recurrence rate was 4.5% (5/110). There was one perioperative death (1.9%). All remaining complications could be managed by radiological interventions. Despite broad surface contact thermal injury of surrounding organs could be prevented in all patients. CONCLUSION Liver packing presents a viable and safe option for RFA of tumors with broad surface contact to surrounding organs with excellent local tumor control.","Schullian, Peter; Weiss, Helmut; Klaus, Alexander; Widmann, Gerlig; Kranewitter, Christof; Mittermair, Christof; Margreiter, Raimund; Bale, Reto",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,153,5

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical variables that could be used as futility indicators in massively transfused patients. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 138 adult surgical patients at our institution receiving a massive transfusion (2016-2019). Peak lactate and nadir pH within 24 h of massive transfusion initiation, along with other clinical variables, were assessed as predictors of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The overall rate of in-hospital mortality among our patient population was 52.9% (n = 73). Increasing lactate and decreasing pH were associated with greater mortality among massively transfused patients. Mortality rates were ~2-fold higher for patients in the highest lactate category (≥10.0 mmol/L: 25 of 37; 67.6%) compared to the lowest category (0.0-4.9 mmol/L: 17 of 48; 35.4%) (p = .005), and ~2.5-fold higher for patients in the lowest pH category (<7.00: 8 of 9; 88.9%) compared to the highest category (≥7.40: 8 of 23; 34.7%) (p = .016). Increasing age was also associated with higher mortality (≥65 years: 24 of 33; 72.7%) when compared to younger patients (18-64 years: 49 of 105; 46.7%) (p = .010). CONCLUSIONS Peak lactate ≥10.0 mmol/L, nadir pH <7.00, and age ≥65 years were significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality among massively transfused patients. Incorporating these clinical parameters into a futility index for massive transfusions will be useful in situations where blood products are scarce and/or mortality may be unavoidable.","Lo, Brian D; Merkel, Kevin R; Dougherty, James L; Kajstura, Tymoteusz J; Cruz, Nicolas C; Sikorski, Robert A; Frank, Steven M",Transfusion,153,16

The existence of genetic variance for resistance in the host population is crucial to the spread of an emerging virus. Models predict that rapid spread decreases with the frequency and diversity of resistance alleles in the host population. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce. Arabiodpsis thaliana--tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here, we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First, we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered. Second, the concept of resistance genes may only be valid for a well-defined viral genotype but not for polymorphic viral populations.","Lalić, Jasna; Agudelo-Romero, Patricia; Carrasco, Purificación; Elena, Santiago F","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In the present study, we evaluated the feasibility of this simple suspension method for the preparation of lenalidomide (Celgene, Summit, New Jersey and USA) suspension by testing the stability of this drug at 55℃ and its adsorbability on the tube. METHODS We examined, by high-performance liquid chromatography, the time-dependent changes in the concentration of lenalidomide in suspensions of the drug prepared by the simple suspension method. The high-performance liquid chromatography analyses of lenalidomide were performed on Prominence LC-20AB/SPD-20 A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a ZORBAX SB-C18 RR analytical column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA; particle size: 2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. A solvent system consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.0)/acetonitrile was used as the eluent and the eluate was detected by UV at 254 nm. RESULTS Lenalidomide was confirmed to remain stable in hot water at 55℃ for 24 h in the prepared suspension by the simple suspension method, and more than 99% of the drug could be recovered from the suspension. In addition, 94.5-98.0% of the drug amount could pass through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a motion-activated system (MAS) that applies motion-activated energy (vibration) to prevent chest tube clogging and maintain tube patency. We performed chest tube blood flow analysis in vitro, studied MAS effects on intraluminal clot deposition in vivo, and conducted a pilot clinical test. Background. Chest tube clogging is known to adversely contribute to postoperative cardiac surgery outcomes. Methods. The MAS was tested in vitro with a blood-filled chest tube model for device acceleration and performance. In vivo acute hemothorax studies (n = 5) were performed in healthy pigs (48.0 ± 2 kg) to evaluate the drainage in MAS versus control (no device) groups. Using a high-speed camera (FASTCAM Mini AX200, 100 mm Zeiss lens) in an additional animal study (n = 1), intraluminal whole-blood activation imaging of the chest tube (32 Fr) was made. The pilot clinical study (n = 12) consisted of up to a 30 minutes device tolerance test. Results. In vitro MAS testing suggested optimal device performance. The 2-hour in vivo evaluation showed a longer incremental drainage in the MAS group versus control. The total drainage in the MAS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (379 ± 144 mL vs 143 ± 40 mL; P = .0097), indicating tube patency. The high-speed camera images showed a characteristic intraluminal blood ""swirling"" pattern. Clinical data showed no discomfort with the MAS use (pleural = 4; mediastinal = 8). Conclusions. The MAS showed optimal performance at bench and better drainage profile in vivo. The clinical trial showed patients' tolerance to the MAS and device safety.","Karimov, Jamshid H; Dessoffy, Raymond; Fukamachi, Kiyotaka; Okano, Shinji; Idzior, Laura; Lobosky, Mark; Horvath, David",Surgical innovation,153,1

METHOD A self-completed questionnaire for older adults was provided in 2 dayservice facilities and a nursing station. We operationally defined health status with 4 domains (motor function, oral and swallowing function, depression, and social networks) and designed the questionnaire to determine self-rated changes in health status using factor analysis. After factor analysis, regression analyses were conducted. Dependent variable was each factor score (self-rated changes of health status), and independent variable was decrease in frequency of going outdoors. RESULTS Approximately 80% of participants answered that their health status had ""worsened"" in motor function (75.0%-87.2%). Moreover, more than 70% of participants answered ""worsened"" in ""Feeling energy"" and ""Getting together and speaking with friends"" (72.3% and 75.7%, respectively). Regression analyses demonstrated that, after adjusting for covariates, the decrease in frequency of going outdoors was related to self-rated changes of motor function and friend network. CONCLUSION During stay-at-home orders, older adults felt deterioration in their motor function, in feeling energy, and in their friend network, especially people who had decreased their frequency of going outdoors felt more deterioration in their motor function and in their friend network.","Ono, Takazumi; Kashima, Mieko; Asakawa, Yasuyoshi",Physical therapy research,153,1

We aimed to discover a set of miRNAs that could accurately discriminate Barrett's esophagus (BE) from normal esophageal tissue and to test its diagnostic accuracy when applied to samples collected by a noninvasive esophageal cell sampling device. METHODS We analyzed miRNA expression profiles of 2 independent sets of esophageal biopsy tissues collected during endoscopy from 38 patients with BE and 26 patients with normal esophagus (controls) using Agilent microarray and Nanostring nCounter assays. Consistently up-regulated miRNAs were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in esophageal tissues collected by Cytosponge from patients with BE vs without BE. miRNAs were expressed from plasmids and antisense oligonucleotides were expressed in normal esophageal squamous cells; effects on proliferation and gene expression patterns were analyzed. RESULTS We identified 15 miRNAs that were significantly up-regulated in BE vs control tissues. Of these, 11 (MIR215, MIR194, MIR 192, MIR196a, MIR199b, MIR10a, MIR145, MIR181a, MIR30a, MIR7, and MIR199a) were validated in Cytosponge samples. The miRNAs with the greatest increases in BE tissues (7.9-fold increase in expression or more, P < .0001: MIR196a, MIR192, MIR194, and MIR215) each identified BE vs control tissues with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.82 or more. We developed an optimized multivariable logistic regression model, based on expression levels of 6 miRNAs (MIR7, MIR30a, MIR181a, MIR192, MIR196a, and MIR199a), that identified patients with BE with an AUC value of 0.89, 86.2% sensitivity, and 91.6% specificity. Expression level of MIR192, MIR196a, MIR199a, combined that of trefoil factor 3, identified patients with BE with an AUC of 0.93, 93.1% sensitivity, and 93.7% specificity. Hypomethylation was observed in the promoter region of the highly up-regulated cluster MIR192-MIR194. Overexpression of these miRNAs in normal esophageal squamous cells increased their proliferation, via GRHL3 and PTEN signaling. CONCLUSIONS In analyses of miRNA expression patterns of BE vs non-BE tissues, we identified a profile that can identify Cytosponge samples from patients with BE with an AUC of 0.93. Expression of MIR194 is increased in BE samples via epigenetic mechanisms that might be involved in BE pathogenesis.","Li, Xiaodun; Kleeman, Sam; Coburn, Sally B; Fumagalli, Carlo; Perner, Juliane; Jammula, Sriganesh; Pfeiffer, Ruth M; Orzolek, Linda; Hao, Haiping; Taylor, Philip R; Miremadi, Ahmad; Galeano-Dalmau, Núria; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; Tennyson, Maria; MacRae, Shona; Cook, Michael B; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Gastroenterology,153,1

This report describes the largest cadaveric series to date as optimization of this approach for clinical application continues. METHODS Between December 2008 and September 2011, NOTES transanal rectosigmoid resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) was successfully performed in 32 fresh human cadavers using transanal dissection alone (n = 19), with transgastric endoscopic assistance (n = 5), or with laparoscopic assistance (n = 8). The variables recorded were gender, body mass index (BMI), operative time, length of the mobilized specimen, integrity of the mesorectum and the resected specimen, and complications. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Of the 32 cadavers, 22 were male with a mean BMI of 24 kg/m(2) (range 16.3-37 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 5.1 h (range 3-8 h), and the mean specimen length was 53 cm (range 15-91.5 cm). After the first five cadavers, specimen length significantly improved, and a trend toward decreased operative time was demonstrated. The mesorectum was intact in 100% of the specimens. In nine cadavers, endoscopic dissection was complicated by organ injury. Evaluation by the operative approach demonstrated a significantly longer specimen with laparoscopic assistance (67.7 cm) than with transgastric assistance (45.4 cm) or transanal dissection alone (49.2 cm) (p = 0.013). Comparison of the technique used for inferior mesenteric pedicle division demonstrated both significantly decreased operative time (4.8 vs 6 h; p = 0.024) and increased specimen length (57.7 vs 39.6 cm; p = 0.025) when a stapler was used in lieu of a bipolar cautery device. CONCLUSION Transanal NOTES rectosigmoid resection with TME is feasible and demonstrates improvement in specimen length and operative time with experience. Transitioning to clinical application requires laparoscopic assistance to overcome limitations related to NOTES instrumentation, as well as procedural training with fresh human cadavers.","Telem, Dana A; Han, Kyung Su; Kim, Min-Chan; Ajari, Ifode; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Woods, Kevin; Kapur, Varun; Sbeih, Mohammad A; Perretta, Silvana; Rattner, David W; Sylla, Patricia",Surgical endoscopy,153,1

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 surge began, an interdisciplinary group of administrators, providers, and trainees at Brigham and Women's Hospital created an inpatient virtual staffing model called the Virtual Team Rounding Program (VTRP). APPROACH The conceptual framework guiding VTRP development was rapid-cycle innovation. The VTRP was designed iteratively using feedback from residents, physician assistants, attendings, and administrators from March to June 2020. The VTRP trained and deployed a diverse set of providers across specialties as ""virtual rounders"" to support inpatient teams by joining and participating in rounds via videoconference and completing documentation tasks during and after rounds. The program was rapidly scaled up from March to June 2020. OUTCOMES In a survey of inpatient providers at the end of the pilot phase, 10/10 (100%) respondents reported they were getting either ""a lot"" or ""a little"" benefit from the VTRP and did not find the addition of the virtual rounder burdensome. During the scaling phase, the program grew to support 24 teams. In a survey at the end of the contraction phase, 117/187 (62.6%) inpatient providers who worked with a virtual rounder felt the rounder saved them time. VTRP leadership collaboratively and iteratively developed best practices for challenges encountered during implementation. NEXT STEPS Virtual rounding provides a valuable extension of inpatient teams to manage COVID-19 surges. Future work will quantitatively and qualitatively assess the impact of the VTRP on inpatient provider satisfaction and well-being, virtual rounders' experiences, and patient care outcomes.","Becker, Nora V; Bakshi, Salina; Martin, Kate L; Bougrine, Amina; Andrade, Jonathan; Massey, Paul R; Hirner, Jesse P; Eccleston, Julie; Choudhry, Niteesh K; Britton, Kathryn; Landman, Adam B; Licurse, Adam M; Carlile, Narath; Mendu, Mallika L",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,153,1

Although composting is an effective method to treat source separated biowaste (SSB), there are certain limitations in terms of operation, partly due to insufficient control to the variability of SSB quality, which affects process kinetics and product quality. This study assesses the variability of the SSB physicochemical quality in a composting facility located in a small town of Colombia, in which SSB collection was performed twice a week. Likewise, the influence of the SSB physicochemical variability on the variability of compost parameters was assessed. Parametric and non-parametric tests (i.e. Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney test) showed no significant differences in the quality parameters of SSB among collection days, and therefore, it was unnecessary to establish specific operation and maintenance regulations for each collection day. Significant variability was found in eight of the twelve quality parameters analyzed in the inlet stream, with corresponding coefficients of variation (CV) higher than 23%. The CVs for the eight parameters analyzed in the final compost (i.e. pH, moisture, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, total phosphorus, total potassium and ash) ranged from 9.6% to 49.4%, with significant variations in five of those parameters (CV>20%). The above indicate that variability in the inlet stream can affect the variability of the end-product. Results suggest the need to consider variability of the inlet stream in the performance of composting facilities to achieve a compost of consistent quality.","Oviedo-Ocaña, E R; Torres-Lozada, P; Marmolejo-Rebellon, L F; Torres-López, W A; Dominguez, I; Komilis, D; Sánchez, A",Waste management,153,33

Mostly individual teletherapy has been offered and studied, although group therapy is often offered in clinics. In fact, little is known regarding group therapy's acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact when offered via videoconferencing. METHODS This pilot study offered group cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis via videoconferencing to 14 individuals with early psychosis either living in remote areas or confined during the pandemic. RESULTS The rate of consenting to the study (79%) and actual participation rates were acceptable (18.5 sessions out of 24). Although some technological obstacles were encountered, solutions offered allowed the videoconferencing group to be considered feasible for most participants and therapists. Prepost results on symptoms and self-esteem were comparable to those of other studies using the same group treatment but in-person. Alliance scores seemed similar as well. CONCLUSIONS More studies are warranted on the efficacy of group therapy via videoconferencing. This pilot study does offer promising results, suggesting that a wider range of people with early psychosis can be reached and benefit from the advantages of receiving an evidence-based group intervention.","Lecomte, Tania; Abdel-Baki, Amal; Francoeur, Audrey; Cloutier, Briana; Leboeuf, Amélie; Abadie, Pascale; Villeneuve, Marie; Guay, Stephane",Early intervention in psychiatry,153,30

The cytokine storm can occur in a number of infectious and noninfectious diseases including COVID-19, sepsis, ebola, avian influenza, and graft versus host disease, or during the severe inflammatory response syndrome.Area covered: This review mainly focuses on the most common and well-known methods of protein studies (PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and high- performance liquid chromatography). It also discusses other modern technologies in proteomics like mass spectrometry, soft ionization techniques, cytometric bead assays, and the next generation of microarrays that have been used to get an in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms involved during the cytokine storm.Expert opinion: Overactivation of leukocytes drives the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines fueling the cytokine storm. These events lead to a systemic hyper-inflammation, circulatory collapse and shock, and finally to multiorgan failure. Therefore, monitoring the patient's systemic cytokine levels with proteomic technologies that are redundant, economical, and require minimal sample volume for real-time assessment might help in a better clinical evaluation and management of critically ill patients.","David, Paul; Hansen, Frederik J; Bhat, Adil; Weber, Georg F",Expert review of proteomics,153,1

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has a demonstrated role in shaping innate and adaptive antiviral immunity by inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and mediating signals downstream of IFN-γ. Although ectopic expression experiments have suggested an inhibitory function of IRF-1 against infection of alphaviruses in cell culture, its role in vivo remains unknown. Here, we infected Irf1 -/- mice with two distantly related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and assessed the early antiviral functions of IRF-1 prior to induction of adaptive B and T cell responses. IRF-1 expression limited CHIKV-induced foot swelling in joint-associated tissues and prevented dissemination of CHIKV and RRV at early time points. Virological and histological analyses revealed greater infection of muscle tissues in Irf1 -/- mice than in wild-type mice. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 appeared to be independent of the induction of type I IFN or the effects of type II and III IFNs but were associated with altered local proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and differential infiltration of myeloid cell subsets. Collectively, our in vivo experiments suggest that IRF-1 restricts CHIKV and RRV infection in stromal cells, especially muscle cells, and that this controls local inflammation and joint-associated swelling.IMPORTANCE Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a broad range of antiviral host defense genes. In this study, using Irf1 -/- mice, we investigated the role of IRF-1 in modulating pathogenesis of two related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus and Ross River virus. Our studies show that IRF-1 controlled alphavirus replication and swelling in joint-associated tissues within days of infection. Detailed histopathological and virological analyses revealed that IRF-1 preferentially restricted CHIKV infection in cells of nonhematopoietic lineage, including muscle cells. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 resulted in decreased local inflammatory responses in joint-associated tissues, which prevented immunopathology.","Nair, Sharmila; Poddar, Subhajit; Shimak, Raeann M; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,153,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS This investigation was approved by the animal care committee. Sixty nude rats with subcutaneously implanted HNSCC xenografts (six per group) were treated with (a) RF ablation (70 °C for 5 minutes), (b) PEGylated liposomes, (c) liposomal doxorubicin, (d) (186)Re-PEGylated liposomes (1295 MBq/kg), (e) (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin (555 MBq/kg), (f) PEGylated liposomes plus RF ablation, (g) liposomal doxorubicin plus RF ablation, (h) (186)Re-PEGylated liposomes plus RF ablation, or (i) (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin plus RF ablation. Six rats did not receive any treatment (control group). Tumor uptake in (186)Re therapy groups was monitored with small-animal single photon emission computed tomography for 5 days. Therapeutic efficacy was monitored for 6 weeks with measurement of tumor volume, calculation of the percentage injected dose of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in tumor from small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) images, and determination of viable tumor volume at histopathologic examination. Significant differences between groups were determined with analysis of variance. RESULTS The average tumor volume (± standard deviation) on the day of therapy was 1.32 cm(3) ± 0.17. At 6 weeks after therapy, control of tumor growth was better with (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin than with liposomal doxorubicin alone (tumor volume, 2.26 cm(3) ± 0.89 vs 5.43 cm(3) ± 0.93, respectively; P < .01). The use of RF ablation with liposomal doxorubicin and (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin further improved tumor control (tumor volume, 2.05 cm(3) ± 1.36 and 1.49 cm(3) ± 1.47, respectively). The tumor growth trend correlated with change in percentage of injected dose of FDG in tumor for all groups (R(2) = 0.85, P < .001). Viable tumor volume was significantly decreased in the group treated with (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin plus RF ablation (0.54 cm(3) ± 0.38; P < .001 vs all groups except (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin alone). CONCLUSION Triple and dual therapies had an observable trend ((186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin plus RF ablation > (186)Re-liposomal doxorubicin > liposomal doxorubicin plus RF ablation > liposomal doxorubicin) of improved tumor growth control and decreased viable tumor compared with other therapies. FDG PET could be used as a noninvasive surrogate marker for tumor growth and viability in this tumor model.","Soundararajan, Anuradha; Dodd, Gerald D; Bao, Ande; Phillips, William T; McManus, Linda M; Prihoda, Thomas J; Goins, Beth A",Radiology,153,11

The objective of this study was to compare the two currently most commonly used methods for thoracic sympathicotomy: transection (ETS) and clipping (ETC.). METHODS This is a retrospective study on a total of 63 patients, who underwent rib-oriented sympathicotomy, either by transection (n = 36, 57 %) or by clipping (n = 27, 43 %). Moreover, the up-to-date international literature is reviewed concerning which level(s) of the sympathetic trunk should be addressed, depending on the patients underlying condition. Furthermore, the highly controversial topic of reversibility of sympathetic clipping is debated. RESULTS Our results confirm that clipping is at least as effective as transection of the sympathetic chain in the treatment of hyperhidrosis and facial blushing. Furthermore, the analysis of all larger studies on unclipping in humans shows a surprisingly high reported reversal rate between 48 and 77 %. CONCLUSIONS Depending on the symptoms of the patient, different levels of the sympathetic chain should be addressed. When a higher rib level such as R2 is approached, which more likely will result in moderate to severe compensatory sweating, clipping should be preferred as it seems that this technique has indeed a potential for reversibility. As demonstrated, this method is at least as effective as an irreversible transection of the sympathetic chain.","Kocher, Gregor J; Taha, Anas; Ahler, Markus; Schmid, Ralph A",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,153,8

Loss of pulsatile brain perfusion, however, has been implicated in neurological complications. Furthermore, the adverse effects of absent pulsatility on the cerebral microcirculation are modulated similarly as CO2 vasoreactivity in resistance vessels. During support with an extracorporeal assist device swings in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressures (PaCO2) that determine cerebral oxygen delivery are not uncommon-especially when CO2 is eliminated by the respirator as well as via the gas exchanger of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine. We, therefore, investigated whether non-pulsatile flow affects cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity (CVR) and regional brain oxygenation (rSO2). METHODS In this prospective, single-centre case-control trial, we studied 32 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAv) as well as rSO2 was determined during step changes of PaCO2 between 30, 40, and 50 mmHg. Measurements were conducted on cardiopulmonary bypass during non-pulsatile and postoperatively under pulsatile blood flow at comparable test conditions. Corresponding changes of CVR and concomitant rSO2 alterations were determined for each flow mode. Each patient served as her own control. RESULTS MCAv was generally lower during hypocapnia than during normocapnia and hypercapnia (p < 0.0001). However, the MCAv/PaCO2 slope during non-pulsatile flow was 14.4 cm/s/mmHg [CI 11.8-16.9] and 10.4 cm/s/mmHg [CI 7.9-13.0] after return of pulsatility (p = 0.03). During hypocapnia, non-pulsatile CVR (4.3 ± 1.7%/mmHg) was higher than pulsatile CVR (3.1 ± 1.3%/mmHg, p = 0.01). Independent of the flow mode, we observed a decline in rSO2 during hypocapnia and a corresponding rise during hypercapnia (p < 0.0001). However, the relationship between ΔrSO2 and ΔMCAv was less pronounced during non-pulsatile flow. CONCLUSIONS Non-pulsatile perfusion is associated with enhanced cerebrovascular CVR resulting in greater relative decreases of cerebral blood flow during hypocapnia. Heterogenic microvascular perfusion may account for the attenuated ΔrSO2/ΔMCAv slope. Potential hazards related to this altered regulation of cerebral perfusion still need to be assessed.

The inability to conduct traditional evaluations has left neuropsychologists with the unprecedented task of determining how to modify existing paradigms while balancing the need to provide services and adhere to safety parameters. The COVID-19 literature suggests clinicians are modifying their evaluations based on the following models: (1) continuing to administer in-person evaluations; (2) discontinuing all evaluations due to issues related to standardization, test security, and patient-specific characteristics; (3) conducting virtual evaluations; and/or (4) adopting a hybrid model incorporating both traditional and technology-based modalities. Given the challenges with models 1-3, along with the modifications in telehealth guidelines and insurance reimbursement rates, neuropsychologists are more poised than ever to solidify the implementation of a hybrid model that lasts beyond COVID-19.

However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.","Zhou, Bin; Thi Nhu Thao, Tran; Hoffmann, Donata; Taddeo, Adriano; Ebert, Nadine; Labroussaa, Fabien; Pohlmann, Anne; King, Jacqueline; Steiner, Silvio; Kelly, Jenna N; Portmann, Jasmine; Halwe, Nico Joel; Ulrich, Lorenz; Trüeb, Bettina Salome; Fan, Xiaoyu; Hoffmann, Bernd; Wang, Li; Thomann, Lisa; Lin, Xudong; Stalder, Hanspeter; Pozzi, Berta; de Brot, Simone; Jiang, Nannan; Cui, Dan; Hossain, Jaber; Wilson, Malania; Keller, Matthew; Stark, Thomas J; Barnes, John R; Dijkman, Ronald; Jores, Joerg; Benarafa, Charaf; Wentworth, David E; Thiel, Volker; Beer, Martin",Nature,153,20

A cluster of cases among health care workers and family members following exposure to a patient with fulminant disease consistent with HGA prompted investigation. OBJECTIVE To investigate the origin and transmission of apparent nosocomial cases of febrile illness in the Anhui Province. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS After exposure to an index patient whose fatal illness was characterized by fever and hemorrhage at a primary care hospital and regional tertiary care hospital's isolation ward, secondary cases with febrile illness who were suspected of being exposed were tested for antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing for A. phagocytophilum DNA. Potential sources of exposure were investigated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cases with serological or PCR evidence of HGA were compared with uninfected contacts to define the attack rate, relative risk of illness, and potential risks for exposure during the provision of care to the index patient. RESULTS In a regional hospital of Anhui Province, China, between November 9 and 17, 2006, a cluster of 9 febrile patients with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels were diagnosed with HGA by PCR for A. phagocytophilum DNA in peripheral blood and by seroconversion to A. phagocytophilum. No patients had tick bites. All 9 patients had contact with the index patient within 12 hours of her death from suspected fatal HGA while she experienced extensive hemorrhage and underwent endotracheal intubation. The attack rate was 32.1% vs 0% (P = .04) among contacts exposed at 50 cm or closer, 45% vs 0% (P = .001) among those exposed for more than 2 hours, 75% vs 0% (P < .001) among those reporting contact with blood secretions, and 87.5% vs 0% (P = .004) among those reporting contact with respiratory secretions from the index patient.

PE is associated with ischemia and increased oxidative stress in the placenta, which may lead to modification of plasma albumin to ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). The aim of this study was to investigate IMA and hematological parameters in mothers and in premature infants in normal and in pre-eclamptic pregnancies. METHODS Twenty-five pregnant women with PE and their premature newborns were categorized as the PE group, and 25 normotensive pregnant women and their premature newborns as the control group. Preterm infants are classified as small for gestational age (SGA) or non-SGA according to the Fenton preterm growth chart. Serum IMA, complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), albumin, and C-reactive protein were measured in the mothers immediately before birth, and in the cord blood and serum of the newborns at 6 and 24 h after birth. Clinical and demographic data were recorded for both groups. RESULTS While IMA, LFT and RFT were significantly increased in the PE group compared with the control group, albumin and CBC were significantly lower in the PE group. A total of 40% of PE newborns were SGA, 30% of whom had severe SGA (birthweight <3rd percentile). Cord IMA was significantly increased in all preterm neonates in the PE group compared with the control group. No mothers or neonates died. CONCLUSION Serum IMA in addition to the prevalence of SGA were significantly increased in the PE group. Cord blood IMA, therefore, might be a predictive biomarker for SGA in PE pregnancies.","Özdemir, Özmert Ma; Özdemir, Emine; Enli, Yaşar; Öztekin, Özer; Ergin, Hacer",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,153,16

This study compared the efficacy of oxycodone/acetaminophen to that of acetaminophen alone as second-line treatment for patients with acute musculoskeletal pain who were administered prescription strength ibuprofen and reported insufficient relief 1hour later. METHODS A randomized, double-blind study conducted in two urban EDs. Opioid-naïve patients ≥18 years with an acute musculoskeletal injury were administered ibuprofen 600mg as part of the study protocol. Those who reported insufficient relief one hour later were randomized (1:1ratio) to oxycodone10mg/ acetaminophen 650mg or acetaminophen 650mg. The primary outcome was improvement in 0-10 pain scale between randomization and 2 hours later. We also assessed medication-associated adverse events. A sample size calculation, built around a minimum clinically important difference of 1.3 units, determined the need for 154 patients. RESULTS We screened 924 patients and enrolled 393. All 393 received ibuprofen. 159(40%) patients reported inadequate relief after 1hour had elapsed. 154 of these were randomized, 77 to oxycodone/acetaminophen and 77 to acetaminophen. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Among patients randomized to oxycodone/acetaminophen, mean improvement in 0-10 pain scale was 4.0(SD: 2.6) versus 2.9(SD:2.4) in the acetaminophen arm. The 95%CI for the mean difference of 1.1 was 0.3, 1.9.

Unfortunately, a large cohort of patients do not achieve functional independence with treatment, even though the results are more robust than with medical management. The hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) on MRI is an indication of the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that the presence of HARM on MRI correlates with worse neurological recovery after reperfusion therapy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 35 consecutive patients who between February 24, 2016 and April 23, 2016 underwent MRI to determine the presence of HARM after thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Demographic, radiographic imaging, and outcome data were collected. Univariate and binary logistic regression models were performed to assess predictors for improvement of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score by ≥8 points at 24 hours. RESULTS The 35 patients studied had an average age of 64±14 years of age with a median NIHSS score of 15 (IQR 9-20). Eighteen patients (51%) were found to have a HARM-positive MRI. In univariate analysis, patients with HARM were older, had lower reperfusion rates and more postprocedural hemorrhages. In binary logistic regression modeling, the absence of HARM was independently associated with a ≥8-point NIHSS score improvement at 24 hours (OR=7.14, 95% CI 1.22 to 41.67). CONCLUSIONS This preliminary analysis shows that the presence of HARM may be linked to worse neurological recovery 24 hours after thrombectomy.

We compared the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol using low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure with open lung approach resulting in moderate to high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure for the management of established moderate/severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN A prospective, multicenter, pilot, randomized controlled trial. SETTING A network of 20 multidisciplinary ICUs. PATIENTS Patients meeting the American-European Consensus Conference definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome were considered for the study. INTERVENTIONS At 12-36 hours after acute respiratory distress syndrome onset, patients were assessed under standardized ventilator settings (FIO2≥0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure ≥10 cm H2O). If Pao2/FIO2 ratio remained less than or equal to 200 mm Hg, patients were randomized to open lung approach or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol. All patients were ventilated with a tidal volume of 4 to 8 ml/kg predicted body weight. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS From 1,874 screened patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 200 were randomized: 99 to open lung approach and 101 to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol. Main outcome measures were 60-day and ICU mortalities, and ventilator-free days. Mortality at day-60 (29% open lung approach vs. 33% Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol, p = 0.18, log rank test), ICU mortality (25% open lung approach vs. 30% Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol, p = 0.53 Fisher's exact test), and ventilator-free days (8 [0-20] open lung approach vs. 7 [0-20] d Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol, p = 0.53 Wilcoxon rank test) were not significantly different. Airway driving pressure (plateau pressure - positive end-expiratory pressure) and PaO2/FIO2 improved significantly at 24, 48 and 72 hours in patients in open lung approach compared with patients in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome network protocol. Barotrauma rate was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS In patients with established acute respiratory distress syndrome, open lung approach improved oxygenation and driving pressure, without detrimental effects on mortality, ventilator-free days, or barotrauma. This pilot study supports the need for a large, multicenter trial using recruitment maneuvers and a decremental positive end-expiratory pressure trial in persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Kacmarek, Robert M; Villar, Jesús; Sulemanji, Demet; Montiel, Raquel; Ferrando, Carlos; Blanco, Jesús; Koh, Younsuck; Soler, Juan Alfonso; Martínez, Domingo; Hernández, Marianela; Tucci, Mauro; Borges, Joao Batista; Lubillo, Santiago; Santos, Arnoldo; Araujo, Juan B; Amato, Marcelo B P; Suárez-Sipmann, Fernando",Critical care medicine,153,31

In this work, we chose a model plant, wheat, as the test material to determine the effects of applying 10 mg/kg S-ME to soil on its fresh weight, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the diversity and structural composition of the phyllosphere microorganisms after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Our work showed that this concentration of residual S-ME in soil only slightly decreased plant biomass and had little effect on lipid peroxidation, the antioxidant enzyme system and chlorophyll content. Interestingly, although the test concentration of S-ME did not exert strong inhibitory effects on the physiological activities of wheat, it decreased the diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities and changed their structure, indicating that microorganisms were more sensitive stress indicators. S-ME reduced the colonization by some beneficial bacteria related to plant nitrogen fixation among the phyllosphere microorganisms, which influenced the growth and yield of wheat because these bacteria contribute to plant fitness. In addition, S-ME affected the association between the host and the composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities under different growth conditions. Our work provides insights into the ecological implications of the effects of herbicides on the phyllosphere microbiome.","Xu, Nuohan; Qu, Qian; Zhang, Zhenyan; Yuan, Wenting; Cui, Hengzheng; Shen, Yijia; Lin, Wei; Lu, Tao; Qian, Haifeng",The Science of the total environment,153,24

It has been reported that PCV-VG decreases airway pressure and improves oxygenation among the adult group. In this study, the respiratory dynamics of PCV-VG and VCV are compared in pediatric patients ventilated with laryngeal mask airway and underwent laparoscopic hernia of the sac ligation. Patients and Methods Sixty-four pediatric patients were included in this prospective, randomized clinical trial. Pediatric patients were randomly allocated to receive VCV and PCV-VG ventilation during the general anesthesia. The hemodynamic and respiratory variables were recorded at the time when laryngeal mask airway was placed, pneumoperitoneum began, 5 mins after pneumoperitoneum began, pneumoperitoneum ended, and the operation ended respectively. The respiratory adverse events were recorded after the operation and on the first day after the operation. In this study, respiratory adverse events are defined as cough, hoarseness, hypoxemia, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and sore throat. Results There was no statistical difference in hemodynamic variables at all time points between the two groups. Compared to the VCV group, peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and plateau airway pressure in the PCV-VG group decreased significantly. Pulmonary dynamic compliance (Cydn) in the PCV-VG group was significantly higher than that in the VCV group. The respiratory adverse events appeared to have no statistical difference between VCV and PCV groups. Conclusion PCV-VG provides a lower Ppeak and better Cydn in pediatric patients compared with the VCV group during laparoscopic surgery. The results suggested that PCV-VG may be a superior way of mechanical ventilation for pediatric patients who ventilated with laryngeal mask airway and experienced laparoscopic surgery.","Liu, Huan; Cao, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Xuesheng; Gu, Erwei",International journal of general medicine,153,24

We explored patients' perceptions and experiences of telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy (Tele-CBT) in this qualitative study. Ten participants from the Toronto Western Hospital Bariatric Surgery Program in Toronto, Canada who completed the Tele-CBT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02920112) were individually interviewed from November 2014 to June 2016 until thematic saturation occurred (ie, no more new coding groups emerged). Interviews were transcribed, independently coded, checked for discrepancies, and analysed using grounded theory. Four themes emerged: (1) participants were generally satisfied with Tele-CBT (eg, therapeutic alliance, resources provided, relevance of therapy to their own bariatric journey), (2) participants noticed emotional, cognitive, and behavioural changes following therapy, (3) the optimal time to deliver the Tele-CBT was when weight loss plateaued, generally at one-year post-surgery, and (4) participants found the telephone modality convenient. CBT was generally found to be helpful and the telephone format increased convenience and accessibility. Patients reported learning skills and receiving resources that could help them improve their well-being following bariatric surgery.","Santiago, Vincent A; Cassin, Stephanie E; Wnuk, Susan; Du, Chau; Hawa, Raed; Parikh, Sagar V; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Clinical obesity,153,24

STUDY DESIGN From video recordings in delivery rooms, we determined the time from birth and arrival on a resuscitation table to warm, assess heart rate (HR), attach an oximeter, and provide respiratory support for each infant. We determined the proportion of infants who had these tasks completed by 30 and 60 seconds, and the median time taken to perform each task. RESULTS We reviewed and analyzed data from 189 infants (median gestational age, 29 weeks [IQR, 27-34 weeks]; median birth weight, 1220 g [IQR, 930-2197 g]). Twelve infants (6%) were not on the resuscitation table within 30 seconds of birth. Less than 10% of infants were placed in polyethylene bags or had their HR determined by 30 seconds. By 60 seconds, 48% were in polyethylene bags, 33% had their HR determined, 38% received respiratory support, and 60% had an oximeter attached. The median time taken to perform all tasks was greater than that recommended in the guidelines. CONCLUSION Most newborns were not managed within the time frame recommended in resuscitation guidelines.

METHOD AND MATERIALS A database search was performed to include patients with unresectable histologically proven and/or (18)F-FDG-PET avid CRLM who were treated with RFA or MWA between January 2001 and September 2014 in a single centre. All lesions that were considered to have a peribiliary and/or perivascular location were included. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the distribution of patient, tumour and procedure characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to correct for potential confounders. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-three patients with 774 unresectable CRLM were ablated. One hundred and twenty-two patients (78 males; 44 females) had at least one perivascular or peribiliary lesion (n = 199). Primary efficacy rate of RFA was superior to MWA after 3 and 12 months of follow-up (P = 0.010 and P = 0.022); however, after multivariate analysis this difference was non-significant at 12 months (P = 0.078) and vanished after repeat ablations (P = 0.39). More CTCAE grade III complications occurred after MWA versus RFA (18.8 vs. 7.9 %; P = 0.094); biliary complications were especially common after peribiliary MWA (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION For perivascular CRLM, RFA and MWA are both safe treatment options that appear equally effective. For peribiliary CRLM, MWA has a higher complication rate than RFA, with similar efficacy. Based on these results, it is advised to use RFA for lesions in the proximity of major bile ducts.","van Tilborg, Aukje A J M; Scheffer, Hester J; de Jong, Marcus C; Vroomen, Laurien G P H; Nielsen, Karin; van Kuijk, Cornelis; van den Tol, Petrousjka M P; Meijerink, Martijn R",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,153,1

There is no research in Canada identifying and describing the strategies and resources that pharmacists use to minimize disruption and continuity of care for patients. Methods An exploratory qualitative methodology was used. Community pharmacists and technicians in Ontario were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol. Verbatim transcripts were generated and coded by at least 2 independent reviewers using content analysis methods to identify management strategies. Results and Discussion A total of 14 pharmacists and 7 regulated pharmacy technicians participated in this study. The following 5 main strategies for managing drug shortages were identified: (1) using the supplier, (2) generic options, (3) brand options, (4) contacting other pharmacies and (5) switching to a different medication. Conclusion The strategies identified through this research can provide pharmacists with some guidance in approaching the real-world problem of drug shortages. It also highlights opportunities for organizations, government and manufacturers to provide additional support for pharmacists to minimize disruptions for patients and to ensure current ad hoc practices do not further compound shortage issues.

In lung tissue specimens from patients with stable, mild COPD and from control smokers without airflow obstruction, we determined the prevalence and load of nucleic acid from common respiratory viruses and concomitant inflammation of small airways measuring less than 2-mm in diameter. METHODS Frozen lung tissue obtained from patients with stable, mild COPD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 20) underwent real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for 13 respiratory viruses, and quantitative histology for inflammation of small airways. The two groups were compared for viral prevalence and load, and airway inflammation. The relationship between viral load and airway inflammatory cells was also analyzed. RESULTS Viral nucleic acid were detected in lung tissue of 18/40 (45.0%) of the individuals studied and included seven co-infections that were characterized by a ""dominant virus"" contributing to most of the total measured viral load. Lung tissue of COPD patients had a significantly higher prevalence of viral nucleic acid (particularly influenza A virus), and increased inflammation of small airways by macrophages and neutrophils versus controls. In qPCR-positive individuals, linear regression analysis showed a direct correlation between viral load and airway neutrophils, and between influenza A virus load and airway macrophages. CONCLUSION The lung tissue of patients with stable, mild COPD has a higher prevalence and load of respiratory viruses versus non-obstructed control subjects, and increased inflammation of small airways. Respiratory viruses may represent potential targets in COPD patient management.","Utokaparch, Soraya; Sze, Marc A; Gosselink, John V; McDonough, John E; Elliott, W Mark; Hogg, James C; Hegele, Richard G",COPD,153,20

A large (n = 10,010 patients) international trial (POISE-2) demonstrated that perioperative aspirin did not prevent myocardial infarction, and the result was consistent both for patients who had been taking aspirin before the trial (continuation stratum, 4382 patients) and for patients who had not been taking aspirin before the trial (initiation stratum, 5628 patients). Aspirin did, however, increase the risk of major bleeding. Therefore, the best evidence does not support the use of aspirin for the prevention of myocardial infarction in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. In patients who have an indication for long-term aspirin usage and have their aspirin held during the perioperative period, it is important to ensure aspirin is restarted after the high-risk period for bleeding has passed (i.e., 8-10 days after surgery).","Duceppe, E; Mrkobrada, M; Thomas, S; Devereaux, P J",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,153,10

Our study examined whether use of face masks and hand hygiene reduced the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS A randomized intervention trial involving 1437 young adults living in university residence halls during the 2006-2007 influenza season was designed. Residence halls were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups-face mask use, face masks with hand hygiene, or control- for 6 weeks. Generalized models estimated rate ratios for clinically diagnosed or survey-reported ILI weekly and cumulatively. RESULTS We observed significant reductions in ILI during weeks 4-6 in the mask and hand hygiene group, compared with the control group, ranging from 35% (confidence interval [CI], 9%-53%) to 51% (CI, 13%-73%), after adjusting for vaccination and other covariates. Face mask use alone showed a similar reduction in ILI compared with the control group, but adjusted estimates were not statistically significant. Neither face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ILI cumulatively. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.

We hypothesized that the inclusion of BCI in the diets may lead to fermentation parameters equivalent to those of conventional feedstuff such as tropical grasses or grains; therefore, we aimed to evaluate ruminal fermentation parameters of BCI in in vitro conditions. Three different substrates were prepared: 100% BCI (BCI diet), 100% tifton (Cynodon spp.) hay (CTL diet), and 50% tifton hay +50% BCI (THB diet). Ruminal fermentation parameters of these diets were evaluated in in vitro gas production assays. In a 24-h incubation, increased values for total gas production, organic matter degradability, and methane production were observed for BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05), while neutral THB showed the highest value for neutral detergent fiber degradability (p < 0.05).

These challenges were exacerbated by the busy and turbulent clinical environment in which they worked. To cope with various clinical situations and forms of leadership, doctors in training engage in a range of different followership behaviours and strategies.

Although the neural pathways activated by PNS have been well studied, those by MPS are still unclear. Here we investigated whether MPS activates Ia-sensory nerves and induces antidromic firing of motor nerves. Ten able-bodied males and females participated in this study. We confirmed that soleus MPS did not induce the H-reflex while soleus PNS did. Furthermore, MPS of the tibialis anterior muscle did not induce the reciprocal inhibition of soleus muscle while PNS did. For testing the effect of MPS on motor neuron excitability, we examined the H-reflex modulation by soleus MPS. When the conditioning and test interval on was under 100-ms and the conditioning stimulus intensity was above 30-mA, soleus MPS induced the H-reflex inhibition. This suggests that soleus MPS produces antidromic firing that can induce after-hyperpolarization. These results suggest that MPS predominantly activates the motor nerve without depolarizing the Ia-sensory nerve. Since MPS is applicable to larger number of muscles compared to PNS, utilizing MPS can lead to more versatile neuromodulation of the spinal cord.","Nakagawa, Kento; Bergquist, Austin J; Yamashita, Taro; Yoshida, Takashi; Masani, Kei",Neuroscience letters,153,19

METHODS Post-hoc analysis of the INTERACT2 dataset, a randomized controlled trial of patients with acute ICH with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), randomly assigned to intensive (target SBP <140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (<180 mm Hg) BP management. Patients with a sedimentation level at baseline assessment on CT, and modified Rankin Scale score at 90-day, were included in these analyses. Factors associated with a sedimentation level and its significance in relation to 90-day clinical outcomes were assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Of 2,065 participants, 19 (1%) had sedimentation level on baseline CT, which was independently associated with warfarin use (p = 0.006) and lobar ICH (p = 0.025). Sedimentation level was also associated with death or major disability at 90-day in both crude (84 vs. 53%; p = 0.014) and multivariable analyses adjusted for age, gender, Chinese region, warfarin use, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, onset to CT time, volume and location of ICH, intraventricular extension, and randomized intensive BP lowering (OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.01-15.37; p = 0.049).

Therefore, our study proposes a Distortion Correction Matrix (DCM) to correct the fine distortion of close-up mobile images, pixel by pixel. We verified the correction performance by analyzing the results of correspondence point matching in the stereo image corrected using the DCM. We also confirmed the correction results of the image taken at the five different working distances and derived a linear regression model for the relationship between the angle of the image and the distortion ratio. The proposed DCM considers the distortion degree, which appears to be different in the left and right regions of the image.

There were 26 patients (2.3%) who were admitted for inability to pass urine and 20 required catheterisation. Fifty-two patients (4.6%) were admitted for post-operative bleeding. In 32 cases the bleeding stopped spontaneously, while 19 patients required adrenaline injection and packing for hemostasis. Only one patient required surgical hemostasis. Thirty-three patients (2.9%) were admitted for post-operative pain and stayed for a median of 1 day (range 1-4 days). There were 14 patients (1.2%) who developed anorectal strictures requiring surgical intervention. All underwent anoplasty at a median of 3 months post-operatively (range 2-5 months), with good result. There were no recurrent haemorrhoids during follow-up. CONCLUSION Stapled haemorrhoidectomy using the DST EEA 33 stapler is safe. The neu@ anoscope provides good visibility and handling, and is a useful tool in this procedure.","Kam, Ming Hian; Lim, Jit Fong; Ho, Kok Sun; Ooi, Boon Swee; Eu, Kong Weng",Techniques in coloproctology,153,17

The laparoscopic approach has been the standard of care for complex or large ventral hernias for non-pregnant patients over the past decade. Despite evidence that demonstrates that laparoscopy is safe during pregnancy, there is currently no consensus regarding the indications, contraindications, patient selection and post-operative care of pregnant patients evaluated for laparoscopic ventral herniorrhaphy. METHODS The medical records of our pregnant patient who underwent laparoscopic ventral herniorrhaphy were reviewed for demographics, operative indications, surgical technique, perioperative complications, recurrence, and outcome of the pregnancy. A Medline search using the terms: laparoscopy, surgery, and pregnancy was performed to review the literature from 1997 to 2007. RESULTS This case report represents the first published description of a safe and successful laparoscopic approach to the repair of a complex ventral hernia in a woman at 21 weeks gestation. The discussion reviews the current literature regarding the safety of laparoscopy in pregnant women and highlights techniques to reduce perioperative morbidity and risk to the fetus. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair can be safe during pregnancy with appropriate fetal monitoring and consideration of physiologic changes that occur during parturition. Elective procedures should be delayed until after delivery and all semi-elective surgeries until organogenesis is completed during the second trimester.","Wai, P Y; Ruby, J A; Davis, K A; Roberts, A C; Roberts, K E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,153,12

However, the effect of varying wave periods of COVID-19 on in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for non-COVID disease for non-COVID diseases remains unexplored. METHODS We examined a territory-wide observational cohort of 563,680 emergency admissions between January 1 and November 30, 2020, and 709,583 emergency admissions during the same 2019 period in Hong Kong, China. Differences in 28-day in-hospital mortality risk and LOS due to COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of 28-day in-hospital mortality increased overall from 2.9% in 2019 to 3.6% in 2020 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.22, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.25). The aHR was higher among patients with lower respiratory tract infection (aHR: 1.30 95% CI 1.26 to 1.34), airway disease (aHR: 1.35 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49), and mental disorders (aHR: 1.26 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37). Mortality risk in the first- and third-wave periods was significantly greater than that in the inter-wave period (p-interaction < 0.001). The overall average LOS in the pandemic year was significantly shorter than that in 2019 (Mean difference = -0.40 days; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.36). Patients with mental disorders and cerebrovascular disease in 2020 had a 3.91-day and 2.78-day shorter LOS than those in 2019, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increased risk of in-hospital deaths was observed overall and by all major subgroups of disease during the pandemic period. Together with significantly reduced LOS for patients with mental disorders and cerebrovascular disease, this study shows the spillover effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xiong, Xi; Wai, Abraham K C; Wong, Janet Y H; Tang, Eric H M; Chu, Owen C K; Wong, Carlos K H; Rainer, Timothy H",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,153,1

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery was developed with the aim of decreasing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 3-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS From February 2014 to September 2016, 187 patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis were randomized to a single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (89 patients) or a 3-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (98 patients). The primary outcomes were a postoperative pain score (at 6 hours and 1 day) and patients of complications, while the secondary outcomes were operative time, estimated blood loss, opioid requirements, duration of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction with aesthetic effects. RESULTS When comparing 3-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there were differences in the (mean ± standard deviation) operative time (58.9 ± 18.6 minutes vs 45.2 ± 11.8 minutes; P < .001), success rate (93% vs 99%; P < .01), conversion rate (7% vs 1%; P < .001), and aesthetic score (7.9 ± 1.6 vs 6.7 ± 1.4; P = .008). There were no statistically significant differences in estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, opioid requirement, complications, and hospital stay between both groups. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible procedure in selected patients. The main advantage is the superior aesthetic results, while the main disadvantage is a greater operative time with some technical difficulties.","Omar, Mohammed A; Redwan, Alaa A; Mahmoud, Ahmed G",Surgery,153,24

We describe the switch from in-person didactic sessions to videoconferencing in a Neurology department. We analyse the opinions and satisfaction of participants. MATERIAL AND METHODS Narrative description of the adopted measures; Online survey among participants. RESULTS One of the three weekly sessions was cancelled, and two switched to videoconferencing. There were more participants online than in the conference hall. 49 users answered the survey, 51% women, mean age 40.5 years (range 25-65). Satisfaction was higher for previous face-to-face meetings (8.68) than for videoconferencing (8.12) (p=0.006). There was a significant inverse correlation between age and satisfaction with virtual sessions (r=-0.37; p=0.01), that was not found for in-person attendance. Most users (75.5%) would prefer to continue with online sessions when the pandemic is over, and 87.8% support inter-hospital remote meetings, but the safety of web platforms is a concern (53.1%). CONCLUSIONS The change from in-person to virtual sessions is an easy measure to implement in a neurology department, with a good degree of satisfaction among users. There are some unsolved problems with the use of commercial web platforms and inter-hospital connection.

Here we describe the functional properties of hexamethylene amiloride (HMA)-derived compounds that inhibit the wild-type and adamantane-resistant forms of the influenza A M2 ion channel. For example, 6-(azepan-1-yl)-N-carbamimidoylnicotinamide ( 9: ) inhibits amantadine-sensitive M2 currents with 3- to 6-fold greater potency than amantadine or HMA (IC50 = 0.2 vs. 0.6 and 1.3 µM, respectively). Compound 9: competes with amantadine for M2 inhibition, and molecular docking simulations suggest that 9: binds at site(s) that overlap with amantadine binding. In addition, tert-butyl 4'-(carbamimidoylcarbamoyl)-2',3-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylate ( 27: ) acts both on adamantane-sensitive and a resistant M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N) with improved efficacy over amantadine and HMA (IC50 = 0.6 µM and 4.4 µM, respectively). Whereas 9: inhibited in vitro replication of influenza virus encoding wild-type M2 (EC50 = 2.3 µM), both 27: and tert-butyl 4'-(carbamimidoylcarbamoyl)-2',3-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxylate ( 26: ) preferentially inhibited viruses encoding M2(S31N) (respective EC50 = 18.0 and 1.5 µM). This finding indicates that HMA derivatives can be designed to inhibit viruses with resistance to amantadine. Our study highlights the potential of HMA derivatives as inhibitors of drug-resistant influenza M2 ion channels.","Jalily, Pouria H; Eldstrom, Jodene; Miller, Scott C; Kwan, Daniel C; Tai, Sheldon S-H; Chou, Doug; Niikura, Masahiro; Tietjen, Ian; Fedida, David",Molecular pharmacology,153,1

Recently, we reported that esophageal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a crucial role in the generation of heartburn. In the present study, we focused on the PGE2 receptor, EP1, and investigated the effects of ONO-8539, a novel EP1 receptor antagonist, on heartburn symptoms in healthy male volunteers. METHODS This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study was performed in 20 healthy male subjects. The novel prostanoid EP1 receptor antagonist, ONO-8539 (450 mg), was administered once 4 h prior to acid perfusion test. During the test, hydrochloric acid (0.15 mol l-1) was perfused into the lower esophagus for 30 min. Acid perception threshold was quantified by the time to first sensation of heartburn and intensity of GI symptoms determined using a validated categorical rating scale, and the area under the curve (AUC) as the total symptom score. RESULTS ONO-8539 significantly reduced a total heartburn symptom score, not other upper GI symptom scores, during acid perfusion compared with placebo (AUC for heartburn, 85.0 ± 10.6 for placebo and 56.5 ± 7.2 for ONO-8539; P < 0.01), and significantly extended the time to first sensation of heartburn compared with placebo (5.7 ± 4.3 min for placebo and 9.7 ± 7.2 min for ONO-8539; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS ONO-8539 attenuated acid-induced heartburn in healthy male subjects, suggesting that EP1 receptors play a role in generation of heartburn symptoms. ONO-8539 is a potential novel therapeutic option for controlling heartburn symptoms in GERD patients.

Improving safe sexual communication (SSC) could enable women to accurately assess and mitigate their risk of infection within their relationship. Literature to identify psychosocial correlates that facilitate or inhibit SSC between Latina women and their partners has not yet been synthesized. The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrative review and synthesis of empirical and theoretical research that examines psychosocial correlates of SSC among adult Latina women from the United States, Latina America, and the Caribbean with stable male partners. A systematic search of LILACS, EBSCO, and PsychInfo databases was conducted to identify qualitative and quantitative studies that investigated psychosocial correlates of SSC among adult Latina women with a stable male partner. Pertinent data were abstracted and quality of individual studies was appraised. A qualitative synthesis was conducted following Miles and Huberman's method. Five qualitative and three quantitative studies meet eligibility criteria. Factors related to SSC related to three main themes: (1) relationship factors such as length, quality, and power/control, (2) individual factors including attitudes, beliefs, background, behaviors, and intrapersonal characteristics, and (3) partner factors related to partner beliefs and behaviors. The interplay of relationship, individual, and partner factors should be considered in the assessment of SSC for Latina women with their stable partners. To inform future interventions and clinical guidelines, additional research is needed to identify which factors are most related to SSC for this population, and how comparable experiences are for Latina women of different subcultures and living in different countries.","Luft, Heidi; Larson, Elaine",AIDS care,153,16

The primary aim of the UIH/MSHC testing project was to increase testing capacity in the most affected, racial/ethnic minority communities. More than 7,500 tests were performed over a six-month period. Half of those who were tested were Black and Latinx residents. The majority of those tested at the Walk-Up sites were Black, while ""Other"" race group tended to get tested in Drive Thru testing sites. Latinx residents had the highest positivity rate, followed by Other race group. Younger age groups were more likely to have higher positivity rates. Overall, UH/MSHC testing results reflected the overall Chicago COVID-19 testing results. Our findings substantiate the need to advocate for equitable resource allocation to counter the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection among minority communities.

Conflicting results exist whether high-altitude exposure impairs LV diastolic function and thus contributes to the high altitude-induced increase in systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and reduction in stroke volume (SV). This study aimed to assess LV diastolic function, LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and LA mechanics using comprehensive echocardiographic imaging in healthy volunteers at 4559 m. Fifty subjects performed rapid (<20 hours) and active ascent from 1130 m to 4559 m (high). All participants underwent echocardiography during baseline examination at 424 m (low) as well as 7, 20 and 44 hours after arrival at high altitude. Heart rate (HR), sPAP, and comprehensive volumetric- and Doppler- as well as speckle tracking-derived LA strain parameters were obtained to assess LV diastolic function, LA mechanics, and LVEDP in a multiparametric approach. Data for final analyses were available in 46 subjects. HR (low: 64 ± 11 vs high: 79 ± 14 beats/min, P < 0.001) and sPAP (low: 24.4 ± 3.8 vs high: 38.5 ± 8.2 mm Hg, P < 0.001) increased following ascent and remained elevated at high altitude. Stroke volume (low: 64.5 ± 15.0 vs high: 58.1 ± 16.4 mL, P < 0.001) and EDV decreased following ascent and remained decreased at high altitude due to decreased LV passive filling volume, whereas LA mechanics were preserved. There was no case of LV diastolic dysfunction or increased LVEDP estimates. In summary, this study shows that rapid and active ascent of healthy individuals to 4559 m impairs passive filling and SV of the LV. These alterations were not related to changes in LV and LA mechanics.","Sareban, Mahdi; Perz, Tabea; Macholz, Franziska; Reich, Bernhard; Schmidt, Peter; Fried, Sebastian; Mairbäurl, Heimo; Berger, Marc M; Niebauer, Josef",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,153,30

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In May and June 2020, Australian residents who believed themselves eligible to donate blood responded to measures assessing constructs from an integrated protection motivation theory, organizational trust, and theory of planned behavior framework, with donor status also assessed. RESULTS A total of 507 residents (47% male, mean age 28.69 years; 272 had donated/attempted to donate) participated. A revised structural equation model was a good fit to these data. In this model, perceived risk, severity, anxiety, and response cost associated with donating during the COVID-19 pandemic underpinned threat appraisals, while response efficacy, self-efficacy, and attitude toward donating during COVID-19 informed coping appraisals. Trust in the BCA predicted lower threat and higher coping appraisals, and higher coping appraisals predicted stronger subjective norms. Intention to donate during the COVID-19 pandemic was positively predicted by subjective norm and self-efficacy. Donation-related behavior was positively predicted by intention, with this relationship stronger for nondonors than donors. CONCLUSION Self-efficacy and approval from others, underpinned by coping appraisals and organizational trust, play a critical role in intentions to donate. BCAs that focus on maintaining trust with (potential) donors, providing clear messaging stating the minimal threat of contracting COVID-19 from donating and the protective measures in place, and showing how donating is achievable, may help to ensure a safe and secure blood supply throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Masser, Barbara M; Hyde, Melissa K; Ferguson, Eamonn",Transfusion,153,7

A more complete understanding of the symptom frequency and burden in naturally occurring colds is needed. METHODOLOGY We characterized common cold symptoms from 226 cold episodes experienced by 104 male or female subjects. Subjects were enrolled in the work environment in an attempt to start symptom evaluation (frequency and severity) at the earliest sign of their cold. We also assessed the symptom that had the greatest impact on the subject by asking them to identify their single most bothersome symptom. RESULTS Symptom reporting started within 24 hours of cold onset for most subjects. Sore throat was a harbinger of the illness but was accompanied by multiple symptoms, including nasal congestion, runny nose and headache. Cough was not usually the most frequent symptom, but was present throughout the cold, becoming most bothersome later in the cold. Nasal congestion, pain (eg, sore throat, headache, muscle pains) or feverishness and secretory symptoms (eg, runny nose, sneezing), and even cough, were simultaneously experienced with high incidence over the first 4 days of illness. The single most bothersome symptom was sore throat on day 1, followed by nasal congestion on days 2-5 and cough on days 6 and 7. CONCLUSION There is substantial overlap in the appearance of common cold symptoms over the first several days of the common cold. Nasal congestion, secretory and pain symptoms frequently occur together, with cough being somewhat less prominent, but quite bothersome when present. These data establish the typical symptomatology of a common cold and provide a foundation for the rational treatment of cold symptoms typically experienced by cold sufferers.","Witek, Theodore J; Ramsey, David L; Carr, Andrew N; Riker, Donald K",Rhinology,153,8

METHODS A retrospective chart review examined outcomes of 1240 laparoscopic hernia operations in 783 patients, focusing on intraoperative and early postoperative complications, pain, and time until return to work and normal physical activities. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications in this series; 106 patients experienced early postoperative complications across 8 evaluated categories: urinary retention (4.1%), seroma (3.0%), testicular/hemiscrotal swelling (1.9%), testicular atrophy (0%), hydrocele (0.6%), mesh infection (0.1%), and neurological symptoms (transient, 1.0%; persistent, 0.2%). Patients used an average of 5.6 Percocet pills after the procedure, and mean times until return to work and normal activities, including their routine exercise regimen, were 3.0 and 3.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSION Complication rates and convalescence times were considered equivalent or superior to those found in other studies assessing both laparoscopic and open techniques. The usage of multiple Endostaples did not result in increased neurologic complications in the early postoperative period when compared with findings in the literature. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, total extraperitoneal repair is a safe, effective alternative to open inguinal hernia repair.","Reiner, Mark A; Bresnahan, Erin R",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,153,1

The shifting demographic of surgery trainees, lifestyle issues and an increased trend toward subspecialization are the major influences. To guide these important educational initiatives, a contemporary profile of Canadian general surgery residents and their impressions of training in Canada is required. METHODS We developed and distributed a questionnaire to residents in each Canadian general surgery training program, and residents responded during dedicated teaching time. RESULTS In all, 186 surveys were returned for analysis (62% response rate). The average age of Canadian general surgery residents is 30 years, 38% are women, 41% are married, 18% have dependants younger than 18 years and 41% plan to add to or start a family during residency. Most (87%) residents plan to pursue postgraduate education. On completion of training, 74% of residents plan to stay in Canada and 49% want to practice in an academic setting. Almost half (42%) of residents identify a poor balance between work and personal life during residency.

Investigation of these regulatory proteins is uncovering not just the mechanisms that underlie gene regulation, but relationships that apply to all intrinsically disordered proteins. Recent studies confirm that binding does not necessarily induce folding but that when it does, it tends to follow induced fit mechanisms. Other work emphasises the importance of electrostatics to interactions involving intrinsically disordered proteins, and roles of intrinsic disorder in phase transitions. All these features help direct transcription factors to target sites in the genome to upregulate or downregulate transcription.","Smith, Ngaio C; Kuravsky, Mikhail; Shammas, Sarah L; Matthews, Jacqueline M",Current opinion in structural biology,153,1

Currently numerous drugs are under expedited investigations without well-established safety or efficacy data. Pharmacogenomics may allow individualization of these drugs thereby improving efficacy and safety. In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic literature available for COVID-19 drug therapies including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, interferon beta-1b, tocilizumab, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and corticosteroids. We searched PubMed, reviewed the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB®) website, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pharmacogenomics information in the product labeling, and the FDA pharmacogenomics association table. We found several drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, SLCO1A2, and SLCO1B1); azithromycin (ABCB1); ribavirin (SLC29A1, SLC28A2, and SLC28A3); and lopinavir/ritonavir (SLCO1B1, ABCC2, CYP3A). We also identified other variants, that are associated with adverse effects, most notable in hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (G6PD; hemolysis), ribavirin (ITPA; hemolysis), and interferon β -1b (IRF6; liver toxicity). We also describe the complexity of the risk for QT prolongation in this setting because of additive effects of combining more than one QT-prolonging drug (i.e., hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and azithromycin), increased concentrations of the drugs due to genetic variants, along with the risk of also combining therapy with potent inhibitors. In conclusion, although direct evidence in COVID-19 patients is lacking, we identified potential actionable genetic markers in COVID-19 therapies. Clinical studies in COVID-19 patients are deemed warranted to assess potential roles of these markers.","Takahashi, Takuto; Luzum, Jasmine A; Nicol, Melanie R; Jacobson, Pamala A",NPJ genomic medicine,153,1

The findings of eye strain, tired eyes, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision and double vision, when appearing together, have recently been termed 'computer vision syndrome', or asthenopia. To examine the frequency and intensity of asthenopia among individuals employed in research and development departments of high-tech firms and the effects of job stress and burnout on ocular complaints, this study included 106 subjects, 42 high-tech workers (study group) and 64 bank employees (control group). All participants completed self-report questionnaires covering demographics, asthenopia, satisfaction with work environmental conditions, job-related stress and burnout. There was a significant between-group difference in the intensity of asthenopia, but not in its frequency. Burnout appeared to be a significant contributing factor to the intensity and frequency of asthenopia. This study shows that burnout is a significant factor in asthenopic complaints in high-tech workers. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY This manuscript analyses the effects of psychological environmental factors, such as job stress and burnout, on ocular complaints at the workplace of computer users. The findings may have an ergonomic impact on how to improve health, safety and comfort of the working environment among computer users, for better perception of the job environment, efficacy and production.","Ostrovsky, Anat; Ribak, Joseph; Pereg, Avihu; Gaton, Dan",Ergonomics,153,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether centhaquin improves 24-h survival and reduces the total volume of required fluids in an established model of swine hemorrhagic shock. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five pigs were instrumented and subjected to hemorrhagic shock. The animals were randomly allocated in two experimental groups, the control (vehicle) (n = 10) and the centhaquin groups (0.015 mg/kg, n = 10); all animals received lactated Ringer solution in the resuscitation phase until their mean arterial pressure reached 90% of the baseline. A sham group (n = 5) was added a posteriori to mimic the hemodynamic profile of the centhaquin group. RESULTS A statistically significant difference was observed in the time required for the three groups to reach their target mean aortic pressure, 36.88 ± 3.26 min for the control group versus 9.40 ± 1.01 min for the sham group and 7.10 ± 0.97 min for the centhaquin group (P < 0.001). The total amount of fluids in the control and the sham groups was significantly higher when compared with that of the centhaquin-treated animals (P < 0.001). All 10 animals in the centhaquin group survived for 24 h, whereas only three animals survived in the control group and one animal in the sham group (P = 0.002).

It has the potential to enhance the production, accessibility and utilisation of routine health information for clinical and service management decision-making. It is important to understand the range of definitions and concepts of data harmonisation, as well as how its various social and technical components and processes are thought to lead to better health management decision-making. However, there is lack of agreement in the literature, and in practice, on definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation, making it difficult for health system decision-makers and researchers to design, implement, evaluate and compare data harmonisation interventions. This scoping review aims to synthesise (1) definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation as well as (2) explanations in the literature of the causal relationships between data harmonisation and health management decision-making. METHODS This review follows recommended methodological stages for scoping studies. We will identify relevant studies (peer-reviewed and grey literature) from 2000 onwards, in English only, and with no methodological restriction, in various electronic databases, such as CINAHL, MEDLINE via PubMed and Global Health. Two reviewers will independently screen records for potential inclusion for the abstract and full-text screening stages. One reviewer will do the data extraction, analysis and synthesis, with built-in reliability checks from the rest of the team. We will use a combination of sampling techniques, including two types of 'purposeful sampling', a methodological approach that is particularly suitable for a scoping review with our objectives. We will provide (a) a numerical synthesis of characteristics of the included studies and (b) a narrative synthesis of definitions and explanations in the literature of the relationship between data harmonisation and health management decision-making. DISCUSSION We list potential limitations of this scoping review. To our knowledge, this scoping review will be the first to synthesise definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation in the literature as well as the underlying explanations in the literature of the causal links between data harmonisation and health management decision-making.","Schmidt, Bey-Marrié; Colvin, Christopher J; Hohlfeld, Ameer; Leon, Natalie",Systematic reviews,153,1

However, the mechanisms of action remain unclear. Placebo effects contribute to the efficacy of face-to-face mental health interventions and may also be a potential mechanism of action in smartphone-based interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate whether different types of efficacy expectancies as potential factors underlying placebo effects could be successfully induced in a smartphone-based digital placebo mental health intervention, ostensibly targeting mood and stress. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, superiority trial with a multi-arm parallel design. Participants underwent an Android smartphone-based digital placebo mental health intervention for 20 days. We induced prospective efficacy expectancies via initial instructions on the purpose of the intervention and retrospective efficacy expectancies via feedback on the success of the intervention at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. A total of 132 healthy participants were randomized to a prospective expectancy-only condition (n=33), a retrospective expectancy-only condition (n=33), a combined expectancy condition (n=34), or a control condition (n=32). As the endpoint, we assessed changes in efficacy expectancies with the Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire, before the intervention and on days 1, 7, 14, and 20. For statistical analyses, we used a random effects model for the intention-to-treat sample, with intervention day as time variable and condition as two factors: prospective expectancy (yes vs no) and retrospective expectancy (yes vs no), allowed to vary over participant and intervention day. RESULTS Credibility (β=-1.63; 95% CI -2.37 to -0.89; P<.001) and expectancy (β=-0.77; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.05; P=.04) decreased across the intervention days. For credibility and expectancy, we found significant three-way interactions: intervention day×prospective expectancy×retrospective expectancy (credibility: β=2.05; 95% CI 0.60-3.50; P=.006; expectancy: β=1.55; 95% CI 0.14-2.95; P=.03), suggesting that efficacy expectancies decreased least in the combined expectancy condition and the control condition. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study investigating whether efficacy expectancies can be successfully induced in a specifically designed placebo smartphone-based mental health intervention. Our findings may pave the way to diminish or exploit digital placebo effects and help to improve the efficacy of digital mental health interventions.

In this setting, apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis may operate on a continuum. Because the latter is characterized by the loss of sarcolemmal integrity, we propose that an appropriately labeled tracer directed at a ubiquitously present intracellular moiety would allow non-invasive definition of cardiomyocyte necrosis. A trivalent arsenic peptide, GSAO (4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino)phenylarsonous acid), is capable of binding to intracellular dithiol molecules such as HSP90 and filamin-A. Since GSAO is membrane impermeable and dithiol molecules abundantly present intracellularly, we propose that myocardial localization would represent sarcolemmal disruption or necrotic cell death.

Compared with two gender-matched unaffected sibling carriers of similar ages, the index PD patient with DJ-1 deficiency showed a decline in many critical immunoaging features, including almost doubled frequencies of non-senescent T cells. The observation of a ‘younger’ immune system in the index patient was further consolidated by the results in aged DJ-1 knockout mice. Our data from bone marrow chimera models and adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that DJ-1 regulates several immunoaging features via hematopoietic-intrinsic and naïve-CD8-intrinsic mechanisms.

However, it is not clear whether these apps are always beneficial or effective in what they aim to do; for instance, the overuse of restriction and surveillance has been found to undermine parent-child relationship and children's sense of autonomy. In this work, we investigate this gap, asking specifically: how might children's and parents' perceptions be related to how parental control features were designed? To investigate this question, we conducted an analysis of 58 top Android parental control apps designed for the purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised: granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our findings within existing digital parenting theories.","Wang, Ge; Zhao, Jun; Kleek, Max Van; Shadbolt, Nigel",,153,1

This single-center experience outlines the considerations our hospital took into account when planning for this restructure and the steps taken to ensure a successful execution of the task. Cross-specialty collaboration between the pediatric and adult critical care teams adopted a unique approach to care for only critically ill COVID-19 positive adult patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), transferring out critically unwell children at an early stage before the adult intensive care unit (AICU) became overwhelmed (nonhybrid model). This was designed to be in a staggered fashion, before allowing the AICU to overflow. This approach enabled the adult critical care team to support pediatric colleagues in learning the nuances of looking after critically ill adults prior to the service being saturated by the predicted supersurge. The success of the operation hinged on two things. First, PICU staff continuing to work in a familiar environment with their usual clinical team and second, the gradual and controlled admission of adult patients into PICU before the peak in demand for critical care beds. This design helped protect staff morale and build confidence in their new clinical role. The overall case fatality of invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in our hospital during the first surge was 32%, which is lower than the global average of 45%. This serves as evidence that this nonhybrid model is safe and sustainable.","Holliday, K.; Horner, R.; Ramesh, P.; Bebbington, M. B.; Kanaris, C.",Journal of Pediatric Intensive Care,153,28

Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons. Our results provide important mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could affect the nervous system circuitries causing neurological symptoms.","Martinez-Marmol, Ramon; Giordano-Santini, Rosina; Kaulich, Eva; Cho, Ann-Na; Riyadh, Md Asrafuzzaman; Robinson, Emilija; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Meunier, Frédéric A.; Ke, Yazi D.; Ittner, Lars M.; Hilliard, Massimo A.",bioRxiv,153,26

An empirical study was carried out with a large sample of children and adolescents in Galicia, Spain (N = 2083), where 10–17 year olds were presented with The European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire and European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire. School bullying was found to be more prevalent than cyberbullying, with 25.1% involved as victims and 14.3% as bully-victims, while the cyberbullying rates were 9.4% for victims and 5.8% for bully-victims. Perpetration rates were similar for school and cyberbullying (4.4% and 4.3% respectively).

Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accordingly, this study sought to determine whether service quality differences among ships operating in the Asian market could suggest broader implications for the sustainability of the cruise industry. We chose the SERVQUAL framework for the analysis;we also employed the multiple case study method and topic synthesis to compare the service quality of three ships. Of the ships investigated—the Costa Victoria, Diamond Princess, and Superstar Virgo—the Diamond Princess had the highest service quality. Based on the results, we outlined suggestions for improving the quality of cruise services, including introducing the latest large ships and high-tech facilities, complying with the departure and arrival times of sailing schedules, improving the ratio of crew members per passenger, establishing a cruise personnel training system, and expanding membership program operations.","Yoon, Yeohyun Kyoung Cheon Cha",Sustainability,153,32

Breast and cervical cancers are the major leading cancers in females, both of which are curable with access to timely and effective care. To meet population health goals, early abnormalities of the cervix and breast must be treated promptly to maximize the chance for cure. The AMPATH Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Program (ABCCCP) was initiated to improve access to screening and diagnostic services for breast and cervical cancer in Kenya by addressing the barriers of cancer care through a population health approach, working with communities and the Ministry of Health in Kenya with a potential for scaling these efforts to other parts of the region. Methods: We performed an interim analysis 3 years into a 5-year program, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our screening program. Statistical descriptive summaries were used to show the trend of screening using visual inspection with acetic acid and breast clinical examination. The screening was conducted facility-based along with community screening upon requests across nine counties. Also, we conducted capacity building through mentoring of health care providers and initiating a telemedicine program to improve patient care and management plans. Results:From 2018-2021, we conducted training, connected 12 centers with telemedicine capacity and screened a total of 100,973 persons were for breast and cervical cancer. The yearly trends demonstrate that the facility routine screenings were maintained: 23,421 (2018);27,997 (2019);and 28,045 (2020). The total women seen through organized mass screenings however declined (10,304 (2018);10,107 (2019);and 1,099 (2020), respectively) as this type of screening was stopped after the onset of COVID- 19 pandemic. Of all women screened, 3,019 (2.98%) had clinical abnormalities requiring followup per standard of care including 1,781(1.8%) who were eventually histologically confirmed to have cancer. During our first and second year of the program, 83 physicians were trained on cancer management and treatment, 341 nurses were trained on breast and cervical cancer screening procedures, and 247 community health workers (CHW) were trained on the importance of screening to enlighten the community on awareness. However, this training was suspended in our year three due to COVID- 19. Conclusions: An integrated training program utilizing CHW, nurses and physicians are an effective means for breast and cervical cancer screening in LMC, such as Kenya. This capacity building allows flexibility and sustainability even in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We also demonstrated successful integration with the county government for program sustainability. The use of telemedicine has greatly enhanced our screening and patient care across several facilities in western Kenya.","Kiptoo, S.; Busakhala, N. W.; Itsura, P.; Tonui, P.; Vik, T.; Loehrer, P.

We distinguish between immunopathological costs due to collateral damage and autoimmune costs due to false positives against self. Selection on sensitivity follows different trajectories depending on the cost nature and the overlap degree between host- and parasitic molecular signatures. Increased parasite virulence selects for higher immune sensitivity under immunopathological costs but low sensitivity when the costs are autoimmune, contradicting previous theoretical results. Longer lifespan of the host selects for low sensitivity under immunopathology to avoid accumulated tissue damage. Under autoimmune costs, hosts with a shorter lifespan cannot afford to shorten it further due to autoimmunity and evolve lower immune sensitivity. Longer lifespan selects for high or low sensitivity depending on the presence of immune memory. These results extend our understanding of selection on immune sensitivity and help explain phenomena like the cytokine shock and chronic infections.","Aldakak, Lafi; Rühli, Frank; Galipaud, Matthias; Bender, Nicole",bioRxiv,153,1

However, their production is associated with pollution among which is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Livestock contributes 80% of the total GHG emission from agricultural sector. These emissions are originated from enteric fermentations and manure management. Emissions from manure management are mostly Nitrous oxide. Five (5) sources of N2O emission from livestock were identified and are dung and urine from grazing animals deposited in pastures, indirect sources, animal wastes in stables and storages, application of animal wastes to land and burning of dung with emission proportion of 41, 27, 19, 10 and 3% respectively. IPCC developed methods for estimation N2O emission designated as Tier 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

This paper aimed to uncover some of the responses of Morocco’s agricultural sector to the pandemic and the low rainfall, with a focus on potential opportunities for improvement. Under the increasing recurrence of crises and shocks, systems and organisations are becoming obligated to develop resilience. The Moroccan agricultural system is expected to become more resilient to climate change-induced extremes and the volatility of global food product markets while decreasing its dependence on the international agro-inputs supply chain. Moreover, Morocco’s agricultural system should learn to evolve under uncertainty. To succeed in this task, a high level of agility is required across all components of its value chain. Specific leadership and mechanisms should be set up to increase the system's agility in responding to the unpredictable climate and consumer habits;research and development can play an important role in this.

Such targeting is potentially contentious, so rigorously quantifying its benefits and downsides is critical for designing effective and equitable pandemic control policies. We propose a flexible modeling framework and a set of associated algorithms that compute optimally targeted, time-dependent interventions that coordinate across two dimensions of heterogeneity: population group characteristics and the specific activities that individuals engage in during the normal course of a day. We showcase a complete implementation in a case study focused on the Ile-de-France region of France, based on commonly available hospitalization, community mobility, social contacts and economic data. We find that optimized dual-targeted policies have a simple and explainable structure, imposing less confinement on group-activity pairs that generate a relatively high economic value prorated by activity-specific social contacts. When compared to confinements based on uniform or less granular targeting, dual-targeted policies generate substantial complementarities that lead to Pareto improvements, reducing the number of deaths and the economic losses overall and reducing the time in confinement foreach population group. Since dual-targeted policies could lead to increased discrepancies in the confinements faced by distinct groups, we also quantify the impact of requirements that explicitly limit such disparities, and find that satisfactory intermediate trade-offs may be achievable through limited targeting.","Camelo, S.; Ciocan, D.

In today’s world, where dealing with COVID 19 pandemic has become need of the hour, availability of critical data and transmitting information between various nodes can be lifesaving. The need for setting up an ad hoc network in a remote area or a hotspot point would help in sending and receiving information with least human intervention. To have a proper ad hoc network setup that relays critical data or information, it is necessary that the system provides good quality of service (QoS) parameters such as least error, good packet delivery ratio, and minimum delay. QoS parameters depend on routing protocols which transmit information between various nodes. Ad hoc networks mainly employ reactive routing protocols that provide routes between nodes as and when required. Applying artificial intelligence techniques with various routing protocols enhances monitoring and recognition of devices leading to better QoS parameters. This paper focusses on the study and application of various routing protocols in an ad hoc network setup in a critical area. Also, the advantage of the artificial intelligence technique on routing protocols is discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Rao, M.","2nd International Conference on Emerging Technologies in Data Mining and Information Security, IEMIS 2020",153,24

Still, there’s no specific drug or preventive medication to treat ZIKA infection despite comprehensive analysis by the researchers. This study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of some plant derived bioactive compounds against ZIKV by using both structure and ligand based virtual screening methods. A number of 35 plant metabolites were screened against ZIKA NS2B-NS3 protease (5LC0), Envelop protein (5JHM), Capsid protein (5YGH) and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein (5U04) employing molecular docking approach. Results showed that there have been four metabolites, i.e. Chicoric acid, Luteone, Reserpine and Rosmarinic acid provide highest binding affinity to targeted ZIKV proteins. Crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots are unraveled for every targeted viral protein. The ADME study showed that neither of the candidate compounds had side effects that would reduce their drug-like properties. As compared, the toxicity pattern analysis has unmasked the non-toxic essence of top drug candidates. The RMSD values of ligand-macromolecule complexes were 2 Å apart from Envelop protein- Chicoric Acid, although the RMSF values showed normal atomic fluctuations within the molecular dynamics analysis, with the exception of Envelop protein- Chicoric Acid. The expected majority of the target class the highest drug candidates is enzyme classes (e.g. protease, hydrolase, phosphatase). In addition, the drug similarity prediction revealed several structural analogs from drugbank such as Isoformononetin (DB04202), Deserpidine (DB01089) and Rescinnamine (DB01180) etc. and these analogs could even be an option for the treatment of ZIKV infections.

In the current study, we demonstrate the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of fit test performance of N95 respirators following treatment with dry heat. We apply scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements to analyze filter material changes as a consequence of different decontamination treatments. We further compared the integrity of the respirator after autoclaving versus dry heat treatment via quantitative fit testing and found that autoclaving, but not dry heat, causes the fit of the respirator onto the users face to fail, thereby rendering the decontaminated respirator unusable.

The city of Melbourne was hardest hit during the pandemic and experienced the strictest and longest lockdown worldwide. Religious and spiritual groups were especially affected, given the prohibition of gatherings of people for religious services and yoga classes with a spiritual orientation, for example. Fault lines in socio-economic differences were also pronounced, with low-wage and casual workers often from cultural and religious minorities being particularly vulnerable to the virus in their often precarious workplaces. In addition, some religious and spiritual individuals and groups did not comply and actively resisted restrictions at times. By contrast, the pandemic also resulted in a positive re-engagement with religion and spirituality, as lockdown measures served to accelerate a digital push with activities shifting to online platforms. Religious and spiritual efforts were initiated online and offline to promote wellbeing and to serve those most in need. This article presents an analysis of media representations of religious, spiritual and non-religious responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia, from January to August 2020, including two periods of lockdown. It applies a mixed-method quantitative and qualitative thematic approach, using targeted keywords identified in previous international and Australian media research.

Out of 19 having been discharged, 8 were willing to be re-evaluated. On second evaluation 6 months later, serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highly positive, although at lower titers compared to the titers at disease onset (median [range]) 8.705 (range: 7.95-9.56) vs 6.640 (range: 6.29-6.76), p=0.0002, Mann-Whitney test. Initially 3 out of 8 patients expressed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at titers 1/160, 1/320 and 1/320 with a fine speckled pattern with the second patient also expressing at a titer of 1/160, antimitochondrial (AMA) antibodies. Six months later the same patients and not anyone else expressed ANA of the same pattern at titers 1/640, 1/160 and 1/160 respectively. Two patients with 1/20 p-ANCA and 1/640 c-ANCA initially, lost their respective autoantibodies after 6 months. One patient initially negative for IgM anti-β2GPI became positive at low titer and an initially positive became negative. One patient initially positive for anti-Ro60 antibody continued to be positive 6 months later. One patient initially negative developed anti-Tg antibodies and 3 patients initially positive for anti-TPO antibodies remained positive 6 months later. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 survived after ICU admission still retain high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies but significantly lower that at disease onset, but they tend to lose autoantibodies with pathogenic potential.","Bitzogli, K.; Magira, E.; Chatzis, L.; Jahaj, E.; Alexopoulos, H.; Dalakas, M.; Kotanidou, A.; Tzioufas, A.; Vlachoyiannopoulos, P.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,153,5

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of RT-CGM use. Methods: Blood Glucose (BG) data were collected from the electronic medical record and the Dexcom system on 165 patients treated on DEXCOM CGM from June to December using a preapproved protocol. Retrospective chart review was performed on 60 patients on vasopressors and dialysis. Analysis included glycemic control, hypoglycemia rate, and correlation between finger stick (FS) and RT-CGM BG. Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCC) and MARD were calculated. Strong correlation was defined as a PCC value of > 0.7. Results: Of the > 300,000 BG readings from DEXCOM, 81 % were between 70-180 mg/dl;12 % between 180-250mg/dl;and 5% were > 250 mg/dl. The incidence of hypoglycemia was low, 0.8% values being between 55 - 69 mg/dL and 0.5% being < 55 mg/dL. Of the 2016 readings used for correlation, the PCC between FS and RT-CGM glucose was 0.838 with a MARD of 14%. PCC was 0.798 for patients on vasopressors and 0.79 for dialysis Patients. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, Dexcom CGM utilization was safe with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and good correlation to FS blood glucose. CGM utilization decreased the frequency of FS for most patients, and was well accepted by the clinical team.","Joshi, Renu Snell Vanessa M.; Good, Karen L.; Wert, Yijin Helmuth Amy M.",Diabetes,153,24

We surveyed 1200 Koreans, and then six months later re-surveyed 840 people among those who participated in the first survey. We built a structural equation model that was configured of five latent variables: COVID-19-related, self-isolation, destination condition, level of preventive measures in the airport/aircraft, and social perception. We performed paired sample t-test, multi-group analysis, and latent mean analysis for two divided groups, based on the survey period. We found that the perception structure on resuming air transportation use over time during the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed, though a significant change has occurred in the responses to the measured and latent variables. In particular, a high variation was found in the awareness of COVID-19-related factors and social perceptions, and we suggest continuous monitoring of the related factors to preemptively respond to the recovery of air transport demand. On the other hand, we propose proactive level setting and the maintaining of sanitary conditions of the destination and preventive measures in the airport/aircraft.

In Latin America, COVID19 had its first case in the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil, thus being the starting point and epicenter of this disease. In this context, prostate cancer (PC) is the most common nonskin cancer among men and its preventive healthcare is substantial to public health surveillance. Additionally, PC raises particular interest during COVID-19 outbreak as PC androgen-deprivation therapies have shown to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggests an association between SARS-CoV-2 and PC cells. Thus, the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on male genital cancers care remain inconclusive and will probably be felt for decades. This study aimed to determine the impact of pandemic on the incidence of hospital admissions (HA) due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of the HAs due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs in the city of São Paulo comparing the outbreak period (January-June 2020) and a pre-pandemic corresponding period of the years 2017-2019. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Unified Health System - Hospital Information System database according to the chapter II of the International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD10). Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the incidence of HAs and time (months). Results: A significant reduction in HAs due to malignant neoplasms of male genital organs was observed in PC, but not other malignant neoplasms of male genital organs during the outbreak period (JanuaryJune 2020). PC (-19, CI -36 to -1) showed to be remarkably affected while other male genital cancers (-1, CI -5 to 3) did not (Table). Conclusions: Our findings seem to be associated to delayed oncological care delivery to PC during the lockdown and health system disruption. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of the ongoing pandemic in malignant neoplasm of male genital organs, particularly PC, in order to strategically corroborate public health actions for implications of COVID-19 pandemic.","Portugal, I.

Choppin, 1985, J. Cell Biol. 101:1578-1590) described the lipid composition of a series of mouse fibroblast cell lines which vary in susceptibility to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two alterations in lipid content were found to be directly correlated with resistance to PEG-induced cell fusion: increases in fatty acyl chain saturation, and the elevation of neutral glycerides, including an unusual ether-linked compound. In this study, we have probed the association between lipid composition and cell fusion through the use of fatty acid supplements to the cellular growth medium, and show that the fusibility of cells can be controlled by altering their acyl chain composition. The parental Clone 1D cells contain moderately unsaturated fatty acids with a ratio of saturates to polyunsaturates (S/P) approximately 1 and fuse virtually to completion following a standard PEG treatment. By contrast, the lipids of a highly fusion-resistant mutant cell line, F40, are highly saturated (S/P approximately 4). When the S/P ratio of Clone 1D cells was increased to approximate that normally found in F40 cells by growth in the presence of high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, they became highly resistant to PEG. Reduction of the S/P ratio of F40 cells by growth in cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids rendered them susceptible to fusion. Cell lines F8, F16, etc., which are normally intermediate between Clone 1D and F40 in both lipid composition and fusion response, can be altered in either direction (towards either increased or decreased susceptibility to fusion) by the addition of appropriate fatty acids to the growth medium. Although trans-unsaturated fatty acids have phase-transition temperatures roughly similar to saturated compounds, and might therefore be expected to affect membrane fluidity in a similar manner, trans-unsaturated fatty acids exerted the same effect as cis-unsaturates on the control of PEG-induced cell fusion. This observation suggests that the control of cell fusion by alteration of fatty acid content is not due to changes in membrane fluidity, and thus that the fatty acids are involved in some other way in the modulation of cell fusion.",,J Cell Biol,153,1

I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.","Tsuchihashi, Z",,153,1

Research has shown that it is caused by a novel coronavirus. A series of cases is reported where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. Detection of ocular infection from tears using the PCR technique has been widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose infections for other viruses. METHODS This is a case series report from cases classified as probable or suspect SARS cases. Tear samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients who were suspected of having SARS in Singapore over a period of 12 days (7-18 April 2003), and analysed by PCR using protocols developed by the WHO network of laboratories. RESULTS Three patients with probable SARS (one female and two male patients) had positive results from their tear samples. Tear samples were used to confirm SARS in the female patient, who was positive only from her tears. The positive specimens were found in cases sampled early in their course of infection. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case series reported with the detection of the SARS coronavirus from tears, and has important implications for the practice of ophthalmology and medicine. The ability to detect and isolate the virus in the early phase of the disease may be an important diagnostic tool for future patients and tear sampling is both simple and easily repeatable. Many healthcare workers are in close proximity to the eyes of patients and this may be a source of spread among healthcare workers and inoculating patients. Ophthalmic practices may need to change as more stringent barrier methods, appropriate quarantine, and isolation measures are vital when managing patients with SARS.","Loon, S-C; Teoh, S C B; Oon, L L E; Se-Thoe, S-Y; Ling, A-E; Leo, Y-S; Leong, H-N",The British journal of ophthalmology,153,1

Recent introduction of molecular tests enabled the identi cation of parechovirus and enterovirus infections. Our aim was a retrospective analysis of signs and symptoms associated with confirmed parechovirus or enterovirus infections among children treated in the Department of Neonatology, St. Louis Regional Children's Hospital in Kraków, Poland. METHODS Based on laboratory records, we identified all cases of parecho- or enterovirus infections confirmed by identification of viral RNA in nasal swab or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Hospital records and laboratory tests results of selected patients were then analyzed, and selected data were summarized, with emphasis on clinical and laboratory findings at admission. RESULTS We identified 11 cases of parechovirus and three of enterovirus infections. All cases were neonates admitted to hospital with fever and irritability. Except for leukopenia in 50% of patients, no significant abnormalities were noted in blood counts and serum biochemistry, including low C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. In nine cases, cerebrospinal fluid was collected, the fluid protein concentrations and cell counts were moderately increased. Final diagnosis was meningitis in 12 children, and other viral infections in two. CONCLUSIONS Viral infection, including parecho- and enteroviruses, should be considered in the etiology of fever and meningitis in neonates.

However, these dressings do not stabilize the eschar or reduce its toxicity. Cerium nitrate (CN) solutions have been established clinically to stabilize the eschar by decreasing release of inflammatory mediators from burned tissue thereby allowing delayed excision and grafting. In this report, we tested the extent to which CN imparts CN benefits to silver dressings for temporizing treatments of burn wounds and enhancing anti-bacterial activity. Using a rat full-thickness scald burn model, we showed that CN enhanced the anti-bacterial effects of the tested silver-based dressings (Acticoat™, Mepilex™, and Silverlon®), while also imparting anti-inflammatory properties to these dressings. Compared to the use of silver dressings alone, CN significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β and GRO/KC, and exhibited downward trending levels of IL-1α, MIP-1α, and bacterial bioburden within the wound. Based on our findings, we conclude that CN has the ability to expand and enhance the function of several silver dressings. We propose the use of CN in combination with silver dressings to stabilize burn wounds thereby allowing postponement of excision and grafting, most notably in scenarios where the standard of care is not feasible such as in combat situations, resource limited regions, and new emergent health care challenges as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in which COVID-positive severe burn patients are not able to undergo surgery during an active outbreak.","Qian, Li-Wu; Fourcaudot, Andrea B; Chen, Ping; Brandenburg, Kenneth S; Weaver, Alan J; Leung, Kai P",International journal of burns and trauma,153,9

Preclinical studies verified the antiviral effects of some antidepressants, first of all fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These drugs inhibit the entry of viruses into the cell, arrest their intracellular pathway, and block their replication if used in the dose of usual human therapy, according to most of the studies.

Nuclear import factors function as key gatekeepers that regulate the transport of innate immune regulatory cargo to the nucleus of cells to activate the antiviral response. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model, we demonstrate that SARS-COV ORF6 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, where it binds to and disrupts nuclear import complex formation by tethering karyopherin alpha 2 and karyopherin beta 1 to the membrane. Retention of import factors at the ER/Golgi membrane leads to a loss of STAT1 transport into the nucleus in response to interferon signaling, thus blocking the expression of STAT1-activated genes that establish an antiviral state. We mapped the region of ORF6, which binds karyopherin alpha 2, to the C terminus of ORF6 and show that mutations in the C terminus no longer bind karyopherin alpha 2 or block the nuclear import of STAT1. We also show that N-terminal deletions of karyopherin alpha 2 that no longer bind to karyopherin beta 1 still retain ORF6 binding activity but no longer block STAT1 nuclear import. Recombinant SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 did not tether karyopherin alpha 2 to the ER/Golgi membrane and allowed the import of the STAT1 complex into the nucleus. We discuss the likely implications of these data on SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.","Frieman, Matthew; Yount, Boyd; Heise, Mark; Kopecky-Bromberg, Sarah A; Palese, Peter; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,153,1

We investigated the ability of SARS CoV to infect 5-week-old Golden Syrian hamsters. When administered intranasally, SARS CoV replicates to high titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. Peak replication in the lower respiratory tract was noted on day 2 postinfection (p.i.) and was cleared by day 7 p.i. Low levels of virus were present in the nasal turbinates of a few hamsters at 14 days p.i. Viral replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was accompanied by cellular necrosis early in infection, followed by an inflammatory response coincident with viral clearance, focal consolidation in pulmonary tissue, and eventual pulmonary tissue repair. Despite high levels of virus replication and associated pathology in the respiratory tract, the hamsters showed no evidence of disease. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera at day 7 p.i., and mean titers at day 28 p.i. exceeded 1:400. Hamsters challenged with SARS CoV at day 28 p.i. were completely protected from virus replication and accompanying pathology in the respiratory tract. Comparing these data to the mouse model, SARS CoV replicates to a higher titer and for a longer duration in the respiratory tract of hamsters and is accompanied by significant pathology that is absent in mice. Viremia and extrapulmonary spread of SARS CoV to liver and spleen, which are seen in hamsters, were not detected in mice. The hamster, therefore, is superior to the mouse as a model for the evaluation of antiviral agents and candidate vaccines against SARS CoV replication.","Roberts, Anjeanette; Vogel, Leatrice; Guarner, Jeannette; Hayes, Norman; Murphy, Brian; Zaki, Sherif; Subbarao, Kanta",Journal of virology,153,9

Cows in 8 of the 9 herds seroconverted to BCV alone, while the animals in the ninth herd, which showed severe symptoms of the disease, seroconverted both to BCV and BVDV. The BCV antibodies, which were present in high titres 1 year postinfection, were transferred to the offspring via the colostrum and were then detectable in sera of calves until these were approximately 5 months old. A serological survey of 549 Swedish heifers showed that 61% of the animals were reactors to BCV. The prevalence of seroreactors to BCV was equally distributed over Sweden but was commonly either high or low in herds. In conclusion, BCV is commonly detected in animals suffering from winter dysentery. A co-infection with BVDV appears to aggravate the disease.","Alenius, S; Niskanen, R; Juntti, N; Larsson, B",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,153,1

Acid aerosol and inhalable (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters < 10 micron; PM10) and fine (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 micron; PM2.5) particle samples were collected for 24-hr periods (9 A.M.-9 A.M. EDT) on alternate days at six monitoring sites located throughout the greater Washington, D.C. area. Monitoring sites were located in both urban and rural areas and were generally situated along a southwest to northeast line due to the prevailing winds. Information on site characteristics, including population density and distance from the city center, was also obtained, as were data on meteorological parameters. Results from this study show strong correlations among the particulate measures, PM10, PM2.5, SO4(2-), and H+. These strong correlations resulted from the fact that PM2.5 comprised 77% of PM10, with SO4(2-)-related species accounting for 49% of total PM2.5. PM10, PM2.5, SO4(2-), and H+ concentrations were found to be uniform across the metropolitan Washington area. Spatial variation was found, however, for coarse particles (PM2.5-10) and NH3 concentrations. In our previous Philadelphia study, population density was an important determinant of spatial variation in coarse particles and NH3 concentrations, however, in Washington, D.C., population density was not associated with observed spatial patterns in coarse particle concentrations, but was an important determinant of NH3 concentrations. When data from one site (Reservoir) was excluded from the analysis, population density explained larger percentage of the variability in NH3 levels and became an important determinant of the H+/SO4(2-) ratio as well. Ambient H+ models developed from Philadelphia data were found to predict H+ concentrations in Washington, D.C. reasonably well, representing an improvement over measurements made at a single stationary ambient monitoring site.","Suh, H H; Nishioka, Y; Allen, G A; Koutrakis, P; Burton, R M",Environmental health perspectives,153,1

In this study, two replication-competent bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV-3) recombinants (BAV331 and BAV338) expressing bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) glycoprotein E2 in the early region 3 (E3) of BAV-3 were constructed. Recombinant BAV331 contains chemically synthesized E2 gene (nucleotides modified to remove internal cryptic splice sites) under the control of BAV-3 E3/major late promoter (MLP), while recombinant BAV338 contains original E2 gene under the control of human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Since E2, a class I membrane glycoprotein, does not contain its own signal peptide sequence at the 5' end, the bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) glycoprotein D signal sequence was fused in frame to the E2 open reading frame (ORF) for proper processing of the E2 glycoprotein in both the recombinant viruses. Recombinant E2 protein expressed by BAV331 and BAV338 recombinant viruses was recognized by E2-specific monoclonal antibodies as a 53-kDa protein, which also formed dimer with an apparent molecular weight of 94 kDa. Insertion of an E2-expression cassette in the E3 region did not effect the replication of recombinant BAV-3s. Intranasal immunization of cotton rats with these recombinant viruses generated E2-specific IgA and IgG responses at the mucosal surfaces and in the serum. In summary, these results show that the pestivirus glycoprotein can be expressed efficiently by BAV-3. In addition, mucosal immunization with replication-competent recombinant bovine adenovirus 3 can induce a specific immune response against the expressed antigen.","Baxi, M K; Deregt, D; Robertson, J; Babiuk, L A; Schlapp, T; Tikoo, S K",Virology,153,12

Most causes of febrile respiratory illness are bacterial and viral agents of community-acquired pneumonia. However, a small number of rare and highly contagious agents can initially present as febrile respiratory illnesses, which can lead to an epidemic that can greatly impact the health care system. This impact includes sustained mass critical care, with potential scarcity of critical resources (eg, positive-pressure ventilators), spread of disease to health care workers, sustained spread within the community, and extensive morbidity and mortality. The main agents of febrile respiratory illness that would lead to an epidemic include influenza, the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fever, plague, tularemia, and anthrax. Recognition of these agents occurs largely based on epidemiological clues, and management consists of antibiotics, antivirals, supportive care, and positive-pressure ventilation. Acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome occur with these agents, so a lung-protective (low tidal volume) ventilation strategy is indicated. Additional respiratory care measures, such as nebulized medications, bronchoscopy, humidified oxygen, and airway suctioning, potentiate aerosolization of the virus or bacteria and increase the risk of transmission to health care workers and patients. Thus, appropriate personal protective equipment, including an N95 mask or powered air-purifying respirator, is indicated. A basic understanding of the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment of these agents will provide a foundation for early isolation, evaluation, infection control, and public health involvement and response in cases of a febrile respiratory illness that causes respiratory failure.","Sandrock, Christian E",Respiratory care,153,9

The titer of SeV/DeltaM carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene in place of the M gene was 7 x 10(7) cell infectious units/ml or more. The new vector showed high levels of infectivity and gene expression, similar to those of wild-type SeV vector, in vitro and in vivo. Virus maturation into a particle was almost completely abolished in cells infected with SeV/DeltaM. Instead, SeV/DeltaM infection brought about a significant increase of syncytium formation under conditions in which the fusion protein was proteolytically cleaved and activated by trypsin-like protease. This shows that SeV/DeltaM spreads markedly to neighboring cells in a cell-to-cell manner, because both hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and active fusion proteins are present at very high levels on the surface of cells infected with SeV/DeltaM. Thus, SeV/DeltaM is a novel type of vector with the characteristic features of loss of virus particle formation and gain of cell-to-cell spreading via a mechanism dependent on the activation of the fusion protein.","Inoue, Makoto; Tokusumi, Yumiko; Ban, Hiroshi; Kanaya, Takumi; Shirakura, Masayuki; Tokusumi, Tsuyoshi; Hirata, Takahiro; Nagai, Yoshiyuki; Iida, Akihiro; Hasegawa, Mamoru",Journal of virology,153,20

The type of fuel shown to decrease combustion emissions components versus traditional diesel fuel, is the diesel emulsion. The Lubrizol Corporation, in conjunction with Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and several subcontracting laboratories, recently conducted a health assessment of the combustion emissions of PuriNOx diesel fuel emulsion (diesel-water-methanol) in rodents. Combustion emissions from either of two, 2002 model Cummins 5.9L ISB engines, were diluted with charcoal-filtered air to exposure concentrations of 125, 250 and 500 microg total PM/m3. The engines were operated on a continuous, repeating, heavy-duty certification cycle (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I) using Rotella-T 15W-40 engine oil. Nitrogen oxide (NO) and PM were reduced when engines were operated on PuriNOx versus California Air Resources Board diesel fuel under these conditions. Male and female F344 rats were housed in Hazleton H2000 exposure chambers and exposed to exhaust atmospheres 6 h/day, five days/week for the first 11 weeks and seven days/week thereafter. Exposures ranged from 61 to 73 days depending on the treatment group. Indicators of general toxicity (body weight, organ weight, clinical pathology and histopathology), neurotoxicity (glial fibrillary acidic protein assay), genotoxicity (Ames assay, micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange), and reproduction and development were measured. Overall, effects observed were mild. Emulsion combustion emissions were not associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, or in vivo genotoxicity. Small decreases in serum cholesterol in the 500-microg/m3 exposure group were observed. PM accumulation within alveolar macrophages was evident in all exposure groups. The latter findings are consistent with normal physiological responses to particle inhalation. Other statistically significant effects were present in some measured parameters of other exposed groups, but were not clearly attributed to emissions exposure. Positive mutagenic responses in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium were observed subsequent to treatment with emulsion emissions subfractions. Based on the cholesterol results, it can be concluded that the 250-microg/m3 exposure level was the no observed effect level. In general, biological findings in exposed rats and bacteria were consistent with exposure to petroleum diesel exhaust in the F344 rat and Ames assays.","Reed, M D; Blair, L F; Burling, K; Daly, I; Gigliotti, A P; Gudi, R; Mercieca, M D; McDonald, J D; O'Callaghan, J P; Seilkop, S K; Ronskoh, N L; Wagner, V O; Kraska, R C",Toxicology and industrial health,153,16

METHODS BALB/c mice were immunized with purified recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV for producing mAbs, and New Zealand white rabbits were immunized for producing polyclonal antibodies. The identification of antibodies was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent-antibody assay (IFA), and Western immunoblotting. Capturing and detecting antibodies were selected by pairing the mAbs and polyclonal antibodies one by one and an antibodies-based sandwich antigen capture ELISA was used for detecting N antigen of SARS-CoV. RESULTS Nine mAbs and hyperimmune rabbit polyclonal antibodies, specifically against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein were obtained. Using paired ELISA assay, three mAbs N1E8, N8E1 and N10E4 were selected as capturing antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies as detecting antibody then triple antibodies-based sandwich ELISA was established following horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. The recombinant N protein was used as a standard to establish a detection sensitivity of approximated 50 pg/ml with this assay.

METHOD A cross-sectional study with 47,876 telephone interviews in the state capitals and Federal District, a probabilistic sample of adult population (>18 years-old) with landline telephone. Questions concerning the results of ILI cases and pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009, from January 10 to November 30, were analyzed. The proportion of cases stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and Brazilian geographic region was weighted with data from the National Survey with Household Sampling (PNAD) 2008. RESULTS The prevalence of ILI cases in the last 30 days before interview was 31.2% (95%CI 30.2-32.2%) for all state capitals and the Federal District. This prevalence was higher among women, young adults (18 to 29 years-old) and individuals with 9 to 11 years of schooling. According to the geographic region analysis, Northern Brazil presented the highest prevalence of ILI cases. A tendency to increase with further decrease was observed among the geographic regions, except the Northeast. Need for health care assistance was reported by 26.8% (95%CI 25.1-28.5) from ILI cases. Among ILI cases that sought health care assistance, 2.6% (95%CI 1.8-3.4) reported pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 medical suspicion. CONCLUSION The results of this survey supported influenza surveillance as it provided timeliness and useful surveillance information, which were not captured by the traditional surveillance system, as the occurrence of ILI and need of health care assistance.","Reis, Priscilleyne Ouverney; Iser, Betine Pinto Moehlecke; Souza, Líbia Roberta de Oliveira; Yokota, Renata Tiene de Carvalho; de Almeida, Walquiria Aparecida Ferreira; Bernal, Regina Tomie Ivata; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; de Oliveira, Wanderson Kleber; Penna, Gerson Oliveira",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,153,16

Assessment in real-life conditions of subjective symptoms and objective metrics of mobility and nonmotor symptoms such as sleep disturbance is strongly advocated. This information would critically guide the adaptation of antiparkinsonian medications and nonpharmacological interventions. Moreover, since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care practices are being reshaped toward a more home-based care. New technologies could play a pivotal role in this new approach to clinical care. Nevertheless, devices and information technology tools might be unhandy for PD patients, thus dramatically limiting their widespread employment. OBJECTIVE: The goals of the research were development and usability evaluation of an application, SleepFit, for ecological momentary assessment of objective and subjective clinical metrics at PD patients' homes, and as a remote tool for researchers to monitor patients and integrate and manage data. METHODS: An iterative and user-centric strategy was employed for the development of SleepFit. The core structure of SleepFit consists of (1) an electronic finger-tapping test; (2) motor, sleepiness, and emotional subjective scales; and (3) a sleep diary. Applicable design, ergonomic, and navigation principles have been applied while tailoring the application to the specific patient population. Three progressively enhanced versions of the application (alpha, v1.0, v2.0) were tested by a total of 56 patients with PD who were asked to perform multiple home assessments 4 times per day for 2 weeks. Patient compliance was calculated as the proportion of completed tasks out of the total number of expected tasks. Satisfaction on the latest version (v2.0) was evaluated as potential willingness to use SleepFit again after the end of the study. RESULTS: From alpha to v1.0, SleepFit was improved in graphics, ergonomics, and navigation, with automated flows guiding the patients in performing tasks throughout the 24 hours, and real-time data collection and consultation were made possible thanks to a remote web portal. In v2.0, the kiosk-mode feature restricts the use of the tablet to the SleepFit application only, thus preventing users from accidentally exiting the application. A total of 52 (4 dropouts) patients were included in the analyses. Overall compliance (all versions) was 88.89% (5707/6420). SleepFit was progressively enhanced and compliance increased from 87.86% (2070/2356) to 89.92% (2899/3224; P=.04). Among the patients who used v2.0, 96% (25/26) declared they would use SleepFit again. CONCLUSIONS: SleepFit can be considered a state-of-the-art home-based system that increases compliance in PD patients, ensures high-quality data collection, and works as a handy tool for remote monitoring and data management in clinical research. Thanks to its user-friendliness and modular structure, it could be employed in other clinical studies with minimum adaptation efforts.

Whilst access to hospitals was restricted, outpatient care continued remotely. At our institute, the biologic therapy for severe asthma patients is administered on-site by specialist nurses who follow manufacturers' recommendations. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the satisfaction of patients with severe asthma with telemedicine, and the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on their receipt of biologics and other treatments for asthma. Methods: A crosssectional survey of 58 patients with severe asthma scheduled to receive biologic therapy at our hospital during the lockdown was performed with ethical approval. Results: Fifty-four patients participated (F 37;mean age 46.7 years;response rate 93.1%). Meantime since diagnosis was 19.2 years (SD 11.5 years). All had been on biologic therapy Omalizumab (45), Mepolizumab (7), or Dupilumab (2) for over three months (mean 38.4 months ± SD 26.5 months). Fifty (92.6%) had telephone follow-up, 31 (57.4%) were satisfied with telemedicine, 45 (81.4%) agreed that biologic therapy improved their asthma, and 40 (74.1%) received scheduled biologic therapy. Of the 45 patients living in the city, nine did not receive biologic therapy, two cited the lockdown as the reason for this;two did not receive an appointment;two did not perceive any benefit;2 had other reasons. Five of the nine patients living outside the city did not receive biologic therapy, 3 because of the lockdown, and 1 for fear of acquiring COVID-19. Alarmingly, 16 (29.6%) suggested that they had insufficient medications, and 27 (50%) reported difficulty obtaining medications. Conclusions: Many patients were satisfied with telemedicine, so this could be used to deliver routine outpatient tertiary care post-pandemic. However, logistics around supplying medications, and biologics must be considered in plans preparing for the second wave of COVID-19.","Al-Jahdali, H.

Due to the multiple functional sites on HA and its intrinsic affinity for CD44, a receptor highly expressed on various cancer cells, HA has been widely engineered to construct different drug-loading nanoparticles (NPs) for CD44- targeted anti-tumor therapy. When a cocktail of drugs is co-loaded in HA NP, a multifunctional nano-carriers could be obtained, which features as a highly effective and self-targeting strategy to combat the cancers with CD44 overexpression. The HA-based multidrug nano-carriers can be a combination of different drugs, various therapeutic modalities, or the integration of therapy and diagnostics (theranostics). Up to now, there are many types of HA-based multidrug nano-carriers constructed by different formulation strategies including drug co-conjugates, micelles, nano-gels and hybrid NP of HA and so on. This multidrug nano-carrier takes the full advantages of HA as NP matrix, drug carriers and targeting ligand, representing a simplified and biocompatible platform to realize the targeted and synergistic combination therapy against the cancers.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the levels of impact of COVID-19 on mental health among people from Spain and China and correlated mental health parameters with variables relating to symptoms similar to COVID-19, COVID-19 knowledge, and precautionary measures. METHODS: We collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms, contact history with persons with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 knowledge, and precautionary measures. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21). To analyze the differences in the mental health parameters, the mean scores between Chinese and Spanish respondents were compared using the independent samples t test. The differences in categorical variables between the two samples were analyzed by the chi-square test. Linear regression was used to calculate the univariate associations between the independent variables and mental health parameters for both groups separately, with adjustments made for age, gender, and education. RESULTS: A total of 1528 participants (Spain: n=687; China: n=841) were recruited. The mean age of the Chinese respondents was 24.73 years (SD 7.60; range 18-65 years), and the mean age of the Spanish respondents was 43.06 years (SD 11.95; range 18-76 years). Spanish participants reported significantly more symptoms similar to COVID-19 infection (eg, fever, sore throat, and breathing difficulties), contact history with COVID-19, higher perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, frequent use of medical services, and less confidence in medical services compared with their Chinese counterparts (P<.001).

We present airborne and ground-based data, supported by satellite observations, to measure weekly to monthly changes in total methane emissions in the United States' Permian Basin during a period of volatile oil prices associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As oil prices declined from ∼ USD 60 to USD 20 per barrel, emissions changed concurrently from 3.3 % to 1.9 % of natural gas production;as prices partially recovered, emissions increased back to near initial values. Concurrently, total oil and natural gas production only declined by∼ 10 % from the peak values seen in the months prior to the crash. Activity data indicate that a rapid decline in well development and subsequent effects on associated gas flaring and midstream infrastructure throughput are the likely drivers of temporary emission reductions. Our results, along with past satellite observations, suggest that under more typical price conditions, the Permian Basin is in a state of overcapacity in which rapidly growing associated gas production exceeds midstream capacity and leads to high methane emissions.","Lyon, David R.; Hmiel, Benjamin Gautam Ritesh Omara Mark Roberts Katherine A.; Barkley, Zachary R.; Davis, Kenneth J.; Miles, Natasha L.; Monteiro, Vanessa C.; Richardson, Scott J.; Conley, Stephen Smith Mackenzie L.; Jacob, Daniel J.; Shen, Lu Varon Daniel J.; Deng, Aijun Rudelis Xander Sharma Nikhil Story Kyle T.; Brandt, Adam R.; Kang, Mary Kort Eric A.; Marchese, Anthony J.; Hamburg, Steven P.",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,153,16

METHODS: We collected 184 serum samples from 70 consecutively qRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients at four participating hospitals from 23 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as the presence of new pulmonary infiltration. Serum samples were grouped by the duration after symptom onset on a weekly basis for antibody testing and analysis. The four immunoassays: Beckman SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (Beckman Test), Siemens (ADVIA Centaur®) SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) (Siemens Test), SBC COVID-19 IgG ELISA (SBC Test) and EliA SARS-CoV-2-Sp1 IgG/IgM/IgA P2 Research (EliA Test) were used for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. RESULTS: The sensitivity of all tests reached 100% after 42 days of symptom onset. Siemens Test, the only test detecting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, had the best performance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (day 0-7: 77%; day 8-14: 95%) compared to the other 3 serological tests. All tests showed 100% specificity except SBC Test (98%). COVID-19 patients with pneumonia had significantly higher testing signal values than patients without pneumonia (all p values < 0.05, except EliA IgM Test). However, Siemens Test and SBC Test had highest probability in early prediction of the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Chronological analysis of immune response among COVID-19 patients with different serological tests provides important information in the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prediction of the risk of pneumonia after infection.","Lin, Yi-Chun; Lee, Yu-Lin; Cheng, Chien-Yu; Tseng, Wen-Pin; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Lin, Chien-Hao; Chung, Ming-Yi; Kang, Chun-Min; Lee, Ya-Fan; Chen, Cheng-Pin; Huang, Chien-Hua; Liu, Chun-Eng; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Chen, Shyr-Chyr; Chen, Shey-Ying; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,153,16

The questionnaire included questions of KAP about COVID-19, depressive and anxiety symptoms scales. Multivariable generalized linear regressions models were applied to estimate the unstandardized regression coefficients (ß) of KAP. The awareness rates about COVID-19 were 70.1% - 99.5% for all 1650 valid questionnaires. 37.2% of the participants quite worried about being infected with COVID-19. Approximately 96% of them washed hands in certain situations, while 85.6% of them washed hands after coughing or sneezing. Compared to the students without depressive symptoms, those who had depressive symptoms scored lower of total KAP, knowledge, attitudes, and practice. The findings suggest that primary students had a relatively good awareness of COVID-19 during the epidemic, as well as optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices.

To investigate whether immune response to the virus can be influenced by genetic factors, we compared HLA and AB0 frequencies in organ transplant recipients and waitlisted patients according to presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by transplanted and waitlisted patients in a January 2002-March 2020 time frame. Data from this cohort were merged with the Italian registry of COVID subjects, evaluating infection status of transplanted and waitlisted patients. A total of 56304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (n=265, COVID) or absence (n=56 039, COVID) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted/transplanted patients (OR=4.2, 95%CI [3.7-4.7], P<0.0001). HLA-DRB1*08 was more frequent in COVID (9.7% and 5.2%: OR=1.9, 95%CI [1.2-3.1]; P=0.003; Pc=0.036). In COVID patients, HLA-DRB1*08 was correlated to mortality (6.9% in living vs 17.5% in deceased: OR=2.9, 95%CI [1.15-7.21]; P=0.023). Peptide binding prediction analyses showed that these DRB1*08 alleles were unable to bind any of the viral peptides with high affinity. Lastly, blood group A was more frequent in COVID (45.5%) than COVID patients (39.0%; OR=1.3, 95%CI [1.02-1.66]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Even though preliminary, these results suggest that HLA antigens may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical evolution of COVID-19 and confirm that blood group A individuals are at greater risk of infection, providing clues on the spread of the disease and indications about infection prognosis and vaccination strategies.","Amoroso, Antonio; Magistroni, Paola; Vespasiano, Francesca; Bella, Antonino; Bellino, Stefania; Puoti, Francesca; Alizzi, Silvia; Vaisitti, Tiziana; Boros, Stefano; Grossi, Paolo Antonio; Trapani, Silvia; Lombardini, Letizia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Deaglio, Silvia; Brusaferro, Silvio; Cardillo, Massimo",Transplantation,153,16

While we agree that the coronavirus pandemic is unique and relevant to research, we argue that not all effects are worth researching or novel to us. Previous research on crises and disasters do show similar patterns and existing theories can often very well explain the current phenomena. Thus, six illustrative examples are shown how a research agenda could look like.

Much of what we know about the signaling molecules and associated signal transduction induced during the host cellular response to viral pathogens has been gained from research conducted from the 1990's to the present day, but certain intricacies of the mechanisms involved, still remain unclear. In a recent study by Vaughn et al. the authors examine one of the main mechanisms regulating interferon induction following viral infection, the RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3 pathway, and find that similar to PKR both DICER interacting proteins, PACT and TRBP, regulate RIG-I signaling in an opposing manner. More specifically, the reported findings demonstrate, like others, that PACT stimulates RIG-I-mediated signaling in a manner independent of PACT dsRNA-binding ability or phosphorylation at sites known to be important for PACT-dependent PKR activation. In contrast, they show for the first time that TRBP inhibits RIG-I-mediated signaling. RIG-I inhibition by TRBP did not require phosphorylation of sites shown to be important for inhibiting PKR, nor did it involve PACT or PKR, but it did require the dsRNA-binding ability of TRBP. These findings open the door to a complex co-regulation of RIG-I, PKR, MDA5, miRNA processing, and interferon induction.","Blalock, William L",Biochem J,153,1

Fast, accurate, and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. METHODS: The study included 33 plasma samples from 20 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non-COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA) (ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM + IgA/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics) and compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika). RESULTS: Of the 33 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 28 were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA + IgM and 75% IgG by IMA and 80% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 91%. The specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. CONCLUSION: IMA for COVID-19 is a rapid simple-to-use point-of-care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","Moeller, Maria E; Fock, Jeppe; Pah, Pearlyn; Veras, Antia De La C; Bade, Melanie; Donolato, Marco; Israelsen, Simone B; Eugen-Olsen, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas; Engsig, Frederik N",J Med Virol,153,13

This study aims to examine the perception on the capability of local authority's response and community adaptation among core workforces in responding to acute events in Vietnam. Health professionals, medical students, and community workers in all regions of Vietnam were invited to participate in a web-based survey from December 2019 to February 2020. The snowball sampling technique was utilized to recruit respondents. The Tobit multivariable regression model was used to identify associated factors. The results showed that based on a 0–10 numeric rating scale, the mean scores of the capacity of local agencies and community adaptation were 6.2 ± 2 and 6.0 ± 1.8, respectively. Regarding local authority competencies, the lowest score went to “Adequate equipment, infrastructures and funding for disease prevention”. For community adaptation, the respondents evaluated the capacity on “Periodic training, equipment and drills to prepare for epidemic and disaster response” competency” with the lowest mark (5.2 ± 2.5). Overall, there were significant differences in the assessment of community adaptive capacity between urban and rural areas (p &lt; 0.01). This study indicated the moderate capacity of the local authority and community adaptation on epidemics and disasters in Vietnam.

Refractive surprises are rare for normal eyes and with the use of optical biometry. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all elective surgeries were stopped. This has resulted in a large backlog of deferred cataract surgeries. Now more than ever before, we should consider ISBCS as an excellent alternative to delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery in the right hospital or surgical setting.

The characteristics of COVID-19 in older patients and its clinical outcomes in different kidney disease groups are not well known. METHODS: Data were retrieved from a national multicentric database supported by Turkish Society of Nephrology, which consists of retrospectively collected data between 17 April 2020 and 31 December 2020. Hospitalised patients aged 18 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis suffering from stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or on maintenance haemodialysis (HD) treatment were included in the database. Non-uraemic hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were also included as the control group. RESULTS: We included 879 patients [388 (44.1%) female, median age: 63 (IQR: 50-73) years]. The percentage of older patients in the CKD group was 68.8% (n = 188/273), in the HD group was 49.0% (n = 150/306) and in the control group was 30.4% (n = 70/300). Co-morbidities were higher in the CKD and HD groups. The rate of presentation with severe-critical disease was higher in the older CKD and HD groups (43.6%, 55.3% and 16.1%, respectively). Among older patients, the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was significantly higher in the CKD and HD groups than in the control group (38.8%, 37.3% and 15.7%, respectively). In-hospital mortality or death and/or ICU admission rates in the older group were significantly higher in the CKD (29.3% and 39.4%) and HD groups (26.7% and 30.1%) compared with the control group (8.6% and 17.1%). In the multivariate analysis, in-hospital mortality rates in CKD and HD groups were higher than control group [hazard ratio (HR): 4.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53-12.26) and HR: 3.09 (95% CI: 1.04-9.17), respectively]. CONCLUSION: Among older COVID-19 patients, in-hospital mortality is significantly higher in those with stage 3-5 CKD and on maintenance HD than older patients without CKD regardless of demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical and laboratory data on admission.","Ozturk, Savas; Turgutalp, Kenan; Arici, Mustafa; Gok, Mahmut; Islam, Mahmud; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Aydin, Zeki; Doner, Baris; Eren, Necmi; Sengul, Erkan; Karadag, Serhat; Ozler, Tuba Elif; Dheir, Hamad; Pembegul, Irem; Guven Taymez, Dilek; Sahin, Garip; Bakirdogen, Serkan; Dolarslan, Murside Esra; Soypacaci, Zeki; Hur, Ender; Kara, Ekrem; Basturk, Taner; Ogutmen, Melike Betul; Gorgulu, Numan; Sahin, Idris; Ayli, Mehmet Deniz; Tuglular, Zubeyde Serhan; Sahin, Gulizar; Tokgoz, Bulent; Tonbul, Halil Zeki; Yildiz, Alaattin; Sezer, Siren; Odabas, Ali Riza; Ates, Kenan",Int J Clin Pract,153,1

In this research, the polycaprolactone composite materials (carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone) were developed by reinforcement of the 0%-2% of carbonyl iron powder using the solvent cast three-dimensional printing technique. The physicochemical properties of developed composites were characterized in conjunction with mechanical and biological properties. The mechanical characterizations were assessed by uniaxial tensile testing as well as flexibility testing. The results of mechanical testing assured that carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone composites have shown desirable properties for vascular implants. Besides the mechanical characterization, in vitro biological investigations of carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone were done for analyzing blood compatibility and cytocompatibility. The results revealed that the materials developed were biocompatible, less hemolytic, and having non-thrombogenic properties indicating the promising applications in the field of cardiovascular applications.","Singh, Jasvinder; Kaur, Tejinder; Singh, Neetu; Pandey, Pulak Mohan",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,153,26

COVID-19 contains a single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid containing matrix protein. The virus is a spherical, pleomorphic enveloped particle bearing club-shaped glycoprotein projections. Intermediate source of origin is not known, therefore, bats could be responsible as the primary reservoir. Transmission can also occur through families in their immediate environment around that particular infected person.

This paper demonstrates that high-frequency electricity market data can be used to estimate the causal, short-run impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, providing information that is essential for shaping future lockdown policy. Unlike official statistics, which are published with a delay of a few months, our approach permits almost real-time monitoring of the economic impact of the containment policies and the financial stimuli introduced to address the crisis. We illustrate our methodology using daily data for the Italian day-ahead power market. We estimate that the 3 weeks of most severe lockdown reduced the corresponding Italian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by roughly 30%.

We conducted a survey of the clinical staff at 10 federally funded Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers to understand their views regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues related to host genomics and the administrative and clinical functions of high-level isolation units. Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genomics could provide valuable information to identify patients and employees at higher risk for poor outcomes from highly infectious diseases. However, there was considerable disagreement about whether such data should inform the allocation of scarce resources or determine treatment decisions. While most respondents supported a confidential employer-based genomic testing system to inform individual employees about risk, respondents disagreed about whether such information should be used in staffing models. Respondents who thought genomic information would be valuable for patient treatment were more willing to undergo genetic testing for staffing purposes. Most respondents felt they would benefit from additional training to better interpret results from genetic testing.

The peak of the increase in DV appears, on average, 5 weeks after the introduction of the lockdown.

A polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation. Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer, and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of [Formula: see text] mm and Dice coefficient of [Formula: see text]. Hierarchical clustering identified four radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes.

Several countries in the world are experiencing a second, or even a third, wave of contagion, while awaiting the effects of mass vaccination campaigns. The aim of this report was to provide an update of previously released recommendations on prioritization and restructuring of urological activities. METHODS: A large group of Italian urologists directly involved in the reorganization of their urological wards during the first and second phase of the pandemic agreed on a set of updated recommendations for current urology practice. RESULTS: The updated recommendations included strategies for the prioritization of both surgical and outpatient activities, implementation of perioperative pathways for patients scheduled for elective surgery, management of urological conditions in infected patients. Future scenarios with possible implementation of telehealth and reshaping of clinical practice following the effects of vaccination are also discussed. CONCLUSION: The present update may be a valid tool to be used in the clinical practice, may provide useful recommendations for national and international urological societies, and may be a cornerstone for further discussion on the topic, also considering further evolution of the pandemic after the recently initiated mass vaccination campaigns.","Ficarra, Vincenzo; Novara, Giacomo; Giannarini, Gianluca; De Nunzio, Cosimo; Abrate, Alberto; Bartoletti, Riccardo; Crestani, Alessandro; Esperto, Francesco; Galfano, Antonio; Gregori, Andrea; Liguori, Giovanni; Pavan, Nicola; Simonato, Alchiede; Trombetta, Carlo; Tubaro, Andrea; Porpiglia, Francesco; Scarpa, Roberto Mario; Mirone, Vincenzo",Urologia,153,4

On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.","Wang, Minjin; Zhou, Yanbing; Zong, Zhiyong; Liang, Zongan; Cao, Yu; Tang, Hong; Song, Bin; Huang, Zixing; Kang, Yan; Feng, Ping; Ying, Binwu; Li, Weimin",Precis Clin Med,153,1

In our hospital three COVID-19 patients developed SPM: one on admission at the emergency department and the other two during hospitalization. In this study we describe their clinical course and computed tomography (CT) findings. All of them had severe disease according to the total severity score on admission CT. The management of pneumomediastinum was conservative and follow-up CT showed resolution in all patients. As the correlation between extension of parenchymal lung lesions and development of pneumomediastinum is still under investigation, we highlight the importance of reporting the severity score on chest CT in order to obtain more comparable results between different studies. Furthermore, in this tragic circumstance we also had the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with the otherwise uncommon occurrence of air along the bronchovascular sheaths (Macklin effect) and evaluate the ability of CT to detect it.","Kalpaxi, Angeliki; Kalokairinou, Mariana; Katseli, Paraskevi; Savvopoulou, Vasiliki; Ioannidi, Pinelopi; Triantafyllou, Evangelia; Flokatoula, Maria; Pythara, Chrystalla; Papaevangelou, Angeliki",,153,24

METHODS: We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. RESULTS: Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid. CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.","Trias-Llimós, Sergi; Riffe, Tim; Bilal, Usama",PLoS One,153,21

However, OFC are time-consuming and risky procedures. OBJECTIVE: to assess the utility of the basophil activation test (BAT) to predict the allergic status and reduce the need for OFC in children with one or more nut or seed allergies. METHODS: Participants in the Pronuts study recruited at the Geneva and the London centers were tested on the BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 6, using FlowCAST, a commercially available BAT kit, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut discriminated between allergic and non-allergic children, to the respective nut or seed. The optimal allergen concentration and their optimal, positive and negative cut-offs were identified for BAT and the other tests, for each nut and seed. Using BAT as a second step in the diagnostic process, following equivocal skin prick test and IgE to extracts and components, reduced the number of total OFCs by 5-15% and of positive OFC by 33-75% (except for hazelnut) with 0% false-negatives and a diagnostic accuracy of 96-100%. CONCLUSION: The BAT proved to be a useful diagnostic tool, used in a stepwise approach, to predict the allergic status and reduce the number of OFC in the Pronuts study patients with at least one nut allergy willing to consume selected nuts.","Santos, Alexandra F; Bergmann, Marcel; Brough, Helen A; Couto-Francisco, Natália; Kwok, Matthew; Panetta, Valentina; Haddad, Diab; Lack, Gideon; Eigenmann, Philippe; Caubet, Jean-Christoph",J.

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of data on 202 SOTR with COVID-19, published as case reports or case series. We extracted clinical, hemato-chemical, imaging, treatment, and outcome data. RESULTS: Most patients were kidney recipients (61.9%), males (68.8%), with median age of 57 years. The majority was on tacrolimus (73.5%) and mycophenolate (65.8%). Mortality was 18.8%, but an equal proportion was still hospitalized at last follow up. Immune suppressive therapy was withheld in 77.2% of patients, either partially or completely. Tacrolimus was continued in 50%. One third of survivors that continued immunosuppressants were on dual therapy plus steroids. None of those who continued immunosuppressants developed critical COVID-19 disease. Age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1-1.11, P = .001) and lopinavir/ritonavir use (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.2-8.5, P = .013) were independent predictors of mortality while immunosuppression maintenance (OR 0.067, 95% CI 0.008-0.558, P = .012) and tacrolimus continuation (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, P = .013) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that maintaining immune suppression might be safe in SOTR with moderate and severe COVID-19. Specifically, receiving tacrolimus could be beneficial for COVID-19 SOTR. Because of the quality of the available evidence, no definitive guidance on how to manage SOTR with COVID-19 can be derived from our data.","Karruli, Arta; Spiezia, Serenella; Boccia, Filomena; Gagliardi, Massimo; Patauner, Fabian; Salemme, Anna; Maiello, Ciro; Zampino, Rosa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Transpl Infect Dis,153,26

People's commitment to the recommended control measures is generally affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) concerning COVID-19;hence, this study aimed to assess the KAPs of university students in Sudan regarding COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This was an online descriptive cross-sectional study, performed between April and June 2020 among Sudanese students enrolled in 10 universities in Khartoum state. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire designed in Arabic. The sample size in this study was 657 students. Data were collected by a convenience sampling method and were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: More than 60% of the participants were females, around two-Thirds (68.1%) aged between 18 and 23 years. More than 81% of the participants live in urban areas;approximately two-fifth (59.5%) of them were medical students. About 59% of the participants have sufficient knowledge. Twenty-Two percent of the participants reported a positive attitude, while 71% of them reported a fair attitude, and only 3.8% reported a negative attitude. Nearly 94% of them do not go out of home, and 95% do use disinfectants, solutions, and face masks to prevent contacting and spreading COVID-19. Knowledge was significantly associated with age, gender, study level, being medical or nonmedical students, attending online lectures or webinars about COVID-19, and educational level, while attitude was significantly associated with gender. Conclusion: More than half of the participants had sufficient knowledge, and the minority of them had a negative attitude toward COVID-19, while most of them had a good practice.

With the significant asymptomatic spread of the virus and without an immediate vaccine and pharmaceuticals available, the best feasible strategies for testing and diagnostics, contact tracing, and quarantine need to be optimized. With potentially high false negative test results, infected people would not be enrolled in contact-trace programs and thus, may not be quarantined. Similarly, without broad testing, asymptomatic people are not identified and quarantined. Interconnected system dynamics models can be used to optimize strategies for mitigations for decision support during a pandemic. We use a systems dynamics epidemiology model along with other interconnected system models within public health including hospitals, intensive care units, masks, contact tracing, social distancing, and a newly developed testing and diagnostics model to investigate the uncertainties with testing and to optimize strategies for detecting and diagnosing infected people. Using an orthogonal array Latin Hypercube experimental design, we ran 54 simulations each for two scenarios of 10% and 30% asymptomatic people, varying important inputs for testing and social distancing. Systems dynamics modeling, coupled with computer experimental design and statistical analysis can provide rapid and quantitative results for decision support. Our results show that widespread testing, contacting tracing and quarantine can curtail the pandemic through identifying asymptomatic people in the population.","Fair, Jeanne M; LeClaire, Rene J; Dauelsberg, Lori R; Ewers, Mary; Pasqualini, Donatella; Cleland, Tim; Rosenberger, William",Methods (S.

OBJECTIVE: To explore patient and caregiver understanding and valuation of ""continuity of care"" while transitioning from an in-hospital to a home-based palliative care team. METHODS: Longitudinal qualitative design using semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and their caregivers before and after transitioning from hospital to palliative care at home. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis within a post-positivist framework. Thirty-nine participants (18 patients, 7 caregivers and 7 patient-caregiver dyads) were recruited from two acute care hospitals wherein they received care from an inpatient palliative care consultation team and transitioned to home-based palliative care. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 68, 60% were female and 60% had a diagnosis of cancer. Caregivers had a mean age of 62 and 50% were female. Participants perceived continuity of care to occur in three ways, depending on which stage they were at in their hospital-to-home transition. In hospital, continuity of care was experienced as consistency of information exchanged between providers. During the transition from hospital to home, continuity of care was experienced as consistency of treatments. When receiving home-based palliative care, continuity of care was experienced as having consistent providers. CONCLUSION: Patients' and their caregivers' valuation of continuity of care was dependent on their stage of the hospital-to-home transition.

Methodology: Following lockdown announcement, an immediate online cross sectional study was conducted from the 31 stMarch to 6 April 2020. Data was analyzed by using SPSS IBM version 22. 00. Results: A total of 316 responses were received. Our study has shown that people 95.80% were well familiar with COVID-19, informed via news channels 46.2%. 91.7% believed the virus is contagious, 95.8% reported that the virus is spread by the respiratory droplets, 89.2% believed that all ages are at risk while 62.3% believed it risky for geriatrics only. 60.4% believed in its prevention with 91.7% respondents agreeably quarantined themselves while 6.6% didn’t. 99.7% participants were aware of social/physical distancing and 75.6% found it affecting mental health i.e. cause anxiety, depression etc. 59.2% of respondents were optimistic expecting it to end soon while 32.3% were uncertain. 49.1% said they have diagnostic facility and 89.6% acknowledged efforts of researchers/healthcare providers (doctors, pharmacist, nurses, allied health professionals and paramedical staff) for the society. 94.3% believed that there is need of awareness regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: An ever increasing need of awareness amongst the local population regarding COVID-19 is needed. It will lend hands in preventing spread of COVID-19 with minimal secondary transmission. It is recommended that extensive survey studies are required that can provide supportive data in developing and implementing public health policies regarding COVID-19 pandemic.

Cancer patients are uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 and many have been or will be infected. Although an unfortunate minority will die from the infection, most will recover. This poses a challenge in which clinicians must weigh the benefits of initiation or resumption of antineoplastic therapy against the risks that antineoplastic treatment may worsen outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. A recent study of 423 patients at our institution found that patients in active cancer treatment who develop COVID-19 infection did not fare any worse than other hospitalized patients yet guidance as to who requires testing prior to antineoplastic therapy and when to resume therapy post-COVID diagnosis remains unknown. Our institution, therefore, commissioned a task force to help create guidelines for treating oncologists using available published literature. The taskforce focused on the ambulatory care testing guidelines only, as all inpatients receiving antineoplastic therapy are tested for COVID-19 prior to hospital admission. The guidelines focus solely on the safety and well-being of the individual patient undergoing antineoplastic therapy and are not designed to address infection control issues.","Reidy-Lagunes, Diane; Saltz, Leonard; Postow, Michael; Scordo, Michael; Moskowitz, Alison; Tew, William; Zamarin, Dmitriy; Redelman-Sidi, Gil",J. natl. cancer inst,153,33

This paper examines the intricate balance between health and the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the policy options needed to assist countries to implement strategies to protect the health of their citizens and promote economic recovery in this unprecedented global crisis situation. There is need for a coordinated public-private sector partnership in the recovery plan of each country, taking into account their contextual and country specific health system and economy, but not discarding the universal application thereof.

This paper takes an alternative view: if not unpredictable, the crisis unfolding in the United Kingdom (UK) is not unprecedented. Rather, it is foretold in accounts of successive animal health crises. Social studies of biosecurity and animal disease management provide an “anticipatory logic” - a mirror to the unfolding human catastrophe of Covid-19, providing few surprises. And yet, these accounts appear to be routinely ignored in the narrative of Covid-19. Do social studies of animal disease really have no value when it comes to guiding and assessing responses to Covid-19? To answer this question, we describe the narrative arc of the UK's approach to managing Covid-19. We then overlay findings from social studies of animal disease to reveal the warnings they provided for a pandemic like Covid-19. We conclude by reflecting on the reasons why these studies have been paid minimal attention and the extent to which the failure to learn from these lessons of animal health management signals a failure of the One Health agenda.","Enticott, Gareth; Maye, Damian",Front.

Herein we evaluated the interest in measuring the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a biomarker of intestinal injury, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Serum I-FABP was analyzed in 28 consecutive patients hospitalized for a PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in 24 hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases, and 79 patients admitted to the emergency room for abdominal pain. RESULTS: I-FABP serum concentrations were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19, as compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases [70.3 pg/mL (47-167.9) vs. 161.1 pg/mL (88.98-305.2), respectively, p = 0.008]. I-FABP concentrations in these two populations were significantly lower than in patients with abdominal pain without COVID-19 [344.8 pg/mL (268.9-579.6)]. I-FABP was neither associated with severity nor the duration of symptoms. I-FABP was correlated with polymorphonuclear cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we observed a low I-FABP concentration in COVID-19 patients either with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, of which the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical impact remain to be established. Further explorations on a larger cohort of patients will be needed to unravel the molecular mechanism of such observation, including the effects of malabsorption and/or abnormal lipid metabolism.","Guedj, Kevin; Uzzan, Mathieu; Soudan, Damien; Trichet, Catherine; Nicoletti, Antonino; Weiss, Emmanuel; Manceau, Hana; Nuzzo, Alexandre; Corcos, Olivier; Treton, Xavier; Peoc039,; h, Katell",PLoS One,153,25

A literature search was conducted using publications from academic databases and websites of relevant organisations. The disease is associated with typical and atypical signs and symptoms, mimicking other common illnesses. Nigeria is now in the phase of widespread community transmission as almost all the states have reported confirmed cases. The pandemic has shown a wide range of case-fatality rate (CFR) globally; this is postulated to be related to the demographics, existing health systems and probably other unidentified factors. There has been a steady increase in the burden caused by the disease in Nigeria with a relatively stable CFR, which is lower than the global CFR. Health systems have responded with the guidelines for prevention, management, and surveillance of the disease, while effort is being put in place to find a vaccine and a specific therapy for the cure of the disease. The pandemic has had a severe effect on health systems globally, including an unintended disruption in the service delivery of other diseases. It has the potential to disrupt the weak health system in Nigeria significantly. As such, a combination of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures that are cost-effective needs to be scaled up to prevent it from further weakening the existing health system.","Akande, Oluwatosin Wuraola; Akande, Tanimola Makanjuola",Niger Postgrad Med J,153,27

A positive aspect of this model is the consideration of random inventory, delivery capacities and supplier's reliability. Additionally, we assume supplier capacity follows an exponential distribution. This inventory model addresses the problem of a manufacturer having an imperfect production system with single supplier and single retailer and considers the quantity of product (Q), reorder points (r) and reliability factors (n) as the decision variables. The main contribution of our study is that we consider supplier may not be able to deliver the exact amount all the time a manufacturer needed. We also consider that the demand and the time interval between successive availability and unavailability of supplier and retailer follows a probability distribution. We use a genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution and compare the results with those obtained from simulated annealing algorithm. Findings reveal the optimal value of the decision variables to maximize the average profit in each cycle. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to increase the understanding of the developed model.

Our aim was to evaluate how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and related preventive strategies affected pediatric emergency rooms (ERs) during this period. We performed a retrospective cohort multicenter study, comparing the lockdown period to the corresponding period in 2019. We examined 15 Italian pediatric ERs in terms of visit rates, specific diagnoses (grouped as air communicable diseases and non-air communicable diseases), and triage categories. During the lockdown period, ER admissions decreased by 81% compared to 2019 (52,364 vs. 10,112). All ER specific diagnoses decreased in 2020 and this reduction was significantly higher for air communicable diseases (25,462 vs. 2934, p < 0.001). Considering the triage category, red codes remained similar (1% vs. 1%), yellow codes increased (11.2% vs. 22.3%), and green codes decreased (80.3% vs. 69.5%). We can speculate that social distancing and simple hygiene measures drastically reduced the spread of air communicable diseases.

Unfortunately, confiscated live animals often experience substandard care. In this study, we investigate the barriers to the ‘disposal’ of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia. ‘Disposal’ is the term used for what happens to illegally traded wildlife after confiscation. Guidelines for the ‘disposal’ of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual nations must enforce this within their own legislation. We interviewed 18 experts from seven countries in Southeast Asia revealing eight categories of barriers to the disposal of confiscated live animals. We then propose seven recommendations to help reform the disposal of confiscated live animals, which would support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife in Southeast Asia and globally.AbstractIncreased focus on the illegal global wildlife trade has resulted in greater numbers of live animals confiscated by authorities, increasing the need to manage these animals responsibly. Most wildlife seizures take place in Southeast Asia, with global demand for live animals fuelling much of the trafficking. Guidelines for the ‘disposal’ of live specimens are provided by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), although individual Parties must implement provisions through national laws and regulations. ‘Disposal’ is the term used for the management of illegally traded wildlife upon confiscation. Confiscated live animals can be euthanised (i.e., killed), repatriated to their native country and released, or kept in captivity. This study investigates barriers to proper care and disposal of confiscated live animals in Southeast Asia, where roughly one quarter of the global multibillion dollar illegal wildlife trade takes place. Interviews were conducted with 18 professionals working within conservation, wildlife crime, and confiscated live animal management. Eight limitations to the proper care and disposal of confiscated wildlife were identified: (1) political will, (2) policy, (3) funding, (4) capacity, (5) expertise (6) attitudes and behaviours, (7) exploitation, and (8) corruption. Based on interviews, we propose seven key reforms to support the efficient and humane management of illegally traded wildlife for national authorities and CITES parties. These are wildlife seizure management, legislative support, enhanced political will, demand reduction, global participation, registry of rescue centres, and terminology change. This research highlights major barriers to the proper care and disposal of live confiscated animals and proposes key reforms to improve the conservation of threatened species and the welfare of millions of illegally traded animals.","Knight, Andrew McCulloch Steven P.",Animals,153,1

The immune system is considered to play a crucial role for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, although especially the contribution of innate-like T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed the phenotype and function of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, innate-like T cells with potent antimicrobial effector function, in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 by multicolour flow cytometry. Our data indicate that MAIT cells are highly activated in patients with COVID-19, irrespective of the course of disease, and express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A and TNF&#945; ex vivo. Of note, expression of the activation marker HLA-DR positively correlated with SAPS II score, a measure of disease severity. Upon MAIT cell-specific in vitro stimulation, MAIT cells however failed to upregulate expression of the cytokines IL-17A and TNF&#945;, as well as cytolytic proteins, that is, granzyme B and perforin. Thus, our data point towards an altered cytokine expression profile alongside an impaired antibacterial and antiviral function of MAIT cells in COVID-19 and thereby contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Deschler, Sebastian; Kager, Juliane; Erber, Johanna; Fricke, Lisa; Koyumdzhieva, Plamena; Georgieva, Alexandra; Lahmer, Tobias; Wiessner, Johannes R; Voit, Florian; Schneider, Jochen; Horstmann, Julia; Iakoubov, Roman; Treiber, Matthias; Winter, Christof; Ruland, Jürgen; Busch, Dirk H; Knolle, Percy A; Protzer, Ulrike; Spinner, Christoph D; Schmid, Roland M; Quante, Michael; Böttcher, Katrin",Viruses,153,14

Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity.

As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. The majority of existing models assume random diffusion but do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals, i.e. the underlying human interaction network, whose structure is known to be scale-free. Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals. Although applicable to infectious disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models.","Herrmann, Helena A; Schwartz, Jean-Marc",Phys. biol,153,16

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world; indeed, this infection has been declared a pandemic. Consequently, the scientific community is working hard to gain useful information about the history of this virus, its transmission, diagnosis, clinical features, radiological findings, research and development of candidate therapeutics as well as vaccines. This review aims to analyze the diagnostic techniques used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection, critically reviewing positive points and criticism for forensic implications, obviously including autopsy. Finally, this review proposes a practical workflow to be applied in the management of corpses during this outbreak of the COVID-19 infection, which could be useful in cases of future infectious disease emergencies. Analyzing the diagnostic methods, to date, virus nucleic acid RT-PCR represents the standard method used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection in living subjects and corpses, even if this technique has several criticisms: mainly, the staff should be highly specialized, working in high-throughput settings, able to handle high workloads and aware of health risks and the importance of the results. Thus, IgG/IgM serological tests have been developed, overcoming RT-qPCR duration, costs, and management, not requiring highly trained personnel. Nevertheless, serological tests present problems; the WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. Furthermore, nothing has yet been published regarding the possibility of applying these methods during post-mortem investigations. In light of this scenario, in this review, we suggest a flow chart for the pathologist called on to ascertain the cause of death of a subject with historical and clinical findings of COVID-19 status or without any anamnestic, diagnostic, or exposure information. Indeed, the literature data confirmed the analytical vulnerabilities of the kits used for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly during postmortem examinations. For these reasons, autopsy remains the gold standard method to ascertain the exact cause of death (from or with COVID-19 infection, or other causes), to consequently provide real data for statistical evaluations and to take necessary measures to contain the risks of the infection.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands a response to prevent a peak in the prevalence of mental health problems and to avoid the collapse of mental health services, which are scarce and inaccessible due to the pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to review articles on the effectiveness of bibliotherapy on different mental health problems. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to examine relevant studies that assess the effectiveness of bibliotherapy in different clinical settings as a treatment capable of enhancing a sense of purpose and its surrounding values. To achieve this, a systematic review, including a bioethical meta-analysis, was performed. A variant of the PICO (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) model was used for the search strategy, and the systematic review was conducted in three databases: PubMed, Bireme, and OVID. Inclusion criteria were relevant studies that included the keywords, excluding documents with irrelevant topics, studies on subjects 15 years or younger, and in languages besides Spanish or English. Starting with 707 studies, after three rounds of different quality criteria, 13 articles were selected for analysis, including a hermeneutic analysis, which was followed by a fourth and final recovery round assessing bibliotherapy articles concerning healthcare workers. Results: Our findings showed that through bibliotherapy, patients developed several capacities, including the re-signification of their own activities through a new outlook of their moral horizon. There are no research road maps serving as guides to conduct research on the use of bibliotherapy to enhance mental health. Additionally, values such as autonomy and justice were closely linked with positive results in bibliotherapy. This implies that bibliotherapy has the potential to have a positive impact in different settings. Conclusions: Our contribution is to offer a road map that presents state-of-the-art bibliotherapy research, which will assist institutions and healthcare professionals to plan clinical and specific interventions with positive outcomes.","Monroy-Fraustro, Daniela; Maldonado-Castellanos, Isaac; Aboites-Molina, Mónica; Rodríguez, Susana; Sueiras, Perla; Altamirano-Bustamante, Nelly F; de Hoyos-Bermea, Adalberto; Altamirano-Bustamante, Myriam M",Front Public Health,153,24

In absence of any valid and appropriate vaccines to combat this newly evolved agent, there is need of novel resource molecules for treatment and prophylaxis. To this effect, flavonol morin which is found in fruits, vegetables and various medicinal herbs has been evaluated for its antiviral potential in the present study. PASS analysis of morin versus reference antiviral drugs baricitinib, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine revealed that morin displayed no violations of Lipinski's rule of five and other druglikeness filters. Morin also displayed no tumorigenic, reproductive or irritant effects and exhibited good absorption and permeation through GI (clogP <5). In principal component analysis, morin appeared closest to baricitinib in 3D space. Morin displayed potent binding to spike glycoprotein, main protease 3CLPro and papain-like protease PLPro of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using molecular docking and significant binding to three viral-specific host proteins viz. human ACE2, importin-&#945; and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, further lending support to its antiviral efficacy. Additionally, morin displayed potent binding to pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, 8 and 10 also supporting its anti-inflammatory activity. MD simulation of morin with SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro and PLPro displayed strong stability at 300 K. Both complexes exhibited constant RMSDs of protein side chains and C&#945; atoms throughout the simulation run time. In conclusion, morin might hold considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment and management of not only COVID-19, but also SARS and MERS if studied further. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Hereby, how to connect the rural areas and what are the difficulties of providing connectivity draw great attention. This article first provides a brief discussion about existing technologies and strategies for enhancing the network coverage in rural areas, their advantages, limitations, and cost. Next, we mainly focus on the UAV-assisted network in resource-limited regions. Considering the limitation of the on-board battery of UAVs and the electricity supply scarcity in some rural regions, we investigate the possibility and performance enhancement of the deployment of renewable energy (RE) charging stations. We outline three practical scenarios, and use simulation results to demonstrate that RE charging stations can be a possible solution to address the limited on-board battery of UAVs in rural areas, specially when they can harvest and store enough energy.

PURPOSE: To describe an approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy development at a school of pharmacy aimed at stakeholder investment and infrastructure that can address systemic challenges in various healthcare settings. SUMMARY: The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy utilized an organizational approach focused on infrastructure to produce a diverse and inclusive school community. The Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) established vision and mission statements to represent the school's commitment and conducted a comprehensive environmental scan to compose a shared vision. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni participated in a series of retreats, symposiums, and focus groups to identify opportunities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive school community. A working group comprised of key leaders in the school developed and launched a 3-year DEI Strategic Plan along with initiatives and metrics for year 1. The plan's 3 priorities were (1) to recruit and retain diverse talent, (2) to prepare culturally intelligent professionals, and (3) to build an inclusive community. The ODI collaborated with internal and external stakeholders, which included students, faculty, staff, postdocs, alumni, and partners from health systems, industry, and other institutions and organizations, to initiate, implement, and monitor progress through an organizational approach to establish accountability and greater commitment. CONCLUSION: An organizational approach to DEI strategy through stakeholder engagement and infrastructure increased commitment and shared ownership among members of the school community. Applications in an organizational approach can be adapted to multiple healthcare settings to contribute to the cultural transformation necessary to develop a diverse and inclusive healthcare workforce.","White, Carla Y; Patel, Ami; Cossari, Dominique",Am. j. health system pharm,153,2

Considering the role of cigarette smoking in the pathogenesis of lung diseases and the effect of nicotine on expression of the entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is important to determine the implications of smoking in COVID-19. Methods: In this brief report, by using the published articles in the literature, we aimed to compare the reported prevalence of smoking in patients with COVID-19 to the prevalence of smoking in the general population of the corresponding report. Binomial tests were conducted and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among the screened papers, we found 12 peer-reviewed articles in which epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, including smoking status, were stated. Based on the descriptive reports of characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we observed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 patients with smoking history compared to what is expected, given the population average for each study’s geographic area. Conclusion: This analysis of available data showed a lower prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 patients in comparison to the regional average. Considering the limitations of the study, the results should be interpreted with great caution and be viewed just as a preliminary report to motivate related basic and clinical researches.","Tajlil, Arezou; Ghaffari, Samad; Pourafkari, Leili; Mashayekhi, Sina; Roshanravan, Neda",J.

METHODOLOGY: This was an experimental study on healthy human volunteers (n=8 eyes). In an experimental setup, NCT was performed on eyes (n=8) of human volunteers under normal settings, with a single and 2 drops of lubricant. High-speed shadowgraphy, frontal lighting technique, and fluorescein analysis were used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. Mathematical computation of the spread of the droplets was then performed. RESULTS: In a natural setting, there was no droplet or aerosol production. Minimal splatter along with droplet ejection was observed when 1 drop of lubricant was used before NCT. When 2 drops of lubricant were instilled, a significant amount of fluid ejection in the form of a sheet that broke up into multiple droplets was observed. Some of these droplets traversed back to the tonometer. Droplets ranging from 100 to 500 µm in diameter were measured. CONCLUSIONS: There was no droplet generation during NCT performed in a natural setting. However, NCT should be avoided in conditions with high-tear volume (natural or artificial) as it would lead to droplet spread and tactile contamination.","Shetty, Rohit; Balakrishnan, Nikhil; Shroff, Sujani; Shetty, Naren; Kabi, Prasenjit; Roy, Durbar; Joseph, Sophia M; Khamar, Pooja; Basu, Saptarshi; Sinha Roy, Abhijit",J Glaucoma,153,6

Schematically, two antagonistic and extreme strategies have been proposed, zero-covid and herd immunity. Between the two, often oscillating measures, based on medical but also societal and political considerations, have been taken without any major effect on the course of the epidemic. Vaccines are a game-changer by providing a real opportunity to sustainably protect everyone against infection and eliminate the circulation of the virus. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, the three currently authorized in France, overall induce remarkable protection rates of 95 %, 94 % and 70 % respectively. The surprise came from that this efficacy was obtained after a rapid development, by targeting only the viral protein S as antigen, and by using the administration of expression vectors innovative in vaccinology, consisting of either messenger RNA or recombinant adenovirus. However, bringing the epidemic under control requires a well-organized mass vaccination campaign. It also requires careful monitoring of many parameters such as the occurrence of adverse events, duration of induced immunity, vaccine efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, interest or not of vaccinating people already infected, vaccination of immunocompromised patients. Vaccination must be accompanied by the maintenance of barrier measures and gestures and an amplification of clinical and biological investigations both to validate its effectiveness on the Covid-19 epidemic and to prepare for future developments in vaccinology.","Agut, Henri",Virologie (Montrouge),153,8
255747,255747,255747,Pharmacological treatment options which can be considered for covid-19,15.623207,6.3635516,2020,"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",,153,26

In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.","Amirian, E.

How other factors can explain this bias remains unclear. So two experiments investigated how complying with public health recommendations during the COVID19 pandemic depended on victim portrayal, reflection, and philosophical beliefs (Total N = 998). Only one experiment found that messaging about individual victims increased compliance compared to messaging about statistical victims-i.e., ""flatten the curve"" graphs-an effect that was undetected after controlling for other factors. However, messaging about flu (vs. COVID19) indirectly reduced compliance by reducing perceived threat of the pandemic. Nevertheless, moral beliefs predicted compliance better than messaging and reflection in both experiments. The second experiment's additional measures revealed that religiosity, political preferences, and beliefs about science also predicted compliance. This suggests that flouting public health recommendations may be less about ineffective messaging or reasoning than philosophical differences.","Byrd, Nick; Bialek, Michal",Cognition,153,22

We conducted a study in technical secondary school and college students before and during the pandemic to explore changes in PLEs and relevant influential factors. METHODS: A total of 938 students completed both waves of the survey through electronic questionnaires. PLEs were assessed using the 15-item Positive Subscale of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-P15). Childhood trauma, perceived stress, resilience, and demographic factors were evaluated at baseline, and psychological status was measured during the pandemic. RESULTS: The overall CAPE-P15 scores significantly decreased during the pandemic. Students with persistent PLEs showed the most severe COVID-19 related psychological symptoms, followed by new-onset and remitted individuals; those without PLEs exhibited the mildest symptoms (all p < .001). A single parent family (OR = 4.707), more childhood trauma (OR = 1.056), and a higher family income (OR = 1.658) were predictive of new-onset PLEs during the pandemic, while better resilience was a protective factor, associated with remission of previous PLEs (OR = 0.932). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a downward trend in the prevalence of PLEs during the pandemic, PLEs predict greater serious psychological impact due to COVID-19, especially for students with persistent PLEs. Interventions that cultivate students' resilience are urgently needed to reduce PLEs and improve mental health, especially for students from single parent households or those who have experienced childhood trauma.","Sun, Meng; Wang, Dongfang; Jing, Ling; Zhou, Liang",Schizophr Res,153,14

During the heating season, interior air buoyancy creates large pressure differentials in vertical shafts that can drive airflow from lower floors into upper floors. This pressure differential can result in the spread of contaminants throughout a building. Most recently, concern over COVID-19 has increased attention to the potential spread of airborne diseases in densely populated buildings. For many multi-unit residential buildings, suite ventilation has traditionally relied upon fresh air supplied through a mechanically pressurized corridor. In cold climates, large pressure differentials created by stack-effect can reduce the effectiveness of this approach. Multizone and CFD simulations are employed to analyze airflow and contaminant spread due to stack effect. Simulations are conducted on an idealized model of a 10-storey building using a range of experimentally derived airtightness parameters. Simulations demonstrate stack effect can reduce corridor ventilation to suites and even reverse the airflow for leakier buildings. Reduced airflow to suites can result in the accumulation of contaminants. Reversal of the airflow can allow contaminants from a suite to spread throughout the building. Contaminant spread is illustrated as a function of mechanical ventilation, building airtightness, and ambient temperatures. Strategies to reduce the influence of stack effect on mechanically pressurized corridors are discussed.","Mckeen, Philip; Liao, Zaiyi",Build Simul,153,2

Mobile technology offers greater convenience, but little is known regarding the efficacy of self-paced, mobile-delivered (mHealth) mindfulness interventions in this population. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of offering such an intervention for pregnant women with moderate-to-moderately-severe depression symptoms. Methods: We conducted a single-arm trial within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were identified through KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program. Eligible participants included English-speaking pregnant women (<28 weeks of gestation) with moderate-to-moderately-severe depressive symptoms without a regular (<3 times/week) mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to follow a self-paced, 6-week mindfulness meditation program using a mobile app, Headspace&#8482;, 10-20 min/day. Outcome measures included feasibility, acceptability, and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., depression symptoms). Results: Of the 27 women enrolled, 20 (74%) completed the study. Over half (55%) of participants used the app &#8805;50% of the days during the 6-week intervention. Responses to the semi-structured interviews indicated that women appreciated the convenience of the intervention and the ability to engage without having to attend classes or arrange childcare. We observed significant improvements in pre-postintervention scores for depression symptoms, perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and mindfulness. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for women with moderate-to-moderately-severe antenatal depression symptoms. The preliminary data further suggest that an efficacy trial is warranted.","Kubo, Ai; Aghaee, Sara; Kurtovich, Elaine M; Nkemere, Linda; Quesenberry, Charles P; McGinnis, MegAnn K; Avalos, Lyndsay A",Mindfulness (N Y),153,10

The following recommendations were developed in relation to the three defined types of TOS (neurogenic, venous, and arterial) and three phases of pandemic response (preparatory, urgent with limited resources, and emergency with complete diversion of resources). â¢ In-person evaluation and treatment for neurogenic TOS (interventional or surgical) are generally postponed during all pandemic phases, with telephone/telemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises recommended when feasible. â¢ Venous TOS presenting with acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is managed primarily with anticoagulation, with percutaneous interventions for venous TOS (thrombolysis) considered in early phases (I and II) and surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases, with definitive surgical treatment postponed. â¢ Evaluation and surgical treatment for arterial TOS should be reserved for limb-threatening situations, such as acute upper extremity ischemia or acute digital embolization, in all phases of pandemic response. In late pandemic phases, surgery should be restricted to thrombolysis or brachial artery thromboembolectomy, with more definitive treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve.","Ohman, J Westley; Annest, Stephen J; Azizzadeh, Ali; Burt, Bryan M; Caputo, Francis J; Chan, Colin; Donahue, Dean M; Freischlag, Julie A; Gelabert, Hugh A; Humphries, Misty D; Illig, Karl A; Lee, Jason T; Lum, Ying Wei; Meyer, Richard D; Pearl, Gregory J; Ransom, Erin F; Sanders, Richard J; Teijink, Joep A W; Vaccaro, Patrick S; van Sambeek, Marc R H M; Vemuri, Chandu; Thompson, Robert W",J. vasc. surg,153,29

Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of 274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples' qualitative responses about their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133 of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance. There were nuanced differences between the egalitarian strategies in their relationships with outcomes, with the Alternating Days egalitarian category emerging as the overall strategy that best preserved wives' and husbands' well-being while allowing both to maintain adequate job performance.

The youngest age group (18-24) was most burdened and showed significantly more mental health symptoms compared with the oldest age group (65+) in depressive symptoms (50% vs. 12%), anxiety symptoms (35% vs. 10%), and insomnia (25% vs. 11%, all p-values &lt; 0.05). Mental health decreased compared to both the first lockdown earlier in 2020 and pre-pandemic data. Further analyses indicate these findings were especially apparent for the under 24-year-olds, women, single/separated people, low incomes and those who do not partake in any physical activity (all p-values &lt; 0.05). We highlight the need for ongoing mental health support, particularly to the most burdened groups.","Dale, R.; Budimir, S.; Probst, T.; Stippl, P.; Pieh, C.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],153,15

Due to an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) transmission, elective surgical treatment has been suspended in many centers. The effects of COVID-19 in the early post-operative period after esophagectomy remains unknown. In this report, we present three cases of patients diagnosed with esophago-gastric junction cancer who were scheduled for elective esophagectomy with a curative intention during second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in a single high-volume tertiary center. Despite all available safety measures, one of the patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia on post-operative day two, leading to an impaired respiratory function and increased pleural fluid collection from the chest tube, resulting in a prolonged time of hospital stay. Finding a good balance between the COVID-19-related perioperative risks and consequences of delaying surgical treatment in patients diagnosed with esophago-gastric cancer is a challenge. In order to achieve the best possible outcome, care must be taken to ensure availability of necessary treatment options and to reduce the risk of SARS-Cov-2 transmission perioperatively.","Nurczyk, Kamil; Chan, Chia-En; Nowak, Norbert; Skoczylas, Tomasz",Curr Oncol,153,20

Its contribution within schools is described in the literature especially with regard to the management of chronic diseases and health education interventions. The Sars-CoV2 pandemic has forced many states to close schools, involving major psycho-social problems. The reopening of schools is a great challenge, in this regard this work has the goal of evaluating the literature that identifies the figure of the school nurse as a strength in containing the spread of contagious diseases and the actions that can be effective for this purpose. METHODS: An integrative literature review was conducted by interrogating the main international medical-nursing databases, all research articles were included, editorials and letters were excluded. Results were screened independently by two investigators. RESULTS: 10 articles were included, the main purpose of which was to describe outbreak cases and strategies for their management. The major nursing interventions highlighted are surveillance, case reporting, education, management of relationships with families, collaboration with other professionals. DISCUSSION: Although the identified literature was quantitatively poor, it is clear that the school nurse is central to syndromic surveillance, educational role, decision making, clinical management, collaboration with the team of experts and management of communication.","Guarinoni, Milena Giovanna; Lardelli, Marco; Motta, Paolo Carlo",Prof Inferm,153,24

Still, little is known about the impact of COVID-19-induced microscale damage in the lung on global lung dynamics. This review summarizes the key histological features of SARS-CoV-2 infected alveoli and links the findings to structural tissue changes and surfactant dysfunction affecting tissue mechanical behavior similar to changes seen in other lung injury. Along with typical findings of diffuse alveolar damage affecting the interstitium of the alveolar walls and blood-gas barrier in the alveolar airspace, COVID-19 can cause extensive microangiopathy in alveolar capillaries that further contribute to mechanical changes in the tissues and may differentiate it from previously studied infectious lung injury. Understanding microlevel damage impact on tissue mechanics allows for better understanding of macroscale respiratory dynamics. Knowledge gained from studies into the relationship between microscale and macroscale lung mechanics can allow for optimized treatments to improve patient outcomes in case of COVID-19 and future respiratory-spread pandemics.","Dimbath, Elizabeth; Maddipati, Veeranna; Stahl, Jennifer; Sewell, Kerry; Domire, Zachary; George, Stephanie; Vahdati, Ali",Life Sci,153,26

Particular attention has focused on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its correlation with psychotic symptom severity. Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis and also has immunomodulating properties. It has been hypothesized that inflammatory disturbances are a common underlying pathology between cannabis use and psychosis. We measured inflammatory markers in individuals admitted to a psychiatric unit with acute psychosis who had toxicology positive for natural and/or synthetic cannabinoids (n = 59) compared to patients with negative cannabinoid toxicology (n = 60). Psychosis severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). While PANSS scores were similar between groups, cannabinoid-positive participants were more likely to receive pro re nata (PRN or as-needed) medications for agitation in the psychiatric emergency room, particularly synthetic cannabinoid-positive participants. In unadjusted models, cannabinoid-positive participants had lower interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) levels (p = 0.046), but this finding was not significant after adjusting for covariates and multiple comparisons. Among cannabinoid-positive participants, IL-6 levels negatively correlated with PANSS total score (p = 0.040), as well as positive (p = 0.035) and negative (p = 0.024) subscales. Results suggest inflammatory alterations among psychotic individuals with comorbid cannabinoid use.","Gibson, Claire L; Bassir Nia, Anahita; Spriggs, Sharron A; DeFrancisco, Daniel; Swift, Amy; Perkel, Charles; Zhong, Xiaobo; Mazumdar, Madhu; Fernandez, Nicolas; Patel, Manishkumar; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Hurd, Yasmin L",Psychiatry Res,153,26

The great effort put in the development of ionizable lipids with increased in vivo potency brought LNPs from the laboratory benches to the FDA approval of patisiran in 2018 and the ongoing clinical trials for mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Despite these success stories, several challenges remain in RNA delivery, including what is known as ""endosomal escape."" Reaching the cytosol is mandatory for unleashing the therapeutic activity of RNA molecules, as their accumulation in other intracellular compartments would simply result in efficacy loss. In LNPs, the ability of ionizable lipids to form destabilizing non-bilayer structures at acidic pH is recognized as the key for endosomal escape and RNA cytosolic delivery. This is motivating a surge in studies aiming at designing novel ionizable lipids with improved biodegradation and safety profiles. In this work, we describe the journey of RNA-loaded LNPs across multiple intracellular barriers, from the extracellular space to the cytosol. In silico molecular dynamics modeling, in vitro high-resolution microscopy analyses, and in vivo imaging data are systematically reviewed to distill out the regulating mechanisms underlying the endosomal escape of RNA. Finally, a comparison with strategies employed by enveloped viruses to deliver their genetic material into cells is also presented. The combination of a multidisciplinary analytical toolkit for endosomal escape quantification and a nature-inspired design could foster the development of future LNPs with improved cytosolic delivery of nucleic acids.","Schlich, Michele; Palomba, Roberto; Costabile, Gabriella; Mizrahy, Shoshy; Pannuzzo, Martina; Peer, Dan; Decuzzi, Paolo",Bioeng Transl Med,153,16

METHOD AND RESULTS: Patients with unilateral and isolated angle or condylar fractures were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Data was collected from patient records and panoramic x-rays. The predictor variables included the type of occlusal support and the presence or absence of third molars. The outcome variable was angle or condylar fracture, while other predictor variables included demographic factors. Bivariate (&#967;2 test) and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between variables and the outcome. 43 angle (mean age: 29.9 ± 12.8 years; 98.4% male) and 37 condylar (mean age: 46.8 ± 20.2 years; 62.2% male) fracture cases were included in this study. Bilateral occlusal support was present in 81.4% of angle fracture group and in 51.3% of condylar fracture group (p<0.001). In the case of bilateral occlusal support, an odds ratio (OR) of 4.2 was found for angle fractures (p<0.006). A third molar was present in 86% of the angle fracture group and in 43.2% of the condylar fracture group (p<0.001). The presence of a third molar exhibited an odds ratio of 8.1 for the angle fractures (p<0.001). When bilateral occlusal support and third molar were present simultaneously, the risk was 15.9 times higher for an angle fracture (p<0.001).

In both mouse and rhesus macaque models, viral replication and histopathological injuries caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are significantly inhibited by dalbavancin administration. Given its high safety and long plasma half-life (8-10 days) shown in previous clinical trials, our data indicate that dalbavancin is a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.","Wang, Gan; Yang, Meng-Li; Duan, Zi-Lei; Liu, Feng-Liang; Jin, Lin; Long, Cheng-Bo; Zhang, Min; Tang, Xiao-Peng; Xu, Ling; Li, Ying-Chang; Kamau, Peter Muiruri; Yang, Lian; Liu, Hong-Qi; Xu, Jing-Wen; Chen, Jie-Kai; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Peng, Xiao-Zhong; Lai, Ren",Cell res,153,1

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) addressed the disruption that COVID-19 has caused and the negative impact it has made on both physical and mental health of athletes (14). The purpose of this research study was to examine the mental distress and programming needs of Division III student-athletes in response to COVID-19. Through the use of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), anxiety was assessed among participants suggesting that both genders and all academic years have experienced some level of anxiety during this pandemic which deserve to be addressed and explored on a deeper level. Significant findings revealed that female participants were more likely than male participants to effectively manage their schoolwork, use social media at least four hours per day, express worry for the future and the fall 2020 semester related to COVID-19, experience challenges moving home, and to utilize mindfulness practices. Findings also revealed that as compared to other races/ethnicities, white participants indicating experiencing higher challenges regarding social distancing. Mental distress was associated with lack of resources and the absence of available facilities to train for their sport.

METHODS: Interested participants, n=28, actively employed as medical personnel, support staff and emergency responders, in the Midwestern USA in May-June of 2020, provided informed consent and were randomised to complete either low-dose or high-dose intervention, one time daily for 1 week via smartphone application. Each daily intervention included expressive writing, adaptive emotion regulation activity and (one vs two) positive emotion-generation activities, lasting 3-6 min a day. Ratings of negative and positive emotion were provided before and after each activity daily. Analyses tested compliance, acceptability, as well as efficacy at increasing positive emotion and decreasing negative emotion with each use and across time. RESULTS: The results indicated a 13% increase in positive emotion, t(25)=2.01, p=0.056; and decrease in negative emotion by 44%, t(25)=-4.00, p=0.001 across both doses. However, there was a clear advantage for individuals in the high-dose condition as daily boosts in positive emotion were significantly greater (an additional 9.4%) B=0.47, p=0.018. Overall, compliance was good. Acceptability ratings were good for those who completed the follow-up assessment. CONCLUSION: Front-line personnel, including medical staff and emergency responders, are experiencing unprecedented psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation suggests both feasibility and efficacy for a brief, daily, ambulatory intervention which could provide essential psychological support to individuals at risk in the workplace.","Coifman, Karin G; Disabato, David D; Seah, T H Stanley; Ostrowski-Delahanty, Sarah; Palmieri, Patrick A; Delahanty, Douglas L; Gunstad, John",Occup. environ. med,153,1

In some cases, seventeen (17) or more potentially toxic compounds are found in a single street purchased bag or block of cocaine or heroin. Pharmacologically active compounds, impurities, or breakdown products from drug manufacturing and industrial chemicals (collectively referred to as toxic adulterants) are now found in street drugs. They include, but are not limited to: Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihistamines, anthelmintics, anesthetics, anti-inflammatorys, antipyretics, analgesics, antispasmodics, antiarrhythmics, antimalarials, veterinary medications, bronchodilators, expectorants, sedatives, muscle relaxers, natural/synthetic hallucinogens, decongest- ants, new psychoactive substances (NPS), industrial compounds, fungicides, and impurities in the manufacturing process. All can be found within a single street purchase of heroin or cocaine. Routine clinical or workplace drug testing will not detect all these toxic adulterants. Only specialty forensic tests, specifically ordered, will detect them. The synergistic effect on the human body of such an unprecedented combination of pharmacologically active compounds is unknown and potentially deadly. This is especially seen in daily substance users who are exposed to these combinations multiple times a day over an extended period of time. Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have several co-occurring health problems that make them more susceptible to COVID-19, including compromised immune, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. These problems are high-risk factors for the acquisition of COVID-19 infection and more serious complications from the virus, including hospitalization and death. Objective: The study aims to bring to the attention of public health officials, addiction medicine specialists, treatment officials, therapists, and the general public the alarming increase of dangerous toxic adulterants being added to street drugs and their potentially lethal synergistic effects. Also, it aims to provide insights into how these new formulations can have serious pathophysiological effects on individuals with Substance Abuse Disorders (SUDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The literature on street drug cutting agents, toxic adulterants, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, and other industrial compounds will be reviewed. Also, a review of the literature of pathophysiological effects, especially on SUD patients, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented. This is combined with international and USA studies that were carried out by the Colombo Plan that identified these new combinations of toxic adulterants in street drugs, using state-of-the-art field and forensic laboratory detection technologies. Results: The majority of street drugs, in some cases more than ninety-five percent, now have multiple toxic adulterants. It is rare that a street purchase of cocaine or heroin does not contain multiple toxic adulterants, cutting agents, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, or industrial chemicals. Conclusion: This dangerous new composition in world street drug supply is unprecedented and may be the undetected cause of many psychostimulant and opioid overdose deaths, as many toxic adulter- ants are not routinely tested in post-mortem or street drug seizure cases. In addition, several of these toxic adulterants create a catastrophic drop in white blood cells, causing neutropenia and making the substance users susceptible to a wide range of opportunistic infections, including COVID-19. This profound change in the world street drug supply has catastrophic implications for individuals with SUDs and our health care system, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Browne, T.; Gold, M.

To the best of our knowledge, there is not any embracing published review about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic literature review. A search in the PubMed database was performed, with the terms 'psychotropic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'psychiatry' and 'pandemic'. Consensus and clinical guidelines about psychotropic drugs and COVID-19 approach, published by scientific societies, governmental entities and drug regulatory agencies were included. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We present the recommendations about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19. The regular treatment of mentally ill patients with COVID-19 presents increased complexity.","Andrade, Gabriela; Simões do Couto, Frederico; Câmara-Pestana, Luis",Acta Med Port,153,33

Several communications claimed in the first weeks of March 2020 that the mitigation in air pollution observed at that time was actually related to these lockdown measures without considering that seasonal variations in emissions and meteorology also influence air quality. To determine the specific impact of lockdown measures on air quality in northern Italy, we compared observations from the European Commission Atmospheric Observatory of Ispra (regional background) and from the regional environmental protection agency (ARPA) air monitoring stations in the Milan conurbation (urban background) with expected values for these observations using two different approaches. On the one hand, intensive aerosol variables determined from specific aerosol characterisation observations performed in Ispra were compared to their 3-year averages. On the other hand, ground-level measured concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, PM10, O3, NO, SO2) were compared to expected concentrations derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Regional (CAMS) ensemble model forecasts, which did not account for lockdown measures. From these comparisons, we show that NO2 concentrations decreased as a consequence of the lockdown by -30 % and-40 % on average at the urban and regional background sites, respectively. Unlike NO2, PM10 concentrations were not significantly affected by lockdown measures. This could be due to any decreases in PM10 (and PM10 precursors) emissions from traffic being compensated for by increases in emissions from domestic heating and/or from changes in the secondary aerosol formation regime resulting from the lockdown measures. The implementation of the lockdown measures also led to an increase in the highest O3 concentrations at both the urban and regional background sites resulting from reduced titration of O3 by NO. The relaxation of the lockdown measures beginning in May resulted in close-to-expected NO2 concentrations in the urban background and to significant increases in PM10 in comparison to expected concentrations at both regional and urban background sites.","Jean-Philippe, Putaud Pozzoli Luca Pisoni Enrico Sebastiao Martins Dos Santos Lagler Friedrich Lanzani Guido Umberto Dal Santo Augustin Colette",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,153,24

Methods: We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time.

These microorganisms have multiple different types of interaction with each other. A plethora of evidence suggests that they can regulate immune and digestive systems and also play roles in various diseases, such as mental, cardiovascular, metabolic and some skin diseases. In addition, they take-part in some current health problems like diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancers and infections. Viral infection is one of the most common and problematic health care issues, particularly in recent years that pandemics like SARS and COVID-19 caused a lot of financial and physical damage to the world. There are plenty of articles investigating the interaction between microbiota and infectious diseases. We focused on stimulatory to suppressive effects of microbiota on viral infections, hoping to find a solution to overcome this current pandemic. Then we reviewed mechanistically the effects of both microbiota and probiotics on most of the viruses. But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system's microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures.","Baghbani, Taha; Nikzad, Hossein; Azadbakht, Javid; Izadpanah, Fatemeh; Haddad Kashani, Hamed",Microb Cell Fact,153,8

Stringency of imposed measures universally reflects the standpoint from which protecting public health and avoiding damage to economy are seen as contradictory objectives. Based on epidemic trajectories of 25 highly developed countries and 10 US states in the (mobility reduction)-(reproduction number) plane we showed that delay in imposition of nation-wide quarantine elevates the number of infections and deaths, surge of which inevitably has to be suppressed by stringent and sustained lockdown. As a consequence, cumulative mobility reduction and population-normalized cumulative number of COVID-19-associated deaths are significantly correlated and this correlation increases with time. Overall, we demonstrated that, as long as epidemic suppression is the aim, the trade-off between the death toll and economic loss is illusory: high death toll correlates with deep and long-lasting lockdown causing a severe economic downturn.","Kochanczyk, Marek; Lipniacki, Tomasz",Sci Rep,153,1

Respiratory decline in patients with COVID-19 is precipitated by a lung-mediated aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose lung radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes for select patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A single-institution trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is being performed for the first time. This report describes outcomes of a planned day 7 interim analysis. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidation, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. RESULTS: Of 9 patients screened, 5 were treated with whole-lung radiation on April 24 until April 28 2020, and they were followed for a minimum of 7 days. The median age was 90 years (range, 64-94 years), and 4 were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, 3 patients (60%) were weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, 4 (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) was weaned from oxygen at hour 96. The mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot trial of 5 oxygen-dependent elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvements in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic consolidation without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation appears to be safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study. LAY SUMMARY: Researchers at Emory University report preliminary safety outcomes for patients treated with low-dose lung irradiation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Five residents of nursing or group homes were hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19. Each had pneumonia visible on a chest x-ray, required supplemental oxygen, and experienced a clinical decline in mental status or in work of breathing or a prolonged or escalating supplemental oxygen requirement. A single treatment of low-dose (1.5-Gy) radiation to both lungs was delivered over the course of 10 to 15 minutes. There was no acute toxicity attributable to radiation therapy. Within 24 hours, 4 patients had rapidly improved breathing, and they recovered to room air at an average of 1.5 days (range, 3-96 hours). Three were discharged at a mean time of 12 days, and 1 was preparing for discharge. Blood tests and repeat imaging confirm that low-dose whole-lung radiation treatment appears safe for COVID-19 pneumonia. Further trials are warranted.","Hess, Clayton B; Buchwald, Zachary S; Stokes, William; Nasti, Tahseen H; Switchenko, Jeffrey M; Weinberg, Brent D; Steinberg, James P; Godette, Karen D; Murphy, David; Ahmed, Rafi; Curran, Walter J; Khan, Mohammad K",Cancer,153,6

To understand the pathogenicity and antigenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to profile the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The current map of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity is based on computational predictions and relies on homology with other coronaviruses. As the protein complement varies among coronaviruses, especially in regard to the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Here, using a suite of ribosome-profiling techniques2-4, we present a high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which enables us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs that are likely to have a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; instead, virus translation dominates host translation because of the high levels of viral transcripts.

In 2016, the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system launched a unique program to distribute video-enabled tablets to Veterans with access barriers. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the use of VA-issued video telehealth tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness in the VA system. DESIGN: Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we first evaluated the adoption of tablets among Veterans experiencing homelessness and housed Veterans. We then analyzed health record and tablet utilization data to compare characteristics of both subpopulations, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with tablet use among Veterans experiencing homelessness. PATIENTS: In total, 12,148 VA patients receiving tablets between October 2017 and March 2019, focusing on the 1470 VA Veterans experiencing homelessness receiving tablets (12.1%). MAIN MEASURES: Tablet use within 6 months of receipt for mental health, primary or specialty care. KEY RESULTS: Nearly half (45.9%) of Veterans experiencing homelessness who received a tablet had a video visit within 6 months of receipt, most frequently for telemental health. Tablet use was more common among Veterans experiencing homelessness who were younger (AOR = 2.77; P <.001); middle-aged (AOR = 2.28; P <.001); in rural settings (AOR = 1.46; P =.005); and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (AOR = 1.64; P <.001), and less common among those who were Black (AOR = 0.43; P <.001) and those with a substance use disorder (AOR = 0.59; P <.001) or persistent housing instability (AOR = 0.75; P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth care and connection for vulnerable populations are particularly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic but also beyond. VA's distribution of video telehealth tablets offers healthcare access to Veterans experiencing homelessness; however, barriers remain for subpopulations. Tailored training and support for these patients may be needed to optimize telehealth tablet use and effectiveness.","Garvin, Lynn A; Hu, Jiaqi; Slightam, Cindie; McInnes, D Keith; Zulman, Donna M",J. gen. intern. med,153,29

We present 5 cases of probable in-flight transmission in Greece. METHODS: We studied international passengers arriving to or departing from Greece from February 26 through March 9, 2020. Contact tracing extended up to 4 days before the onset of symptoms and focused on close contacts. Close contacts were defined as persons sitting within a distance of <2 m for >15 min, including passengers seated two seats around the index case and all crew members and persons who had close contact with the index case. RESULTS: We investigated 18 international flights with 2224 passengers and 110 crew members. Main countries of departure included Northern Italy, Israel and the United Kingdom. In accordance with the national surveillance investigation, in these flights there were 21 index cases and 891 contact traced cases. Six index cases were symptomatic during the flight. Of the 891 contact traced cases, 4 passengers and 1 crew member developed laboratory-confirmed infection (3 with COVID-19 and 2 with asymptomatic infection); they travelled on the same flight with two COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Air travel has played a central role in the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are scarce data about in-flight transmission.

DESIGN: Data resource comprising linked person level records from national healthcare settings for the English population, accessible within NHS Digital's new trusted research environment. SETTING: EHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, covid-19 laboratory test results, and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care, cardiovascular, and covid-19 vaccination data. PARTICIPANTS: 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 and registered with an NHS general practitioner in England. MAIN MEASURES OF INTEREST: Confirmed and suspected covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack and incident myocardial infarction) and all cause mortality between 1 January and 31 October 2020. RESULTS: The linked cohort includes more than 96% of the English population. By combining person level data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex, and ethnicity are complete for around 95% of the population. Among 53.3 million people with no previous diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 98 721 had a first ever incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack between 1 January and 31 October 2020, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records. Among 53.2 million people with no previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction, 62 966 had an incident myocardial infarction during follow-up, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death registry records. A total of 959 470 people had a confirmed or suspected covid-19 diagnosis (714 162 in primary care data, 126 349 in hospital admission records, 776 503 in covid-19 laboratory test data, and 50 504 in death registry records). Although 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and 18%, respectively, were recorded in only one. CONCLUSIONS: This population-wide resource shows the importance of linking person level data across health settings to maximise completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardiovascular events and covid-19 diagnoses. Although this resource was initially established to support research on covid-19 and cardiovascular disease to benefit clinical care and public health and to inform healthcare policy, it can broaden further to enable a wide range of research.","Wood, Angela; Denholm, Rachel; Hollings, Sam; Cooper, Jennifer; Ip, Samantha; Walker, Venexia; Denaxas, Spiros; Akbari, Ashley; Banerjee, Amitava; Whiteley, William; Lai, Alvina; Sterne, Jonathan; Sudlow, Cathie",BMJ,153,1

Due to the full acceptance of the above control practices, frequent hospital contact visits are being discouraged. However, there are people whose physiological vital needs still require routine monitoring for improved healthy living. Interestingly, with the recent technological advancements in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart home automation, and healthcare systems, contact-based hospital visits are now regarded as non-obligatory. To this end, a remote smart home healthcare support system (ShHeS) is proposed for monitoring patients' health status and receiving doctors' prescriptions while staying at home. Besides this, doctors can also carry out the diagnosis of ailments using the data collected remotely from the patient. An android based mobile application that interfaces with a web-based application is implemented for efficient patients-doctors dual real-time communication. Sensors are incorporated in the system for automatic capturing of physiological health parameters of patients. Also, a hyperspace analogue to context (HAC) was incorporated into the current monitoring framework for service discovery and context change in the home environment towards accurate readings of the physiological parameters and improved system performance. With the proposed system, patients can be remotely monitored from their homes, and can also live a more comfortable life through the use of some features of smart home automation devices on their phones. Therefore, one main significant contribution of this study is that patients in self-isolation or self-quarantine can use the new platform to send daily health symptoms and challenges to doctors via their mobile phones. Thus, improved healthy living and a comfortable lifestyle can still be achieved even during such a problematic period of the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic that has already recorded 20,026,186 million cases so far with 734,020 thousand deaths globally.","Taiwo, Olutosin; Ezugwu, Absalom E",Inform Med Unlocked,153,6

Problem with many unknowns,15.764967,6.6394606,2020,"Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is an emerging global concern affecting several agricultural communities in the Americas and South Asia. Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals (e.g., Cd, As, Pb, and V) and organic pesticides (e.g., glyphosate) in the drinking water have been hypothesized to play a role in childhood onset and progression of this disease. However, a comprehensive analysis of chemical contaminants in the drinking water and effects of these compounds and their mixtures on kidney development and function remains unknown. Here, we conducted targeted and non-targeted chemical analyses of sediment and drinking water in CKDu affected regions in Sri Lanka, one of the most affected countries. Using zebrafish Danio rerio, a toxicology and kidney disease model, we then examined kidney developmental effects of exposure to (i) environmentally derived samples from CKDu endemic and non-endemic regions and (ii) Cd, As, V, Pb, and glyphosate as individual compounds and in mixtures. We found that drinking water is contaminated with various organic chemicals including nephrotoxic compounds as well as heavy metals, but at levels considered safe for drinking. Histological studies and gene expression analyses examining markers of kidney development (pax2a) and kidney injury (kim1) showed novel metal and glyphosate-metal mixture specific effects on kidney development. Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to kidney failure, and examination of mixture specific mitochondrial toxicity showed altered mitochondrial function following treatment with environmental samples from endemic regions. Collectively, we show that metals in drinking water, even at safe levels, can impede kidney development at an early age, potentiating increased susceptibility to other agrochemicals such as glyphosate. Drinking water contaminant effects on mitochondria can further contribute to progression of kidney dysfunction and our mitochondrial assay may help identify regions at risk of CKDu.","Babich, Remy; Ulrich, Jake C; Ekanayake, E M Dilini V; Massarsky, Andrey; De Silva, P Mangala C S; Manage, Pathmalal M; Jackson, Brian P; Ferguson, P Lee; Di Giulio, Richard T; Drummond, Iain A; Jayasundara, Nishad",Environ Int,153,1

Patients with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population when suffering from COVID-19. Most hospitals have been facing difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and there is a need to minimise patient flow time so that staff health is less endangered, and more patients can be treated. This article shows how to use simulation techniques to prepare hospitals for a virus outbreak. The initial simulation of the current processes of the heart clinic first identified the bottlenecks. It confirmed that the current workflow is not optimal for COVID-19 patients; therefore, to reduce waiting time, three optimisation scenarios are proposed. In the best situation, the discrete-event simulation of the second scenario led to a 62.3% reduction in patient waiting time. This is one of the few studies that show how hospitals can use workflow modelling using timed coloured Petri nets to manage healthcare systems in practice. This technique would be valuable in these challenging times as the health of staff, and other patients are at risk from the nosocomial transmission.","Zeinalnezhad, Masoomeh; Chofreh, Abdoulmohammad Gholamzadeh; Goni, Feybi Ariani; Klemes, Jirí Jaromír; Sari, Emelia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),153,20

Automated RNA extraction, followed by RT-PCR, was performed in a 96-well plate. Positive pools were identified, and the individual samples were reanalyzed. Of the 94 pools/wells, four were positive [Ct values: N (22.7 to 28.3), ORF1ab (23.3 to 27.2), and internal control (34.4 to 35.4)]. The 40 samples comprising the four pools were identified and reanalyzed individually; six samples were positive, with Ct values of N gene, ORF1ab, and internal control comparable to their respective wells. Additional experiments were performed on samples with high Ct values, and overall results showed 91.6% positive and 100% negative agreement compared with individual testing approach. Thus, 940 samples were tested in 148 reactions compared with 940 reactions in routine screening.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a multicentric, cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of 431 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between 10 March and 14 April 2020 who died or were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. This project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04367129). Standard ECG was recorded at hospital admission. ECG was abnormal in 93% of the patients. Atrial fibrillation/flutter was detected in 22% of the patients. ECG signs suggesting acute right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO) were detected in 30% of the patients. In particular, 43 (10%) patients had the S1Q3T3 pattern, 38 (9%) had incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and 49 (11%) had complete RBBB. ECG signs of acute RVPO were not statistically different between patients with (n = 104) or without (n=327) invasive mechanical ventilation during ECG recording (36% vs. 28%, P = 0.10). Non-specific repolarization abnormalities and low QRS voltage in peripheral leads were present in 176 (41%) and 23 (5%), respectively. In four patients showing ST-segment elevation, acute myocardial infarction was confirmed with coronary angiography. No ST-T abnormalities suggestive of acute myocarditis were detected. In the subgroup of 110 patients where high-sensitivity troponin I was available, ECG features were not statistically different when stratified for above or below the 5 times upper reference limit value. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG is abnormal in almost all critically ill COVID-19 patients and shows a large spectrum of abnormalities, with signs of acute RVPO in 30% of the patients. Rapid and simple identification of these cases with ECG at hospital admission can facilitate classification of the patients and provide pathophysiological insights.","Bertini, Matteo; Ferrari, Roberto; Guardigli, Gabriele; Malagù, Michele; Vitali, Francesco; Zucchetti, Ottavio; D039,; Aniello, Emanuele; Volta, Carlo Alberto; Cimaglia, Paolo; Piovaccari, Giancarlo; Corzani, Alessandro; Galvani, Marcello; Ortolani, Paolo; Rubboli, Andrea; Tortorici, Gianfranco; Casella, Gianni; Sassone, Biagio; Navazio, Alessandro; Rossi, Luca; Aschieri, Daniela; Rapezzi, Claudio",Europace,153,25

This approach models infection-age dependent infectivity, and extends the classical SIR and SEIR models. We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time), and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this LLN, the infectivity process and the susceptible process are determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then derive the exposed, infectious and recovered processes, again using integral equations. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non--Markovian) branching process, and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of non-extinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use these equations to derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ during the early stage of an epidemic, in terms of the average individual infectivity function and the exponential rate of growth of the epidemic.","Forien, Raphael; Pang, Guodong; Pardoux, Etienne",,153,29

The asymptomatic nature of COVID-19 obfuscates the signs policy makers look for when deciding to reopen public areas or further quarantine. In much of the world, testing resources are often scarce, creating a need for testing potentially infected individuals that prioritizes efficiency. This report presents an advancement to Beigel and Kasifs Approximate Counting Algorithm (ACA). ACA estimates the infection rate with a number of tests that is logarithmic in the population size. Our newer version of the algorithm provides an extra level of efficiency: each subject is tested exactly once. A simulation of the algorithm, created for and presented as part of this paper, can be used to find a linear regression of the results with R2 > 0.999. This allows stakeholders and members of the biomedical community to estimate infection rates for varying population sizes and ranges of infection rates.","Beigel, Richard; Webber, Max J",,153,24

The word ""tuberculosis"" derives from ""tubercle"", the histological lesion which appears in the organs, described by Pott in the late Eighteenth century and found, by molecular biology, in human skeletons dating back to 5000 BC. Early description of TB can be found in the writings of ancient India and China and in the Bible. In ancient Greece tuberculosis was not considered contagious, but Aristotle recognized the contagious nature of the pig's and ox's scrofula. The suspicion that phthisis is a contagious disease and that isolation can reduce the risk of transmission was expressed for the first time by the Arabian Avicenna, in his work ""The canon of medicine"". In 1699, the Health Council of the Republic of Lucca founded the ""sanatorium"" concept as place of care and isolation. In 1865 Villemain inoculated tubercular material from a human lymph node into a rabbit, obtaining for the first time the typical tubercular lesions. Some years later, on March 24, 1882, Robert Koch announced to the Berlin Society of Physiology the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the same period Virchow improved awareness of risk factors and correct behaviours among the general population. In 1952 Waksman won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the first active drug against TB: streptomycin. Nevertheless, drug resistance appeared rapidly some years later and it is still a great challenge in TB fight nowadays.","Riccardi, N; Canetti, D; Martini, M; Diaw, M M; DI Biagio, A; Codecasa, L; Barberis, I; Bragazzi, N L; Besozzi, G",J Prev Med Hyg,153,30

Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children who met criteria for the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) and compare these characteristics with other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 58 children from 8 hospitals in England admitted between March 23 and May 16, 2020, with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definitions for PIMS-TS. The final date of follow-up was May 22, 2020. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were abstracted by medical record review, and were compared with clinical characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (n = 1132), KD shock syndrome (n = 45), and toxic shock syndrome (n = 37) who had been admitted to hospitals in Europe and the US from 2002 to 2019. Exposures: Signs and symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings of children who met definitional criteria for PIMS-TS from the UK, the US, and World Health Organization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children meeting definitional criteria for PIMS-TS, and comparison with the characteristics of other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Results: Fifty-eight children (median age, 9 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 5.7-14]; 20 girls [34%]) were identified who met the criteria for PIMS-TS. Results from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests were positive in 15 of 58 patients (26%) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 40 of 46 (87%). In total, 45 of 58 patients (78%) had evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. All children presented with fever and nonspecific symptoms, including vomiting (26/58 [45%]), abdominal pain (31/58 [53%]), and diarrhea (30/58 [52%]). Rash was present in 30 of 58 (52%), and conjunctival injection in 26 of 58 (45%) cases. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with marked inflammation, for example, C-reactive protein (229 mg/L [IQR, 156-338], assessed in 58 of 58) and ferritin (610 µg/L [IQR, 359-1280], assessed in 53 of 58). Of the 58 children, 29 developed shock (with biochemical evidence of myocardial dysfunction) and required inotropic support and fluid resuscitation (including 23/29 [79%] who received mechanical ventilation); 13 met the American Heart Association definition of KD, and 23 had fever and inflammation without features of shock or KD. Eight patients (14%) developed coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm. Comparison of PIMS-TS with KD and with KD shock syndrome showed differences in clinical and laboratory features, including older age (median age, 9 years [IQR, 5.7-14] vs 2.7 years [IQR, 1.4-4.7] and 3.8 years [IQR, 0.2-18], respectively), and greater elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (median, 229 mg/L [IQR 156-338] vs 67 mg/L [IQR, 40-150 mg/L] and 193 mg/L [IQR, 83-237], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of hospitalized children who met criteria for PIMS-TS, there was a wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms and disease severity, ranging from fever and inflammation to myocardial injury, shock, and development of coronary artery aneurysms. The comparison with patients with KD and KD shock syndrome provides insights into this syndrome, and suggests this disorder differs from other pediatric inflammatory entities.","Whittaker, Elizabeth; Bamford, Alasdair; Kenny, Julia; Kaforou, Myrsini; Jones, Christine E; Shah, Priyen; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Fraisse, Alain; Miller, Owen; Davies, Patrick; Kucera, Filip; Brierley, Joe; McDougall, Marilyn; Carter, Michael; Tremoulet, Adriana; Shimizu, Chisato; Herberg, Jethro; Burns, Jane C; Lyall, Hermione; Levin, Michael",JAMA,153,16
314952,314952,314952,Cancer and COVID-19 vaccines: a complex global picture,15.764215,6.3543997,2021,"Upon recognition of microbial DNA or self-DNA, the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) of the host catalyzes the production of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. cGAMP is the main activator of STING, stimulator of interferon genes, leading to interferon synthesis through the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. STING is also a hub for activation of NF-&#954;B and autophagy. The present review details the striking similarities between T and B cell responses in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and both animal or human models of STING gain of function (SAVI syndromes: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy). Those similarities may be further clues for a delayed activation of STING in severe COVID-19 patients, due to DNA damages following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) infection and unusual role of STING in SARS-CoV-2 control. In early stages, Th2 differentiation are noticed in both severe COVID-19 and SAVI syndromes; then, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells functional exhaustion/senescent patterns due to TCR hyper-responsiveness are observed. T cell delayed over-responses can contribute to pneumonitis and delayed cytokine secretion with over-production of IL-6. Last, STING over-activation induces progressive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphopenia in SAVI syndromes, which parallels what is observed in severe COVID-19. ACE2, the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is rarely expressed in immune cells, and it has not been yet proven that some human lymphocytes could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 or CD26. However, STING, expressed in humans T cells, might be triggered following excessive transfer of cGAMP from infected antigen presenting cells into activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lymphocytes. Indeed, those lymphocytes highly express the cGAMP importer SLC19A1. Whereas STING is not expressed in human B cells, B cells counts are much less affected, either in COVID-19 or SAVI syndromes. The recognition of delayed STING over-activation in severe COVID-19 patients could prompt to target STING with specific small molecules inhibitors already designed and/or aspirin, which inhibits cGAS.","Berthelot, Jean-Marie; Lioté, Frédéric; Maugars, Yves; Sibilia, Jean",Front Immunol,153,16

on caregiver burden among caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases has been growing throughout the past few decades, allowing health professionals to gain an understanding of the challenges faced by caregivers and provide important recommendations and interventions to reduce caregiver burden Currently, a new set of challenges has arisen as the US faces the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which disproportionally impacts older adults Given that the risk of COVID-19 illness severity increases with age, older adults have been advised to self-quarantine and follow stay-at-home orders put in place by government officials This physical isolation is purported to lead to decreased social interaction and physical activity among older adults and their caregivers, removing protective factors for overall well-being, aging, and quality of life, and subsequently increasing caregiver burden Despite the assumed impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, a rapid review of the current body of literature is critical to provide a summary of work being conducted in this emerging area As such, the current presentation aims to disseminate the findings of a rapid literature review and lessons learned from translating the findings into clinical recommendations Methods Source documents for this literature review were identified through a computerized search using the APA PsychInfo Database and Google Scholar covering the year 2019 to 2020 The following keywords, and combinations of these were utilized: “Caregiver,” “Caregiver Burden,” “Family Caregiver,” “Burden,” “Dementia,” “Alzheimer's Disease,” and “COVID-19 ” All English-Language journal articles that appeared to be relevant for this literature were read After applying exclusion criteria (i e articles unrelated to the COVID-19 Pandemic or those that did not assess caregiver burden associated with older adults), 21 peer-reviewed articles warranted inclusion Results After rapid review of the available literature to date, a total of 12 articles in our review assessed for the impact of COVID-19 on caregiver burden Six articles indicated that the worsening of patients’ behavioral and psychological symptoms, an increase in patients’ functional impairment, being the sole caregiver, and increased daily hours of care have all been associated with increased caregiver burden and depression Additional factors such as social support, coping strategies, mindfulness, reduction of social isolation, reinforcement of positive activities, and acceptance of role change and loss, among others, have been identified to protect against caregiver burden, as assessed by 3 articles included in our review Conclusions As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and government officials continue to urge the public to practice social distancing by staying home and keeping interaction with people outside of the household to a minimum, increased experiences of social isolation and continued reduction of readily available outside resources due to the global pandemic is expected to greatly impact caregivers and related caregiver burden Within the past year, researchers have answered the call to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through substantial and timely contributions giving unique insights to help guide practice and future research Within the research to date, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on caregivers and caregiver burden remain unknown Gaining an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on caregivers will serve to inform caregivers and health professionals about treatment and interventions, as well as raise awareness of the lasting impact COVID-19 will continue to have over the coming years In order to summarize and disseminate timely findings, the current review highlights the dimensions of caregiving that affect the caregiver and the person being cared for;it will also address how those dimensions have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic As seen in our clinical practice, older adults are now faced with additional obstacles when it comes to aging successfully The burden of adapting and facilitating successful aging within the pandemic complicates the burden already felt by the caregiver, compromising the caregiver's self-care and quality of life Implications of this review will serve to call attention to the impact COVID-19 has had and continues to have on caregivers and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, touch on the experiences and consequences of caregiver burden, and will further provide concrete translational clinical recommendations of these findings to improve patient care and outcomes Funding N/A","Hristova, Claudia

DESIGN: Living systematic review and critical appraisal by the COVID-PRECISE (Precise Risk Estimation to optimise covid-19 Care for Infected or Suspected patients in diverse sEttings) group. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through Ovid, arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 5 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION: At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS: 14 217 titles were screened, and 107 studies describing 145 prediction models were included. The review identified four models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 91 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (60 were based on medical imaging, nine to diagnose disease severity); and 50 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequently reported predictors of diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 are age, body temperature, lymphocyte count, and lung imaging features. Flu-like symptoms and neutrophil count are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while comorbidities, sex, C reactive protein, and creatinine are frequent prognostic factors. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.68 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting. Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION: Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models for use in current practice. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones. The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for treating COVID-19 and SARS has been FDA approved. Previous studies suggest that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has shown various biological activities that may help against COVID-19 and SARS, including antiviral, anti-allergy and inflammation, hepatoprotection against drug- and infection-induced liver injury, as well as reducing oxidative stress. In particular, berberine has a wide range of antiviral activities such as anti-influenza, anti-hepatitis C, anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti-alphavirus. As an ingredient recommended in guidelines issued by the China National Health Commission for COVID-19 to be combined with other therapy, berberine is a promising orally administered therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The current study comprehensively evaluates the potential therapeutic mechanisms of berberine in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS using computational modeling, including target mining, gene ontology enrichment, pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction analysis, and in silico molecular docking. An orally available immunotherapeutic-berberine nanomedicine, named NIT-X, has been developed by our group and has shown significantly increased oral bioavailability of berberine, increased IFN-Î³ production by CD8+ T cells, and inhibition of mast cell histamine release in vivo, suggesting a protective immune response. We further validated the inhibition of replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells line in vitro (Calu3 cells) by berberine. Moreover, the expression of targets including ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-1&#945;, IL-8, IL-6, and CCL-2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells were significantly suppressed by NIT-X. By supporting protective immunity while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines; inhibiting viral infection and replication; inducing apoptosis; and protecting against tissue damage, berberine is a promising candidate in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS. Given the high oral bioavailability and safety of berberine nanomedicine, the current study may lead to the development of berberine as an orally, active therapeutic against COVID-19 and SARS.","Wang, Zhen-Zhen; Li, Kun; Maskey, Anish R; Huang, Weihua; Toutov, Anton A; Yang, Nan; Srivastava, Kamal; Geliebter, Jan; Tiwari, Raj; Miao, Mingsan; Li, Xiu-Min",FASEB J,153,16

On the one hand, this increased financialization of the two markets helps investors design a well-diversified investment portfolio with assets from different asset categories. However, at the same time, this increases the connectedness between the two markets significantly, which may have strong implications for investors and consumers. In this paper, we examine the long-term connectedness and causality between Crude oil and agricultural commodity prices. The advantage of long-term time series is that we may be able to uncover the demand and supply shocks that originated in both markets during the tranquil period and the shocks during the volatile period such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we employ the full bootstrap sample and rolling window causality tests primarily. Our results are surprisingly different from most of the studies that have held oil prices responsible for causing changes in agricultural commodity prices (ACP). In contrast, our results confirm the presence of bidirectional causality and show that Oil prices are as much affected by the ACP as vice versa. This significant reverse causality running from ACP to Oil prices can open up a completely new interpretation domain. Finally, it is surprisingly interesting that both ACP and Oil prices remain immune to the shocks that originated in both markets during the entire time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Sun, Y.; Mirza, N.; Qadeer, A.; Hsueh, H.

There is an increasing need to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care, in order to manage their limited resources. This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed in Bogotá, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use an SEIR model that includes three different categories of infection: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December. We provide a Shiny app available at https://claudia-rivera-rodriguez.shinyapps.io/shinyappcovidclinic/. The original values in the app reproduce the results of this paper, but the parameters and starting values can be changed according to the user's needs. COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to be prepared for the excess demand of services that a pandemic like this one generates. Unfortunately, the model predicts that by mid-November the projected capacity of the system in Bogotá will not be enough. We expect the lockdown rules to be strengthened in future days, so the death toll will not be as bad as predicted by this model.","Rivera-Rodriguez, Claudia; Urdinola, Beatriz Piedad",Front Public Health,153,17

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Recent studies have suggested that patients with hypertension and diabetes treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection as these drugs could upregulate ACE2, motivating the study of ACE2 modulation by drugs in current clinical use. Here, we mined published datasets to determine the effects of hundreds of clinically approved drugs on ACE2 expression. We find that ACEIs are enriched for ACE2-upregulating drugs, while antineoplastic agents are enriched for ACE2-downregulating drugs. Vorinostat and isotretinoin are the top ACE2 up/downregulators, respectively, in cell lines. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, significantly upregulates ACE2 both in vitro and in vivo. Further top ACE2 regulators in vivo or in primary cells include erlotinib and bleomycin in the lung and vancomycin, cisplatin, and probenecid in the kidney.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD: Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS: Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. APPLICATION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study examining the feasibility and impact of virtual care as an adjunct to in-person emergency care at a tertiary pediatric hospital from May to July 2020. Children (< 18 years) from Ontario and Quebec seeking V-PED care were included. A secure, encrypted, video platform within the hospital's electronic medical record was used. Caregivers self-determined appropriateness of V-PED using a standardized online triage questionnaire to request their appointment. The V-PED is directly launched from the patient's chart and the family joins the portal via hyperlink. Outcome measures included the number of V-PED visits, hospital admission rates, and caregiver satisfaction using a 10-item voluntary post-visit online survey. RESULTS: A total of 1036 V-PED visits were seen of which 176 (17.0%) were referred for further in-person ED assessment, and 8 (0.8%) required hospital admission. Of the 107 completing patient experience surveys (10% response), most respondents (69%) endorsed they ""very likely"" or ""definitely"" would have presented in-person to the ED if V-PED were unavailable. Overall satisfaction was rated as excellent (9 or 10 out of 10) in 87% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Our novel V-PED is feasible, has high caregiver satisfaction, and can reduce the burden of in-person ED visits. Future work must ensure the safety of emergency virtual care and examine how to increase capacity and integrate V-PED within traditional emergency medicine.","Reid, Sarah; Bhatt, Maala; Zemek, Roger; Tse, Sandy",CJEM,153,15

We estimated R(t) as a function of the time of infection using the date of illness onset. The epidemic in Osaka came under control around 2 April during the first wave, and 26 July during the second wave. R(t) did not decline drastically following any single intervention. However, when multiple interventions were combined, the relative reductions in R(t) during the first and second waves were 70% and 51%, respectively. Although the second wave was brought under control without declaring a state of emergency, our model comparison indicated that relying on a single intervention would not be sufficient to reduce R(t) < 1.

328077,328077,328077,Multi-layered masks to combat COVID-19,15.815095,6.2499866,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government's emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged &#8805;18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged &#8805;65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=-0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Hijazi, Rana; Abed Elhadi Shahbari, Nour",J Med Internet Res,153,29

However, viruses undergo frequent recombination, which makes it difficult to trace their evolutionary history using traditional phylogenetic methods. Here, we present a phylogenetic workflow, virDTL, for analyzing viral evolution in the presence of recombination. Our approach leverages reconciliation methods developed for inferring horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes, and, compared to existing tools, is uniquely able to identify ancestral recombinations while accounting for several sources of inference uncertainty, including in the construction of a strain tree, estimation and rooting of gene family trees, and reconciliation itself. We apply this workflow to the Sarbecovirus subgenus and demonstrate how a principled analysis of predicted recombination gives insight into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to providing confirming evidence for the horseshoe bat as its zoonotic origin, we identify several ancestral recombination events that merit further study.","Zaman, Sumaira; Sledzieski, Samuel; Berger, Bonnie; Wu, Yi-Chieh; Bansal, Mukul S.",,153,16

More data were needed on the pathogenesis of this unusual clotting disorder. METHODS: We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4-heparin immunoassay. RESULTS: Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4-heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4-heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

However, it is yet unknown if gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM)'s IPV risk has increased during this time. This article describes and analyzes IPV experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of coupled-GBMSM in the United States. We hypothesized that pandemic-driven stressors would be associated with increased IPV prevalence and severity. A sample of 214 coupled men living in the US who had previously participated in HIV-related couple studies was surveyed in July-September 2020. Respondents reported demographic, sexual and substance use behaviors, and relationship characteristics. Surveys also collected data on pandemic-related life-changes (employment, substance use, COVID-19 illness). IPV victimization and perpetration were measured with the Gay and Bisexual Men Intimate Partner Violence scale and measured individually experienced or perpetrated violence, sexual, emotional, monitoring, or controlling behaviors, and if a given behavior was new and/or had changed in frequency during the pandemic. Reported prevalence and pandemic-related changes in victimization and perpetration were described. New or more frequent IPV victimization was modeled against employment, substance use changes, COVID-19 illness, and outside sexual partners (modified by a couple's sexual agreement). IPV perpetration prevalence was 15.17%, 34.44% of which was new or more frequent. Victimization prevalence was 14.95%, of which 46.88% was new or more frequent. After adjustment, outside sexual partners were associated with IPV among those with nonmonogamous sexual agreements; each outside sexual partner increased the odds of new or more frequent victimization by 70% (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.16, 2.51]). Given this study's documented rise in IPV among a sample of coupled men, additional research into IPV predictors, interventions, and support strategies in GBMSM populations are warranted.","Walsh, Alison R; Sullivan, Stephen; Stephenson, Rob",J Interpers Violence,153,17

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 qualitative serological assays by Abbott (IgG), Beckman (IgG), DiaSorin (IgG), EUROIMMUN (IgG and IgA), Roche and Bio-Rad (Total) were evaluated using specimens collected pre-December 2019 (n=393), from nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) negative patients (n=40), and from 53 patients with COVID-19 by NAAT collected 3-21 days post-onset of symptoms (POS) (N=83). Negative agreement (NA), positive agreement (PA), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) at prevalences of 5% and 10% were calculated. RESULTS: The overall %NA;95% CI in the negative samples were: Roche 99.8%; 99.3-100.2, Beckman 99.8%; 98.7-100.0, Abbott and Bio-Rad 99.3%; 98.0-99.9, DiaSorin 98.4; 97.2-99.6, EUROIMMUN IgG 97.5%; 95.5-98.7, and EUROIMMUN IgA 79.7%; 75.9-83.5), accounting for positive/equivocal results as false positives. The %PA; 95% CI in samples collected 14+days POS (n=24) were: Bio-Rad 83.3%; 68.4-98.2, Abbott and Roche 79.2%; 62.9-95.4, EUROIMMUN IgA 70.8%; 52.6-89.0, Beckman 58.3%; 38.6-78.1, DiaSorin 54.2; 34.2-74.1, and EUROIMMUN IgG 50.0%; 30.0-70.0, accounting for negative/equivocal results as false negatives.

METHODS: Data about the total number of cases, tests, and rates of COVID-19 as of June 10, 2020 were obtained for cities and towns in MA. The data on COVID-19 were matched with data on various SDoH variables at the city and town level from the American Community Survey. These variables included information about income, poverty, employment, renting, and insurance coverage. We compared COVID-19 rates according to these SDoH variables. RESULTS: There were clear gradients in the rates of COVID-19 according to SDoH variables. Communities with more poverty, lower income, lower insurance coverage, more unemployment, and a higher percentage of the workforce employed in essential services, including healthcare, had higher rates of COVID-19. Most of these differences were not accounted for by different rates of testing in these cities and towns. CONCLUSIONS: SDoH variables may explain some of the variability in the risk of COVID-19 across cities and towns in MA. Data about SDoH should be part of the standard surveillance for COVID-19.

According to the crystal structure of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which binds to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), 15 amino acids of ACE2 have considerable interaction with RBD. Therefore, a new peptide based on these amino acids was designed as the functional group for AuNP. On the basis of the obtained results, functionalized AuNPs have remarkable effects on the RBD and strongly interact with this protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the studied nanoparticles, the AuNP functionalized by new peptide forms a more stable complex with RBD in comparison with ACE2, which is the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

Flavonoids, especially rutin, have attracted considerable interest as a prospective SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor. In this study, a database containing 2017 flavone analogs was prepared and screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the molecular docking technique. According to the results, 371 flavone analogs exhibited good potency towards Mpro with docking scores less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations, were performed for the top potent analogs in complex with Mpro. Compared to rutin, PubChem-129-716-607 and PubChem-885-071-27 showed better binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro over 150 ns MD course with &#916;Gbinding values of -69.0 and -68.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Structural and energetic analyses demonstrated high stability of the identified analogs inside the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site over 150 ns MD simulations. The oral bioavailabilities of probable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors were underpinned using drug-likeness parameters.

PTSI are also linked to increased absenteeism, suicidality, and performance decrements, which compromise occupational and public health and safety in trauma-exposed workers. Evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness of ""prevention"" programs designed to mitigate PTSI proactively. The purpose of this review is to measure the effectiveness of proactive PTSI mitigation programs among occupational groups exposed to PPTE on measures of PTSI symptoms, absenteeism, and psychological wellness. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched per PRISMA guidelines for English or French peer-reviewed studies from 2008 to 2019 evaluating PTSI and psychological wellness in adults exposed to occupational PPTE. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We identified 42 studies evaluating 3182 public safety and frontline healthcare professionals, PPTE-exposed educational staff, and miners. Significant overlap was found across program themes that included mindfulness, psychoeducation, resilience promotion, and stress management strategies. Post-program effect sizes were small (SMD < 0.5) to moderate (SMD < 0.8) for reductions in PTSI symptoms and for promoting measures of well-being as indicated by a meta-analysis on 36 studies. There was no evidence for significant reductions in substance use, absenteeism, or biomarkers of distress except for heart rate. Subgroup analyses indicated that multimodal programs effectively improved general psychological health, while resilience programs improved measures of depression, burnout, coping, and resilience. Effect sizes for resilience, depression, and general psychological health improvements were greatest immediately or 1-month post-training, while improvements in PTSD symptoms and coping were larger at longer follow-up. Studies were of moderate quality and risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The current results showcase modest evidence for time-limited reductions in PTSI following participation in holistic programs that promote resilience, stress, and emotion regulation among at-risk workers. Implications for organizational implementation of proactive PTSI mitigation programs and areas of future research are discussed.

Fifty-five of the confirmed cases were hospitalised (48%) and no deaths were reported. At the start of the outbreak, cases were mostly individuals of Romanian origin; the outbreak subsequently spread to the wider population. Over the 8-month response, the IMT conducted the following control measures: extensive contact tracing, immediate provision of post-exposure prophylaxis, community engagement amongst specific high-risk groups, MMR awareness raising including catch-up campaigns and enhanced vaccination services at selected GP surgeries. Key challenges to the effective control measures included language difficulties limiting community engagement; delays in diagnosis, notification and appropriate isolation of cases; limited resources for contact tracing across multiple high-risk settings (including GPs and hospitals) and lack of timely data on vaccine coverage in sub-groups of the population to guide public health action.","Mulchandani, R; Sibal, B; Phillips, A; Suleman, S; Banerjee, A; Teagle, R; Foulkes, S; Spence, K; Edeghere, O",Epidemiol Infect,153,23

To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitchTM platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. The screen included 31 MHC Class I and 19 MHC Class II peptides predicted to be good binders by the IEDB web resource provided by NIAID. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and three MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind to multiple MHC molecule types. In addition to providing important data towards the study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its presented antigenic epitopes, the peptides identified in this study can be used in the QuickSwitch platform to generate MHC tetramers. With those tetramers, scientists can assess CD4 + and CD8 + immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes.","Poluektov, Yuri; George, Marybeth; Daftarian, Pirouz; Delcommenne, Marc C",Vaccine,153,3

We hypothesized that activity restriction caused by efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would result in increased body mass index (BMI) in children, differing from conventional seasonal growth variations. Methods: We included 169 children who visited endocrine clinics of three hospitals in Korea at regular intervals under the same conditions for two years. Visit dates were D1 (January, 2019), D2 (July, 2019), D3 (January, 2020) before the COVID-19 outbreak, and D4 (July, 2020) during the pandemic. Differences in the z-score for height (HT), weight (WT), and BMI among time points and between spring seasons (i.e., S1–S3) were compared. Results: There were significant differences in BMIz among time points, which decreased from D1–D2 and increased from D2–D3 and D3–D4. WTz significantly increased from D2–D3 and D3–D4. BMIz values of S1 (spring 2019) and S3 (spring 2020) were −0.05 and 0.16, respectively, showing significant differences. WTz values between S1 and S3 were significantly different (−0.02 vs. 0.13). Conclusions: In 2019, there were conventional seasonal variations in BMIz, which declined in spring and increased in autumn, while in 2020, BMIz increased even in spring.

The virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is transmitted by droplet infection from person to person. Our current understanding of the disease spectrum is limited. The proportion of infected children is significantly less compared to adults with the majority of them showing mild symptoms. More than half of symptomatic children present with fever and cough. However, the extent of asymptomatic infection in children and the role they play in community transmission is still undetermined. Although there are case reports of neonates infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, vertical transmission from infected mother to new-born is yet to be proven. The disease is confirmed by demonstration of the virus by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in respiratory secretions. Due to the lack of specific antiviral agents, we rely on infection-control measures to prevent disease spread and on supportive care for infected ones.

The symptom responses to bereavement vary, particularly during the first year. However, the neurobiology underlying the symptom variance in grief is poorly understood. The endocannabinoid signaling (ECS) system is stress-responsive; mounting evidence implicates the central ECS in psychopathology. The current study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the ECS is abnormal in grief, using circulating eCB concentrations as a biomarker of central ECS. A predominantly older sample of grief participants, within 13 months following the death of a loved one, and healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. Associations of circulating eCBs with symptom variance in grievers were also examined. A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity. Circulating eCB measures may have the potential to serve as biomarkers of prolonged grief disorder.","Harfmann, Elisabeth J; McAuliffe, Timothy L; Larson, Eric R; Claesges, Stacy A; Sauber, Garrett; Hillard, Cecilia J; Goveas, Joseph S",Psychoneuroendocrinology,153,26

This question is answered by using a novel method to identify shocks to uncertainty in access to credit. Time-variation in uncertainty about credit availability is estimated using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We extract shocks to time-varying credit uncertainty and decompose it into two parts: the first captures the""pure""effect of a shock to the second moment; the second captures total effects of uncertainty including effects on the first moment. Using state-dependent local projections, we find that the""pure""effect by itself generates a sharp slowdown in real activity and the effects are largely countercyclical. We feed the estimated shocks into a flexible price real business cycle model with a collateral constraint and show that when the collateral constraint binds, an uncertainty shock about credit access is recessionary leading to a simultaneous decline in consumption, investment, and output.","Chatterjee, Pratiti; Gunawan, David; Kohn, Robert",,153,26

METHODS: Data for COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from 30 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most nonsurvivors were male, older, or with chronic diseases. Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune inflammation index (defined by platelet count multiplied by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer and showed decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all Pâ <â .05). With a cutoff value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity of 90.5%, specificity of 77.6%, positive predictive value of 61.3%, and negative predictive value of 95.4%.

First, it aims at identifying the main teaching practices and information and communication technologies (ICTs) used to teach Operations Management (OM) in emerging economies during COVID-19 outbreak. Second, it investigates the effect of contextual characteristics on the adoption level of those teaching practices and ICTs. Third, this study examines the relationship between the adoption of ICTs and OM teaching practices during COVID-19 outbreak. Expectedly, schools around the world have pivoted to online learning and digital classrooms. Thus, OM lecturers and professors located in emerging economies that have been teaching during COVID-19 outbreak were surveyed. The collected data was analyzed through multivariate techniques. Findings indicate that lecturers and professors have been remarkably adopting specific teaching practices and ICTs to teach OM. Nevertheless, when considering the contextual characteristics of the universities, departments, and lecturers/professors, the adoption level of those practices and ICTs may significantly vary, especially depending on subject type and teaching experience. Moreover, we empirically verified that ICTs positively relate with OM teaching practices in emerging economies, although in a much less extent than expected. This research provides OM instructors guidelines to better plan their courses and subjects in face of extreme disruptive moments, such as the one caused by the COVID-19. Understanding how the concurrent utilization of ICTs and teaching practices helps OM programs to continue developing their activities is particularly important for universities located in emerging economies, since they are more likely to struggle with resources scarcity and more financially humble students.","Tortorella, Guilherme Luz Narayanamurthy Gopalakrishnan Vijaya Sunder M.; Cauchick-Miguel, Paulo A.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,153,20

The role of IFIH1 polymorphism, rs1990760 (C>T; aaA946T) in the epidemiology of viral infection is well studied, and the minor allele T resists viral infection. Knock-in mice with mutated IFIH1 protein (946T) for this allele have enhanced interferon production and protection from lethal viral infection. The minor allele frequency (Tmaf) varies widely from Africans (0.06 to 0.35) to Chinese (0.19 to 0.23) to Caucasians (0.56 to 0.69). During the initial days of infection when the social restrictions were not imposed, I show that the infection rate in Italy was lower as expected from its higher Tmaf (0.56) than that in China (Tmaf for southern China, 0.23). The infection rate in the USA and Spain was intermediate between those two countries despite higher Caucasian overall Tmaf (0.69), perhaps due to a more admixed African population in these countries. These analyses suggest that African-Americans and Chinese with low Tmaf of rs1990760 are more vulnerable to SARS-COV2 infection, apart from other genetic factors or socioeconomic conditions in these population. Taken together, an IFN-beta supplement might aid in preventing COVID-19 infection and help in development of herd immunity.","Maiti, Amit K",Immunogenetics,153,1

Panic buying is identified as one such side effect. Among various models and measures undertaken by government to manage the pandemic, timed-intervention policy is commonly practiced by most countries. This paper examines the timing effect between government measures and panic buying. Three studies were undertaken to understand the timing effect and identify a connection between timed measures and consumer behaviours. Semantic analysis, secondary data search, and big data analytics were deployed to address the research aim. Although claiming a causal relationship is cautioned, the findings reveal a connection between timing of government measures and panic buying.

Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. METHODS: An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. RESULTS: COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care. When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice.","Pothuri, Bhavana; Alvarez Secord, Angeles; Armstrong, Deborah K; Chan, John; Fader, Amanda N; Huh, Warner; Kesterson, Joshua; Liu, Joyce F; Moore, Kathleen; Westin, Shannon N; Naumann, R Wendel",Gynecol Oncol,153,20

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the level of learning engagement and its relationship with students' perceived learning satisfaction in an online clinical nursing elective course. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study. SETTINGS: A nursing course was converted to an online format because of the coronavirus disease COVID pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Part-time post-registration nursing undergraduates enrolled in an elective online clinical course. METHODS: Related teaching and learning strategies were deployed in the course using the Community of Inquiry framework. All students who completed the course were invited to complete an online survey that included a validated Online Student Engagement questionnaire (OSE). Pearson's correlations were used to determine the association between perceived learning satisfaction and learning engagement. A logistic regression model was used to explore the associations of gender, age, working experience and perceived learning satisfaction with higher learning engagement. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 56 of 68 students (82%). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the mean perceived learning satisfaction and OSE scores was 0.75 (p < .001). Twenty-five students (45%) were identified as highly engaged, using a cut-off of &#8805;3.5 for the mean OSE score. The mean perceived learning satisfaction (SD) score differed significantly between highly engaged and not highly engaged students [4.02 (0.49) vs. 3.27 (0.62), p < .001]. The logistic regression model showed that a greater perceived learning satisfaction [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 17.2, 95% C.I.: 3.46-86.0, p = .001] was associated with an increased likelihood of higher learning engagement, and >1 year of working experience (adjusted OR: 0.11, 95% C.I.: 0.01-0.89, p = .0039) was associated with a decreased likelihood of higher learning engagement.

METHODS: We utilized a combination of in silico- and molecular-based approaches to profile and compare CYP expression/activity in human adult liver and fetal tissues. Using public datasets, we evaluated human CYP expression between: 1) placenta vs. adult livers; 2) fetal vs. adult livers; or 3) five compartments of the human placenta. We generated new experimental data, characterizing expression levels of nine CYPs in placenta/fetal liver vs. adult liver. In a subset of samples, we evaluated CYP3A4 activity. Finally, we summarized evidence of human fetal CYP expression/activity and environmental exposures during pregnancy. RESULTS: In silico, CYPs were predominately expressed at higher levels in the adult liver vs. fetal tissues, with a few noted exceptions. Sixty percent of CYP enzymes were expressed at nominal levels in the placenta. In wet-lab analyses, we observed significant CYP-specific differences in expression/activity between adult and fetal tissues; CYP2E1 and -3A4 were expressed significantly lower in fetal vs. adult livers, while CYP2J2 levels were similar. DISCUSSION: We provide a qualitative review of the expression of the CYP enzyme family in critical sites of xenobiotic distribution during human pregnancy and novel quantitative data regarding fetal CYP expression and activity during mid-gestation. Data outputs may be a resource for modeling predictions of chemical distribution and sensitivity.","Robinson, Joshua F; Hamilton, Emily G; Lam, Juleen; Chen, Hao; Woodruff, Tracey J",Placenta,153,24

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25% (95% CI: 24 to 26%) in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points (95% CI: 3 to 5 percentage points [p.p.]) in Denmark. This suggests that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggests that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low-health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.","Sheridan, Adam; Andersen, Asger Lau; Hansen, Emil Toft; Johannesen, Niels",Proc.

METHODS: Among people who participated in a community cohort study between 2013 and 2018 with previous depression measurement, a total of 1928 people without quarantine experience (680 men and 1249 women) were included after responding to an online survey in March 2020. In the 2020 survey, people were queried about daily needs supply, social support, risk perception, change during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mental health indices measuring loneliness, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. Separate analyses by gender were conducted to assess the association between COVID-19-related experiences and each mental health index, using multivariable logistic regressions with additional adjustment and stratification with pre-existing depression status. RESULTS: We could not observe significant gender differences for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and loneliness at 55 days after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Most external support, including daily needs supply and social support, protected men and women from experiencing severe anxiety (for life supply, OR = 0.92 (95%CI 0.88-0.97) (men) and OR = 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) (women); for social support, OR = 0.92(both for men and women, p < 0.01)). The results were similar for depression and PTSD. External support showed a larger reduction in the likelihoods for anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with pre-existing depression compared to previously healthy people, and it was more prominent in men. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 significantly affected the mental health of both men and women in the early period of the pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of photodynamic therapy (PDT) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. METHODS: Vero E6 cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Russia were used for PDT with methylene blue (MB) and Radahlorin. A continuous laser with wavelength &#955; = 662 nm in doses of 16 J/cm2 and 40 J/cm2 laser irradiation was used for PDT of a viral suspension and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. The direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated via light microscopy to calculate the TCID50 in the samples and perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 that had a TCID50 greater than 103 were inactivated by PDT in the presence of MB and Radahlorin. Vero E6 cells were protected from 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by PDT post infection. The range of protective concentrations was 1.0-10.0 µg/ml and 0.5-5.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. Additionally, it was found that MB and Radahlorin also possess significant antiviral activity even without PDT. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against 102 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 0.22 and 0.33 µg/ml with the addition of MB and Radahlorin, respectively, to cells concomitantly with virus, whereas in the case of applying the photosensitizers at 3.5 hours post infection, the IC50 was 0.6 and 2.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. CONCLUSION: PDT shows high antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 when combined with MB and Radahlorin in vitro.","Svyatchenko, Victor A; Nikonov, Sergey D; Mayorov, Alexander P; Gelfond, Mark L; Loktev, Valery B",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,153,25

The rapid spread of the novel SARS CoV-2 worldwide is raising a significant global public health issue with nearly 61.86 million people infected and 1.4 million deaths. To date, no specific drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19. The inhibition of proteases essential for the proteolytic treatment of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy for conquering viral infections. In the study, molecular docking approach was used to screen potential drug compounds among the phytochemicals of Vitex negundo L. against COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking analysis showed that oleanolic acid forms a stable complex and other phyto-compounds ursolic acid, 3ß-acetoxyolean-12-en-27-oic acid and isovitexin of V. negundo natural compounds form a less-stable complex. When compared with the control the synergistic interaction of these compounds shows inhibitory activity against papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (50 ns) were performed on the complexes of PLpro and the phyto-compounds viz. oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, 3ß-acetoxyolean-12-en-27-oic acid and isovitexin followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA and these molecules have stable interactions with PLpro protein binding site.

This study examined pre-COVID-19 deterrents reported by psychologists who did not use telepsychology. Participants were 1,400 psychologists with an average of 26.3 (SD = 11.18) years in practice who were currently practicing within the United States but did not currently use telepsychology. All 50 states were represented as well as Washington, DC. The most commonly reported deterrents, from most to least frequent, were insufficient training, client safety/crisis concerns, privacy, legality, ethics, reimbursement, efficacy, prohibitive organizational policies/culture, and insufficient demand. Logistic regression analyses suggested that psychologists' deterrents varied based in part on demographic and practice characteristics. Psychologists practicing within medical centers or Veterans Affairs facilities were less likely to indicate safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as a concern. Older psychologists were less deterred by reimbursement issues and more concerned about effectiveness. Those using cognitive-behavioral approaches were less likely to report efficacy and safety concerns. Cisgender men were less likely to be deterred by safety or privacy issues, and White psychologists were less likely to indicate safety as a deterrent. Additional telepsychology training and information for psychologists may increase its use and foster improved mental health care access for populations unable to attend in-person sessions. A more focused approach to training and implementation of telepsychology that considers the needs and concerns of the target psychologist group could benefit organizations promoting its use.

Due to these challenges, the care of several chronic conditions was in many cases discontinued and patients and healthcare professionals treating these conditions had to cope with this new scenario. This was the case of the world rare diseases (RDs) that had to face this global emergency despite the vulnerability of people with RDs and the well-known need for high expertise required to treat and manage them. The numerous lessons learned so far regarding health emergencies and RDs should represent the basis for the establishment of new healthcare policies and plans aimed at ensuring the preparedness of our health systems in providing appropriate care to people living with RDs in the case of eventual new emergencies. This paper aims at providing pragmatic considerations that might be useful in designing future actions to create or optimise existing organisational models for the care of RDs in case of future emergencies or any other situation that might threaten the provision of routine care. These policies and plans should benefit from the multi-stakeholder RDs networks (such as the European Reference Networks), that should join forces at European, national, and local levels to minimise the economic, organisational, and health-related impact and the negative effects of potential emergencies on the RDs community. In order to design and develop these policies and plans, a decalogue of points to consider were developed to ensure appropriate care for people living with RDs in the case of eventual future health emergencies.","Talarico, Rosaria; Marinello, Diana; Cannizzo, Sara; Gaglioti, Andrea; Ticciati, Simone; Carta, Claudio; Kodra, Yllka; Azadegan, Mojgan; Taruscio, Domenica; Mosca, Marta; Turchetti, Giuseppe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),153,16

In this topical review, we describe how we used treatment fidelity as a guiding principle to orient adaptations for telepsychology, as well as preliminary findings and early lessons learned in this implementation. Methods: Using rapid-cycle quality improvement methods, we adapted a brief parent training group (Bootcamp for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; BC-ADHD) to three groups of caregivers (i.e., 5-7 families) of school-aged children with ADHD (n = 20; 85% males). Families were from the following ethnic backgrounds: 75% White non-Hispanic, 15% White Hispanic, and 10% Black. Clinicians completed measures on their implementation experience. Observers completed measures on content/process fidelity and attendance. Caregivers completed measures on demographics, treatment satisfaction, and telepsychology experience. RESULTS: Telepsychology BC-ADHD can be implemented with comparably high levels of content and process fidelity and treatment satisfaction to in-person groups; and it appears to be feasible and acceptable to caregivers. Caregiver and clinician qualitative feedback revealed themes of appreciating the convenience of telepsychology, while experiencing some challenges in relating to others and sharing over video. CONCLUSIONS: When treatment fidelity is used as a guiding tool, telepsychology parent training groups can be delivered with high fidelity and appear to be acceptable and feasible to caregivers and clinicians. Future research using larger and more diverse samples, multimethod and multi-informant measurement approaches, and controlled designs is needed to further assess the generalizability and efficacy of telepsychology parent training groups.","Fogler, Jason M; Normand, Sébastien; O039,; Dea, Nicole; Mautone, Jennifer A; Featherston, Marilyn; Power, Thomas J; Nissley-Tsiopinis, Jenelle",J Pediatr Psychol,153,24

Background: Nurses are assigned a key role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Of particular importance is their work engagement, depending on job demands and resources. So far, there have only been scattered and first-wave related indications of nurses' job demands, resources and work engagement in Germany during the pandemic. Aim: To systematically assess key job demands, key job resources and work engagement of nursing staff for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, also differentiating between various groups of nurses. Method: The study was realized in a cross-sectional design and included nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected with an online questionnaire using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. The dataset for analyses comprised 1027 cases in total. Results: Regarding demands, work overload was even higher than before the pandemic, but work-life interferences were less pronounced. Nurses' resource architecture was not fundamentally changed by the pandemic, but interpersonal relationships and autonomy were rated more positively. Domiciliary care workers assessed demands and resources more positively than nurses in nursing homes or hospitals, whereas nurses caring for COVID-19 patients evaluated demands and resources more critically. Nurses' work engagement was higher during the second pandemic wave than in the first wave, but still low overall. Conclusions: Due to the importance of work engagement for nurses' health and performance and thus the quality of care, demands and resources must be further improved. Starting points are, e. g., fostering team cohesion, strengthening autonomy, and managing workload.","Dürr, Lena; Forster, Andrea; Bartsch, Christina E; Koob, Clemens",Pflege,153,26

Multiple community threats may also have cumulative impact on mental health, so examination across several contexts is important. The objective of this study is to report on changes in mental health and well-being in response to the Australian bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized an Experience-Sampling-Method (ESM), using the smartphone-based mood monitoring application, MoodPrism. Participants were prompted once a day to complete a brief survey inquiring about symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several well-being indices, including arousal, emotional valence, self-esteem, motivation, social connectedness, meaning and purpose, and control. Participants were N = 755 Australians (aged 13 years and above) who downloaded and used MoodPrism, between 2018 and 2020. Results showed that anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not during the bushfires. This may be explained by concurrent feelings of social connectedness maintained during the bushfires but not during the pandemic. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, which maintained during the pandemic. Most indices of well-being decreased significantly during the bushfires, and further again during the pandemic. Study findings highlight the unique responses to the bushfire and COVID-19 crises, revealing specific areas of resilience and vulnerability. Such information can help inform the development of public health interventions or individual clinical treatment, to improve treatment approaches and preparedness for potential future community disasters.","Arjmand, H.

Masks for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in combination with viral-proof filters, worn by healthcare workers, could serve as an alternative protection measure. We determined the simulated protection factor (SPF) of such devices in comparison to conventional surgical masks, N95, and FFP3 respirators. Masks and respirators were mounted on a ventilated mannequin head in a test-chamber. Isotonic saline containing 150 MBq 99mTC-DTPA (99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) was nebulized inside the box. The aerosol had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm. SPFs were measured using radioactive DTPA particles in the mannequin test system by calculating the ratio of unfiltered particles (Pu) and filtered particles (Pf) for each tested device (SPF = Pu/Pf). Simulated protection factors were 15.6 ± 3.6 for a ResMed AcuCare mask plus filter, 3.5 ± 0.2 for a ResMed Mirage Quattro FX mask plus filter, 9.5 ± 0.8 for a Loewenstein JOYCEclinc FF mask plus filter, 1.9 ± 0.2 for a surgical mask with a rubber band, 2.7 ± 0.7 for a surgical mask with ribbons, 2.3 ± 0.3 for an FFP3 respirator, and 3.6 ± 1.3 for an N95 respirator.

Currently, no specific medicine is available to treat infection with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 175 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to January 31, 2020, and to establish a tool to identify potential critical patients with COVID-19 and help clinical physicians prevent progression of this disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical characteristics of 175 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in COVID-19 progression. We established a nomogram to evaluate the probability of progression of the condition of a patient with COVID-19 to severe within three weeks of disease onset. The nomogram was verified using calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 18 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the laboratory parameters (P<.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out 10 risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were age (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.017-1.054; P<.001), CK level (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.0003-1.0039; P=.02), CD4 count (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P=.002), CD8 % (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004-1.012, P<.001), CD8 count (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.835-0.931; P<.001), and C3 count (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.945-24.691; P=.003). The areas under the curve of the prediction model for 0.5-week, 1-week, 2-week and 3-week nonsevere probability were 0.721, 0.742, 0.87, and 0.832, respectively. The calibration curves showed that the model had good prediction ability within three weeks of disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a predictive nomogram of critical patients with COVID-19 based on LASSO and Cox regression analysis. Clinical use of the nomogram may enable timely detection of potential critical patients with COVID-19 and instruct clinicians to administer early intervention to these patients to prevent the disease from worsening.","Fan, Tao; Hao, Bo; Yang, Shuo; Shen, Bo; Huang, Zhixin; Lu, Zilong; Xiong, Rui; Shen, Xiaokang; Jiang, Wenyang; Zhang, Lin; Li, Donghang; He, Ruyuan; Meng, Heng; Lin, Weichen; Feng, Haojie; Geng, Qing",JMIR Med Inform,153,13

In an attempt to enhance the adsorption capacity of toxic chromium on the prepared modified biopolymer, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been loaded on the modified adsorbent to form the magnetite adsorbent (Fe3O4@CTS-Nap). The adsorption mechanism of both adsorbents is explored by batch experiments, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, and EDS. The optimum adsorption is achieved at pHâ¯1.5 for CTS-Nap and 1.0 for Fe3O4@CTS-Nap. Pseudo second order illustrated the best description for the adsorption process with correlation coefficient R2 = 0.999 and the film diffusion or chemisorption is the rate-limiting step. The equilibrium data is analyzed using five isotherm models, the experimental data agreed well with the Freundlich model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 78.12â¯mgâ¯g-1 and 57.14â¯mgâ¯g-1 for CTS-Nap and Fe3O4@CTS-Nap, respectively. However, this unexpected result revealed that the presence of magnetic nanoparticles does not always enhance the adsorption process and many other factors could control the adsorption process. Generally, these outcomes revealed that the unmagnetite modified adsorbent CTS-Nap have practical greater influence on wastewater treatment management rather than the magnetic modified chitosan Fe3O4@CTS-Nap.","Khalil, Tarek E; Elhusseiny, Amel F; Ibrahim, Nagwa M; El-Dissouky, Ali",Int. j. biol. macromol,153,25

This study was performed with: (i) a positive panel constituted of 88 SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and (ii) a negative panel of 120 serum samples, all collected before November 2019, including 64 samples with a cross-reactivity panel. Sensitivity of Covid-Presto® test for IgM and IgG was 78.4% and 92.0%, respectively. Sensitivity of NG-Test® for IgM and IgG was 96.6% and 94.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of Abbott IgG assay was 96.5% showing an excellent agreement with the two rapid tests (&#954; = 0.947 and &#954; = 0.936 for NGTest ® and Covid-Presto® test, respectively). An excellent agreement was also observed between the two rapid tests (&#954; = 0.937). Specificity for IgM was 100% and 86.5% for Covid-Presto® test and NG-Test®, respectively. Specificity for IgG was 92.0%, 94.9% and 96.5% for Covid-Presto®, NGTest ®, and Abbott, respectively. Most of the false positive results observed with NG-Test® resulted from samples containing malarial antibodies. In conclusion, performances of these 2 rapid tests are very good and comparable to those obtained with automated immunoassay, except for IgM specificity with the NG-Test®. Thus, isolated IgM should be cautiously interpreted due to the possible false-positive reactions with this test. Finally, before their large use, the rapid tests must be reliably evaluated with adequate and large panel including early seroconversion and possible cross-reactive samples.","Charpentier, Charlotte; Ichou, Houria; Damond, Florence; Bouvet, Elisabeth; Chaix, Marie-Laure; Ferré, Valentine; Delaugerre, Constance; Mahjoub, Nadia; Larrouy, Lucile; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Visseaux, Benoit; Mackiewicz, Vincent; Descamps, Diane; Fidouh-Houhou, Nadhira",J Clin Virol,153,32

METHODS: This study employed a cross-over design in healthy female volunteers. Twenty-five milligrams of melatonin was administered intravenously, intravesically, rectally, transdermally, and vaginally. Blood samples were collected at specified time points up to 24 h following intravenous, intravesical, rectal, and vaginal administration, and up to 48 h following transdermal administration. Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sedation was evaluated by a simple reaction-time test, and sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Adverse events were registered for each route of administration. RESULTS: Ten participants were included. We documented a mean (SD) time to maximal concentration of 51 (29) min for intravesical, 24 (20) min for rectal, 21 (8) h for transdermal, and 147 (56) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) elimination half-life was 47 (6) min for intravenous, 58 (7) min for intravesical, 60 (18) min for rectal, 14.6 (11.1) h for transdermal, and 129 (17) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) bioavailability was 3.6 (1.9)% for intravesical, 36.0 (28.6)% for rectal, 10.0 (5.7)% for transdermal, and 97.8 (31.7)% for vaginal administration. No significant changes in reaction times were observed following administration of melatonin by any of the administration routes. Increased tiredness was documented following transdermal administration only. No serious adverse effects were documented. CONCLUSION: Rectally and vaginally administered melatonin may serve as relevant alternatives to standard oral melatonin therapy. Transdermal delivery of melatonin displayed an extended absorption and can be applied if prolonged effects are intended. Intravesical administration displayed, as expected, a very limited bioavailability. Melatonin administered by these routes of administration was safe.","Zetner, Dennis; Andersen, Lars Peter Kloster; Alder, Rasmus; Jessen, Majken Lyhne; Tolstrup, Anders; Rosenberg, Jacob",Pharmacology,153,20

Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.","Pirouz, Behrouz; Haghshenas, Sina Shaffiee; Haghshenas, Sami Shaffiee; Piro, Patrizia",Sustainability,153,24

We aimed to develop a high-throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. METHODS: Spike protein subunits S1 and receptor binding domain, and nucleoprotein were coupled to microspheres. Sera collected before emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 224) and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (n = 184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 115) with various severities of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG concentrations. RESULTS: Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay specificity was 95.1%-99.0% with sensitivity 83.6%-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to nonhospitalized cases. CONCLUSIONS: The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories.

The timely availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming, several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials. As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which four have cleared phase III trials (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273, University of Oxford & AstraZeneca's AZD1222, and Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine).

We characterized Black/White disparities among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 in Cuyahoga County which has some of the most extreme health disparities in the U.S., such as a rate of Black infant mortality that is three times that of White counterparts. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using data collected as part of public health surveillance between March 16, 2020 until October 1, 2020. This study aimed to compare Black and Non-Black pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to understand how the distribution of risk factors may differ by race. Outcomes included age, gestational age at infection, medical co-morbidities, exposure history, socio-economic status, occupation, symptom severity and pregnancy complications. Findings One hundred and sixty-two women were included. 81 (50%) were Black, 67 (41%) White, 9 (0·05%) Hispanic, 2 (0·01%) Asian;and three did not self-identify with any particular race. More than half who supplied occupational information (n = 132) were essential workers as classified by the CDC definition (55%, n = 73). Black women were younger (p = 0·0062) and more likely to identify an occupational contact as exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 (p = 0·020). Non-Black women were more likely to work from home (p = 0·018) and indicate a personal or household contact as their exposure (p = 0·020). Occupation was a risk factor for severe symptoms (aOR 4·487, p = 0·037). Most Black women lived in areas with median income &lt;$39,000 and Black women were more likely to have a preterm delivery (22·2% versus 0%, p = 0·026). Interpretation Many pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 are essential workers. Black women are more likely than White counterparts to have occupational exposure as the presumed source for their infection. Limitations in occupational options and controlling risk in these positions could be related to lower socio-economic status, resulting from a long history of structural racism in Cuyahoga County as evidenced by redlining and other policies limiting opportunities for people of color.

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively.

To this end, we computationally investigated the MPD3 phytochemical database along with the pool of reported natural antiviral compounds with potential to be used as anti-SARS-CoV-2. The docking results demonstrated glycyrrhizin followed by azadirachtanin, mycophenolic acid, kushenol-w and 6-azauridine, as potential candidates. Glycyrrhizin depicted very stable binding mode to the active pocket of the Mpro (binding energy, -8.7 kcal/mol), PLpro (binding energy, -7.9 kcal/mol), and Nucleocapsid (binding energy, -7.9 kcal/mol) enzymes. This compound showed binding with several key residues that are critical to natural substrate binding and functionality to all the receptors. To test docking prediction, the compound with each receptor was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to characterize the molecule stability and decipher its possible mechanism of binding. Each complex concludes that the receptor dynamics are stable (Mpro (mean RMSD, 0.93 Å), PLpro (mean RMSD, 0.96 Å), and Nucleocapsid (mean RMSD, 3.48 Å)). Moreover, binding free energy analyses such as MMGB/PBSA and WaterSwap were run over selected trajectory snapshots to affirm intermolecular affinity in the complexes. Glycyrrhizin was rescored to form strong affinity complexes with the virus enzymes: Mpro (MMGBSA, -24.42 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, -10.80 kcal/mol), PLpro (MMGBSA, -48.69 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, -38.17 kcal/mol) and Nucleocapsid (MMGBSA, -30.05 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, -25.95 kcal/mol), were dominated mainly by vigorous van der Waals energy. Further affirmation was achieved by WaterSwap absolute binding free energy that concluded all the complexes in good equilibrium and stability (Mpro (mean, -22.44 kcal/mol), PLpro (mean, -25.46 kcal/mol), and Nucleocapsid (mean, -23.30 kcal/mol)).

Because eukaryal genomes are liberally interspersed with transcription units specifying long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, there are many opportunities for lncRNA synthesis to negatively affect a neighboring protein-coding gene. Here, I review two eukaryal systems in which lncRNA interference with mRNA expression underlies a regulated biological response to nutrient availability. Budding yeast SER3 is repressed under serine-replete conditions by transcription of an upstream SRG1 lncRNA that traverses the SER3 promoter and elicits occlusive nucleosome rearrangements. SER3 is de-repressed by serine withdrawal, which leads to shut-off of SRG1 synthesis. The fission yeast phosphate homeostasis (PHO) regulon comprises three phosphate acquisition genes - pho1, pho84, and tgp1 - that are repressed under phosphate-replete conditions by 5' flanking lncRNAs prt, prt2, and nc-tgp1, respectively. lncRNA transcription across the PHO mRNA promoters displaces activating transcription factor Pho7. PHO mRNAs are transcribed during phosphate starvation when lncRNA synthesis abates. The PHO regulon is de-repressed in phosphate-replete cells by genetic manipulations that favor 'precocious' lncRNA 3'-processing/termination upstream of the mRNA promoters. PHO lncRNA termination is governed by the Pol2 CTD code and is subject to metabolite control by inositol pyrophosphates.","Shuman, Stewart",Nucleic Acids Res,153,23

Dysregulation of host IFN responses has been known to be associated with severe disease progression in COVID-19 patients. However, the reported results are controversial and the roles of IFN responses in COVID-19 need to be investigated further. In the absence of a highly efficacious antiviral drug, clinical studies have evaluated recombinant type I and III IFNs, as they have been successfully used for the treatment of infections caused by two other epidemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.

Understanding of psychosocial factors related to the use of face coverings within the context of COVID-19 is needed. This study aimed to conceptualize mask-wearing behavior among students using the Multi-theory Model (MTM) of behavior change. Methods: In October 2020, students (n = 595) enrolled in a large public southeastern US university were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional survey, using a valid and reliable instrument. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques described mask-wearing behavior and differentiated theoretical drivers of mask-wearing between individuals compliant and noncompliant with guidelines. Results: Compliant individuals reported significantly higher scores (P &lt; 0.05) for initiation and sustenance of mask-wearing, participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, emotional transformation, practice for change, changes in the social environment, and significantly lower scores for disadvantage. Among multivariable models, all theoretical predictors exhibited significant relationships to their respective outcomes (initiation and sustenance). Specifically, MTM constructs explained approximately 35% of variance in initiation (R-2 = 0.346, F-(3,F-526) = 94.32, P &lt; 0.001) and 33% of variance in sustenance of mask wearing (R-2 = 0.328, F-(3,F-529) = 87.71, P &lt; 0.001) for compliant individuals. Behavioral confidence and emotional transformation exhibited the strongest relationships to initiation (beta = 0.403, P &lt; 0.001) and sustenance (beta = 0.450, P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Findings suggest a need to design educational programming based on the MTM to promote mask-wearing behavior among laggards who defy face mask guidelines, recommendations, and mandates.","Davis, R.

The blurred disc clinic,15.733638,6.542853,2020,"Vulnerable adolescents may lose control over cigarette use within a day or two after smoking their first cigarette, as nicotine dependence (ND) symptoms may appear before actual daily smoking and usually occur at low levels of daily smoking. Moreover, smoking can cause illnesses and promote other types of substance abuse. Therefore, it was deemed essential to adapt the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale to develop and validate the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) in Lebanese adolescents and evaluate whether cumulative cigarette smoking is associated with nicotine dependence and symptoms of dependence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, during the partial sanitary lockdown imposed by the government to limit COVID-19, coinciding with the summer holidays for most Lebanese. The total sample consisted of 564 community-dwelling adolescents aged 13 to 18. A factor analysis was performed using a varimax rotation. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measurement of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's sphericity test were appropriate. The factors retained corresponded to Eigenvalues > 1. Cronbach's alpha value represented the internal consistency of the scale. The Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) was used to screen for dependence symptoms. All items of the YACD were extracted, except for items 4 (smoking to concentrate at work) and 18 (smoking as a habit), which yielded a three-factor solution (factor 1 = smoking patterns; factor 2 = positive and negative reinforcements; factor 3 = smoking cessation) with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 56.18%; KMO = 0.784; Bartlett's sphericity test p < 0.001; &#945;Cronbach = 0.875). The newly generated scale was termed Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS) and consisted of 19 items. Higher ACDS scores (higher cigarette dependence) were significantly associated with higher HONC scores (higher symptoms of dependence) (rho = 0.647; p < 0.001). Having deceased (B = 8.54) or divorced (B = 4.26) parents and higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.29) were significantly associated with higher ACDS scores. Higher cumulative cigarette smoking (B = 0.05) was significantly associated with higher HONC scores due to cigarettes. This study could validate a new tool to evaluate nicotine dependence among Lebanese adolescents, the Adolescent Cigarette Dependence Scale (ACDS). This version adapted from the Young Adults' Cigarette Dependence (YACD) Scale is reliable and valuable and correlates well with other scales, such as the HONC. However, further studies are necessary to improve this instrument, adding new questions useful for the diagnosis and evaluation of cigarette dependence.","Hallit, Souheil; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Khoury, Alessandro; Salameh, Pascale",,153,1

Despite its limitations, Australia?s industrial relations system responded to the challenges of the pandemic in a way that less regulated and ?decentralised? systems would not have been able to. This article argues that the union movement was critical to Australia?s successful response, and that the award system proved to be an adaptable mechanism to deliver change at a national level while ensuring that the representative voice of workers was heard, and basic industrial protections were not jettisoned. Industry bargaining would have also been a beneficial tool to deal with economy-wide issues of this kind.

By analyzing metagenomic terabase datasets, we identified two compact families (775 to 803 amino acids (aa)) of CRISPR-Cas ribonucleases from hypersaline samples, named Cas13X and Cas13Y. We engineered Cas13X.1 (775 aa) for RNA interference experiments in mammalian cell lines. We found Cas13X.1 could tolerate single-nucleotide mismatches in RNA recognition, facilitating prophylactic RNA virus inhibition. Moreover, a minimal RNA base editor, composed of engineered deaminase (385 aa) and truncated Cas13X.1 (445 aa), exhibited robust editing efficiency and high specificity to induce RNA base conversions. Our results suggest that there exist untapped bacterial defense systems in natural microbes that can function efficiently in mammalian cells, and thus potentially are useful for RNA-editing-based research.","Xu, Chunlong; Zhou, Yingsi; Xiao, Qingquan; He, Bingbing; Geng, Guannan; Wang, Zikang; Cao, Birong; Dong, Xue; Bai, Weiya; Wang, Yifan; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Dongming; Yuan, Tanglong; Huo, Xiaona; Lai, Jinsheng; Yang, Hui",Nat Methods,153,16

In particular, the migration of exercise physiology labs, which included anaerobic and aerobic exercise tests, posed a considerable hurdle in attempting to provide a practical and engaging lab environment fully online. Using a qualitative case-study design, this presentation will highlight the experience of migrating exercise physiology labs into a virtual post-secondary course context. In Fall 2020, approximately 200 Kinesiology students attended a virtual second-year exercise physiology course, which included four previously in-person, bi-weekly labs. Labs were rapidly migrated onto an open access platform for integration into the existing institutional learning management system. Students completed bi-weekly labs in lab groups of 20-25 students, led by a Teaching Assistant (TA), with students working in small breakout groups of 4-5 students to complete the virtual lab as a group using a collaborative workspace. Following the breakouts, students would rejoin their peers in the main group for a post-lab discussion period to discuss lab report questions with the TA. After the lab, students completed a content quiz which included a responsive question: ?What did you like about the lab? What do you feel could be improved about the lab?? Given the importance of considering students as partners in course development, responses from students were considered in refinement of future virtual labs throughout the term. Responses were analyzed using qualitative coding for positive/neutral/negative responses, and general themes emerged for each lab. Briefly, main themes for improvement included: increased organization and instruction for navigating the virtual lab, more contact with the TA in breakout rooms, improving engagement between members of breakout groups, and enhancements to the virtual lab components. Positive themes included: students enjoying breakout room opportunities to connect with peers, TA support especially in the post-lab discussion period, and additional cues added to the virtual lab. Finally, student responses became increasingly positive from the first lab to fourth lab, with students noting their appreciation for being a part of the refinement process. Overall, this presentation, detailing the practical considerations of migrating labs to a virtual environment, will benefit future exercise physiology instructors in pursuing successful virtual lab delivery.","Williams, Jennifer Howarth Krista",The FASEB Journal,153,24

A nonameric peptide derived from a prevalent CBFB-MYH11 fusion protein was found to be immunogenic in HLA-B*40:01+ donors. High-avidity CD8+ T cell clones isolated from healthy donors killed CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML cell lines and primary human AML samples in vitro. CBFB-MYH11-specific T cells also controlled CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML in vivo in a patient-derived murine xenograft model. High-avidity CBFB-MYH11 epitope-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) transduced into CD8+ T cells conferred antileukemic activity in vitro. Our data indicate that the CBFB-MYH11 fusion neoantigen is naturally presented on AML blasts and enables T cell recognition and killing of AML. We provide proof of principle for immunologically targeting AML-initiating fusions and demonstrate that targeting neoantigens has clinical relevance even in low-mutational frequency cancers like fusion-driven AML. This work also represents a first critical step toward the development of TCR T cell immunotherapy targeting fusion gene-driven AML.","Biernacki, Melinda A; Foster, Kimberly A; Woodward, Kyle B; Coon, Michael E; Cummings, Carrie; Cunningham, Tanya M; Dossa, Robson G; Brault, Michelle; Stokke, Jamie; Olsen, Tayla M; Gardner, Kelda; Estey, Elihu; Meshinchi, Soheil; Rongvaux, Anthony; Bleakley, Marie",J. clin. invest,153,1

However, CT has been found to have limited sensitivity and negative predictive value in the early stages of the disease, and the value of its use has come under debate due to whether its images change the treatment plan, the risk of radiation, as well as its practicality with infection control. Therefore, there has been a shift to the use of other imaging modalities and tests, such as chest X-rays and ultrasound. Furthermore, the use of nucleic acid-based testing such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have proven useful with direct confirmation of COVID-19 infection.

Real-life pointing tasks are both spatially and temporally unconstrained. Spatial adjustment alone is insufficient for modelling these tasks due to several human factors. To resolve this, we propose $ANTASID$ (A Novel Temporal Adjustment to $SID$) formulation with detailed performance analysis.

Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. METHODS: We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based detection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple organ pathogenic pro-inflammatory responses. Direct viral tissue damage is a transient phenomenon that is generally not sustained throughout disease progression.","El Jamal, Siraj M; Pujadas, Elisabet; Ramos, Irene; Bryce, Clare; Grimes, Zachary M; Amanat, Fatima; Tsankova, Nadejda M; Mussa, Zarmeen; Olson, Sara; Salem, Fadi; Miorin, Lisa; Aydillo, Teresa; Schotsaert, Michael; Albrecht, Randy A; Liu, Wen-Chun; Marjanovic, Nada; Francoeur, Nancy; Sebra, Robert; Sealfon, Stuart C; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Fowkes, Mary; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Westra, William H",Hum. pathol,153,20

To estimate the scale of the pandemic in Poland, a serosurvey of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was performed after the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (March–May 2020). Within this study, we collected samples from 28 July to 24 September 2020 and, based on the ELISA results, we found that 1.67% (25/1500, 95% CI 1.13–2.45) of the Poznan (Poland) metropolitan area’s population had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after the first wave of COVID-19. However, the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was confirmed with immunoblotting in 56% (14/25) samples, which finally resulted in a decrease in seroprevalence, i.e., 0.93% (14/1500, 95% CI 0.56–1.56). The positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results were associated with age, occupation involving constant contact with people, travelling abroad, non-compliance with epidemiological recommendations and direct contact with the novel coronavirus. Our findings confirm the low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Poland and imply that the population had little herd immunity heading into the second and third wave of the pandemic, and therefore, that herd immunity contributed little to preventing the high numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths in Poland during these subsequent waves.","Lorent, Dagny Nowak Rafal Roxo Carolina Lenartowicz Elzbieta Makarewicz Aleksandra Zaremba Bartosz Nowak Szymon Kuszel Lukasz Stefaniak Jerzy Kierzek Ryszard Zmora Pawel",Vaccines,153,11

METHOD: We retrospectively included 68 CTs (61 patients) with COVID-19. CRs were collected from the digital database while corresponding SRs were written by an expert radiologist, including a sign checklist, severity score index and final impressions. New CRs were prepared for a random subset (n = 10) of cases, to allow comparisons in reporting time and word count. CRs were analyzed to record severity score and final impressions inclusion. A random subset of 40 paired CRs and SRs was evaluated by two clinicians to assess, using a Likert scale, readability, comprehensiveness, comprehensibility, conciseness, clinical impact, and overall quality. RESULTS: Overall, 19/68 (28 %) and 9/68 (13 %) of CRs included final impressions and severity score, respectively. SR writing required significantly (p < 0.001) less time (mean = 308 s; SD ± 60 s) compared to CRs (mean = 458 s; SD ± 72 s).

The second phase of the project aims to characterize individual trajectories in the course of either healthy and pathological aging, from a group of 50 subjects over 90 who will undergo a comprehensive clinical examination comprised of neurological and cognitive testing, MRI and EEG. The ultimate goal of the project is to characterize the biophysical and clinical profiles of a population that tends to receive little attention in the literature. A better understanding of the rapidly increasing group of nonagenarians will also help to design new policies that minimize the impact and future social and economic consequences of rapidly aging societies.","Fernández-Blázquez, Miguel A; Del Ser, Teodoro; Frades-Payo, Belén; Ávila-Villanueva, Marina; Valentí-Soler, Meritxell; Benítez-Robredo, María T; Bermejo-Aguña, Antonio; Pedrero-Pérez, Eduardo J; Quilis-Sancho, Javier; Pastor, Ana B; Fernández-Garrido, Concepción; Morales-Alonso, Sara; Diaz-Olalla, José M; Santos, Nadine Correia; Maestú, Fernando; Gómez-Ramírez, Jaime",PLoS One,153,16

To get insights into the possible role of the immune system upon COVID-19 infection, 2811 genes of the gene ontology term ""immune system process GO: 0002376"" were selected for coexpression analysis of the human targets of SARS-CoV-2 (HT-SARS-CoV-2) ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in tissue samples from patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus. The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least coexpressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of which there were eight common networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and pan-cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90), and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues. Using this approach, three commonly applicable druggable connections between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes were identified. These include positive associations of ACE2-DPP4 and TMPRSS2-SRC as well as a negative association of FURIN with ADAM17. Furthermore, 16 drugs were extracted from STITCH (score <0.8) with 32 target genes. Thus, an immunological network associated with HT-SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics tools was identified leading to novel therapeutic opportunities for COVID-19.","Subbarayan, Karthikeyan; Ulagappan, Kamatchi; Wickenhauser, Claudia; Bachmann, Michael; Seliger, Barbara",Front Immunol,153,6

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on DDH-USS, in two paediatric orthopaedic centres in one of the most critical areas of the western World.MethodsAn academic teaching hospital and paediatric trauma centre (T) and a University hospital and DDH referral centre (H), classified as national COVID-19 hubs, were involved. Graf’s method was applied in both centres. In T, paediatricians directly referred only patients with delayed DDH-USS or suspicious unstable hips;in H, paediatricians or parents could directly refer to the screening service.ResultsThe mean age of the 95 patients (190 hips) who were referred for DDH-USS in T, was 3.85 months (0.1 to 7.4);175 were type I, nine were type IIa (+ and -), five type D and one type IV. In H, the screened patients in 2020 were only 78% of the same period in 2019. A total of 28 patients with 32 hips (8 IIb, 5 IIc, 8 D, 11 III) had late diagnosis at a mean age of 114 days (96 to 146). In the same period in 2019 only eight patients with 11 hips (8 IIb, 1 D, 1 III, 1 IV) at a mean age of 142 days (92 to 305) had late diagnosis.ConclusionDDH-USS was the only screening in newborns which halted during lockdown.

Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Seo, H.; Altschwager, D.; Choi, B.

Bearing this in mind the current study was aimed to explore the determinants of vaccine hesitancy amongst the Pakistani population. MethodologyA cross-sectional study was carried out from November 2020 to March 2021. The conceptual framework of the study was based on the 3Cs (Confidence, Convenience, Complacency) model. The google-forms-based questionnaire was disseminated amongst the general population. Data collected were entered into SPSS version 26 and analyzed. ResultsOf the 421 participants, 68.4% were women. Non-healthcare workers were 55.8% of respondents. Of vaccine-hesitant individuals, 26.13% reported they were very unlikely to get vaccinated. The vaccine was not safe as it came out too fast was agreed upon by 12.6% of individuals, 50.6% were worried about experiencing side-effects, 18% believed the vaccine will not offer protection and 5.9% believed the vaccine would cause death. Low Practice of SOP in non-Healthcare workers was the strongest contributor to vaccine hesitancy (OR: 5.338, p=0.040, 95% CI: 1.082-26.330) followed by High complacency (p=0.026) and Moderate Complacency (OR: 0.212, p=0.007, 95% CI: 0.069-0.654) towards COVID-19 vaccination. In Healthcare workers the strongest contributor to vaccine hesitancy was having a Moderate Confidence (OR: 0.323, p=0.042, 95% CI: 0.109-0.958) in the vaccine followed by Moderate Convenience (OR: 0.304, p=0.049, 95% CI: 0.093-0.993) for vaccination ConclusionCampaigning and communication strategies to reaffirm confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and educating the general population about the vaccine could lead to increased perception of vaccine safety and effectiveness thereby restoring confidence in vaccine and decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Likewise, working to increase vaccine convenience and decreasing complacency towards the COVID-19 vaccine would translate into high vaccine uptake.","Sheikh, Naveen Siddique; Touseef, Mumtaz; Sultan, Riddah; Cheema, Kanwal Hassan; Cheema, Sidra Shafiq; Sarwar, Afia; Siddique, Haniya Zainab",,153,15

Greater expectations of loneliness and more solidarity with our fellow men were associated with gender (female), younger age and work situation (telecommuting). Greater perceived vulnerability to disease was related to a greater belief that public health measures protect the population, but also to a critical stance towards the Belgian government's handling of the crisis. High agreeableness and high emotional stability were associated with respectively greater belief that health measures protect the population, and greater support for the government's crisis management.

However, most of them are based on circumstantial evidences, like the association between latitude-related sunlight exposure and mortality rate, while studies based on patients' VitD measurements are still scarce. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the VitD levels (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D) from a cohort of 347 patients admitted to a northern Italian Hospital as suspected COVID-19s. Of them, 128 were positive (83 males, aged 62.7 ± 14.2 and 45 females, aged 69.3 ± 15.6) and 219 were negative (107 males, aged 62.8 ± 19.5 and 112 females, aged 54.3 ± 20.1).

The striking similarities between COVID-19 and other outbreaks that took place over the past two decades, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, highlight the severity of the situation and dictate that extra measures should be taken by the transplant programs to avoid adverse outcomes. Transplant organizations are currently calling for strict screening and isolation protocols to be established in all transplant programs, for both organ donors and recipients. As the situation escalates, more radical measures might be necessary, including a temporary hold on non-urgent transplantations, resulting in serious ethical dilemmas between the survival of these patients and the safety of the community. Further data about these special populations could result in more individualized guidelines for abdominal organ transplantation in the era of COVID-19.","Esagian, Stepan M.; Ziogas, Ioannis A.; Giannis, Dimitrios; Hayat, Muhammad H.; Elias, Nahel; Tsoulfas, Georgios",Front.

Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. METHODS: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (CT). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. CT value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33 &#8804; CT < 35.3 CT range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings. CONCLUSION: The simple workflow modification eliminating the SDD led to an overall improvement in the detection of positive specimens and also simplified workflow and reduced hands-on time.","Zhen, Wei; Whitfield, Natalie N; Smith, Elizabeth; Shaw, Christine; Ivy, Cristina; Douglas, Caylee; Bickford, Stephanie; Berry, Gregory J",,153,1

The COVID-19 outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation with higher transmissibility and infectivity compared with SARS and MERS. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness. The prevalent cause of mortality is pneumonia that progresses to ARDS. The ongoing pandemic has already resulted in more than 135,000 deaths and an unprecedented burden on national health systems worldwide. Pending the availability of a vaccine, there is a critical need to identify effective treatments and a number of clinical trials have been implemented worldwide. Trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other infections, have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy at present, as it is still unclear how well these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2.

Sprague-Dawley, Fischer 344, and Brown-Norway male rats were maintained on a high-fat, or regular diet for 24 weeks. Liver tissue was collected at 4, 12, and 24 weeks to assess global small molecule metabolite changes using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The results of the global metabolomics analysis revealed significant changes based on both age and diet within all three strains. Principal component analysis revealed that the influence of diet caused a greater variation in significantly changing metabolites than that of age for the Brown Norway and Fisher 344 strains, whereas diet had the greatest influence in the Sprague Dawley strain only at the 4-week time point. As expected, metabolites involved in lipid metabolism were changed in the animals maintained on a high fat diet compared to the regular diet. There were also significant changes observed in the concentration of Tri carboxylic acid cycle intermediates that were extracted from the liver of all three strains based on diet. The results of this study showed that a high fat diet caused significant liver and metabolic changes compared to a regular diet in multiple rat strains. The inbred Fisher 344 and Brown Norway rats were more metabolically sensitive to the diet changes than outbred Sprague Dawley strain. The study also showed that age, as was the case for Sprague Dawley, is an important variable to consider when assessing metabolic changes.","Boyce, Greg; Shoeb, Mohammad; Kodali, Vamsi; Meighan, Terence; Roberts, Jenny R; Erdely, Aaron; Kashon, Michael; Antonini, James M",PLoS One,153,21

At a safety net health system in Massachusetts, 11 534 adults were retrospectively followed within 3 months of the COVID-19 lockdown. Chi-square and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for categorical and continues variables, respectively. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with weight gain (&#8805;0.01 kg and 5%). During the lockdown period, greater proportion of women gained weight compared to men (46.1% vs 40.6%, P < .01). The obesity rate after the lockdown increased among women (40.7%-41.7, P < .01) but decreased among men (39.6%-38.6, P < .01) compared to before the lockdown.

To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed postmortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients' ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.","Tian, Sufang; Xiong, Yong; Liu, Huan; Niu, Li; Guo, Jianchun; Liao, Meiyan; Xiao, Shu-Yuan",Mod Pathol,153,17

Next, EEG was used to investigate the effect of fragrant cooked brown rice on human brain activity. In addition, the key components of M. alba oil on the sensory effects were determined. The results indicated that M. alba oil vapour &#8805; 450 µL/L provided effective antifungal activity against natural moulds on brown rice for at least 90 days of storage at 25 °C at 100% RH. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of M. alba oil vapour for enhancing consumer preference and acceptance of cooked brown rice was 300-600 µL/L with a rejection threshold of 2,052 µL/L. Moreover, it was found that linalool was the main key component and caryophyllene and ß-elemene were the minor components affecting the sensory quality enhancement. Interestingly, the EEG results showed that fragrant cooked brown rice could increase the power of alpha and beta waves in the human brain, indicating anti-stress effects and a relaxed mood. Therefore, M. alba oil vapour demonstrated good potential to enhance consumer acceptance and preference for cooked brown rice while controlling the significant growth of moulds in brown rice.","Songsamoe, Sumethee; Koomhin, Phanit; Matan, Narumol",J Food Sci Technol,153,24

This glycoprotein is essential for the reproduction of the SARS-COV-2 virus, so its inhibition opens new avenues for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease. In doing so, we used the VINI in silico model of cancer, whose high accuracy in finding effective drugs and their combinations was confirmed in vitro by comparison with existing results from NCI-60 bases, and in vivo by comparison with existing clinical trial results. In the first step, the VINI model calculated the inhibition efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with 44 FDA-approved antiviral drugs. Of these drugs, HIV drugs have been shown to be effective, while others mainly have shown weak or no efficiency. Subsequently, the VINI model calculated the inhibition efficiency of all possible double and triple HIV drug combinations, and among them identified ten with the highest inhibition efficiency. These ten combinations were analyzed by Medscape drug-drug interaction software and LexiComp Drug Interactions. All combinations except the combination of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have serious interactions (risk rating category D) when dosage adjustments/reductions are required for possible toxicity. Finally, the VINI model compared the inhibition efficiency of cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine combination with cocktails and individual drugs already used or planned to be tested against SARS-CoV-2. Combination cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine demonstrated the highest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein over others. Thus, this combination seems to be a promising candidate for the further in vitro testing and clinical trials.","Tomi'c, Dravsko; Skala, Karolj; Szasz, Attila Marcel; Rezeli, Melinda; Vrca, Vesna Bavci'c; Pirki'c, Boris; Petrik, Jozsef; Jandjel, Vladimir; Perivsa, Marija Milkovi'c; Rogina, Branka Medved; Mesari'c, Josip; Davidovi'c, Davor; Informatics, Tomislav Lipi'c Center for; Computing,; Institute, Rudjer Bovskovi'c; Zagreb,; Croatia,; Bioinformatics, Department of; Center, Cancer; Budapest, Semmelweis University; Hungary,; Engineering, Department of Biomedical; University, Lund; Lund,; Sweden,; Pharmacy, Central Hospital; Dubrava, Clinical Hospital Center; Surgery,; Orthopedics,; Clinic, Ophthalmology; Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary; Zagreb, University of; Biochemistry, Department of Medical; Hematology,; Pharmacy, Faculty of; Biochemistry,; Obstetricy, Deprtment of; Zagreb, Clinical Hospital Centre; Pathology, Institute of; Zagreb, School of Medicine University of; Information, Laboratory for; Processing, Signal; Electronics, Division of; Institute, Rudjer Boskovi'c; Engineering, Faculty of Electrical; Lab, Machine Learning; Representations, Knowledge",,153,1

Current literature suggests that the C-terminus of nsp1 competes for the mRNA binding site in the 40S ribosome, preventing host translation from host mRNAs. However, several mutations on surface residues of nsp1 are reported to either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function suggesting a role of these surface amino acids in dampening host gene expression. Additionally, nsp1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 84% sequence identity, prompting us to believe they share a similar mechanism of host shutoff. To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney (HEK) cells using the proximity-dependent biotinylation experiment by expressing nsp1 fused to BIOID2. BioID2 is a promiscuous bacterial biotin ligase protein that attaches biotin to free lysine residues of nearby proteins. Biotin treatment of these cells incorporates biotin tag on proteins proximal to nsp1. Using streptavidin magnetic beads, we isolated these proteins and identified them using mass spectroscopy. Finally, several factors were verified by western blot. By comparing protein complexes, we identified a group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. These proteins are common in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Currently, we are using similar methods to verify the binding of these proteins to nsp1 mutations in the N-terminus and C-terminus.","Nag, Anita Gerassimovich Yevgeniy Miladinovski-Bengall Samantha",The FASEB Journal,153,10

Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression.

Their use was prioritized to protect the most vulnerable, notably, the elderly. Because of fluctuations in vaccine availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost have been employed. The effectiveness of these strategies in the frail elderly are unknown. MethodsIn this real-world vaccination study, under a government-decreed rationing strategy, elderly adults residing in long-term care facilities, with or without previously-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 16-week interval between doses. Clinical data and blood were serially collected during and after this interval period. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to trimeric S; RBD; nucleocapsid) by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. FindingsAfter a significant increase 4 weeks post-prime dose, there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels until the boost dose, followed by an increase 4 weeks later. Previously uninfected individuals exhibited lower antibody responses up to 16 weeks post-prime dose, but achieved comparable levels to previously infected counterparts by 4 weeks post-second dose. Individuals primed with BNT162b2 exhibited larger decrease in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels with 16-week interval between doses, compared to those who received mRNA-1273. No differences in antibody levels 4 weeks after the second dose were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous combinations. InterpretationsThese interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study show that, among frail elderly, neither age, sex, nor comorbidity affect antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID vaccines, but previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and type of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval between doses. Homologous/heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following second dose, supporting their interchangeability. FundingThis project was supported by funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada, through the Vaccine Surveillance Reference group and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (CITF).","Vinh, Donald C; Gouin, Jean-Philippe; Cruz-Santiago, Diana; Canac-Marquis, Michelle; Bernier, Stéphane; Bobeuf, Florian; Sengupta, Avik; Brassard, Jean-Philippe; Guerra, Alyssa; Dziarmaga, Rob; Perez, Anna; Sun, Yichun; Li, Yongbiao; Roussel, Lucie; Langelier, Melanie; Ke, Danbing; Arnold, Corey; Pelchat, Martin; Langlois, Marc-André; Evans, Timothy G.; Zhang, Xun; Mazer, Bruce D.",,153,1

RECENT FINDINGS: There are a very small number of postmortem neuropathological series of coronavirus disease 2019-related cerebrovascular and parenchymal disease. However, they fall into at least three major categories, with the majority manifesting those of terminal hypoxia, and others demonstrating inflammatory vascular leptomeningeal, cerebral and brainstem interstitial changes suspicious for encephalitis in a minority of cases. It remains uncertain whether these histopathological features have a relationship to post-infectious inflammatory immune mechanisms and microscopic vasculitis in adults as it appears to be in affected children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. SUMMARY: The reasons for this dichotomy are unclear but may related to inherent and epigenetic factors that remain poorly understood. Treatment addressing postinfectious mechanisms of pulmonary, systemic, and nervous system injury may avert early mortality.","Younger, David S",Curr Opin Rheumatol,153,29

RESULTS: The skeletal class, forward head posture, and shoulder discrepancy presented statistical association with the symmetrical electromyographic response of digastric muscles and masseter muscles during swallowing. DISCUSSION: This study exhibited a positive relationship between digastric muscle symmetry and skeletal class during swallowing. The compensation of the hyoid system explains these results, showing that skeletal Class III has better electromyographic balance. In contrast, masseter muscle symmetry during swallowing presented a negative relationship with skeletal class. The stabilization role that this muscle plays during swallowing explains these findings, caused by the different lengths and direction of this muscle in skeletal Class III.","Espinoza, Sebastián; Peirano, Gabriela; Tapia, Nancy; Venega, Patricia; Marfull, Norman",Cranio,153,20

Our model, that we call SUDR+K, grounds on the usual SIR model, with the difference of splitting the total fraction of infected individuals in two components: patients that are still undetected and patients that have been already detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly, we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change of the testing rate around the bi-stable point can determine a fluctuation of the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.","Zlatic, Vinko; Barjasic, Irena; Kadovic, Andrea; Stefancic, Hrvoje; Gabrielli, Andrea",Nonlinear Dyn,153,1

Little is known about the biological pathways associated in FIP pathogenesis. This is the first study aiming to determine the phenotypic characteristics on the cellular level in relation to specific metabolic pathways of importance to FIP pathogenesis. Methods: The internalization of type II FIPV WSU 79-1146 in Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CrFK) cells was visualized using a fluorescence microscope, and optimization prior to phenotype microarray (PM) study was performed. Then, four types of Biolog Phenotype MicroArray™ plates (PM-M1 to PM-M4) precoated with different carbon and nitrogen sources were used to determine the metabolic profiles in FIPV-infected cells. Results: The utilization of palatinose was significantly low in FIPV-infected cells; however, there were significant increases in utilizing melibionic acid, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid and alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln) compared to non-infected cells. Conclusion: This study has provided the first insights into the metabolic profiling of a feline coronavirus infection in vitro using PMs and deduced that glutamine metabolism is one of the essential metabolic pathways for FIPV infection and replication.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study with historical control. SETTING: Tertiary referral outpatient institute. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive services provided to patients with spinal disorders (N=1207). INTERVENTIONS: Telemedicine services included teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy, and lasted as long as usual interventions. They were delivered using free teleconference apps, caregivers were actively involved, and interviews and counseling were performed as usual. Teleconsultations included standard, but adapted, measurements and evaluations by video and from photographs and videos sent in advance according to specific tutorials. During telephysiotherapy, new sets of exercises were defined and recorded as usual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared the number of services provided in 3 phases, including corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. During the control (30 working d) and COVID-19 surge (13d) only usual consultations and physiotherapy were provided; during the telemed phase (15d), only teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy were provided. If a reliable medical decision was not possible during teleconsultations, usual face-to-face interventions were prescribed. Continuous quality improvement questionnaires were also evaluated. RESULTS: During telemed, 325 teleconsulations and 882 telephysiotherapy sessions were provided in 15 days. We found a rapid decrease (-39%) of outpatient services from the control to the COVID-19 phase (R2=0.85), which partially recovered in the telemed phase for telephysiotherapy (from -37% to -21%; P<.05) and stabilized for teleconsultation (from -55% to -60%) interventions. Usual face-to-face interventions were required for 0.5% of patients. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was very high (2.8 out of 3). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is feasible and allows medical professionals to continue providing outpatient services with a high level of patient satisfaction. During the current pandemic, this experience can provide a viable alternative for many outpatient services while reducing the need for travel and face-to-face contact to a minimum.","Negrini, Stefano; Donzelli, Sabrina; Negrini, Alberto; Negrini, Alessandra; Romano, Michele; Zaina, Fabio",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,153,24

We have used the modified Bateman SIZ algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the Corona-Warn-App. RESULTS: The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of > 4,500 daily within 18 months when > 67,000 persons would have been infected. This could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID-19. The methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by independent investigators using different commercial software packages. CONCLUSION: The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, and use of the Corona-Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy.","Braun, Peter; Haffner, Steffen; Woodcock, Barry G",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,153,20

In a recent study, 1000 potential ligands were identified for 3CLpro by screening 1.3 billion compounds from the ZINC15 library. In the current study, we have further screened these 1000 compounds using structure-based virtual screening utilizing the Schrödinger suite and identified nine compounds having a docking score of â¼ -11.0 kcal/mol or less. The top 5 hits display good pharmacological profiles revealing better absorption, proper permeability across the membrane, uniform distribution, and non-toxic. The molecular docking study is further complemented by molecular dynamics simulations of the top 5 docked complexes. The binding free energy analyses via the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) scheme reveals that ZINC000452260308 is the most potent (&#916;Gbind = -14.31 kcal/mol) inhibitor.

Herein, we characterize the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by routine screening (RS) in comparison with those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion or exposure history (nonroutine screening [NRS]). METHODS: A multisite prospective observational study was conducted at three major and five satellite campuses of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center between March 18 and July 31, 2020. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admissions and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand four hundred fifty-two patients underwent RS in the outpatient setting only, and 44 (0.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. RS detected 19 additional patients from the scheduled inpatient admissions for surgical or interventional procedures or inpatient chemotherapy. One hundred sixty-one patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of NRS. COVID-19-related hospitalization rate (17.5% v 26.7%; P = .14), intensive care unit admission (1.6% v 5.6%; P = .19), and mortality (4.8% v 3.7%; P = .72) were not significantly different between the RS and NRS groups. In the multivariable analysis, age &#8805; 60 years (odds ratio, 4.4; P = .023) and an absolute lymphocyte count &#8804; 1.4 × 109/L (odds ratio, 9.2; P = .002) were independent predictors of COVID-19-related hospital admission. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 positivity rate was low on the basis of RS. Comparing the hospital admission and mortality outcomes with the NRS cohort, there were no significant differences. The value of routine pre-emptive screening of asymptomatic patients with cancer for COVID-19 remains low.","Xie, Zhuoer; Saliba, Antoine N; Abeykoon, Jithma; Majeed, Umair; Almquist, Daniel R; Wiedmeier-Nutor, Julia E; Bezerra, Evandro; Andrade-Gonzalez, Xavier; Hickman, Ashley; Sorenson, Karl; Rakshit, Sagar; Wee, Christopher; Tella, Sri Harsha; Kommalapati, Anuhya; Abdallah, Nadine; Pritchett, Joshua; De Andrade, Mariza; Uprety, Dipesh; Badley, Andrew; Manochakian, Rami; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Bryce, Alan H; Hubbard, Joleen M; Gangat, Naseema; Thompson, Carrie A; Witzig, Thomas E; McWilliams, Robert R; Leventakos, Konstantinos; Halfdanarson, Thorvardur R",JCO Oncol Pract,153,24

Not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.

The argument is that the pandemic context in which we live has opened the way for the State to intensify eviction and eviction actions, promoting various focuses of land conflicts, violations of human rights and the right to the city and increasing the vulnerability of an already existing vulnerable territory, by reducing minimum conditions of care and social assistance to a population historically unassisted. To carry out this research, we systematized a bibliographic review about the concepts of forced removal and involuntary displacement and performed a documentary research to map data regarding evictions, number of removals, Covid-19 vulnerability index, virus spatialization and sociodemographic information of the district Santa Cecilia as a whole, for a second moment, we investigate how corrections for removals and evictions take place in the Campos Eliseos neighborhood. We found that, at this time, 1624 people are threatened with removal in the Blocks 37 and 38, which are expected to be targets of other large urban projects via PPPs. Therefore, we consider that the possibility of ""staying at home"" as one of the social isolation measures promoted and recommended by the government in combating the pandemic, confronts the selectivity of a State that, on the one hand, expresses care and empathy for lives that matter and, on the other hand, takes away the house of that who most needs assistance.","Pieve, S.

Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to question the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several predictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of topological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains that are constrained such as to mimic the action of predicted molecular actors. More specifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act as topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained bead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics simulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather strong constraints on their binding sites; they must block the diffusion of the excess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and, simultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other one. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition. For example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA nonspecifically, like H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might also explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why multiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains. Strikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented, relaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains. Moreover, although the value of the torsional stress in each domain may vary, their differential is preserved. Our work also predicts that nucleoid-associated proteins known to wrap DNA must form higher protein-DNA complexes to efficiently work as topological barriers.","Joyeux, Marc; Junier, Ivan",Biophys. j,153,22

Recently, global attention has turned to preliminary reports on the promising anti-COVID-19 effect of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), most especially Famotidine. Therefore, this study was designed to exploit a possible molecular basis for the efficacy of H2RAs against coronavirus. Molecular docking was performed between four H2RAs, Cimetidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, Ranitidine, and three non-structural proteins viz. NSP3, NSP7/8 complex, and NSP9. Thereafter, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out with the most outstanding ligands to determine the stability. Thereafter, Famotidine and Cimetidine were subjected to gene target prediction analysis using HitPickV2 and eXpression2Kinases server to determine the possible network of genes associated with their anti-COVID activities. Results obtained from molecular docking showed the superiority of Famotidine and Cimetidine compared to other H2RAs with a higher binding affinity to all selected targets. Molecular dynamic simulation and MMPBSA results revealed that Famotidine as well as Cimetidine bind to non-structural proteins more efficiently with high stability over 100 ns. Results obtained suggest that Famotidine and Cimetidine could be a viable option to treat COVID-19 with a mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of viral replication through the inhibition of non-structural proteins. Therefore, Famotidineand Cimetidine qualify for further study as a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Ishola, Ahmed A; Joshi, Tanuja; Abdulai, Suliat I; Tijjani, Habibu; Pundir, Hemlata; Chandra, Subhash",J Biomol Struct Dyn,153,16

METHODS: This retrospective study involved subjects from seven centers that were admitted and found to be positive for H1N1 or COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients with H1N1 and 309 patients with COVID-19 were involved in the study. H1N1 patients were younger than COVID-19 ones. While 58.7% of H1N1 patients were female, 57.9% of COVID-19 patients were male. Complaints of fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, myalgia, weakness, headache, and shortness of breath in H1N1 patients were statistically higher than in COVID-19 ones. The duration of symptoms until H1N1 patients were admitted to the hospital was shorter than that for COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia was more common in COVID-19 patients. C-reactive protein levels were higher in COVID-19 patients, while lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in H1N1 ones. The mortality rate was also higher in H1N1 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is a major public health problem that continues to affect the world with its high rate of contagion. In addition, no vaccines or a specific drug for the benefit of millions of people have been found yet. The H1N1 pandemic is an epidemic that affected the whole world about ten years ago and was prevented by the development of vaccines at a short period.

Especially, those living in informal settlements and slums worldwide have been profoundly impacted by this pandemic. Individuals living in these places are already leading underprivileged lives. Thus, the economic and mental health problems caused by the COVID-19 crisis have further exacerbated their living standards, which has resulted, for instance, in tragedies such as suicides. Objective: In this study, we have sought to identify those individuals most at risk of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19 in an informal settlement located in the capital city of Peru. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to 449 inhabitants living in the Carmen Alto informal settlement. The questionnaire was made up of two parts: the first one inquired about demographic data and the second part consisted of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: The demographic variables of age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupation, whether a relative from the household was infected with COVID-19, and whether one of them died of this showed significant differences. It could be observed as well that the groups of females, stable workers, unemployed and those having completed a workforce education are at higher odds of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19. As expected, the groups that had either a relative infected with COVID-19 or a relative death by this had the highest levels of fear towards the virus. Conclusion: The female participants are more likely to display higher levels of fear of COVID-19 due to the terrible effect that unfavorable events have on them. In the cases of the unemployed and stable workers, their proneness to show high levels of fear towards the virus is because they have lost their incomes, due to the loss of their jobs, and because of fear of infection, respectively. Hence, we hope that this work serves Peruvian (and other) health authorities to develop strategies that help individuals living in informal settlements and are in urgent need of mitigating mental health problems.","Sotomayor-Beltran, C.; Matta-Solis, H.; Perez-Siguas, R.; Matta-Solis, E.; Matta-Zamudio, L.",Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health,153,1

However, there is no research examining how the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) regulates morphine's paradoxical effect of reward and aversion. The present study addresses this issue, utilizing a high concentration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) via injections to destroy the VTA or the PAG. Moreover, the study employed the new ""pre- and postassociation"" experimental paradigm (2010) to test whether the simultaneous rewarding and aversive effects of morphine can be affected by an NMDA lesion in the VTA or the PAG. The results indicated that the NMDA lesion of the VTA simultaneously reduced morphine-induced conditioned suppression of saccharin solution intake in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and morphine-induced spent time in the preference compartment in conditioned place preference (CPP), whereas the PAG lesion did not change either measure. Thus, the VTA, but not the PAG, appears to contribute to the paradoxical effect reward in CPP and aversion in CTA induced by morphine. The VTA's involvement in morphine-induced CTA aversion and CPP reward supports the paradoxical effect hypothesis of abused drugs.

Further, concerns were raised about a potentially significant backlog of patients in need of cancer care due to the pandemic-related delays in healthcare, further exacerbating any potential adverse outcomes. Delayed access to surgery is particularly relevant to urologic oncology since one-third of new cancers in men (20% overall) arise from the genitourinary (GU) tract and surgery is often the primary treatment. Herein, we summarize the prepandemic literature on deferred surgery for GU cancers and risk of disease progression. The aforementioned data on delayed surgery were gathered in the context of systemic delays present in certain healthcare systems, or occasionally, due to planned deferral in suboptimal surgical candidates. These data provide indirect, but sufficient insight to develop triage schemas for prioritization of uro-oncological cases. Herein, we outline the extent to which the pandemic-related triage guidelines had influenced urologic practice in various regions. To study the adverse outcomes in the pandemic-era, a survey of urologic oncologists was conducted regarding modifications in their initial management of urologic cancers and any delay-related adverse outcomes. While the adverse effects directly from COVID-19 related delays will become apparent in the coming years, the results showing short-term outcomes are quite instructive. Since cancer care was assigned a higher priority at most centers, this strategy may have avoided significant delays in care and limited the anticipated negative impact of pandemic-related constraints.","Mian, Badar M; Siddiqui, Sana; Ahmad, Ardalan E",Urol. oncol,153,16

Given the increase in the volume of information sharing on social media during COVID-19, this study aims to grasp the largely unknown interaction of the individual's trust in citizen journalism practices and public perception formulation. Drawing on this idea, the study has twofold objectives: first, to examine the influence of user-generated information about economic policies of government during COVID-19 as the antecedent of public perception about government performance and second, to identify the moderating role of trust in citizen journalism practices during COVID-19 through social networking sites. Design/methodology/approach The study used a survey method and a sample of 464 adults were collected through an online administrated questionnaire. Findings The findings specify that user-generated content that is pro-government economic policies during COVID-19 positively influenced the perception of government performance. On the other hand, user-generated information that criticized government economic policies had a negative influence on public perception. Originality/value This study seeks to intensify the understudied phenomenon of how nature and source of the information could interact to influence one's information processing during a crisis such as pandemic COVID-19. Furthermore, only a little research has been conducted in this area focusing on two mechanisms, namely;citizen journalism and trust in social media user-generated information about prevailing economic insecurities during crisis provided through citizen journalism.","Raza, S.

This paper describes a novel theoretical and practical framework for modelling volumetric heterogeneous objects on the basis of a novel unifying functionally-based hybrid representation called HFRep. This new representation allows for obtaining a continuous smooth distance field in Euclidean space and preserves the advantages of the conventional representations based on scalar fields of different kinds without their drawbacks. We systematically describe the mathematical and algorithmic basics of HFRep. The steps of the basic algorithm are presented in detail for both geometry and attributes. To solve some problematic issues, we have suggested several practical solutions, including a new algorithm for solving the eikonal equation on hierarchical grids. Finally, we show the practicality of the approach by modelling several representative heterogeneous objects, including those of a time-variant nature.","Tereshin, A.; Pasko, A.; Fryazinov, O.; Adzhiev, V.",,153,26

Many pieces of evidence show that miRNAs affect the viral RNA replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus to mediate changes in the host transcriptome. Many previous studies have been studying the interaction between human cells' miRNA and viral RNA to predict many targets along the viral genome. In this work, via the miRDB database, we determined the target scores of predicted human miRNA to bind with the ss-RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in general and its spike gene in specific. Our predicted miRNA targets of the ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 might destabilize the ss-RNA translation of SARS-CoV-2 that has been established by more than 80% of asymptomatic infected cases in Jordan due to host miRNA interactions. In respiratory epithelial cells, the high prediction scoring for miRNAs covers the RNA from 5' to 3' that explains successful antiviral defenses against ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and might lead to new nucleotide deletion mechanisms. The exciting findings here that the nucleotide substitution 1841Aâ¯â¯>â¯â¯G at the viral genomic RNA level, which is an amino acid substation D614G at the spike protein level showed a change in the predicted miRNA sequence from hsa-miR-4793-5p to hsa-miR-3620-3p with an increase in the target score from 91 to 92.","Haddad, Hazem",,153,10

In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued guidance on which groups should be prioritized to receive vaccines. For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.","Lemke, Michael K",Am. j. ind. med,153,32

Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen sequences (SSHHPS) can be found spanning the viral protease cleavage sites. We hypothesized that these sequences corresponded to specific host protein targets since >40 host proteins have been shown to be cleaved by Group IV viral proteases and one Group VI viral protease. Using PHI-BLAST and the viral protease cleavage site sequences, we searched the human proteome for host targets and analyzed the hit results. Although the polyprotein and host proteins related to the suppression of the innate immune responses may be the primary targets of these viral proteases, we identified other cleavable host proteins. These proteins appear to be related to the virus-induced phenotype associated with Group IV viruses, suggesting that information about viral pathogenesis may be extractable directly from the viral genome sequence. Here we identify sequences cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) in vitro within human MYH7 and MYH6 (two cardiac myosins linked to several cardiomyopathies), FOXP3 (an X-linked Treg cell transcription factor), ErbB4 (HER4), and vitamin-K-dependent plasma protein S (PROS1), an anticoagulation protein that prevents blood clots. Zinc inhibited the cleavage of these host sequences in vitro. Other patterns emerged from multispecies sequence alignments of the cleavage sites, which may have implications for the selection of animal models and zoonosis.

Thus, an essential part of medical students' workplace-based training is dedicated to core skills in clinical diagnostic sciences. Due to a reduction of clinical internships for fifth-year students in the wake of COVID-19 learning activities replacing this aspect of training were needed. Project description: Virtual Patient online learning materials addressing clinical diagnostic sciences, specifically, radiology, were developed to prepare students for the transition to workplace-based learning. Three types of activities related to interprofessional patient treatment, showing how radiology knowledge improves the diagnosing and treatment of patients, were used to design the narrative of each virtual patient. The materials also showed students ""how to learn"" in the clinical workplace while showing ""what to learn"". Students complete relevant tasks and compare their approach with experts' approach in a self-directed way. Results: Twenty self-study quizzes, accompanied by nine interactive Webinars were developed, providing 13% of the overall available replacement learning materials for the summer term 2020. In June 2020, 486 students completed the program and collected a mean share of 16% (SD=10) of their required credits by choosing to learn with these materials. Conclusion: Developing virtual patients based on three types of clinical activities to prepare students for the transition to workplace based learning proved successful and allowed rapid development of learning materials.

We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences. METHODS: Collaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China. Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei. The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined. RESULTS: At the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort). The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9â years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5â days) compared with patients outside Hubei. Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05-2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity. However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7â days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40-1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure. In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01-1.08)). CONCLUSION: There were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre. Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.","Liang, Wen-Hua; Guan, Wei-Jie; Li, Cai-Chen; Li, Yi-Min; Liang, Heng-Rui; Zhao, Yi; Liu, Xiao-Qing; Sang, Ling; Chen, Ru-Chong; Tang, Chun-Li; Wang, Tao; Wang, Wei; He, Qi-Hua; Chen, Zi-Sheng; Wong, Sook-San; Zanin, Mark; Liu, Jun; Xu, Xin; Huang, Jun; Li, Jian-Fu; Ou, Li-Min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Xie, Zhan-Hong; Ni, Zheng-Yi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-Liang; Peng, Yi-Xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-Hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-Ming; Liu, Ji-Yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-Jian; Qiu, Shao-Qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-Jiang; Zhu, Shao-Yong; Cheng, Lin-Ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-Yue; Zheng, Jin-Ping; Zhang, Nuo-Fu; Zhong, Nan-Shan; He, Jian-Xing",Eur. respir. j,153,21

The current surgical gold treatment standard is intramedullary nail fixation. The Authors present their experience with the D-Nail system for intertrochanteric femur fractures. METHODS: From January 1st to February 21st 2020 (breakout of COVID-19 pandemic) 34 patients were treated with the D-Nail system: 11 with basicervical fractures, 16 with intertrochanteric stable fractures and 7 with intertrochanteric unstable fractures. In 11 cases, a single cephalic screw was used; in 23 cases, two of them were used. Distal locking was executed in 7 patients. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 3 months. RESULTS: None of the reported intra- or post-operative complication was linked to the fixation device or the surgical technique. Patients were monitored with clinical and radiological checkups using modified Harris Hip Score to accurately evaluate the fluctuations in the rehabilitation period. CONCLUSION: The main advantages of this synthesis device are the proximal hole's peculiar shape, which allows the possibility to position one or two cephalic screws on the same nail, and the silicon coating, which provides numerous biological advantages. Distal locking was executed in selected cases only, based on fracture type. Optimum treatment involves rapid execution of surgery, minimal trauma during surgery, maximum mechanical stability, and rapid weight-bearing. Although our case number is small and follow-up time brief, our results are encouraging.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Quattri, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Burgio, Valeria; Rivera, Fabrizio; Di Stefano, Giovanni; Pavone, Vito",Acta Biomed,153,16

This study was aimed to assess aggregated risk by investigating the association of ACEIs/ARBs users against non-users of ACEIs/ARBs with the risk of mortality or severe clinical manifestations or magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in COVID-19 patients. Systematic literature search was carried out in different databases for eligible studies. The pooled relative risks (RRs) were measured using RevMan software where P<0.05 was set as statistical significance. In total, 10 studies were included in this analysis. After pooled estimation, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 positive patients taking ACEIs/ARBs were not associated with an increased risk of mortality compared to those not taking ACEIs/ARBs (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64-1.23; P=0.48). Furthermore, the risk of composite severe clinical manifestations was not significantly different between the positive patients with or without ACEIs/ARBs users (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.81-2.04; P=0.28). There was no risk difference for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in patients with or without ACEIs/ARBs users (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.95-1.05; P=0.91).

METHODS: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle thresholds reveal strong associations with a prior medical history, specific symptomatology, and disease severity markers. Further research controlling potential confounding variables needs to be conducted to evaluate the nature and usefulness of these associations in managing COVID-19 patients.","Quiroga, Santiago A; Hernández, Carolina; Castañeda, Sergio; Jimenez, Paula; Vega, Laura; Gomez, Marcela; Martinez, David; Ballesteros, Nathalia; Muñoz, Marina; Cifuentes, Claudia; Sierra, Nathalia; Flórez, Carolina; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Ramírez, Juan David",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,153,16

NCDs are largely preventable with healthy nutrition, regular activity, and not smoking. This perspective outlines the rationale for health professionals' including physical therapists' role in reducing COVID-19 susceptibility. Evidence is synthesized supporting the pro-inflammatory effects of the western diet, increasingly consumed globally, inactivity, and smoking;and the immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory effects of a whole food plant-based diet, regular physical activity, and not smoking. An increased background of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation associated with unhealthy lifestyle practices appears implicated in an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It is timely to re-double efforts across healthcare sectors to reduce the global prevalence of NCDs on two fronts: one, to reduce SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility;and two, to reduce the impact of subsequent waves given high blood pressure and blood sugar, common in people with multi-morbidity, can be improved within days/weeks with anti-inflammatory healthy lifestyle practices, and weight loss and atherosclerosis reduction/reversal, within months/years. With re-doubled efforts to control NCD risk factors, subsequent waves could be less severe. Health professionals including physical therapists have a primary role in actively leading this initiative.","Dean, E.; Skinner, M.; Yu, H. P.; Jones, A.

International agencies have been the exception: despite the still low numbers of cases and deaths, they have voiced concerns, often in catastrophic terms, on the health, economic and social impacts of COVID in African countries. These concerns contrast sharply with the optimistic view that Africa may be spared the worst consequences of the pandemic.This paper provides a snapshot of a crisis in evolution: its features could change as new data become available and our understanding improves. The paper examines the epidemic trends, the health impact, the containment measures and their possible side effects. Africa has a long experience of responding to epidemics: relevant lessons learned are outlined. The picture of the epidemic and its narrative are heterogenous, given the differing vulnerabilities of African countries and the diverse contexts within their borders. The paper, therefore, singles out selected countries as illustrative of specific situations and advocates for a transnational and subnational approach to future analyses.The virus has shown a strong capacity to adapt; therefore, a response strategy, in order to be effective, needs to be flexible and able to adapt to changes.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of cardiopulmonary pathology of COVID-19 based on (non-minimal invasive) autopsies performed on 14 COVID-19 decedents. Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found in all patients. Superimposed acute bronchopneumonia was present in 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients and was considered the major cause of death in 2 patients. A key finding was the presence of thrombotic/thromboembolic vascular occlusions. We classified 5 types of pulmonary thrombi: 1. capillary microthrombi (11/14, 78.6%); 2. partially organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries with complete vessel occlusion; 3. non-organized thrombi in mid-sized pulmonary arteries that did not completely fill out the vessel lumen and probably represented thromboemboli rather than thrombosis; 4. bone marrow emboli (1/14, 7.1%); and 5. septic pulmonary thromboemboli (1/14, 7.1%). Pulmonary thrombi in mid-sized arteries were noted in 5 of 14 (35.7%) patients, causing pulmonary infarction and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. All patients had evidence of chronic cardiac disease, including myocardial hypertrophy (13/14, 92.9%), mild to marked coronary artery atherosclerosis (14/14, 100%) and focal myocardial fibrosis (3/14, 21.4%). Acute myocardial infarction was found as concurrent cause of death in 3 (21.4%) patients, and significant cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight 750 g) was present in 1 (7.1%) patient with ATTR-positive cardiac amyloidosis. The autopsy findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, with major involvement of the lungs, that increases the risk of cardiac and vascular complications including acute myocardial injury and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Secondary acute bronchopneumonia is a common complication in patients with COVID-19 and may be the major cause of death.","Grosse, Claudia; Grosse, Alexandra; Salzer, Helmut J F; Dünser, Martin W; Motz, Reinhard; Langer, Rupert",Cardiovasc Pathol,153,22

We aimed to systematically review the prevalence of liver involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at their hospital admission, and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with or without pre-existing chronic liver disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, PMC, clinical trial registries, and other Coronavirus family publications for studies reporting data on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and liver function tests (LFTs) alterations, as well as clinical course of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Case reports, preprints, editorials, reviews were excluded. We also revised literature to describe the background of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 36 studies, including 20724 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included. The pooled prevalence of LFTs abnormalities at admission was 46.9% (AST 26.5%, ALT 22.8%, GGT 22.5%, ALP 5.7%, tBIL 8.0%). ALT, AST, tBIL were independent predictors of disease severity (ALT OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.03; AST OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.10-4.77; tBIL OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.18-4.58) and in-hospital mortality (ALT OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96; AST OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.68-7.18; tBIL OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.28-26.40). Heterogeneity among studies was high. The few available data also reported that COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: LFTs alterations were reported in up to 47% of unselected patients with COVID-19 and were associated with severe disease or in-hospital mortality.

The main conclusions are as follows.(1) The sustainability of China’s net grain imports fluctuated from 2001 to 2019. (2) China’s EPU has a negative impact on the economic sustainability of its net grain imports. A higher EPU index leads to a lower net import potential ratio and higher trade cost. (3) China’s EPU has a significant negative impact on the environmental sustainability of its net grain imports. It has the greatest negative impact on virtual water imports and smaller impact on virtual land imports and embodied carbon emission.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety of elective colorectal surgery during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study. Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 10 and September 9, 2020, were included. Patient data on sex, age, diagnosis, types of procedures, hospital stay, mortality, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) preoperative screening tests were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 103 colorectal surgical procedures were planned, and 99 were performed. Four surgeries were postponed due to positive preoperative screening for SARS-CoV-2. Surgical procedures were performed for colorectal cancer (n=90) and inflammatory bowel disease (n=9). Laparoscopy was the approach of choice for 43 patients (43.4%), 53 (53.5%) procedures were open, and 3 (3%) procedures were robotic. Five patients developed COVID-19 in the postoperative period, and three of them died in the intensive care unit (n=3/5, 60% mortality). Two other patients died due to surgical complications unrelated to COVID-19 (n=2/94, 2.1% mortality) (p&lt;0.01).

Specifically, we assessed whether individual differences in pathogen disgust sensitivity, social anxiety and generalized social trust predicted judgments of trustworthiness, desired social distance and perceptions of sickness of target faces wearing surgical masks. Our results showed that (a) high sensitivity to pathogen disgust predicted lower judgments of trustworthiness and lower social desirability; (b) high social anxiety predicted higher perceptions of illness and lower judgments of trustworthiness; and (c) generalized social trust predicted higher judgments of trustworthiness and lower perceptions of illness of target faces. Further, we found that mask wearers were perceived as more likely to be ill, more trustworthy and more socially desirable than the same faces presented to a control group, without the surgical mask superimposed.

P. aeruginosa formed the most robust biofilm of conspicuous mushroom-like structure at 20°C. However, when the temperature increased to 25°C, the biofilm formation rapidly decreased. Above 25°C, as the temperature rose, the biofilm formation increased again little by little despite its less structured form, indicating that 25°C is the low point of biofilm formation. The intracellular c-di-GMP levels also decreased rapidly as the temperature rose from 20 to 25°C. The expression of pelA, algD, and pslA encoding Pel, alginate, and Psl, respectively, were also dramatically affected by temperature, in which pelA was regulated in a pattern such as a change in intracellular c-di-GMP levels and the regulation of algD was the most similar to the actual biofilm formation pattern. Total exopolysaccharide production was thermoregulated and followed the regulation pattern of c-di-GMP. Interestingly, the thermoregulation patterns in biofilm formation were different depending on the strain of P. aeruginosa Unlike PAO1, another strain PA14 showed a gradual decrease in biofilm formation and c-di-GMP in the range of 20 - 37°C and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates also showed slightly different patterns in biofilm formation with temperature change, suggesting that different strains may sense different temperature ranges for biofilm formation. However, it is obvious that P. aeruginosa forms more biofilms at lower temperatures and temperature is an important factor determining the biofilm formation.Importance Biofilm formation is an important protection mechanism used by most microorganisms and provides cells with many advantages like high infectivity, antibiotic resistance, and strong survivability. Since most persistent bacterial infections are believed to be associated with biofilms, the biofilm control is an important issue in medicine, environmental engineering, and industry. Biofilm formation is influenced by various environmental factors. Temperature is the most direct environmental cue encountered by microorganisms. Here we investigated the temperature effect on the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa, a notorious pathogen, and found that temperature is an important factor determining the amount and structure of biofilm. Low temperature greatly increases the biofilm formation and gives it a highly conspicuous structure. Although the thermoregulation on biofilm formation is mainly mediated by c-di-GMP, some c-di-GMP-independent regulations were also observed. This study shows how biofilms are formed at various temperatures, and provides new insights to control biofilms using temperature.","Kim, Suran; Li, Xi-Hui; Hwang, Hyeon-Ji; Lee, Joon-Hee",,153,16

It was striking that many of the patients affected had only mild symptoms. In this case study it was investigated to what extent SARS-CoV­2 can cause lung involvement even with minor symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study five outpatient radiological centers and two inpatient hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg in Germany were involved. The retrospective analysis included outpatients with radiologically detected viral pneumonia, who were examined in March or April 2020. The clinical symptoms were divided into severity levels 1-5 using a simplified clinical score. The lung images were evaluated with respect to features specific for COVID-19 . The presence of a SARS-CoV­2 infection was verified using PCR, antibody testing and/or typical computed tomography (CT) morphology. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included, all of whom had radiological signs of viral pneumonia. The majority had no or only few non-specific symptoms (26/50). This was followed by mild symptoms of a flu-like infection (17/50). Severe forms were rare in outpatients (7/50). Detection of COVID-19 was successful in 30/50 cases using PCR and in 4/50 cases using an antibody test. In 16/50 cases the diagnosis was based on typical CT criteria and on the typical COVID patient history. CONCLUSION: A SARS-CoV­2 infection leads to lung involvement more often than previously assumed, namely not only in severely ill hospitalized patients but also in cases with only mild or even non-specific symptoms.","Palmowski, Moritz; Persigehl, Thorsten; Michaely, Henrik; Miller, Steffen; Grouls, Christoph; Nguyen, Hieu; Mühlenbruch, Georg",,153,21

SETTING: Medicare Beneficiaries, United States. DESIGN: Epidemiologic modeling. METHODS: Baseline trends in cataract surgery among Medicare beneficiaries were assessed by querying the Medicare Part B Provider Utilization National Summary data. It was assumed that once the surgical deferment is over, there will be a ramp-up period; this was modeled using a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation. Total surgical backlog 2 years postsuspension was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were used to test model assumptions. RESULTS: Assuming cataract surgeries were to resume in May 2020, it would take 4 months under an optimistic scenario to revert to 90% of the expected pre-COVID forecasted volume. At 2-year postsuspension, the resulting backlog would be between 1.1 and 1.6 million cases. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a substantial surgical backlog would remain despite potentially lower surgical demand in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Suspension of elective cataract surgical care during the COVID-19 surge might have a lasting impact on ophthalmology and will likely result in a cataract surgical patient backlog. These data may aid physicians, payers, and policymakers in planning for postpandemic recovery.","Aggarwal, Shruti; Jain, Punya; Jain, Amit",J Cataract Refract Surg,153,1

Because several neurocognitive domains can only be thoroughly assessed from age 4 years onwards, we aimed to determine the effect of late-parenteral nutrition versus early-parenteral nutrition on physical, neurocognitive, and emotional and behavioural development 4 years after randomisation. METHODS: This is a preplanned, blinded, 4-year follow-up study of participants included in the PEPaNIC trial (done at University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus Medical Centre Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands; and Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada) and of matched healthy children. Studied outcomes were anthropometrics; health status; parent-reported or caregiver-reported executive functions, and emotional and behavioural problems; and clinical tests for intelligence, visual-motor integration, alertness, motor coordination, and memory. Through multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, after imputation for missing values (&#8804;30%) and adjustment for risk factors, we investigated the effect of early-parenteral nutrition versus late-parenteral nutrition. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01536275. FINDINGS: Between March 8, 2016, and Nov 8, 2019, 684 children from the original PEPaNIC trial (356 from the late-parenteral nutrition group and 328 from the early-parenteral nutrition group) were assessed for neurocognitive development at 4-years follow-up. Compared with the control group (369 healthy children), children who had critical illness had lower height (ß-estimate -2·11 [95% CI -3·15 to -1·06]; p<0·0001) and head circumference (-0·42 [-0·67 to -0·18]; p=0.00077); and worse health status (eg, hospital admission odds ratio 4·27 [95% CI 3·12 to 5·84]; p<0·0001), neurocognitive (eg, parent-reported or caregiver-reported total executive functioning ß-estimate 3·57 [95% CI 1·95 to 5·18], p<0·0001; total intelligence quotient -7·35 [-9·31 to -5·39], p<0·0001), and parent-reported or caregiver-reported emotional and behavioural developmental outcomes (internalising 2·73 [1·19 to 4·28], p=0·00055; externalising 1·63 [0·19 to 3·08], p=0·027; and total behavioural problems 2·95 [1·44 to 4·46], p=0·00013), adjusted for risk factors. Outcomes were never worse in the late-parenteral nutrition group compared with the early-parenteral nutrition group, but patients in the late-parenteral nutrition group had fewer parent-reported or caregiver-reported internalising (ß-estimate -1·88 [95% CI -3·69 to -0·07]; p=0·042), externalising (-1·73 [-3·43 to -0·03]; p=0·046), and total emotional and behavioural problems (-2·44 [-4·22 to -0·67]; p=0·0070) than patients who had received early-parenteral nutrition, after adjusting for risk factors, and were no longer different from healthy controls for these outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Omitting early parenteral nutrition use for critically ill children did not adversely affect long-term outcomes 4 years after randomisation and protected against emotional and behavioural problems, further supporting the deimplementation of early parenteral nutrition.

This study evaluates the associations between physical activity (PA), the level of stress and quality of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was distributed during the governmental lockdown in April 2020 and included measures for assessing physical activity, stress and sleep. The surveyed participants included all adults aged 18 years and over. The final data were collected from the 1959 respondents using: International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). FINDINGS: Almost half of the respondents indicated a low level of PA, performing only 60 min of PA daily. Most of the participants reported a moderate or high level of stress (57% and 29%, respectively) and 64% of them reported poor quality of sleep. People with low levels of stress performed on average 85.1 min/day of walking (WPA), 40.9 min/day of moderate PA (MPA) or 52.6 min/day of vigorous PA (VPA). People with good quality of sleep performed 82.9 min/day of WPA, 43.6 min/day MPA and 40.5 min/day VPA. INTERPRETATION: The results from the study indicate that the volume of daily PA may be a predictor of the level of stress and sleep quality in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. To retain a low level of stress and good quality of sleep, a lifestyle that allows to achieve a moderate level of physical activity should be maintained. The optimal daily dose of PA is at least 70 min per day, involving different intensities.","Lipert, Anna; Kozlowski, Remigiusz; Timler, Dariusz; Marczak, Michal; Musial, Kamila; Rasmus, Pawel; Kamecka, Karolina; Jegier, Anna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),153,17

This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends. Therefore, this paper describes the behavior of PM2.5 emissions particulate matter from the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world according to the WHO, measured before-after the start of the quarantine. Likewise, the impact at the local and global level of this emissions behavior, which averaged 12% of PM2.5 decrease in these cities.","Rodríguez-Urrego, Daniella; Rodríguez-Urrego, Leonardo",Environ Pollut,153,21

It started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and led to a highly contagious disease. Since then COVID-19 continues to spread, causing exponential morbidity and mortality and threatening economies worldwide. While the primary diagnostic test for COVID-19 is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, chest CT has proven to be a diagnostic tool of high sensitivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study with two phases was conducted at a U.S. Army Medical Center. Previously collected samples from January 2014 through December 2015 were compared to prospectively collected data from March 2016 through December 2017. All data were collected from a convenience sample of active duty, HIV-positive men who have sex with men. Concordance between provider-collected and self-collected extragenital screening (EGS) samples was evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of detection using EGS was higher than previously found using urogenital screening alone. Our prospective analysis revealed that expanding screening to include extragenital sites increased rates of detection of GC and CT. Our rates of GC detection at the pharynx and rectum, and CT detection at the rectum, were higher than those reported in the literature for men who have sex with men. Rates of CT infection at the pharynx were comparable with those reported in the literature. Detection of GC at the pharynx was exactly concordant between self-collected and provider-collected samples. Concordance of GC and CT detection at the rectum was very good. The kappa coefficient for detection of CT at the pharynx was zero, which corresponded to 44 out of 45 concordant observations. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to implementation of EGS at our institution, we missed the opportunity to detect a substantial number of GC/CT infections with urogenital screening alone. Our results suggest that self-collection is a reliable method of EGS as compared to provider collection of samples.","Chohonis, Kelly; Davis, Kepler; Calvano, Tatjana",Mil. med,153,24

This case series describes the unique challenges presented to an outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation team in providing SCI care in the USA for refugees who suffered their SCI in their home countries. CASE PRESENTATION: Our interdisciplinary rehabilitation team faced challenges related to language, cultural and educational barriers which impacted the typical standard rehabilitation care offered to these individuals. Many of the individuals were focused on curative treatments. As such, managing expectations and educating individuals to rehabilitation practices for chronic SCI and lack of curative treatments for associated medical complications affected the provision of care across all disciplines of the rehabilitation team. DISCUSSION: This case series showcases the challenges of caring for international refugees with SCI. The care offered to these individuals highlights the benefits that an interdisciplinary SCI rehabilitation approach can provide to comprehensively care for this vulnerable population.","Jones, Margaret W; Crane, Deborah A",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,153,16

As a consequence of restrictive public health measures like isolation, quarantine, and community containment, the provision of mental health services is a major challenge. Evidence from past virus epidemics and the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak indicate high prevalence rates of mental health problems (MHP) as short- and long-term consequences. However, a broader picture of MHP among different populations is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a rapid review on MHP prevalence rates published since 2000, during and after epidemics, including the general public, health care workers, and survivors. Any quantitative articles reporting on MHP rates were included. Out of 2,855 articles screened, a total of 74 were included in this review. Results: Most original studies on MHP were conducted in China in the context of SARS-CoV-1, and reported on anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms/disorder, general psychiatric morbidity, and psychological symptoms. The MHP rates across studies, populations, and epidemics vary substantially. While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g., health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g., distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP. Discussion: MHP vary largely across countries and risk-groups in reviewed studies. The results call attention to potentially high MHP during epidemics. Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.","Zürcher, Simeon Joel; Kerksieck, Philipp; Adamus, Christine; Burr, Christian Markus; Lehmann, Anja I; Huber, Flavia Katharina; Richter, Dirk",Front Public Health,153,32

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of internally calibrated conebeam CT pixel value measurements that can enable the determination of active fenestral otosclerosis (otospongiosis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 37 ears in 22 patients with a clinical diagnosis of otospongiosis in those ears and 35 ears in 22 control patients without the diagnosis. Temporal bone conebeam CT was performed. ROIs were set anterior to the oval window, in the lateral semicircular canal bone island, and in a nearby aerated space. Mean conebeam CT pixel values in these regions determined the relative attenuation ratio of the area anterior to the oval window normalized to normal otic capsule bone and air. RESULTS: The relative attenuation ratio for cases of otospongiosis was significantly lower than that for controls (P < .001). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cutoff relative attenuation ratio was 0.876, which had an accuracy of 97.2% for the diagnosis of otospongiosis. CONCLUSIONS: Internally calibrated pixel value ratios in temporal bone conebeam CT can feasibly help diagnose active/spongiotic-phase fenestral otosclerosis in an objective manner.","Deng, F; Touska, P; Reinshagen, K L; Curtin, H D; Juliano, A F",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,153,30

The citrus flavanone hesperetin (HSP) was previously suggested as a template molecule to develop new anti-arrhythmic drugs, as it blocks slowly-inactivating currents carried by the LQT3-associated hNaV1.5 channel mutant R1623Q. Here we investigated whether HSP also has potentially beneficial effects on another LQT3 hNaV1.5 channel variant, the &#916;KPQ, which is associated to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. We used whole-cell patch-clamp to record Na+ currents (INa) in HEK293T cells transiently expressing hNaV1.5 wild type or &#916;KPQ mutant channels. HSP blocked peak INa and the late INa carried by &#916;KPQ mutant channels with an effective concentration of &#8776;300 µM. This inhibition was largely voltage-independent and tonic. HSP decreased the rate of inactivation of &#916;KPQ channels and, consequently, was relatively weak in reducing the intracellular Na+ load in this mutation. We conclude that, although HSP has potential value for the treatment of the R1623Q LQT3 variant, this compound is inadequate to treat the LQT3 associated to the &#916;KPQ genetic variant. Our results underscore the precision medicine rationale of better understanding the basic pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms to provide phenotype- genotype-directed individualization of treatment.","Alvarez-Collazo, Julio; López-Requena, Alejandro; Alvarez, Julio L; Talavera, Karel",Biomolecules,153,1

Carbopol acted as a gelling agent combined with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a viscosity-enhancing agent. The concentration of Carbopol (0.2%, w/v) and HPMC (1.5%, w/v) was optimized for the ISG system. The optimized formulation was evaluated for studies on release in vitro, rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, ocular irritation, residence time, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. The vinpocetine ISG stayed longer in rabbit eyes than vinpocetine ointment. In vivo pharmacokinetics showed that compared with vinpocetine ointment, vinpocetine ISG attained a peak plasma concentration and area under the curve that was 1-2 folds greater in rat plasma. The Drug Targeting Index (DTI) was 1.06 and 1.26 for vinpocetine ointment and vinpocetine ISG, respectively, after ocular administration, showing that vinpocetine ISG had better distribution in rat brain. These results revealed that a pH-triggered ISG system via ocular administration could be an alternative approach compared with traditional ophthalmic formulations.","Ma, Qun; Luo, Rui; Zhang, Huimin; Dai, Manman; Bai, Luyu; Fei, Qingsong; Lei, Fang; He, Ning",AAPS PharmSciTech,153,20

The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic lncRNAs and construct an lncRNA signature for PCa diagnosis by the interaction network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes (PCGs). The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and PCGs (DEPCGs) between PCa and normal prostate tissues were screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPCGs were functionally annotated in terms of the enriched pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 104 PCa samples identified 15 co-expression modules, of which the Turquoise module was negatively correlated with cancer and included 5 key lncRNAs and 47 PCGs. KEGG pathway analyses of the core 47 PCGs showed significant enrichment in classic PCa-related pathways, and overlapped with the enriched pathways of the DEPCGs. LINC00857, LINC00900, LINC00908, LINC00900, SNHG3 and FENDRR were significantly associated with the survival of PCa and have not been reported previously. Finally, Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to establish a prognostic risk formula, and the patients were accordingly stratified into the low- and high-risk groups. The latter had significantly worse OS compared to the low-risk group (P < 0.01), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 14-year OS was 0.829. The accuracy of our prediction model was determined by calculating the corresponding concordance index (C-index) and risk curves.

France is composed of several overseas territories with major cultural differences but also with a different exposure to the COVID-19. Reunion Island is the most populated overseas French department, but few researches have focused on this population. Therefore, the main objective was to explore and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (perceived stress, risk and fear of being infected, severity, lockdown respect, perceived stress, quality of life, quality of relationship, loneliness, resilience) during the lockdown among residents of metropolitan France and of Reunion Island. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 347 participants, aged from 18 to 78 (M=37.90; DS=13.20) replied to a questionnaire posted online during the last ten days of the lockdown in France. The sample is divided into 227 metropolitans (M=38.24 DS=13.41; 13.2% of men) and 120 residents of Reunion Island (M=37.26; DS=12.81; 31.7% of men). Resilience, loneliness and perceived stress have been assessed using validating scales while specific items have been created to assess COVID-19 impacts. RESULTS: The majority of the total sample has been little exposed to the COVID-19, but the estimated severity was high throughout the sample. Several significant differences have been observed between overseas and metropolitans. The latter, who were more exposed, were more respectful of lockdown measures and felt more concerned about being contaminated. They also had different professional activities (work at home, stop working) since the lockdown than did the overseas sample. Non-significant higher scores of resilience and quality of life during the lockdown contrast in the overseas sample, who estimated risk, fear and severity similarly. In correlational analyses, many relationships were significant only in one sample. For example, in metropolitans the higher the loneliness, the higher the severity. In the other sample, the higher the perceived stress, the higher the respect of lockdown measures, while more metropolitans felt lonely the more they respected these measures. Regressional analysis showed different predictive variables of the scores of perceived stress and fear of being contaminated. In metropolitans, stress was explained by COVID-19 related variables (fear, severity, respect), loneliness and negatively by resilience and quality of life while in the other sample it was explained by fear of being infected and negatively by resilience. Fear of being infected was explained by risk and stress in the overseas, but also by quality of life in the metropolitan sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study brings new data on the important psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on two French samples. Observed differences highlight a higher fear of being infected among the metropolitans who were generally more exposed. Overseas from La Réunion did not feel more spared by this risk, despite the limited number of cases since the appearance of the first case in March 11th and the end of the lockdown in May 11th. Despite exposure, our results could be explained by several cultural differences such as way of life or beliefs. Overseas life in Reunion Island might bring more resilience and less loneliness given the particular familial, social and religious functioning. Given the limits of this study and the lack of similar comparisons, more work could highlight the protective factors of these populations.","Laconi, S; Ramaye, D; Kalaitzaki, A",Encephale,153,16

Currently, literature of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates is scarce. We present a case of a neonate with a high viral load and prolonged virus shedding. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of a neonate with COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: A 7-day-old boy was admitted to the hospital with fever, lethargy and apnoea. He was found SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive with an exceptionally high viral load in nasopharyngeal swab and stool. The father and two maternity nurses at home had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well. Sequencing showed all strains belonged to the same cluster. The father was asymptomatic and the maternity nurses developed symptoms after visiting. In the mother, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be found. Six days after admission, the neonate was discharged after clinical improvement with oral antibiotics because of a possible pyelonephritis. Monitoring the course of this infection showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in the nasopharynx until day 19 and in stool until day 42 after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that neonates can have a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and can shed the virus for over one month in stool.

We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.","Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio",Eur.

Therefore, in the present scenario of COVID-19 pandemic, differential diagnosis resulting positive for common respiratory pathogen(s) should not exclude testing of SARS-CoV-2.","Sberna, Giuseppe; Amendola, Alessandra; Valli, Maria Beatrice; Carletti, Fabrizio; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Bordi, Licia; Lalle, Eleonora",J Clin Virol,153,25

OBJECTIVES: To identify the cumulative incidence for ECMO use in the first pandemic wave and to describe the Nationwide Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study from March 3 to August 31, 2020, using linked data from National agencies. Cumulative incidence of ECMO use and mortality risk of ECMO-supported patients were calculated and age-standardized. Additionally, a retrospective cohort was performed. Outcomes were 90-days mortality after ECMO initiation, ECMO-associated complications and hospital length of stay (LOS). Cox regression models were used to explore risk factors for mortality in a time-to-event analysis. MAIN RESULTS: 94 COVID-19 patients were supported with ECMO (0.42:100,000 population, 14.89:100,000 positive cases, and 1.2% of COVID-19 intubated patients); 85 were included in the cohort analysis: age 48 [41-55] years, 83.5% men, 42.4% obese. Pre-ECMO intubation days were 4 [2-7], PaO2:FiO2 86.8 [64-99] mmHg, 91.8% were prone-positioned; 14 had refractory respiratory acidosis. Main complications were infections (70.6%), bleeding (38.8%) and thromboembolism (22.4%); 52 patients were discharged home and 33 died. Hospital LOS was 50 [24-69] days. Lower respiratory system compliance and higher driving pressure before ECMO onset were associated with increased mortality. Duration of pre-ECMO intubation &#8805;10 days was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Documenting nationwide ECMO needs may help planning ECMO provision for future COVID-19 pandemic waves. The 90-days mortality of the Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported COVID-19 patients (38.8%) is comparable to previous reports.

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, nâ=â204), inpatients (cohort B, nâ=â81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohortâC, nâ=â23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6âµmol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","Hippchen, Theresa; Altamura, Sandro; Muckenthaler, Martina U; Merle, Uta",Hemasphere,153,26

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study (10 Hospitals), we included 64 confirmed COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations who underwent a brain MRI. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 men (67%), 21 women (33%), and the median age was 66 years (range: 20-92). 36 (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to SARS-CoV-2. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurological manifestation, following by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from the other patients with abnormal brain imaging since the former had less frequently acute respiratory distress syndrome (p=0·006) and more frequently corticospinal tract signs (p=0·02). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p=0·007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p=0·009). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients may develop a wide range of neurological symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications, such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis. Concerning the meningoencephalitis involvement, even if a direct effect of the virus cannot be excluded, the pathophysiology rather seems to involve an immune and/or inflammatory process given the presence of signs of inflammation in both cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging but the lack of virus in cerebrospinal fluid.","Kremer, Stéphane; Lersy, François; Anheim, Mathieu; Merdji, Hamid; Schenck, Maleka; Oesterlé, Hélène; Bolognini, Federico; Messie, Julien; Henri-Feugeas, Marie-Cécile; Khalil, Antoine; Gaudemer, Augustin; Carré, Sophie; Alleg, Manel; Lecocq, Claire; Schmitt, Emmanuelle; Anxionnat, René; Zhu, François; Jager, Lavinia; Nesser, Patrick; Mba, Yannick Talla; Hmeydia, Ghazi; Benzakoun, Joseph; Oppenheim, Catherine; Ferré, Jean-Christophe; Maamar, Adel; Carsin-Nicol, Béatrice; Comby, Pierre-Olivier; Ricolfi, Frédéric; Thouant, Pierre; Boutet, Claire; Fabre, Xavier; Forestier, Géraud; de Beaurepaire, Isaure; Bornet, Grégoire; Desal, Hubert; Boulouis, Grégoire; Berge, Jérome; Kazémi, Apolline; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya; Lecler, Augustin; Saleme, Suzana; Edjlali-Goujon, Myriam; Kerleroux, Basile; Constans, Jean Marc; Zorn, Pierre-Emmanuel; Mathieu, Muriel; Baloglu, Seyyid; Ardellier, François-Daniel; Willaume, Thibault; Brisset, Jean Christophe",Neurology,153,13

The extent of the effects, especially cumulative over the long period of the pandemic, has not yet been fully investigated for Germany. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine psychological burden as well as COVID-19-related experience and behavior patterns and to show how they changed during the different phases of the pandemic in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Germany-wide online-based cross-sectional study (03/10-07/27/2020) included 22,961 people (convenience sample). Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), and psychological distress (DT) were collected, as well as COVID-19-related experiences and behavior patterns: COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions, subjective level of information, adherent safety behavior, and personal risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness. The pandemic was retrospectively divided into five phases (initial, crisis, lockdown, reorientation, and new normality). RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID-19 reference values, GAD­7, PHQ­2, and DT levels were significantly elevated and persistent throughout the different phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fear, information level, trust, safety behavior, and the risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness showed, after initial strong increase, a strong decrease to partly below the initial value. Exceptions were constant risk assessments of having a severe course of illness or dying of it. CONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of psychological burden, which have persisted throughout all phases of the pandemic, illustrate the need for sustainable support services. Declining values over the duration of the pandemic in terms of trust in governmental actions and the feeling of being well informed underline the need for more targeted education.","Skoda, Eva-Maria; Spura, Anke; De Bock, Freia; Schweda, Adam; Dörrie, Nora; Fink, Madeleine; Musche, Venja; Weismüller, Benjamin; Benecke, Anke; Kohler, Hannah; Junne, Florian; Graf, Johanna; Bäuerle, Alexander; Teufel, Martin",Bundesgesundheitsblatt gesundheitsforschung gesundheitsschutz,153,24

This study aimed to predict mature miRNA sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, their effects on protein-protein interactions in the affected cells, gene-drug relationships to detect possible drug candidates. METHODS: Viral hairpin structure prediction and classification of the hairpins, mutational examination of precursor miRNA candidate sequences, Minimum Free Energy (MFE) and regional entropy analysis, mature miRNA sequences, target gene prediction, gene ontology enrichment and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis, gene-drug interactions were performed. RESULTS: A total of 62 candidate hairpins were detected by VMir analysis. Three hairpin structures classified as true precursor miRNAs by miRBoost. Five different mutations were detected in precursor miRNA sequences in 100 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. Mutations slightly elevated MFE values and entropy in precursor miRNAs. Gene ontology terms associated with fibrotic pathways and immune system were found to be enriched in PANTHER, KEGG and Wiki pathway analysis. PPI analysis showed a network between 60 genes. CytoHubba analysis showed SMAD1 as a hub gene in the network. The targets of the predicted miRNAs, FAM214A, PPM1E, NUFIP2 and FAT4 were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. CONCLUSION: miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome may contribute to the emergence of the Covid-19 clinic by activating pathways associated with the fibrosis in the cells infected by the virus and modulating the innate immune system. The hub protein between these pathways may be the SMAD1, which has an effective role in TGF signal transduction.","Çetin, Zafer; Bayrak, Tuncay; Ogul, Hasan; Saygili, Eyüp Ilker; Akkol, Esra Küpeli",Curr. drug deliv,153,16

Can you have all three?",15.682378,6.684061,2021,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic, which originated in China. At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Subbian, Selvakumar",Int. j. mol. sci.

Can you have all three?",15.843944,6.285782,2021,"Since the first alert launched by the World Health Organization (5 January, 2020), COVID-19 has been spreading out to over 180 countries and territories. As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over 8,400,000 cases and over 450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate the global rise and falls of sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained analysis on the feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in English and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic, thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer framework, called simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in order for a more complete analysis, we also translate the annotated English tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French) to generated training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages. SenWave thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different languages on COVID-19 (covering English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The conversation showed a remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to which the global conversation reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased over time, foretelling a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.","Yang, Qiang; Alamro, Hind; Albaradei, Somayah; Salhi, Adil; Lv, Xiaoting; Ma, Changsheng; Alshehri, Manal; Jaber, Inji; Tifratene, Faroug; Wang, Wei; Gojobori, Takashi; Duarte, Carlos M.; Gao, Xin; Zhang, Xiangliang",,153,16

Understanding the factors that impact influenza vaccination behaviors among underserved older African-Americans could lead to more effective communication and delivery strategies. Aims: We aimed to investigate rate and factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among underserved African-American older adults. We were particularly interested in the roles of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and continuity and patient satisfaction with medical care, as well as physical and mental health status. Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study recruited 620 African-American older adults residing in South Los Angeles, one of the most under-resources areas within Los Angeles County, with a population of over one million. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to document independent correlates of influenza vaccination. Results: One out of three underserved African-American older adults aged 65 years and older residing in South Los Angeles had never been vaccinated against the influenza. Only 49% of participants reported being vaccinated within the 12 months prior to the interview. One out of five participants admitted that their health care provider recommended influenza vaccination. However, only 45% followed their provider's recommendations. Multivariate logistic regression shows that old-old (&#8805;75 years), participants who lived alone, those with a lower level of continuity of care and satisfaction with the accessibility, availability, and quality of care, and participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. As expected, participants who indicated that their physician had advised them to obtain a flu vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated. Our data shows that only gender was associated with self-report of being advised to have a flu shot. Discussion. One of the most striking aspects of this study is that no association between influenza vaccination and being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other major chronic condition was detected. Our study confirmed that both continuity of care and satisfaction with access, availability, and quality of medical care are strongly associated with current influenza vaccinations. We documented that participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: These findings highlight the role that culturally acceptable and accessible usual source of care van play as a gatekeeper to facilitate and implement flu vaccination among underserved minority older adults. Consistent disparities in influenza vaccine uptake among underserved African-American older adults, coupled with a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, places them at high risk for undesired outcomes associated with influenza. As depression is more chronic/disabling and is less likely to be treated in African-Americans, there is a need to screen and treat depression as a strategy to enhance preventive care management such as vaccination of underserved African-American older adults. Quantification of associations between lower vaccine uptake and both depression symptoms as well as living alone should enable health professionals target underserved African-American older adults who are isolated and suffer from depression to reduce vaccine-related inequalities.","Bazargan, Mohsen; Wisseh, Cheryl; Adinkrah, Edward; Ameli, Hoorolnesa; Santana, Delia; Cobb, Sharon; Assari, Shervin",Biomed Res Int,153,24

This study was conducted in the immediate aftermath of this difficult period. OBJECTIVES: to describe clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, and management of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that accessed the emergency department (ED) of the San Luigi Gonzaga hospital of Orbassano (Turin district, Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) in March and April 2020. Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. DESIGN: comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. RESULTS: age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed.","Caramello, Valeria; Maciotta, Alessandro; De Salve, Alessandro Vincenzo; Gobbi, Valentina; Ruffino, Tommaso Maria; Mazzetti, Giulia; Ricagni, Lorenzo; Ling, Camilla; Arione, Roberto; Boccuzzi, Adriana; Costa, Giuseppe; Sacerdote, Carlotta; Ricceri, Fulvio",Epidemiol Prev,153,9

English language training took its share in this transition and several studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the pandemic on emergency online teaching and the learning of English. This integrative literature review study analyses and synthesizes the research studies conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 to illustrate the first year of the pandemic in terms of English language teaching and learning globally. Thus, 69 research studies were selected for analysis. Findings show that the emergency online teaching and learning of English mainly created challenges due to the internet connection problems and students' access to computer or smart phones. On the other hand, contributing the teachers' digital literacy skills, the significance of online teaching and learning in case of emergency situations was highlighted as the findings showed. The studies produced conflicting results in terms of the implementation of emergency online teaching and learning practices, English language teachers and students' perceptions and attitudes, the affective, motivational and cognitive aspects, and the impact of emergency online teaching on the language development of students.","Erarslan, Ali",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,153,1

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. PURPOSE: To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women across the USA aged &#8805;18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April-May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July-August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Pati, Susmita; Heiselman, Cassandra; Lobel, Marci",Ann Behav Med,153,24

DESIGN: Community-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: The UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 421 372 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive as of 1 January 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was CVD-related death, which was defined as death with CVD as a cause in the death register. We retrieved information on hospitalisations with CVD as the primary diagnosis from the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. The study period was 1 January 2020 to June 30 2020, and we used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period. In order to control for seasonal variations and ageing of the study population, standardised mortality/incidence ratios (SMRs/SIRs) with 95% CIs were used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with the reference period. RESULTS: We observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020, compared with the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of CVD-related deaths (n=218) was almost double in April, compared with the expected number (n=120) (SMR=1.82, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.07). In addition, we observed a significant decline in CVD-related hospitalisations from March onwards, with the lowest SIR observed in April (0.45, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: There was a distinct increase in the number of CVD-related deaths in the UK Biobank population at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The shortage of medical resources for hospital care and stress reactions to the pandemic might have partially contributed to the excess CVD-related mortality, underscoring the need of sufficient healthcare resources and improved instructions to the public about seeking healthcare in a timely way.","Wang, Junren; Zhu, Jianwei; Yang, Huazhen; Hu, Yao; Sun, Yajing; Ying, Zhiye; Qu, Yuanyuan; Valdimarsdottir, Unnur; Fang, Fang; Song, Huan",BMJ Open,153,14

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the incidence of refusals after naloxone administration in a single EMS system was evaluated. The number of refusals after naloxone administration was compared across the before-pandemic interval (01/01/20 to 02/15/20) and the during-pandemic interval (03/16/20 to 04/30/20). For comparison the incidence of all other patient refusals before and during COVID-19 as well as the incidences of naloxone administration before and during COVID-19 were also reported. RESULTS: Prior to the widespread knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 of 164 (14.6%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. During the pandemic, 55 of 153 (35.9%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. Subjects receiving naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic were at greater risk of refusal of transport than those receiving naloxone prior to the pandemic (RR = 2.45; 95% CI 1.6-3.76). Among those who did not receive naloxone, 2067 of 6956 (29.7%) patients were not transported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2483 of 6016 (41.3%) were not transported during the pandemic. Subjects who did not receive naloxone with EMS were at greater risk of refusal of transport during the COVID-19 pandemic than prior to it (RR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.32-1.46).

MethodsWe identified patients with immune-mediated diseases who received CD20 inhibitors within one year prior to the index date of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Comparators with COVID-19 were matched up to 5:1 by age, sex, and PCR date. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death in CD20 inhibitor users versus comparators were estimated using Cox regression. ResultsWe identified 114 cases with COVID-19 who had received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases (mean age 55 years, 70% female) and 559 matched comparators with COVID-19 (mean age 54 years, 70% female). CD20 inhibitor-treated cases had higher mortality (aHR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.54) than matched comparators. Risks of hospitalization (aHR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.26) and mechanical ventilation (aHR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen in analyses according to type of indication (e.g., rheumatic or neurologic disease) and duration of CD20 inhibitor use (<1 or [≥]1 year), and after excluding patients with interstitial lung disease, cancer, and those on glucocorticoids prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. ConclusionsPatients who received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases prior to COVID-19 had higher mortality following COVID-19 than matched comparators, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate excess risks in CD20 inhibitor users during the ongoing pandemic.

However, there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to predict the actual impact on virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to understand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models capable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in relation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios. The model uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus (based on a virus spread risk model) and population mobility patterns. The model is calibrated with real data and reproduces the impact that different mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would have been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on a-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic. The proposed model could give useful suggestions for decision-makers to tackle pandemics and virus spreading at a strategic level.","Fazio, Martina; Pluchino, Alessandro; Inturri, Giuseppe; Pira, Michela Le; Giuffrida, Nadia; Ignaccolo, Matteo",,153,21

Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology with a range of potential therapeutic applications that may include ameliorating the experience of some common MS symptoms. Objective: We tested the feasibility and tolerability of a VR intervention and its preliminary effects on affect. Methods: Participants with MS were recruited to complete a pilot study of eight sessions of VR over four weeks. Results: A total of n = 16 participants with MS completed the study (age range: 28–63). Feasibility goals were met with 100% of the sample completing at least n = 4/8 of their intervention sessions, with a total of 119/128 (93%) completed sessions. Two of the n = 16 participants experienced brief adverse events (balance, vertigo) but these resolved with headset removal and were not otherwise treatment limiting. There was a preliminary indication of overall improved affect from baseline to intervention end, with significantly improved positive affect (t(15) = −3.19, p = 0.006) and decreased negative affect (t(15) = 2.25, p = 0.040). Conclusion: VR interventions are feasible, safe, and tolerable for individuals living with MS and may improve affect.","Shaw, M. T.; Palmeri, M. J.; Malik, M.; Dobbs, B.; Charvet, L.

Thus, having a system that automatically detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less human effort.

OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep among US frontline healthcare workers with validated measures on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31-September 15, 2020) targeting healthcare workers (HCW) who were clinically active during the pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and reported demographic/career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI>5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI>14. The mini-Z was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: Nine-hundred and sixty-three surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly white (92.8%), female (73.4%), aged 30-49 (71.9%), and physicians (64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 (SD 1.2) hours. Nearly 90% reported poor sleep (PSQI). One third (33.0%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many (60%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device usage or had bad dreams at least once per week (45%). Over 50% reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, non-physician (OR 2.4; CI: 1.7, 3.4), caring for COVID-19 patients (OR 1.8; CI 1.2, 2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2; CI: 1.4, 3.5), being female (OR 1.6; CI 1.1, 2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3; CI 2.7,6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% of US frontline healthcare workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device usage and nightmares.

We argue that trust is better understood as a family of concepts – trust, mistrust and distrust – and each of these may have different implications for the governance of COVID-19. Drawing on original measures tested through nationally representative surveys conducted in Australia, Italy, the UK and the USA between May and June 2020, we explore how these distinct types of trust are associated with citizens’ perceptions of the threat posed by COVID-19, and their behavioural responses to it. We show how public policy dynamics around the COVID-19 crisis are driven by each of the trust family members and that policymakers might gain more from promoting an information-seeking and mistrusting society, rather than a trusting one.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic literature review investigating treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine, and to evaluate barriers and challenges. Additionally, we review recent regulatory changes that affect telemedicine in neurosurgery, and our institution's initial experience. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including all studies investigating success regarding treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine. We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic billing records after telemedicine was implemented from 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020 and reviewed modifier 95 inclusion to determine the number of face-to-face and telemedicine visits, as well as breakdown of weekly telemedicine clinic visits by subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies (25 prospective and 27 retrospective) with 45 801 patients were analyzed. A total of 13 studies were conducted in the United States and 39 in foreign countries. Patient management was successful via telemedicine in 99.6% of cases. Telemedicine visits failed in 162 cases, 81.5% of which were due to technology failure, and 18.5% of which were due to patients requiring further face-to-face evaluation or treatment. A total of 16 studies compared telemedicine encounters to alternative patient encounter mediums; telemedicine was equivalent or superior in 15 studies. From 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020, our department had 122 telemedicine visits (65.9%) and 63 face-to-face visits (34.1%). About 94.3% of telemedicine visits were billed using face-to-face procedural codes. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical telemedicine encounters appear promising in resource-scarce times, such as during global pandemics.","Eichberg, Daniel G; Basil, Gregory W; Di, Long; Shah, Ashish H; Luther, Evan M; Lu, Victor M; Perez-Dickens, Maggy; Komotar, Ricardo J; Levi, Allan D; Ivan, Michael E",Neurosurgery,153,1

Although lipids have been shown to possess antiviral efficacy, little is currently known about lipid compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry properties. To address this issue, we screened, overall, 17 polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids, as wells as lipid-soluble vitamins. In performing target-based ligand screening utilizing the RBD-SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we observed that polyunsaturated fatty acids most effectively interfere with binding to hACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using a spike protein pseudo-virus, we also found that linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, eicosapentaenoic acid showed higher efficacy than linolenic acid in reducing activity of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases, but neither of the fatty acids affected their expression at the protein level. Also, neither reduction of hACE2 activity nor binding to the hACE2 receptor upon treatment with these two fatty acids was observed. Although further in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings, our study provides a new insight into the role of lipids as antiviral compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 strain.","Goc, Anna; Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra; Rath, Matthias",Sci Rep,153,33

The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage. METHODS: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions. RESULTS: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak. In addition, from the perspective of measuring medical resources, our model has powerful strength because it assumes all the parameters as time-dependent, which reflects the exact status of viral spread.","Jung, Se Young; Jo, Hyeontae; Son, Hwijae; Hwang, Hyung Ju",J Med Internet Res,153,26

The demonstration of in vitro infectiousness of respiratory specimens is an informative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19; accordingly, viral isolation assays in cell culture are an important aspect of laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a simple and rapid protocol for isolating SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, a cell line that is highly susceptible to the virus. We also investigated a correlation between isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and viral load detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using N2 primer/probe set that has been developed for testing of COVID-19 in Japan. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol did not require blind passage of inoculated cells and yielded the results of viral isolation within 7 days after inoculation. Specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <20.2, determined by rRT-PCR, were predicted to be isolation-positive. On the other hand, 6.9% of specimens with Ct values >35 were virus isolation-positive, indicating that low viral loads (high Ct values) in upper respiratory specimens do not always indicate no risk of containing transmissible virus. CONCLUSION: In combination with rRT-PCR, the SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol provides a means for assessing the potential risk of transmissible virus in upper respiratory specimens.","Yamada, Souichi; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Kinoshita, Hitomi; Ohnishi, Makoto; Suzuki, Tadaki; Fujimoto, Tsuguto; Saijo, Masayuki; Maeda, Ken",,153,16

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants from 15 LGAs in metropolitan Melbourne who worked in a role associated or aligned with gambling. An inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged. First, participants described a shift from addiction frameworks to public health policy responses to EGMs, which was driven by increasing EGM losses and the harms caused by EGMs to communities. Second, there was the role of stakeholder groups in the policy-making process, including the challenges associated with engaging the community. Finally, there were barriers and facilitators to policy development and implementation. Barriers included a lack of financial resources and legislative boundaries imposed by the State Government. Facilitators included whole-of-LGA approaches, supportive councillors and collaborative efforts. Conclusions and implications for public health: LGAs have made shifts towards public health responses to EGM harm. Initiatives to further support policy development and implementation could include imposing a levy on EGM losses to directly support public health prevention activities and implementing robust state-based regulatory frameworks that support LGA responses to EGM harm.","Marko, Sarah; Thomas, Samantha L; Pitt, Hannah; Daube, Mike",Aust.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors use a wide set of the sovereign CDS data of 78 countries. To measure the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors use the daily change of confirmed cases collected from Our World in Data. They use panel regressions to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sovereign credit risk. Findings: The authors show how sovereign CDS spreads have widened significantly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the most conservative estimate, a 1% increase in COVID-19 infections leads to a 0.17% increase in sovereign CDS spreads. Furthermore, this effect is stronger for developing countries and countries with worse healthcare systems. Government policies partially offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although these same policies also lead to widening sovereign CDS spreads. Sovereign CDS spreads narrow dramatically several months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the results suggest that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive shock to the global financial stability. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence that COVID-19 widens sovereign CDS spreads. The authors further show that this widening effect is felt most strongly in developing economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Pan, W.

Unlike the previous strain, it is reported that the descendants are associated with increased risk of transmission yet causing less impact in terms of hospital admission, the severity of illness, or mortality. Moreover, the vaccine efficacy is also not believed to vary among the population depending on the variants of the virus and ethnicity. It has been determined that the mutations recorded in the spike gene and protein of the newly evolved viruses are specificallyresponsible for this transformation in the behavior of the virus and its disease condition. Hence, this study aimed to compare the immunogenic profiles of the spike protein from the latest variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concerning the probability of COVID-19 severity. Genome sequences of the latest SARS-CoV-2 variants were obtained from GISAID and NCBI repositories. The translated protein sequences were run against T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction tools. Subsequently, antigenicity, immunogenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and conservancy of the identified epitopes were ascertained using various prediction servers. Only the non-allergic and non-toxic potential epitopes were matched for population relevance by using the Human Leucocyte Antigen population registry in IEDB. Finally, the selected epitopes were validated by docking and simulation studies. The evaluated immunological parameters would concurrently reveal the severity of COVID-19, determining the infection rate of the pathogen. Our immunoinformatics approach disclosed that spike protein of the five variants was capable of forming potential T and B-cell epitopes with varying immune responses. Although the Wuhan strain showed a high number of epitope/HLA combinations, relatively less antigenicity and higher immunogenicity results in poor neutralizing capacity, which could be associated with increased disease severity. Our data demonstrate that increased viral antigenicity with moderate to high immunogenicity, and several potential epitope/HLA combinations in England strain, the USA, India, and South Africa variants,could possess a high neutralizing ability. Therefore, our findings reinforce that the newly circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 might be associated with more infectiousness and less severe disease condition despite their greater viremia, as reported in the recent COVID-19 cases, whichconsequently determine their increased epidemiological fitness.","Mallavarpu Ambrose, Jenifer Priya Veeraraghavan Vishnu Kullappan Malathi Chellapandiyan Poongodi Krishna Mohan Surapaneni Manivel Vivek Anand",Antibiotics,153,31

We evaluated resident perception of our efforts to transition educational activities within the residency to an online, remote format utilizing Microsoft SharePoint. Educational conferences were transitioned to a videoconferencing platform on March 13, 2020 in conjunction with the deployment of an intradepartmental Microsoft SharePoint site to provide educational resources, disseminate scheduling changes, and provide wellness resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An 11-question survey available from 4 Jan 2020-4 Jun 2020 surveyed resident perceptions of the instituted changes. Twenty-six of 31 residents (83.8%) responded to the resident survey invitation. Twenty-four of 26 residents (92.3%) characterized the SharePoint as useful. Twenty of 26 residents (76.9%) desired attending guidance as to how to utilize the online resources for each resident rotation. A total of 92.3% (24/26) of residents felt that the program's response utilizing SharePoint engendered a greater sense of belonging to their work community.

METHODS: Patients were monitored through by 2 rounds of interviews. Clinical characteristics of patients with no symptoms (group 0) and of those reporting â©¾1 (group A), â©¾3 (group B), or â©¾5 symptoms (group C) were analyzed. Patients with â©¾1 symptom at both interviews were defined as group A2. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with HNC were analyzed. A higher frequency of patients with the following characteristics was observed in group A vs group 0: active treatment (40% vs 24%, p = 0.0002), gastrostomy (6% vs 2%, p = 0.027), recent active treatment (48% vs 29%, p < 0.0001), and higher number of concomitant medications (p = 0.01). A lower median age was observed in group B vs group no-B (patients with fewer than three symptoms) (59 vs 63.55 years, p = 0.016) and in group A2 vs group no-A2 (patients without at least one symptom at both interviews) (56 vs 63 years, p = 0.021); patients in group B received more recent active treatment than those in group no-B and in group A2 vs those in group no-A2 (p = 0.024 and 0.043, respectively); patients in group B had a lower body mass index than those in group no-B (22.4 vs 23.93 kg/m2, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: This work is based on patient-reported symptoms and signs independently of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.

The objective of this study was to provide real-world data on the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopic procedures in a safety-net healthcare system and cancer center affiliated with a tertiary academic center. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a combination of electronic health record data and a prospective data tool created to track endoscopy procedures throughout COVID-19 to describe patient and procedural characteristics of endoscopic procedures delayed during the initial COVID-19 surge. RESULTS: Of the 480 patients identified, the median age was 57 years (interquartile range 46-66), 55% (n = 262) were male, and 59% self-identified as white. Colonoscopy was the most common type of delayed procedure (49%), followed by combined esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy (22%), and EGD alone (20%). Colorectal cancer screening was the most common indication for delayed colonoscopy (35%), and evaluation of suspected bleeding (30%) was the most common indication for delayed combined EGD and colonoscopy. To date, 46% (223/480) of delayed cases have been completed with 12 colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers diagnosed. Sociodemographic factors, procedure type, and sedation type were not significantly associated with endoscopy completion. The median time to endoscopy after delayed procedure was 88 days (interquartile range 63-119) with no differences by procedure type. DISCUSSION: To minimize potential losses to follow-up, delayed, or missed diagnoses and to reduce progression of gastrointestinal diseases, all efforts should be used to ensure follow-up in those whose endoscopic procedures were delayed because of COVID-19.","Issaka, Rachel B; Feld, Lauren D; Kao, Jason; Hegarty, Erin; Snailer, Brandon; Kalra, Gorav; Tomizawa, Yutaka; Strate, Lisa",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,153,24

It rapidly spread across the globe causing high mortality especially among the elderly. Africa though not spared has limited studies regarding its effects on its population. We therefore sought to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in Douala, Cameroon. Methods: we conducted a single-centre, retrospective, and observational study by reviewing records of patients managed for COVID-19 between the 8th March 2020 and 31st, May 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Outcomes were either clinical improvement by Day-28 or in-hospital mortality. Results: we analyzed 282 case files, 192 were males (M: F=2: 1). The mean age was 52 (+/- 15) years. Hypertension and diabetes accounted for 75% of the chronic medical conditions identified. Main presenting complaints were dyspnea, cough, asthenia, and fever (55-60%). Radiographic analysis showed a ground-glass appearance in 85% of cases. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine was the most (91.8%) frequently used drug in management protocols, 35% needed oxygen supplementation while 6 patients were intubated. Severe pneumonia (11.3%) was the commonest complication. They were 91 admissions in the intensive care unit. The average length of hospital stay was 10 (+/- 5) days. The mortality rate was 32%.

Our study aims to evaluate the impact of both cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities on a high-risk population with COVID-19 infection and coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to those without CAD. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who tested COVID-19 positive via reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without CAD. Population demographics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with inpatient mortality. RESULTS: A final sample population of 355 patients was identified, and 78 of which had a known diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Our study population had a higher proportion of females, and those with CAD were significantly older. The rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly higher in the CAD population. Lactate dehydrogenase was the only inflammatory marker significantly lower in the CAD group, while troponin and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in this population. Patients with CAD also had significantly higher inpatient mortality (31% vs 20%, P = 0.046) and need for renal replacement therapy (33% vs 11%, P < 0.0001) compared to the non-CAD group. However, only age [odds ratio 1.041 (1.017-1.066), P = 0.001] was significantly associated with mortality in the overall population after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, while the presence of CAD was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with CAD and COVID-19 have higher rates of comorbidities, inpatient mortality and need for renal replacement therapy compared to their non-CAD counterparts. However, CAD in itself was not associated with mortality after adjusting for other covariates, suggesting that other factors may play a larger role in the increased mortality and poor outcomes in these patients.","Peterson, Eric; Lo, Kevin Bryan; DeJoy, Robert; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Amanullah, Aman; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",Coron. artery dis,153,31

Aim To evaluate the impact of powered air-purifying respirators, full-face air-purifying respirators and filtering facepieces on specially trained anaesthesiologists performing difficult airway procedures. Methods All our COVID-19 intubation team members carried out various difficult intubation drills: unprotected, wearing a full-face respirator, a filtering facepiece or a powered respirator. Airway management times and wearer comfort were evaluated and analysed. Results Total mean (SD) intubation times did not show significant differences between the control, the powered, the full-face respirator and the filtering facepiece groups: Airtraq 6.1 (4.4) vs. 5.4 (3.1) vs. 6.1 (5.6) vs. 7.7 (7.6) s;videolaryngoscopy 11.4 (9.0) vs. 7.7 (4.3) vs. 9.8 (8.4) vs. 12.7 (9.8) s;fibreoptic intubation 16.6 (7.8) vs.13.8 (6.7) vs. 13.6 (8.1) vs. 16.9 (9.2) s;and standard endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy 8.1 (3.5) vs. 6.5 (5.6) vs. 6.2 (4.2) vs. 8.0 (4.4) s, respectively.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","Defar, Atkure; Molla, Gebeyaw; Abdella, Saro; Tessema, Masresha; Ahmed, Muhammed; Tadele, Ashenif; Getachew, Fikresilassie; Hailegiorgis, Bezawit; Tigabu, Eyasu; Ababor, Sabit; Bizuwork, Ketema; Deressa, Asefa; Tasaw, Geremew; Kebede, Adisu; Melese, Daniel; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Tayachew, Adamu; Wossen, Mesfin; Hassen, Abduilhafiz; Habebe, Shambel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Abate, Ebba; Tollera, Getachew",PLoS One,153,33

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. RESULTS: The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. CONCLUSION: Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment. The authors and affiliates do not endorse the use of this device at present.","Anwari, Vahid; Ng, William C K; Mbadjeu Hondjeu, Arnaud Romeo; Xiao, Zixuan; Afenu, Edem; Trac, Jessica; Kazlovich, Kate; Hiansen, Joshua; Mashari, Azad",PLoS One,153,6

OBJECTIVE: To review a selective for a course in diagnostic pathology geared toward undergraduate medical students, including its design, technical implementation, instructor and student evaluations, and suggestions for options for further adjusting and optimizing the selective. DESIGN: Whole slide images (WSI) were anonymized and students were given remote access to university computers, which were prepared with two freely available WSI viewers. Each topic was taught in a four-part module: Self-assigned reading, lecture via Zoom, quiz based on digital slide sets, and a frontal review of the slides via Zoom. Fifty-nine students participated in the selective. Following the course, students completed an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 42% (n = 25) responded. None of the respondents had any previous instruction in diagnostic pathology. Overall, the course was rated very favorably: 68% (n = 17) gave at least 3 points on a 4-point scale on questions relating to course interest, improvement in understanding of the covered diseases, and how strongly they would recommend a student take this course if given an option. The most significant disadvantage of the class, as reported by 80% (n = 20) were technical challenges in accessing the slides. CONCLUSION: We believe the course was a success and can be a model for future virtual pathology electives. Great effort should be done to provide technical support to the students.

However, some individuals reportedly remain SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive by pharyngeal swabs weeks after recovery. Whether viral RNA in these persistent carriers is contagious and stimulates SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses is unknown. METHODS: This cohort study was conducted between April 3rd-July 9th 2020, recruiting COVID-19 recovered individuals that were symptom-free for at least 14 days. We collected serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific total Ig, IgA and IgM detection by ELISA, pharyngeal swabs (two time points) for ddPCR and PBMCs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell dextramer analyses. FINDINGS: We enrolled 203 post-symptomatic participants with a previous RT-PCR-verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. At time point 1, a median of 23 days (range 15-44) after recovery, 26 individuals (12â 8%) were PCR positive. At time point 2, 90 days (median, range 85-105) after recovery, 5 (5â 3%) were positive. There was no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels between the PCR negative and positive group. The persistent PCR positive group however, had SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T-cell responses of significantly increased breadth and magnitude. Assisted contact tracing among persistent PCR positive individuals revealed zero new COVID-19 diagnoses among 757 close contacts. INTERPRETATION: Persistent pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in post-symptomatic individuals is associated with elevated cellular immune responses and thus, the viral RNA may represent replicating virus. However, transmission to close contacts was not observed indicating that persistent PCR positive individuals are not contagious at the post-symptomatic stage of the infection.","Vibholm, Line K; Nielsen, Stine S F; Pahus, Marie H; Frattari, Giacomo S; Olesen, Rikke; Andersen, Rebecca; Monrad, Ida; Andersen, Anna H F; Thomsen, Michelle M; Konrad, Christina V; Andersen, Sidsel D; Højen, Jesper F; Gunst, Jesper D; Østergaard, Lars; Søgaard, Ole S; Schleimann, Mariane H; Tolstrup, Martin",EBioMedicine,153,29

The participants were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which included answering an online questionnaire. Data were collected from 10 September through 23 November 2020. Respondents answered questions asking whether they intended to be vaccinated and provided the main reason for their answers. To estimate associations between vaccination hesitancy and independent variables, we fit Poisson regression models with robust variance.

The aim was to explore how these care services have adapted during the pandemic in the UK and are providing care to people living with dementia (PLWD) and carers. METHOD: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in June and July 2020 with 16 purposefully sampled unpaid dementia carers. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing care services since the lockdown, and whether they were beneficial, if accessed at all. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) Impacts of no activities; (2) Difficulties accessing care during the pandemic; (3) Remote vs. face-to-face support. Loss of access to previously enjoyed activities and having had to shield for many PLWD is suggested to have led to severe physical and cognitive deteriorations, advancing the dementia. Where remote support was available, this was helpful to some, but did not replace the benefits of face-to-face support. Where PLWD were residing in a care home, carers had very limited remote access. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the impact on carers both from a community and institutionalised care angle. Few care services have adapted to providing remote support. With the vaccine taking time to be accessible to everyone, it is vital for organisations to work closely with carers and PLWD to adapt services to provide much needed support.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Callaghan, Steve; Cannon, Jacqui; Butchard, Sarah; Shenton, Justine; Komuravelli, Aravind; Limbert, Stan; Tetlow, Hilary; Rogers, Carol; Eley, Ruth; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Gabbay, Mark",Aging Ment Health,153,1

Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","Li, Junjiang; Giabbanelli, Philippe",JMIR Med Inform,153,29

Our model predicts a continuous phase transition between a disconnected and a highly connected phase and that the typical photonic networks do not present the small world property. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the phase transition, provide quantitative estimates for the minimum density of nodes needed to have a fully connected network and for the average distance between nodes. Our results thus provide quantitative benchmarks for the development of a quantum internet.","Brito, Samuraí; Canabarro, Askery; Chaves, Rafael; Cavalcanti, Daniel",Phys Rev Lett,153,19

We aimed to examine the changes in ED utilization during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a country with a well-developed primary care system. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ED utilization was performed in 3 Dutch hospitals during a 60-day period, starting on February 15, 2020. The identical period in 2019 was used as a reference. ED visits were labeled as COVID-related (defined as COVID-19 suspected) or non-COVID-related. Admission rates were compared using chi-square tests, and the reduction in ED visits was assessed descriptively. RESULTS: During the study period, daily ED volume was 18% lower compared to that of 2019. ED utilization further declined (-29%) during lockdown. Combined admission rates were higher in 2020 compared to those in 2019 (P < 0.001), and they were higher for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ED visits (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ED utilization was markedly reduced during the local rise of COVID-19 in a region with a well-developed primary care system and relatively low ED self-referral rates. Although it cannot directly be concluded from the findings of our study, this observation likely reflects a complex interaction between pure lockdown effects and viral fear, which warrants further research.","Barten, Dennis G; Latten, Gideon H P; van Osch, Frits H M",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,153,21

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assay's performance. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 µL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Zhao, Lei; Hu, Guibin; Deng, Lijuan; Su, Dan; Peng, Dongju; Nie, Xinjiao; Wang, Song; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jundao; Ruan, Zhong; Gao, Shouliang; Yang, Huasong; Guo, Fei; Wang, Lunan",Transfusion,153,16

Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden. In an effort to improve epidemic control, Sweden has increased testing rates, implemented more restrictive prevention measures, and increased their intensive care unit bed capacity.","Yarmol-Matusiak, Erica A; Cipriano, Lauren E; Stranges, Saverio",Scand J Public Health,153,26

Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance. METHOD: In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019-30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated. RESULTS: We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated.

DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3' tail.

In this study, we investigated changes in the proteome of kidney tissue of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were infected with an isolate of the nephrotropic variant 2 genotype (IS/1494/06) of avian coronavirus. Twenty 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were randomly divided into two groups, each comprising 10 chickens, which were kept in separate positive-pressure isolators. Chickens in group A served as a virus-free control group up to the end of the experiment, whereas chickens in group B were inoculated with 0.1 ml of 104.5 EID50 of the IBV/chicken/Iran/UTIVO-C/2014 isolate of IBV, and kidney tissue samples were collected at 2 and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) from both groups. Sequencing of five protein spots at 2 dpi and 22 spots at 7 dpi that showed differential expression by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) along with fold change greater than 2 was done by MS-MALDI/TOF/TOF. Furthermore, the corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at 2 and 7 dpi were identified to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanism of molecular pathogenesis. Topological graph analysis of this undirected PPI network revealed the effect of 10 genes in the 2 dpi PPI network and nine genes in the 7 dpi PPI network during virus pathogenesis. Proteins that were found by 2DE analysis and MS/TOF-TOF mass spectrometry to be down- or upregulated were subjected to PPI network analysis to identify interactions with other cellular components. The results show that cellular metabolism was altered due to viral infection. Additionally, multifunctional heat shock proteins with a significant role in host cell survival may be employed circuitously by the virus to reach its target. The data from this study suggest that the process of pathogenesis that occurs during avian coronavirus infection involves the regulation of vital cellular processes and the gradual disruption of critical cellular functions.","Abdollahi, Hamed; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Maghsoudloo, Hossein; Hashemzadeh, Masood; Hosseini, Hossein; Barin, Abbas",Arch. virol,153,6

Notably, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly depends on the control of cytokine storm and the increasingly recognized pathological role of uncontrolled neutrophil activation. Here, we used an integrative approach with publicly available RNA-Seq data sets of nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with SARS-CoV-2, according to sex and age. Female and young patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with male and elderly patients, indicating a stronger immune modulation. Among them, we found an association between upregulated cytokine/chemokine- and downregulated neutrophil-related DEGs. This was correlated with a closer relationship between female and young subjects, while the relationship between male and elderly patients was closer still. The association between these cytokine/chemokines and neutrophil DEGs is marked by a strongly correlated interferome network. Here, female patients exhibited reduced transcriptional levels of key proinflammatory/neutrophil-related genes, such as CXCL8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), IL-1ß, S100A9, ITGAM, and DBNL, compared with male patients. These genes are well known to be protective against inflammatory damage. Therefore, our work suggests specific immune-regulatory pathways associated with sex and age of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provides a possible association between inverse modulation of cytokine/chemokine and neutrophil transcriptional signatures.","Freire, Paula P; Marques, Alexandre Hc; Baiocchi, Gabriela C; Schimke, Lena F; Fonseca, Dennyson Lm; Salgado, Ranieri C; Filgueiras, Igor S; Napoleao, Sarah Ms; Plaça, Desirée R; Akashi, Karen T; Hirata, Thiago Dominguez Crespo; El Khawanky, Nadia; Giil, Lasse M; Cabral-Miranda, Gustavo; Carvalho, Robson F; Ferreira, Luis Carlos S; Condino-Neto, Antonio; Nakaya, Helder I; Jurisica, Igor; Ochs, Hans D; Camara, Niels Olsen Saraiva; Calich, Vera Lúcia G; Cabral-Marques, Otavio",JCI insight,153,20

DESIGN: Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE distributed to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use and disposed of via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of environmental mitigation strategies: (1) eliminating international travel during supply; (2) eliminating glove use; (3) reusing gowns and face shields; and (4) maximal recycling. SETTING: Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The carbon footprint of PPE distributed during the study period totalled 106,478 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 239 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.47 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion was costed at US $12.7m (GBP £9.3m). Scenario modelling indicated UK manufacture would have reduced the carbon footprint by 12%, eliminating gloves by 45%, reusing gowns and gloves by 10% and maximal recycling by 35%. RESULTS: A combination of strategies may have reduced the carbon footprint by 75% compared with the base scenario, and saved an estimated 183 DALYS, 0.34 species.year and US $7.4m (GBP £5.4m) due to resource depletion. CONCLUSION: The environmental impact of PPE is large and could be reduced through domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible and optimising waste management.","Rizan, Chantelle; Reed, Malcolm; Bhutta, Mahmood F",J R Soc Med,153,12

In Peru, although the quarantine is no longer mandatory, it was during the first months of 2020. To date, no studies have assessed the impact of the COVID-19 on the eating patterns and lifestyle context in the country. We aimed to describe the eating habits, lifestyle behaviors and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine among Peruvian adults. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study. We used an online survey to collect information regarding eating habits, self-perceived stress and sedentary lifestyle among adults over 18 years of age residing in Lima-Peru and who complied with strict home quarantine. We presented our data according to the weight variation of the participants. Results A total of 686 were finally included in the study. The 82.9% were female, the median BMI was 25.97 kg/m2 (IQR: 23.37–29.41) and 68.2% reported a significant variation in their weight (38.9% increased and 29.3% lost weight). All bad habits were significantly associated with weight gain, except for prolonged fasting. Additionally, a sitting time longer than usual (p = 0.001), being in front of a screen for more than five hours in the last week (p = 0.002), and most of the stressful scenarios were significantly associated with weight gain. Conclusion Almost four out of ten participants gained weight during the quarantine. This was associated with unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, and stressful scenarios.","Agurto, Hellen S.; Alcantara-Diaz, Ana L.; Espinet-Coll, Eduardo Toro-Huamanchumo Carlos J.",PeerJ,153,16

METHODS: A total of 90 patients with COVID-19 accompanied with insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (45 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (45 cases). In the observation group, baduanjin, a traditional Chinese fitness activity, was practiced everyday. Besides, auricular point sticking therapy was exerted at ear-shenmen (TF 4), subcortex (AT 4), heart (CO 15), occiput (AT 3), etc. These auricular points were pressed and kneaded three times a day, 30 s at each point each time, consecutively for 12 days. In the control group, estazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 mg, once daily, consecutively for 12 days. Before and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01). The scores of sleep time and sleep efficiency in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). SAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia. The therapeutic effect of this combined treatment is better than the oral administration of estazolam.","Yang, Chao; Ma, Yan; Mei, Jun-Hua; Gong, Xue; Wang, Meng; Liu, Kun",Zhongguo Zhen Jiu,153,1

The agents responsible for these infections can be viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi. Among the viruses most frequently responsible for congenital infections are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex 1-2, Herpes virus 6, Varicella zoster. Moreover Hepatitis B and C virus, HIV, Parvovirus B19 and non-polio Enteroviruses when contracted during pregnancy may involve the fetus or newborn at birth. Recently, new viruses have emerged, SARS-Cov-2 and Zika virus, of which we do not yet fully know the characteristics and pathogenic power when contracted during pregnancy. Viral infections in pregnancy can damage the fetus (spontaneous abortion, fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation) or the newborn (congenital anomalies, organ diseases with sequelae of different severity). Some risk factors specifically influence the incidence of transmission to the fetus: the timing of the infection in pregnancy, the order of the infection, primary or reinfection or chronic, the duration of membrane rupture, type of delivery, socio-economic conditions and breastfeeding. Frequently infected neonates, symptomatic at birth, have worse outcomes than asymptomatic. Many asymptomatic babies develop long term neurosensory outcomes. The way in which the virus interacts with the maternal immune system, the maternal-fetal interface and the placenta explain these results and also the differences that are observed from time to time in the fetal­neonatal outcomes of maternal infections. The maternal immune system undergoes functional adaptation during pregnancy, once thought as physiological immunosuppression. This adaptation, crucial for generating a balance between maternal immunity and fetus, is necessary to promote and support the pregnancy itself and the growth of the fetus. When this adaptation is upset by the viral infection, the balance is broken, and the infection can spread and lead to the adverse outcomes previously described. In this review we will describe the main viral harmful infections in pregnancy and the potential mechanisms of the damages on the fetus and newborn.","Auriti, Cinzia; De Rose, Domenico Umberto; Santisi, Alessandra; Martini, Ludovica; Piersigilli, Fiammetta; Bersani, Iliana; Ronchetti, Maria Paola; Caforio, Leonardo",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,153,10

METHODS: Ninety-five symptomatic patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from 1 May to 14 July 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Follow-up CT findings and their distributions were analyzed and compared from symptom onset to late-stage disease. RESULTS: Among all patients, 15.8% had unilateral lung disease and 84.2% had bilateral disease with slight right lower lobe predilection (47.4%). Regarding lesion density, 49.4% of patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) and 50.5% had GGO with consolidation. Typical early-stage patterns were bilateral lesions in 73.6% of patients, diffuse lesions (41.0%), and GGO (65.2%). Pleural effusion occurred in 13.6% and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 11.5%. During intermediate-stage disease, 47.4% of patients showed GGO as the disease progressed; however, consolidation was the predominant finding (52.6%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifested on lung CT scans with bilateral, peripheral, and right lower lobe predominance and was characterized by diffuse bilateral GGO progressing to or coexisting with consolidation within 1 to 3 weeks. The most frequent CT lesion in the early, intermediate, and late phases was GGO. Consolidation appeared in the intermediate phase and gradually increased, ending with reticular and lung fibrosis-like patterns.","Darwish, Hoda Salah; Habash, Mohamed Yasser; Habash, Waleed Yasser",J Int Med Res,153,2

As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally all school children returned to the classroom in September. In this paper, we analyse the data on school absences from September 2020 to December 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Educational Settings database compiled by the Department for Education and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools. Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers were seen to decline during the November lockdown, particularly in those regions that had previously been in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first two weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences owing to confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be significantly lower than in secondary schools across all regions and tiers. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and Greater London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in cases in secondary schools. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. We conclude that there is not significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a significant role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.","Southall, E.

In this paper, household medical products were analyzed. Considering the household anti-epidemic status, economic and environmental benefits, the adaptable design method of anti-epidemic products in the vestibule was proposed. The measure of adaptable design method still have shortcomings. Therefore, an improved method that is based on fuzzy logic programming is required. METHOD: Firstly, common medical product types used in vestibules and household anti-epidemic products were identified and summarized into product sets through the literature review, focus groups and questionnaires. Then matching degree matrix was obtained by functional configuration decomposition and matching calculations. Secondly, experts were invited to evaluate the paired comparative probability matrices and linguistic variables, and the evaluation data were converted by trapezoidal membership functions, fuzzy numbers and the defuzzification method to obtain the usage probability values for product functions. Finally, the matching degree value and the product function were calculated by adaptability measure formula, and product function, the adaptability factor and the adaptability were obtained. RESULTS: Our results show that the degree of adaptability of each product function in the product set. The higher value of the product function, the more it can be prioritized for design development with functional cost savings, simplification or clustering. CONCLUSION: This study proposes an adaptable design method based on fuzzy logic programming. The data results in this study can guide the development and programming of the vestibule anti-epidemic products. The higher adaptability value of a product function indicates that it is more capable of being simplified, clustered, and adapting to changes in the product set.","Fu, You-Lei; Liang, Kuei-Chia",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,153,21

Co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV2 can lead to diagnostic and management difficulties given the similarities in the clinical picture. Methods: This is a cohort of all children hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection from March to September 3rd 2020, and all children admitted with influenza throughout five flu-seasons (2013–2018) at a pediatric referral hospital. Patients with influenza were identified from the clinical laboratory database. All hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection were followed-up prospectively. Results: A total of 295 patients with influenza and 133 with SARS-CoV2 infection were included. The median age was 3.7 years for influenza and 5.3 years for SARS-CoV2. Comorbidities were frequent in both groups, but they were more common in patients with influenza (96.6 vs. 82.7%, p < 0.001). Fever and cough were the most common clinical manifestations in both groups. Rhinorrhea was present in more than half of children with influenza but was infrequent in those with COVID-19 (53.6 vs. 5.8%, p < 0.001). Overall, 6.4% percent of patients with influenza and 7.5% percent of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection died. In-hospital mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation among symptomatic patients were similar between groups in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Influenza and COVID-19 have a similar picture in pediatric patients, which makes diagnostic testing necessary for adequate diagnosis and management. Even though most cases of COVID-19 in children are asymptomatic or mild, the risk of death among hospitalized patients with comorbidities may be substantial, especially among infants.","Laris-González, Almudena; Avilés-Robles, Martha; Domínguez-Barrera, Clemen; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Sánchez-Huerta, José Luis; Ojeda-Diezbarroso, Karla; Bonilla-Pellegrini, Sergio; Olivar-López, Víctor; Chávez-López, Adrián; Jiménez-Juárez, Rodolfo",Front Pediatr,153,20

In patients aged 65 years and older, triage decisions are regularly based on degree of frailty measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). However, the CFS could also be useful in patients younger than 65 years. We aimed to examine the association between CFS score and hospital mortality and between CFS score and admission to intensive care in adult patients of all ages with COVID-19 across Europe. METHODS: This analysis was part of the COVID Medication (COMET) study, an international, multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study in 63 hospitals in 11 countries in Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had been admitted to hospital, and either tested positive by PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or were judged to have a high clinical likelihood of having SARS-CoV-2 infection by the local COVID-19 expert team. CFS was used to assess level of frailty: fit (CFS(1–3)), mildly frail (CFS(4–5)), or frail (CFS(6–9)). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was admission to intensive care. Data were analysed using a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for covariates (age, sex, number of drugs prescribed, and type of drug class as a proxy for comorbidities). FINDINGS: Between March 30 and July 15, 2020, 2434 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 55–77]; 1480 [61%] men, 954 [30%] women) had CFS scores available and were included in the analyses. In the total sample and in patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients and mildly frail patients had a significantly higher risk of hospital mortality than fit patients (total sample: CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) odds ratio [OR] 2·71 [95% CI 2·04–3·60], p<0·0001 and CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 1·54 [1·16–2·06], p=0·0030; age ≥65 years: CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) OR 2·90 [2·12–3·97], p<0·0001 and CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 1·64 [1·20–2·25], p=0·0020). In patients younger than 65 years, an increased hospital mortality risk was only observed in frail patients (CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) OR 2·22 [1·08–4·57], p=0·030; CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 1·08 [0·48–2·39], p=0·86). Frail patients had a higher incidence of admission to intensive care than fit patients (CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) OR 1·54 [1·21–1·97], p=0·0010), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 0·71 [0·55–0·92], p=0·0090). Among patients younger than 65 years, frail patients had an increased incidence of admission to intensive care (CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) OR 2·96 [1·98–4·43], p<0·0001), whereas mildly frail patients had no significant difference in incidence compared with fit patients (CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 0·93 [0·63–1·38], p=0·72). Among patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients had no significant difference in the incidence of admission to intensive care compared with fit patients (CFS(6–9)vs CFS(1–3) OR 1·27 [0·92–1·75], p=0·14), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS(4–5)vs CFS(1–3) OR 0·66 [0·47–0·93], p=0·018). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study suggest that CFS score is a suitable risk marker for hospital mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. However, treatment decisions based on the CFS in patients younger than 65 years should be made with caution.

The role of the HE protein during the torovirus infection cycle remains unknown, although it is believed to be important in the natural infection process. The phylogenetic analysis of HE coding sequences from porcine torovirus (PToV) field strains revealed the existence of two distinct HE lineages. In a previous study, PToV virus strains with HE proteins from the two lineages were found coexisting in a pig herd, and they were even obtained from the same animal at two consecutive sampling time points. In this work, we report antigenic differences between the two HE lineages, and discuss the possible implications that the coexistence of viruses belonging to both lineages might have on the spread and sustainment of PToV infection in the farms.","Pignatelli, Jaime; Alonso-Padilla, Julio; Rodríguez, Dolores",Vet Res,153,11

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on an e-mail survey addressed to CM patients of our headache center. The survey evaluated demographic, life style, sleep, psychological, and migraine features during the COVID-19 lockdown period and the month before. The outcomes were migraine impact on daily life and variation in attack frequency, attack duration, migraine pain intensity, migraine symptomatic drugs use per week, and efficacy. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the survey. During the lockdown period, attack frequency was stable in 40,2%, increased in 33,7%, and reduced in 26,1% of patients; attack duration was stable in 55,4%, increased in 23,9%, and reduced in 20,7%. Migraine pain was stable or reduced in 65,2% and increased in 34,8%; number of symptomatic drugs per week was stable in 50%, reduced in 29,3%, and increased in 20,7%; migraine drug efficacy was stable in 73,9%, reduced in 17,4%, and increased in 8,7%. Patients had a HIT-6 score of 64,63 ± 8,81. Significant associations were found with remote working, smoke, education, discontinuation of the therapy performed within headache center, migraine familiarity, sleep, anxiety, perceived stress, concern about future, and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown, approximately half of the patients had a clinical stability, a quarter an improvement, and another quarter a worsening. We identified different migraine-influencing elements; in particular, the remote working could represent an easy way to ameliorate migraineurs’ life.

Despite available effective treatments, the majority of heavy cannabis users does not seek professional help. Web-based interventions can provide an alternative for cannabis users who are reluctant to seek professional help. Several web-based cannabis interventions are effective in reducing cannabis use; however, the effect sizes are typically small and attrition rates are typically high. This suggests that web-based programs can be an effective cannabis use intervention for some, while others may need additional substance use treatment after completing a web-based intervention. Therefore, it is important that web-based interventions do not solely focus on reducing cannabis use, but also on improving attitudes towards substance use treatment. The Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) approach appears to be well suited for the purpose of reducing cannabis use and improving substance use treatment utilization. Based on the SBIRT approach—and based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI)—we developed the Internet-based cannabis reduction intervention ICan. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol paper presents the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which we evaluate the effectiveness of the ICan intervention compared to four online modules of educational information on cannabis in a sample of Dutch frequent cannabis users. The primary outcome measure is frequency of cannabis use. Secondary outcome measures include the quantity of cannabis used (grams), the attitudes towards seeking help and the number of participants who enter specialized treatment services for cannabis use-related problems. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, ICan is the first Internet-based intervention for cannabis users that combines screening, a brief intervention—based on CBT and MI—and referral to treatment options.

Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as an indicator of hypercoagulability and MA [â¥] 68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. We evaluated the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without thrombotic complications. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. Results: 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (p=0.038 and p=0.043 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (p<0.001) while fibrinogen was positively correlated (p<0.001). A fibrinogen > 441 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA [â¥] 68 mm. Conclusions: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may reflect severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation. Fibrinogen concentration may represent a more useful marker of hypercoagulability in this population.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Looby, Mary; Dalton, Heidi; Bade, Najeebah; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Desai, Mehul; Lantry, James; Osborn, Erik; Djurkovic, Svetolik; Tang, Daniel; Nathan, Steven D; King, Christopher S",,153,1

After hospitalization for COVID-19, a number of patients are referred to medical rehabilitation centers or skilled nursing facilities for further treatment, while others go home with or without aftercare. The aftercare paths include 1] community-based rehabilitation; 2] in- and outpatient medical rehabilitation; 3] inpatient rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities; and 4] sheltered care (inpatient). These aftercare paths and the trajectories of recovery after COVID-19 urgently need long-term in-depth evaluation to optimize and personalize treatment. CO-FLOW aims, by following the outcomes and aftercare paths of all COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge, to systematically study over a 2-year period: 1] trajectories of physical, cognitive, and psychological recovery; 2] patient flows, healthcare utilization, patient satisfaction with aftercare, and barriers/facilitators regarding aftercare as experienced by healthcare professionals; 3] effects of physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes on participation and HRQoL; and 4] predictors for long-term recovery, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction with aftercare. METHODS: CO-FLOW is a multicenter prospective cohort study in the mid-west of the Netherlands with a 2-year follow-up period. Measurements comprise non-invasive clinical tests and patient reported outcome measures from a combined rehabilitation, pulmonary, and intensive care perspective. Measurements are performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after hospital discharge and, if applicable, at rehabilitation discharge. CO-FLOW aims to include at least 500 patients who survived hospitalization for COVID-19, aged ≥18 years. DISCUSSION: CO-FLOW will provide in-depth knowledge on the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 and the quality of current aftercare paths for patients who survived hospitalization. This knowledge is a prerequisite to facilitate the right care in the right place for COVID-19 and comparable future infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to investigate parameters and risk stratification tools that can be applied to predict mortality within 90 days of hospital admission in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search of original studies assessing systems and parameters predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19 was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE. RESULTS: 589 titles were screened, and 76 studies were found investigating the prognostic ability of 16 existing scoring systems (area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC) range: 0.550–0.966), 38 newly developed COVID-19-specific prognostic systems (AUROC range: 0.6400–0.9940), 15 artificial intelligence (AI) models (AUROC range: 0.840–0.955) and 16 studies on novel blood parameters and imaging. DISCUSSION: Current scoring systems generally underestimate mortality, with the highest AUROC values found for APACHE II and the lowest for SMART-COP. Systems featuring heavier weighting on respiratory parameters were more predictive than those assessing other systems. Cardiac biomarkers and CT chest scans were the most commonly studied novel parameters and were independently associated with mortality, suggesting potential for implementation into model development. All types of AI modelling systems showed high abilities to predict mortality, although none had notably higher AUROC values than COVID-19-specific prediction models. All models were found to have bias, including lack of prospective studies, small sample sizes, single-centre data collection and lack of external validation. CONCLUSION: The single parameters established within this review would be useful to look at in future prognostic models in terms of the predictive capacity their combined effect may harness.","Chu, Kelly; Alharahsheh, Batool; Garg, Naveen; Guha, Payal",BMJ Health Care Inform,153,10

Community engagement should cross-cut various types of research including rigorous measurement development of socio-structural determinants and novel analytic techniques to model their role in the trajectory of the epidemic and the impact of interventions. Considering the role of place, we recommend collaboration between scientists and communities in the interpretation of results from studies that map HIV-related behaviors and movement.

Although available, chemotherapy is limited, presenting toxicity and adverse effects. New drugs with antileishmanial activity are being investigated, such as antiparasitic compounds derived from plants. In this work, we investigated the antileishmanial activity of the biflavonoid amentoflavone on the protozoan Leishmania amazonensis. Although the antileishmanial activity of amentoflavone has already been reported in vitro, the mechanisms involved in the parasite death, as well as its action in vivo, remain unknown. Amentoflavone demonstrated activity on intracellular amastigotes in macrophages obtained from BALB/c mice (IC(50) 2.3 ± 0.93 μM). No cytotoxicity was observed and the selectivity index was estimated as greater than 10. Using BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis we verified the effect of an intralesional treatment with amentoflavone (0.05 mg/kg/dose, in a total of 5 doses every 4 days). Parasite quantification demonstrated that amentoflavone reduced the parasite load in treated footpads (46.3% reduction by limiting dilution assay and 56.5% reduction by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction). Amentoflavone decreased the nitric oxide production in peritoneal macrophages obtained from treated animals. The treatment also increased the expression of ferritin and decreased iNOS expression at the site of infection. Furthemore, it increased the production of ROS in peritoneal macrophages infected in vitro. The increase of ROS in vitro, associated with the reduction of NO and iNOS expression in vivo, points to the antioxidant/prooxidant potential of amentoflavone, which may play an important role in the balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory patterns at the infection site. Taken together these results suggest that amentoflavone has the potential to be used in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, working as an ally in the control and development of the lesion.","Rizk, Yasmin Silva; Santos-Pereira, Sandy; Gervazoni, Luiza; Hardoim, Daiana de Jesus; Cardoso, Flávia de Oliveira; de Souza, Celeste da Silva Freitas; Pelajo-Machado, Marcelo; Carollo, Carlos Alexandre; de Arruda, Carla Cardozo Pinto; Almeida-Amaral, Elmo Eduardo; Zaverucha-do-Valle, Tânia; Calabrese, Kátia da Silva",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,153,12

For individuals with neurogenetic conditions, reliance on nonclinical caregivers to facilitate all therapies and care was unprecedented. The study aimed to (1) describe caregivers’ reported impact on their dependent’s services, therapies, medical needs, and impact on themselves as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) assess the relationship between the extent of disruption of services and the degree of self-reported caregiver burden. Two online questionnaires were completed by caregivers participating in Simons Searchlight in April and May 2020. Surveys were completed by caregivers of children or dependent adults with neurodevelopmental genetic conditions in Simons Searchlight. Caregivers reported that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic moderately or severely disrupted services, therapies, or medical supports. The majority of caregivers were responsible for providing some aspect of therapy. Caregivers reported “feeling stressed but able to deal with problems as they arise,” and reported lower anxiety at follow-up. Caregivers reported that telehealth services were not meeting the needs of those with complex medical needs. Future surveys will assess if and how medical systems, educational programs, therapists, and caregivers adapt to the challenges arising during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kowanda, Michelle; Cartner, Lindsey; Kentros, Catherine; Geltzeiler, Alexa R.; Singer, Kaitlyn E.; Weaver, W.

However, little is known about the presentation of patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care, particularly those who used 911 emergency medical services (EMS). OBJECTIVE: To describe patient characteristics and prehospital presentation of patients with COVID-19 cared for by EMS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 124 patients who required 911 EMS care for COVID-19 in King County, Washington, a large metropolitan region covering 2300 square miles with 2.2 million residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas, between February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Test results were available a median (interquartile range) of 5 (3-9) days after the EMS encounter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of clinical characteristics, symptoms, examination signs, and EMS impression and care. RESULTS: Of the 775 confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, EMS responded to 124 (16.0%), with a total of 147 unique 911 encounters. The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (13.2) years, 66 patients (53.2%) were women, 47 patients (37.9%) had 3 or more chronic health conditions, and 57 patients (46.0%) resided in a long-term care facility. Based on EMS evaluation, 43 of 147 encounters (29.3%) had no symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Based on individual examination findings, fever, tachypnea, or hypoxia were only present in a limited portion of cases, as follows: 43 of 84 encounters (51.2%), 42 of 131 (32.1%), and 60 of 112 (53.6%), respectively. Advanced care was typically not required, although in 24 encounters (16.3%), patients received care associated with aerosol-generating procedures. As of June 1, 2020, mortality among the study cohort was 52.4% (65 patients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that screening based on conventional COVID-19 symptoms or corresponding examination findings of febrile respiratory illness may not possess the necessary sensitivity for early diagnostic suspicion, at least in the prehospital emergency setting. The findings have potential implications for early identification of COVID-19 and effective strategies to mitigate infectious risk during emergency care.","Yang, Betty Y.; Barnard, Leslie M.; Emert, Jamie M.; Drucker, Christopher; Schwarcz, Leilani; Counts, Catherine R.; Murphy, David L.; Guan, Sally; Kume, Kosuke; Rodriquez, Karen; Jacinto, Tracie; May, Susanne; Sayre, Michael R.; Rea, Thomas",JAMA Netw Open,153,16

In the model, one layer represents the epidemic-related information diffusion in the social networks, while the other layer denotes the epidemic spreading in physical networks. In addition, there just exist mapping relationships between partial pairs of nodes in the two-layered network, which characterizes the interaction between information diffusion and epidemic spreading. Meanwhile, the information and epidemics can only spread in their own layers. Afterwards, starting from the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) method, we can establish the dynamic equation of epidemic spreading and then analytically deduce its epidemic threshold, which demonstrates that the ratio of correspondence between two layers has a significant effect on the epidemic threshold of the proposed model. Finally, it is found that MMC method can well match with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and the relevant results can be helpful to understand the epidemic spreading properties in depth.","Guo, Haili; Yin, Qian; Xia, Chengyi; Dehmer, Matthias",Nonlinear Dyn,153,20

Although many of them have viral infections, on occasion such patients may be infected with Neisseria meningitidis. We described all children aged 0–18 years with PRF in southern Israel during the period 2005 – 2016 and compared their microbiologic, laboratory, clinical and outcome characteristics in relation to various etiologies of this syndrome. METHODS: Data were summarized from electronic patient and microbiology files. Viral diagnoses were made by serology and/or PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children with PRF were admitted; 30 (43.48%), 9 (13.04%) and 30 (43.48%) had a syndrome of bacterial, viral or non-established etiology, respectively. N. meningitidis infection was diagnosed in 16/69 (23.19%) patients and in 16/30 (53.33%) patients with bacterial etiology; 14/30 (46.67%) patients suffered from a non-invasive bacterial disease (9 with Rickettsial disease). Adenovirus and Influenza B (3 and 2 cases, respectively) represented the most frequent etiologic agents among patients with viral etiology. More patients with PRF of bacterial etiology were older, of Bedouin ethnicity, looked ill on admission, had higher rates of meningitis and were treated more frequently with antibiotics compared with patients with non-bacterial PRF. Fatality rates among patients with bacterial, viral and non-established etiology were 5/30 (16.7%), 0% and 2/39 (5.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although PFR was uncommon, high rates of meningococcal infections were recorded in children with PRF, which was associated with high fatality rates. Rickettsial infections were frequent, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion for this disease in endemic geographic areas.","Gawie-Rotman, Moran; Hazan, Guy; Fruchtman, Yariv; Cavari, Yuval; Ling, Eduard; Lazar, Isaac; Leibovitz, Eugene",Pediatr Neonatol,153,14

Methods: We analyzed 348 Swedish SARS-CoV-2 sequences freely available from GISAID obtained from 7 February 2020 until 14 May 2020. Results: We identified 14 variant sites ≥5% frequency in the population. Among those sites, the D936Y substitution in the viral Spike protein was under positive selection. The variant sites can distinguish 11 mutational profiles in Sweden. Nine of the profiles appeared in Stockholm in March 2020. Mutational profiles 3 (B.1.1) and 6 (B.1), which contain the D936Y mutation, became the predominant profiles over time, spreading from Stockholm to other Swedish regions during April and the beginning of May. Furthermore, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could have emerged in Sweden on 27 December 2019, and community transmission started on February 1st with an evolutionary rate of 1.5425 × 10(−3) substitutions per year. Conclusions: Our study provides novel knowledge on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Swedish SARS-CoV-2 variants during the early pandemic. Characterization of these viral variants can provide precious insights on viral pathogenesis and can be valuable for diagnostic and drug development approaches.","Ling, Jiaxin; Hickman, Rachel A.; Li, Jinlin; Lu, Xi; Lindahl, Johanna F.; Lundkvist, Åke; Järhult, Josef D.",Viruses,153,1

The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well. With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans.

Herein, we established the proof of the concept of nanoscale Sanal-flow-choking in real-world fluid-flow systems using a closed-form-analytical-model. This mathematical-model is capable of predicting exactly the 3D-boundary-layer-blockage factor of nanoscale diabatic-fluid-flow systems (flow involves the transfer of heat) at the Sanal-flow-choking condition. As the pressure of the diabatic nanofluid and/or non-continuum-flows rises, average-mean-free-path diminishes and thus, the Knudsen-number lowers heading to a zero-slip wall-boundary condition with the compressible-viscous-flow regime in the nanoscale-tubes leading to Sanal-flow-choking due to the sonic-fluid-throat effect. At the Sanal-flow-choking condition the total-to-static pressure ratio (ie., systolic-to-diastolic pressure ratio) is a unique function of the heat-capacity-ratio of the real-world flows. The innovation of the nanoscale Sanal-flow-choking model is established herein through the entropy relation, as it satisfies all the conservation-laws of nature.

Interestingly, some species of these Gram-positive bacteria, which are generally recognized as safe organisms by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are able to survive through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), being capable to reach and colonize the intestine, where they play an important role. Besides, during the last decades, an important effort has been done for the development of tools to use LAB as microbial cell factories for the production of proteins of interest. Given the need to develop effective strategies for the delivery of prophylactic and therapeutic molecules, LAB have appeared as an appealing option for the oral, intranasal and vaginal delivery of such molecules. So far, these genetically modified organisms have been successfully used as vehicles for delivering functional proteins to mucosal tissues in the treatment of many different pathologies including GIT related pathologies, diabetes, cancer and viral infections, among others. Interestingly, the administration of such microorganisms would suppose a significant decrease in the production cost of the treatments agents since being live organisms, such vectors would be able to autonomously amplify and produce and deliver the protein of interest.

The current focus is on child-stunting, dietary diversity and ‘nutrient-rich’ foods in recognition of the growing burdens of malnutrition and non-communicable diseases. This article concerns the global dietary and health contribution of major cereals, specifically maize and wheat, which are often considered not to be ‘nutrient-rich’ foods. Nevertheless, these cereals are major sources of dietary energy, of essential proteins and micronutrients, and diverse non-nutrient bioactive food components. Research on bioactives, and dietary fibre in particular, is somewhat ‘siloed’, with little attention paid by the agri-nutrition research community to the role of cereal bioactives in healthy diets, and the adverse health effects often arising through processing and manufacturing of cereals-based food products. We argue that the research agenda should embrace the whole nutritional contribution of the multiple dietary components of cereals towards addressing the triple burden of undernutrition, micronutrient malnutrition, overweight/obesity and non-communicable diseases. Agri-nutrition and development communities need to adopt a multidisciplinary and food systems research approach from farm to metabolism. Agriculture researchers should collaborate with other food systems stakeholders on nutrition-related challenges in cereal production, processing and manufacturing, and food waste and losses. Cereal and food scientists should also collaborate with social scientists to better understand the impacts on diets of the political economy of the food industry, and the diverse factors which influence local and global dietary transitions, consumer behavioural choices, dietary change, and the assessment and acceptance of novel and nutritious cereal-based products.","Poole, Nigel; Donovan, Jason; Erenstein, Olaf",Food Policy,153,16

After the first successful case of intravenous BT to treat a systemic MDR infection at our institution in 2017, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH) was created at the University of California, San Diego, in June 2018. METHODS: We reviewed IPATH consult requests from June 1, 2018, to April 30, 2020, and reviewed the regulatory process of initiating BT on a compassionate basis in the United States. We also reviewed outcomes of the first 10 cases at our center treated with intravenous BT (from April 1, 2017, onwards). RESULTS: Among 785 BT requests to IPATH, BT was administered to 17 of 119 patients in whom it was recommended. One-third of requests were for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium abscessus. Intravenous BT was safe with a successful outcome in 7/10 antibiotic-recalcitrant infections at our center (6 were before IPATH). BT may be safely self-administered by outpatients, used for infection suppression/prophylaxis, and combined successfully with antibiotics despite antibiotic resistance, and phage resistance may be overcome with new phage(s). Failure occurred in 2 cases despite in vitro phage susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of intravenous BT for a variety of infections and discuss practical considerations that will be critical for informing future clinical trials.","Aslam, Saima; Lampley, Elizabeth; Wooten, Darcy; Karris, Maile; Benson, Constance; Strathdee, Steffanie; Schooley, Robert T",Open Forum Infect Dis,153,32

Against the backdrop of research on the HIV pandemic, the paper departs from the assumption that decreased legitimacy of intimate arrangements and subjective worry about the likeliness of infection may reduce the frequency of multiple sexual contact and intimate well-being during the pandemic. Based on findings from a quantitative study which included measures of risk perception, frequency of contact with sexual partners and communities, concealment, as well as relationship quality in Austria and Germany, this paper examines sexual behaviour in association with relationship status and sexual identity. Analysing data from a convenience sample of 4,709 respondents, of whom 24 per cent identified as LGBQA+, 2 per cent as non-binary, and 6 per cent as consensually non-monogamous, bivariate analysis found significant differences in social distancing, frequency of contact with sexual communities and satisfaction with current sex life. Text analysis of the survey's open-ended responses indicates monogamisation due to declined legitimacy of less conventional intimate arrangements during the pandemic. Findings point to the importance of the sexual morality that defined pandemic experiences in times of HIV for understanding normative pressure on intimate life during COVID-19.","Rothmüller, Barbara","Culture, health & sexuality",153,28

Limited data is available on the serological response in pediatric patients. Here we investigate the use of one manufacturer’s commercial assays for detecting IgM and IgG in an exclusively pediatric population. METHODS: Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays were performed on an Abbott Architect i1000. For specificity studies, we tested 78 patient specimens collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 66 specimens from patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For sensitivity we tested 181 specimens from 41 patients with a positive NAAT result. Precision data was acquired for 20 days. RESULTS: For IgM, the highest qualitative positive agreement with molecular results was observed to be 15 to 30 days after a positive NAAT result or after symptom onset. For IgG, the highest positive agreement was 31-60 days after a positive NAAT result or 61-90 days after the start of symptoms. IgM started to decline 30 days after NAAT results and faded by 90 days. IgG started to decrease 60 days after a positive NAAT result. CONCLUSION: The Abbott IgM and IgG assays have negative agreements of 98.7-100% relative to NAAT results. The IgM and IgG levels assayed by these methods start to decline months after positive molecular results and onset of symptoms in a pediatric population.","Interiano, Cristina; Muze, Sheicho; Turner, Brian; Gonzalez, Mark; Rogers, Beverly; Jerris, Robert; Weinzierl, Elizabeth; Elkhalifa, Mohamed; Leung-Pineda, Van",Pract Lab Med,153,26

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes high morbidity and mortality in piglets, is an enteropathogenic coronavirus with economic importance. Here, we demonstrated that both recombinant porcine IFN-L1 (rpIFN-L1) and rpIFN-L3 have powerful antiviral activity against PEDV infection of both Vero E6 cells and the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2). Both forms of rpIFN-L inhibited two genotypes of PEDV (strain CV777 of genotype 1 and strain LNCT2 of genotype 2). rpIFN-L1 primarily controlled viral infection in the early stage and had less antiviral activity in IPEC-J2 than in rpIFN-L3 cells infected with PEDV. In addition, rpIFN-L1 exhibited greater antiviral activity against PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells than that of porcine IFN-alpha. Consistent with this finding, rpIFN-L1 triggered higher levels of certain antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (ISG15, OASL, and MxA) in IPEC-J2 cells than porcine IFN-alpha. Although IPEC-J2 cells responded to both IFN-alpha and lambda, transcriptional profiling of ISGs (specifically ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITMs) differed when induced by either IFN-alpha or rpIFN-L. Therefore, our data provide the experimental evidence that porcine IFN-L suppresses PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells, which may offer a promising therapeutic for combating PED in piglets.","Li, Lin; Fu, Fang; Xue, Mei; Chen, Weiye; Liu, Jin; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Bu, Zhigao; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Antiviral Res,153,26

In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families. Finally, the results of the phage community analyses of these bats indicate a very diverse geographically distinct bat phage population, probably reflecting different diets and gut bacterial ecosystems.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Conceição-Neto, Nádia; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Vanhulle, Emiel; Maes, Piet; Van Ranst, Marc; Matthijnssens, Jelle",Virus Evol,153,24

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) seems to effectively prevent the formation of gallstones detectable by ultrasound after bariatric surgery. The aim of the UPGRADE trial is to provide evidence on the prophylactic use of UDCA in preventing symptomatic gallstone disease postoperatively. METHODS: The UPGRADE trial is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentre trial in patients with morbid obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Patients are randomly assigned to either UDCA 900 mg daily for 6 months or placebo treatment. This paper details the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of this trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of this trial is symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months after bariatric surgery, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary outcomes consist of the development of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months in the gallstone-negative group at baseline, presence of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24 months, number of cholecystectomies, side effects of UDCA, therapy compliance, quality of life, costs and revenues. Analyses will be completed according to this pre-specified SAP. The main analysis will be performed as a standard ITT analysis using the chi-squared test. DISCUSSION: The UPGRADE trial will show if prophylactic use of UDCA reduces the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery. Unforeseen deviations from the SAP at the time of analysis will be motivated and discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands Trial Register NL5954.

Its pathophysiology is still unclear. Using positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose [18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)], we explored the relationship between regional lung density and lung metabolism, as a reflection of lung neutrophilic infiltration during ACS. Patients were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study. Dual modality chest PET/computed tomography (CT) scans were performed, with (18)F-FDG emission scans for quantification of regional (18)F-FDG uptake and CT scans with radiocontrast agent to check for pulmonary artery thrombosis. Regional lung (18)F-FDG uptake was quantified in ACS patients and in SCD patients without ACS (SCD non-ACS controls). Maximal (SUVmax) and mean (SUVmean) standardized uptake values were computed. Seventeen patients with ACS (mean age 28.3 ± 6.4 years) were included. None died nor required invasive mechanical ventilation. The main lung opacity on CT scans was lower lobe consolidation. Lungs of patients with ACS exhibited higher SUVmax than those of SCD non-ACS controls (2.5 [2.1–2.9] vs 0.8 [0.6–1.0]; P < 0.0001). Regional SUVmax and SUVmean was higher in lower than in upper lobes of ACS patients (P < 0.001) with a significant correlation between lung density and SUVmax (R(2) = 0.78). SUVmean was higher in upper lobes of ACS patients than in lungs of SCD non-ACS controls (P < 0.001). Patients with SUVmax >2.5 had longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay than others (7 [6–11] vs 4 [3–6] days; P = 0.016). Lungs of patients with ACS exhibited higher (18)F-FDG uptake than SCD non-ACS controls. Lung apices had normal aeration and lower (18)F-FDG uptake than lung bases, but higher (18)F-FDG uptake than lungs of SCD non-ACS controls.

Although elective orthopaedic procedures were halted to prevent spread of the disease as well as sustain supplies of essential protective equipment and healthcare workers, trauma services were continued. We studied the orthopaedic trauma cases operated over 6 months of the pandemic, and discuss the protocols used to minimize disease spread. METHODS: Data was collected for all orthopaedic emergency cases operated at our centre from 1 st March – 10 th August 2020. During this time specific protocols were used for first aid, pre-operative care, inside the operation theatre, post-operative stay as well as for follow ups. RESULTS: A total of 851 patients were operated. A sharp decline in surgeries was seen during the lockdown. Average stay in the hospital was 4 days. Only 44% of the patients came for follow-up visits. None of the contacted patients or their relatives developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID after discharge. CONCLUSION: Multiple waves and various mutant strains of COVID-19 have made this pandemic longer than expected. Elective orthopaedic cases cannot be ignored for forever, as it leads to poor quality of life and an increasing burden of such patients. We suggest, that using the protocols used at our centre, we have successfully operated on cases without risking spread of the virus. Thus, we believe it’s time to reinstate elective orthopaedic procedures, in a phased manner.","Vatsya, Pulak; Mittal, Samarth; Trikha, Vivek; Sharma, Vijay; Malhotra, Rajesh",J Clin Orthop Trauma,153,26

Dentists, like many other health professionals, are at an increased risk of contracting the virus as they work in close proximity to patients, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Thus, in order for dentists to protect themselves and their patients, it is recommended that practitioners wear filtering facepiece 2 (FFP2) respirators. The prolonged use of these FFP2 respirators has been linked to several side effects. The aim of this paper is to assess the perceived experience associated with N95/FFP2 respirators based on the available literature and data collected through an online survey completed by Italian dental professionals. Articles were included up to May 2020 and literature searches were conducted through The National Library of Medicine, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases. The search terms included COVID-19, respirators, masks, and discomfort. An online survey was administered to 256 Italian dentists. The results from this survey were in agreement with the available literature. The findings concurred that the prolonged use of respirators was associated with headaches (47.5%), severe exertion and discomfort (50.8%), moderate concentration problems (54.3%), moderate breathing difficulties (63.5%), and consequently, an impaired work ability (85.5%). These findings were not influenced by the number of hours spent wearing the respirator. Despite several side effects, FFP2 respirators are fundamental in protecting dentists and their importance was acknowledged.","Farronato, Marco; Boccalari, Elisa; Del Rosso, Ettore; Lanteri, Valentina; Mulder, Riaan; Maspero, Cinzia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,153,6

We performed a timely analysis of the Bavarian telestroke TEMPiS “working diagnosis” database. METHODS: Twelve hospitals from the TEMPiS network were selected. Data collected for January through April in years 2017 through 2020 were extracted and analyzed for presumed and definite ischemic stroke (IS), amongst other disorders. In addition, recommendations for intravenous thrombolysis (rtPA) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) were noted and mobility data of the region analyzed. If statistically valid, group-comparison was tested with Fisher’s exact test considering unpaired observations and ap-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Upon lockdown in mid-March 2020, we observed a significant reduction in recommendations for rtPA compared to the preceding three years (14.7% [2017–2019] vs. 9.2% [2020], p = 0.0232). Recommendations for EVT were significantly higher in January to mid-March 2020 compared to 2017–2019 (5.4% [2017–2019] vs. 9.3% [2020], p = 0.0013) reflecting its increasing importance. Following the COVID-19 lockdown mid-March 2020 the number of EVT decreased back to levels in 2017–2019 (7.4% [2017–2019] vs. 7.6% [2020], p = 0.1719). Absolute numbers of IS decreased in parallel to mobility data. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced stroke incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic may in part be explained by patient avoidance to seek emergency stroke care and may have an association to population mobility. Increasing mobility may induce a rebound effect and may conflict with a potential second COVID-19 wave. Telemedical networks may be ideal databases to study such effects in near-real time.","Schlachetzki, Felix; Theek, Carmen; Hubert, Nikolai D; Kilic, Mustafa; Haberl, Roman L; Linker, Ralf A; Hubert, Gordian J",J Telemed Telecare,153,30

Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself. History of cancer was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death (among average age and BMI patients, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07–6.24; p<0.0001 in those with a smoking history and aOR=1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 – 1.76; p=0.04 in non-smokers). Among the cancer subgroup, prior use of chemotherapy within 2 weeks of admission was associated with in-hospital death (aOR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.05–2.80; p=0.03). Underlying CVD demonstrated a numerical but statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased mortality (aOR=1.18, 95% CI: 0.99 – 1.41; p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cancer history was a predictor of in-hospital mortality. Notably, among cancer patients, recent use of chemotherapy, but not underlying CVD itself, was associated with worse survival. These findings have important implications in cancer therapy considerations and vaccine distribution in cancer patients with and without underlying CVD and CVD risk factors.","Tehrani, David; Wang, Xiaoyan; Rafique, Asim M.; Hayek, Salim S; Herrmann, Joerg; Neilan, Tomas G.; Desai, Pooja; Morgans, Alicia; Lopez-Mattei, Juan; Parikh, Rushi V.; Yang, Eric H.",Res Sq,153,2

METHOD Pearson correlation and generalized additive modeling were performed to assess the relationships between daily new COVID-19 cases and meteorological factors (daily average temperature and relative humidity) with the most updated data currently available. RESULTS The Pearson correlation showed that daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 were more correlated with the average temperature than with relative humidity. Daily new confirmed cases were negatively correlated with the average temperature in Beijing (r=-0.565, P<0.01), Shanghai (r=-0.471, P<0.01), and Guangzhou (r=-0.530, P<0.01) , yet in contrast, positively correlated with that in Japan (r=0.441, P<0.01). In most of the cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur), generalized additive modeling analysis showed the number of daily new confirmed cases was positively associated with both average temperature and relative humidity, especially in lagged 3d model, where a positive influence of temperature on the daily new confirmed cases was discerned in 5 cities except in Beijing, Wuhan, Korea, and Malaysia. Nevertheless, the results were inconsistent across cities and lagged time, suggesting meteorological factors were unlikely to greatly influence the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION The associations between meteorological factors and the number of COVID-19 daily cases are inconsistent across cities and lagged time. Large-scale public health measures and expanded regional research are still required until a vaccine becomes available and herd immunity is established.","He, Zonglin; Chin, Yiqiao; Huang, Jian; He, Yi; Akinwunmi, Babatunde O.; Yu, Shinning; Zhang, Casper J.P.; Ming, Wai-kit",,153,6

In this report, we describe our experience in screening for SARS-CoV-2 prior to semiurgent and urgent hospital procedures. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: A single tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Our study cohort included patients ≥18 years of age who had semiurgent or urgent hospital procedures or surgeries. METHODS: Overall, 625 patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of phone questionnaire (7 days prior to the anticipated procedure), RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients, 520 scans (83.2%) were interpreted as normal; 1 (0.16%) had typical features of COVID-19; 18 scans (2.88%) had indeterminate features of COVID-19; and 86 (13.76%) had atypical features of COVID-19. In total, 640 RT-PCRs were performed, with 1 positive result (0.15%) in a patient with a CT scan that yielded an atypical finding. Of the 18 patients with chest CTs categorized as indeterminate, 5 underwent repeat negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab 1 week after their initial swab. Also, 1 patient with a chest CT categorized as typical had a follow-up repeat negative RT-PCR, indicating that the chest CT was likely a false positive. After surgery, none of the patients developed signs or symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 that would indicate the need for a repeated RT-PCR or CT scan. CONCLUSION: In our experience, chest CT scanning did not prove provide valuable information in detecting asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in our low-prevalence population.","Shah, Aditya S.; Walkoff, Lara A.; Kuzo, Ronald S.; Callstrom, Matthew R.; Brown, Michael J.; Kendrick, Michael L.; Narr, Bradly J.; Berbari, Elie",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,153,9

Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.","Palencia Herrejón, E.; González Díaz, G.; Mancebo Cortés, J.",Medicina Intensiva (English Edition),153,28

COVID‐19 risk‐prediction models include a history of VTE. However, it is unclear whether remote history (>9 years previously) of VTE also confers increased risk of COVID‐19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate possible association between VTE and COVID‐19 severity, independent of other risk factors. METHODS: Cohort study of UK Biobank participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Baseline data, including history of VTE, were linked to COVID‐19 test results, COVID‐19‐related hospital admissions, and COVID‐19 deaths. The risk of COVID‐19 hospitalization or death was compared for participants with a remote history VTE versus without. Poisson regression models were run univariately then adjusted stepwise for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and comorbid covariates. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders and comorbid conditions, remote history of VTE was associated with nonfatal community (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02–2.54, p = .039), nonfatal hospitalized (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06–2.17, p = .024) and severe (hospitalized or fatal) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89, p = .025) COVID‐19. Associations with remote history of VTE were stronger among men (severe COVID‐19: RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–2.42, p = .009) than for women (severe COVID‐19: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.66–1.74, p = .786). CONCLUSION: Our findings support inclusion of remote history of VTE in COVID‐19 risk‐prediction scores, and consideration of sex‐specific risk scores.","Anderson, Jana J.; Ho, Frederick K.; Niedzwiedz, Claire L.; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Celis‐Morales, Carlos; Iliodromiti, Stamatina; Welsh, Paul; Pellicori, Pierpaolo; Demou, Evangelia; Hastie, Claire E.; Lyall, Donald M.; Gray, Stuart R.; Forbes, John F.; Gill, Jason M.

As Natech disasters occur with low frequency, those in charge of facilities should learn lessons from past cases to prepare for situations in the future in which they may have to respond to a potentially catastrophic event for the first time. This paper describes three Natech cases triggered by the heavy rainfall in Japan in 2018. One resulted in violent explosions, one showed consequences half a year later, and the other managed to avoid a catastrophic situation by preparation based on prior analysis of possible damage. The lessons which can be learnt are as follows: Undertake measures based on the hazardous conditions of materials and possible reactions; Avoid normalcy bias for improved decision-making; Identify slow developing and lagging Natech consequences; Prepare and intensify safeguards to avoid possible damage based on risk analysis; Consider employees’ safety in returning to their homes; Collect micro information and aggregate it; Provide current information about the situation to stakeholders; Plan resources required for recovery activities.

Studies suggest that weight loss of patients undergoing bariatric surgery was equally affected. The aim was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on weight loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and nutritional status at 1-year follow-up after gastric bypass (GB). METHODS: Retrospective observational case–control study of patients undergoing primary GB in a tertiary referral Belgian center. COVID-19 period group was composed by those whose 1-year postoperative period was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: from October 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. The control group was composed of patients operated from October 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. Electronic clinical records were reviewed searching: baseline characteristics, weight and comorbidities evolution, and biochemical values. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients in the COVID-19 period group and 66 in the non-COVID-19 period group were analyzed. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. A reduced weight loss was observed at 1-year follow-up, in terms of percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) (82.4% [SD: 21.6] vs. 82.4% [SD: 21.6]; p: 0.043) and body mass index (BMI) (27.8 kg/m(2) [IQR: 25.8–30.0] vs. 26.2 kg/m(2) [IQR: 24.6–28.6]; p: 0.029) for COVID-19 period group vs. non-COVID-19 period group, respectively. There was a similar reduction of obesity-related comorbidities, without clinically significant differences in the nutritional follow-up. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown had an impact on weight loss at 1-year follow-up after gastric bypass.

The dsRNAs were extracted from symptomless pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh] plants cv. Erra Kandulu. This new virus with 4.64 kb genome was tentatively named Arhar cryptic virus-1 (ArCV-1). The genomic RNAs were amplified and characterized by sequence independent single primer amplification. The dsRNAs shared a highly conserved 16 nt 5’ non-coding region (5’-GATAATGATCCAAGGA-3’). The largest dsRNA (dsRNA-1) was identified as the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), predicted to encode a putative 55.34 kDa protein (P1). The two other smaller dsRNAs (dsRNA-2 and dsRNA-3) predicted to encode for putative capsid proteins of 38.50kDa (P2) and 38.51kDa (P3), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ArCV-1 formed a clade together with Fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus, Rosa multiflora cryptic virus and Rose cryptic virus-1, indicating that ArCV-1 could be a new member of the genus Deltapartitivirus. ArCV-1 3D(pol) structure revealed several interesting features. The 3D(pol) in its full-length shares structural similarities with members of the family Caliciviridaeand family Picornaviridae. In addition, fourth dsRNA molecule (dsRNA-2A), not related to ArCV-1 genome, was found in the same plant tissue. The dsRNA-2A (1.6 kb) encodes a protein (P4), with a predicted size of 44.5 kDa. P4 shares similarity with coat protein genes of several cryptic viruses, in particular the bipartite cryptic viruses including Raphanus sativus cryptic virus-3. This is the first report of occurrence of a cryptic virus in pigeonpea plants.","Kumar, Surender; Subbarao, Burra L.; Kumari, Reenu; Hallan, Vipin",PLoS One,153,3

To study the biological properties of the cells involved in this repair process, glial cells were isolated and cultured from spinal cords of these young adult mice during demyelination and remyelination. Using three-color immunofluorescence combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, we have analyzed the antigenic phenotype and mitotic potential of individual glial cells. We identified oligodendrocytes with an antibody to galactocerebroside, astrocytes with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein, and oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells with the O4 antibody. Cultures from demyelinated tissue differed in several ways from those of age-matched controls: first, the total number of O-2A lineage cells was strikingly increased; second, the O-2A population consisted of a higher proportion of O4-positive astrocytes and cells of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype; and third, all the cell types within the O-2A lineage showed enhanced proliferation. This proliferation was not further enhanced by adding PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the defined medium. However, bFGF and IGF-I seemed to influence the fate of O-2A lineage cells in cultures of demyelinated tissue. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of cells expressing galactocerebroside. In contrast, IGF-I increased the relative proportion of oligodendrocytes. Thus, O-2A lineage cells from adult mice display greater phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential in response to an episode of demyelination. These properties may be linked to the efficient remyelination achieved in this demyelinating disease.",,J Cell Biol,153,1

The present pandemic circumstances present us with unique challenges. False negatives in current testing methodology are to be expected.[1] Thus, a rigorous and contextual interpretation of a negative test result is necessary. Blood hypercoagulability and the risk of thrombosis are well documented in cases of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.[2] The systemic inflammatory response is associated with endothelial upregulation of proinflammatory mediators that lead to in situ thrombi, as well as a generalized disseminated intravascular coagulation. As many as 31% of ICU patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have thrombotic complications. More specifically, cerebral thrombotic complications confined to the arterial bed have been well described.[3, 4]. The case described shows that milder forms of coronavirus infection may lead to other types of critical and unusual thrombotic complications. An otherwise healthy 47-year-old Caucasian woman developed fever and respiratory signs and symptoms consistent with a possible case of COVID-19 infection in late March of 2020. Interstitial opacities were seen on radiographic examination. Two COVID-19 PCR nasopharyngeal tests were negative, and she recovered at home over the following 2 weeks. Three weeks later, she developed headaches, expressive aphasia, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was treated for a possible ischemic stroke with alteplase thrombolysis at a local hospital. After subsequent transfer and evaluation, a diagnosis of a left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis with adjacent cortical edema was made. On review of her history, the patient denied taking any form of hormonal contraception, and did not have personal, or family history indicative of thrombophilia. She recovered fully after anticoagulation with enoxaparin and subsequent dabigatran. Prior to discharge a COVID-19, IgG antibody test was reported as positive. Decontextualized and overly simplistic interpretation of COVID-19 negative tests amidst a pandemic is problematic. In addition to the obvious infection control issues associated with the resulting lack of isolation and contract tracing, it may deprive some patients of the opportunity to receive antithrombotic therapy. Prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for hospitalized patients are in evolution, and have been associated with improved clinical outcomes.[5] We are aware that the role of anticoagulation in outpatient cases is not well studied, but we believe it deserves proper investigation.

The aim of this study was to assess which factors are associated with higher self-evaluations of training on infection prevention and control (IPC) and higher self-assessment of IPC practices used by HCWs regarding COVID-19 in University Hospital in Krakow, Poland, in January 2021. Material and methods This was an online survey on the preparedness for COVID-19 epidemic of medical/non-medical staff and medical students. Questions included in the survey concerned participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, hospital staff involvement in the training, knowledge about the hand hygiene, and adherence to IPC measures. Knowledge and Performance Index (K&PI) based on selected questions was constructed for to reflect both subjective (self-evaluation) of preparedness and objective IPC knowledge and skills of HCWs participated in the IPC training. Results A total of 1412 health care workers, including 129 medical students, participated in the study. The largest group, 53.6%, was made up of nurses and paramedics. Age of respondents significantly correlated with knowledge of IPC and with K&PI. The mean age of workers with high K&PI was 42.39 ± 12.53, and among those with low, 39.71 ± 13.10, p < 0.001. 51% UHK workers participated in IPC training, but 11.3% of physicians, 28.8% of other HCWs, and 55.8% of students did not know the IPC standard precaution. Most participants, 72.3%, felt that they had received sufficient training; however, 45.8% of students declined this. There was no correlation between self-reported preparedness and the K&PI, indicating that self-reported preparedness was inadequate for knowledge and skills. Nurses and paramedics assessed their knowledge most accurately. Participants with low K&PI and high subjective evaluation constituted a substantial group in all categories. Students least often overestimated (23.8%) and most often (9.6%) underestimated their knowledge and skills. Conclusions Our study revealed inadequate IPC practice, especially as it refers to the training programme. We confirmed the urgent need of including theory and practice of IPC in curricula of health professions’ training in order to provide students with knowledge and skills necessary not only for future pandemic situations but also for everyday work.","Żółtowska, Barbara; Barańska, Ilona; Szczerbińska, Katarzyna; Różańska, Anna; Mydel, Krzysztof; Sydor, Wojciech; Heczko, Piotr B.; Jachowicz, Estera; Wójkowska-Mach, Jadwiga",J Clin Med,153,9

We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and virological course of non-severe COVID-19 patients with or without symptoms who were admitted to a Chinese cabin hospital. In this retrospective single center study, we reviewed 252 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients treated at one temporary cabin hospital in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, serial chest computed tomography (CT), and serial viral test data were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The association between clinical features and symptomatic status or patient referral status was analyzed. Among all 252 patients, 74 (29.4%) were asymptomatic and 138 (54.76%) had more than two family members who developed COVID-19. The probability for family clustering was similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (59.70 vs. 61.64%, P = 0.79). Asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients were equally likely to reach a virus-free state during their stay at the cabin hospital (93.15 vs. 86.44%, P = 0.13). The initial chest CT screening showed that 81 (32.1%) patients had no visible pneumonia, 52 (20.6%) had unilateral pneumonia, and 119 (47.2%) had bilateral pneumonia. Symptomatic patients had a higher chance to have bilateral pneumonia (P < 0.0001) and were less likely to show improvement on the follow-up CT scan (P = 0.0002). In total, 69 (27.4%) patients were referred to the designated hospital and only 23 (9.1%) patients were referred due to the progression of pneumonia.

Nearly all Universities around the globe were affected. Further, young people and University students in particular, are known to be vulnerable for developing mental disorders. This study aims to examine the mental health social and emotional well-being and perceived burdens of University students during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Germany. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional and anonymous online survey among University students assessed mental health status with standardized measures (depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug consumption, and eating disorder symptoms), attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived burdens, and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support, perceived stress, loneliness, and self-efficacy). Results: In total, N = 3,382 German University students participated. Nearly half of the students (49%) reported that they are worried or very much worried about the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority supports the governmental lockdown measures (85%). A Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) sum score of 10 or above, indicating clinically relevant depressive symptoms, was reported by 37% (n = 1,249). The PHQ-9 sum score was on average 8.66 (SD = 5.46). Suicidal thoughts were indicated by 14.5% of the participants. Levels of depressive symptoms differed significantly for the different self-rated income changes during the pandemic (increase, decrease, no change in income). Further, levels of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation differed significantly for students from different faculties. Multiple regression analyses revealed that not being a parent, having no indirect social contact one or two times a week, higher perceived stress, higher experienced loneliness, lower social support, and lower self-efficacy significantly predicted higher scores of depressive symptoms, also higher hazardous alcohol use, and higher levels of eating disorder symptoms. Other aspects of lifestyle such as social and cultural activities, dating, and hobbies were reported to be negatively affected during the pandemic. Conclusion: The present study implies that University students are vulnerable and due to elevated depressive symptoms at risk, being hit hard by the pandemic, but are in general coping adaptively. Low-threshold online interventions promoting help-seeking and also targeting various mental health conditions might bridge the gap the COVID-19 pandemic opened up recently.","Kohls, Elisabeth; Baldofski, Sabrina; Moeller, Raiko; Klemm, Sarah-Lena; Rummel-Kluge, Christine",Front Psychiatry,153,26

Here we perform force spectroscopy studies on living bacteria to unravel the molecular mechanism of this interaction. We discover that the presence of all three binding partners leads to very high binding forces (2000 pN), largely outperforming other known ternary complexes involving adhesins. Strikingly, our experiments indicate that a direct interaction involving features of the dock, lock and latch mechanism must occur between ClfA and vWF to sustain the extreme tensile strength of the ternary complex. Our results support a previously undescribed mechanism whereby vWbp activates a direct, ultra-strong interaction between ClfA and vWF. This intriguing interaction represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions, including synthetic peptides inhibiting the ultra-strong interactions between ClfA and its ligands.","Viljoen, Albertus; Viela, Felipe; Mathelié-Guinlet, Marion; Missiakas, Dominique; Pietrocola, Giampiero; Speziale, Pietro; Dufrêne, Yves F.",Commun Biol,153,20

As rhinovirus seemed to spread despite the restrictions, we aimed to analyze rhinovirus epidemiology in children during the pandemic. This register‐based study used data from the Finnish Infectious Disease Register. Nationwide rhinovirus findings from July 2015 to March 2021 were included and stratified by age (0–4, 5–9, and 10–14). Cumulative 14‐day incidence per 100000 children was calculated. Four thousand five hundred and seventy six positive rhinovirus findings were included, of which 3788 (82.8%) were among children aged 0–4. The highest recorded incidence was 36.2 among children aged 0–4 in October 2017. The highest recorded incidence during the pandemic period was 13.6 in November 2020. The impact of the restrictions was mostly seen among children aged 0–4 years of age in weeks 14–22 in 2020. The incidence has since remained near reference levels in all age groups. Strict restrictions temporarily interrupted the circulation of rhinovirus in spring 2020. Rhinovirus incidence returned to normal levels soon after the harsh restrictions were lifted. These looser social restrictions prevented RSV and influenza seasons but failed to prevent the spread of rhinovirus.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Artama, Miia; Haapanen, Marjut; Renko, Marjo",J Med Virol,153,1

This study is a retrospective cohort study in which consultation data were collected from a COVID-19 follow-up health consultation program. The studied population was selected from patients who recovered after quarantine and treatment for COVID-19 in Daegu City and in Gyeongsangbukdo province, Korea, from March to June 2020. The healthcare providers comprised 20 family-medicine specialists who consulted and educated the patients through phone calls in accordance with structured guidelines. Physical and mental status before and after recovery were compared among patients who received a single consultation and those who received two or more consultations. A total of 1604 subjects were selected for the final analysis. Of these, 1145 (71.4%) had one consultation and 459 (28.6%) had two or more. The group that had two or more consultations reported significantly more physical symptoms, more psychological symptoms (including depression), and more psychological stress. Multivariate forward selection logistic regression analysis showed that re-confirmed cases of COVID-19, physical symptoms after quarantine, feelings of depression, and psychological stress had a significant effect on the number of consultations received. In conclusion, COVID-19 has various physical and mental sequelae after discharge from quarantine.

Our goal was to illustrate the diversity and beauty of fungal plant pathogens through a naturalist approach that could be followed by any amateur. We achieved this end through “phytopathological strolls”, in which we observed and determined the origin of symptoms on diseased plants found in our garden, in the local streets, and in nearby open spaces, and shared this matter with a broad public. The lockdown imposed in France created an additional motivation to take up the challenge, and to involve our children, even under strong constraints such as movement restrictions. We observed and described fungal pathogens through hundreds of photographs, shared our findings with a large audience on Twitter, and received feedback. The material used was deliberately simple and transportable: a digital reflex camera, an old microscope, a mobile phone, some books, and an internet connection. Between 17 March 2020 and 20 June 2021 we found 196 plant pathogens, including 97 rusts, 27 powdery mildews, and 28 septoria‐like diseases. We discuss here the importance of promoting searches for plant pathogens, their description and conservation, through a combination of classical approaches and digital tools in tune with the times, such as Twitter, by treating pathogen identification like a detective game and, more surprisingly, by making use of the addictive nature of collection approaches, drawing a parallel with Pokémon GO.","Suffert, Frédéric; Suffert, Muriel",Plant Pathol,153,21

There are limited therapeutic options with bad prognostic outcome. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow on Bleomycin (BLM) induced lung fibrosis in albino rats. METHODS: 30 adult female albino rats were distributed randomly into 4 groups; negative control group, Bleomycin induced lung fibrosis group, lung fibrosis treated with bone marrow-MSCs (BM-MSCs) and lung fibrosis treated with cell free media. Lung fibrosis was induced with a single dose of intratracheal instillation of BLM. BM-MSCs or cell free media were injected intravenously 28 days after induction and rats were sacrificed after another 28 days for assessment. Minute respiratory volume (MRV), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) were recorded using spirometer (Power lab data acquisition system). Histological assessment was performed by light microscopic examination of H&E, and Masson’s trichrome stained sections and was further supported by morphometric studies. In addition, electron microscopic examination to assess ultra-structural changes was done. Confocal Laser microscopy and PCR were used as tools to ensure MSCs homing in the lung. RESULTS: Induction of lung fibrosis was confirmed by histological examination, which revealed disorganized lung architecture, thickened inter-alveolar septa due excessive collagen deposition together with inflammatory cellular infiltration. Moreover, pneumocytes depicted variable degenerative changes. Reduction in MRV, FVC and FEV1 were recorded. BM-MSCs treatment showed marked structural improvement with minimal cellular infiltration and collagen deposition and hence restored lung architecture, together with lung functions. CONCLUSION: MSCs are promising potential therapy for lung fibrosis that could restore the normal structure and function of BLM induced lung fibrosis.

Feasibility in the clinical and research setting,15.947179,6.2539573,2021-10-31,"Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the practice of hand and upper extremity surgeons. Methods We assessed how the pandemic affected the practice on multiple fronts including professional, personal, and practice aspects. The survey was conducted through an online questionnaire that had six sections: demographics, clinic, elective surgery, emergency surgery, urgent surgery, and human resources. The survey was sent to 586 Kleinert Society members who are all practicing hand and upper extremity surgeons. Results We received 35 responses from the United States and 53 from the rest of the world. Based on our findings, the clinic volume was reduced by >50% in the early stages, subsequently returning to a level that was 25-50% lower than pre-COVID-19 times in later stages. A corresponding decrease in elective surgeries was also noted. The need for preoperative COVID-19 tests added to the logistics of surgery, causing delays of three to six hours for emergency cases and >24 hours for urgent cases. The hand surgeons witnessed multiple furloughs, layoffs, and even COVID-19 infections among nursing and support staff. Most hand surgeons continued to perform urgent and emergency surgeries during the pandemic. The application of telemedicine was not popular and had multiple drawbacks. Hand surgeons are modifying their practice by adopting measures such as social distancing, reducing the clinic volume, and using personal protective equipment (PPE). Conclusions As COVID-19 is likely to prevail for the foreseeable future, these measures are here to stay. The initial reduction in the clinic and elective volume has improved but has not reached pre-COVID-19 levels, suggesting a slow recovery. As reopening measures will lead to more people rejoining employment, subsequently, more patients with hand-related conditions are likely to present to the clinics. Rapid COVID-19 testing and supply of PPEs will play a crucial role in the near future to enable hand surgeons to continue their service while taking care of their personal health.","Qazi, Uzair A; Sutton, Julianne; Farner, Scott C; Bhandari, Laxminarayan",Cureus,153,16

There is very limited data regarding ASIA syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to report cases of subacute thyroiditis related to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of three cases of subacute thyroiditis after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac®). Three female healthcare workers have applied to our clinic with anterior neck pain and fatigue four to seven days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Two of them were in the breastfeeding period. They were negative for thyroid antibodies, and there was no previous history of thyroid disease or upper respiratory tract infection, or COVID-19. Laboratory test results and imaging findings were consistent with subacute thyroiditis. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can lead to subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis may develop within a few days after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Being in the postpartum period may be a facilitating factor for the development of ASIA syndrome after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of subacute thyroiditis as a phenomenon of ASIA syndrome after inactivated COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should be aware that subacute thyroiditis may develop as a manifestation of ASIA syndrome after the inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","İremli, Burçin Gönül; Şendur, Süleyman Nahit; Ünlütürk, Uğur",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,153,1

We reviewed the recommendations on the recent guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention infection control practices for dentistry, American Dental Association, and the World Health Organization. According to the available evidence, COVID-19 may have a negative impact on the oral health due to the infection itself and due to various other consequences such as therapeutic measures, xerostomia, and other complications of the COVID-19. In light of the above facts, dentists should be wary of the disease, its identification, mode of spread and impacts on the oral health. The dental personnel have been identified as at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 due to cross infection from contact with their patients and aerosols generated in routine dental procedures. As such, they should be aware of the modifications that need to be made to the practice to prevent transmission of the disease.

S100A9 inhibited PRRSV replication via cellular Ca(2+) dependent manner. The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein co-localized with S100A9 in the cytoplasm, and directly interacted at amino acid 78 of S100A9 and amino acids 36–37 of N protein. Moreover, we also found that the mutant S100A9 (E78Q) protein exhibited decreased antiviral activity against PRRSV compared with the parent S100A9. Recombinant PRRSV rBB (36/37) with two mutations in amino acid 36–37 in the N protein exhibited greater replication than the parent PRRSV BB0907 in S100A9-overexpressed PAM and Marc-145 cells.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to synthesize evidence concerning otolaryngology during COVID‐19 pandemic. It presents a review of currently existing guidelines and recommendations concerning otolaryngological procedures and surgeries during COVID-19 pandemic, and provides a collective summary of all crucial information for otolaryngologists. It summarizes data concerning COVID-19 transmission, diagnosis, and clinical presentation highlighting the information significant for otolaryngologists. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without time limit using terms ‘‘COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” in conjunction with “head and neck surgery”, “otorhinolaryngological manifestations”. RESULTS: Patients in stable condition should be consulted using telemedicine options. Only emergency consultations and procedures should be performed during COVID-19 pandemic. Mucosa-involving otolaryngologic procedures are considered high risk procedures and should be performed using enhanced PPE (N95 respirator and full face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable gloves, surgical cap, gown, shoe covers).

BACKGROUND: Contaminated environmental surfaces have been associated with outbreaks of healthcare-associated illness (HAIs). One in every 20 patients in U.S. acute care hospitals acquire a healthcare-associated illness, leading to consequences such as elevated morbidity, mortality, and a decrease in quality of life. In the patient environment, MRSA can remain viable from hours to up to 14 days. METHODS: Environmental surface materials were evaluated as new and worn. Material composition and properties were assessed to evaluate surface integrity and the influence on the disinfection of MRSA. Inoculated materials were used to assess MRSA viability over time and the efficacy of a manufacturer’s recommended cleaning and disinfection product compared to a novel disinfectant. RESULTS: Environmental surface materials respond differently in appearance and roughness, when mechanically worn. When measuring MRSA survival, at 24 hr, MRSA colony forming unit (CFU) counts were reduced on the copper sheet surface and solid surface with cupric oxide. By 72 hr, all MRSA counts were zero. Bleach and the novel disinfectant were equally effective at disinfecting MRSA from all surface types. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a gap in knowledge about the impact of type and wear of environmental surface materials used in healthcare environments on contamination with epidemiologically important organisms.

We use data on 11,340 respondents, living in six European countries (Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Czech Republic) who completed survey questionnaires during the first months of the pandemic. We used a fixed‐effect approach, which included individual and macro‐level variables. The findings suggest that a high proportion of people suffering from depression and heightened risk perception is positively associated with reporting depressive symptoms, even if this relationship varies significantly between countries. Moreover, the association is moderated by contextual factors including health‐care expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, hospital beds for acute care, and number of medical specialists per head of population.

There is compelling evidence that the primary immunoevasive strategy utilized by the SARS virus, like influenza, is to inhibit its host's corticosteroid stress response. This is accomplished by viral expression of amino acid sequences that are molecular mimics of the host's adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). When the host produces antibodies against these viral antigens, the antibodies also bind to the host's own ACTH, which limits the host's stress response by interfering with ACTH's ability to stimulate the secretion of corticosteroids. This inadequate corticosteroid response provokes symptoms as a result of a relative adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment with corticosteroids can relieve the patient's symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency and give them the corticosteroid levels needed to fight their infection. Similarly, by taking moderate daily doses of corticosteroids as a prophylactic, it may be possible to avoid clinical infection with SARS. If SARS's ACTH mimic strategy never has an opportunity to get started, SARS's ability to evade its host's immune system while its viral load is low will be significantly impaired. In this article, amino acid sequences from the SARS and influenza viruses representing likely homology to human ACTH are identified. Evidence demonstrating that ACTH autoantibodies are produced during influenza infection is also presented. Early treatment with corticosteroids should lower the dose necessary to counteract SARS's ACTH autoantibody mechanism. If corticosteroid treatment is delayed until inflammatory cytokine levels are causing serious injury, only high doses of corticosteroids are likely to be effective.","Wheatland, R.",Med Hypotheses,153,20

In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown period (March–May 2020) on snacking behavior, fast-food and alcohol consumption. A systematic search in PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases was conducted and 32 studies were included. Changes in snacking, in fast-food and ordered food consumption and in alcohol intake were examined. Snacking was found to be increased for a significant portion of the population examined (18.9–45.1%), whereas fast food (15.0–41.3%) and ordered food (33.9%) showed a tendency towards decrease. As per alcohol consumption, an upward trend was observed in a significant part (10.4–51.0%) of the participants examined. The increased snacking and alcohol consumption observed for almost a third of the examined population could be alarming because long-term health problems could arise in cases of repeated lockdowns in the future. The observed downward trend in fast-food consumption and in frequency of ordered food could be an encouraging sign of turning to home-prepared foods, but further research is needed in this field.","Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T.; Jayawardena, Ranil; Chourdakis, Michail",Clin Nutr,153,2

METHODS: Data were collected from N = 777 German schoolchildren (aged 9–17 years) at two assessments before and one assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Participants self-reported chronic pain experience, anxiety, depression, and quality of life across all assessments; and COVID-19-related experiences at the last assessment. Trajectories of anxiety, depression, and quality of life as well as COVID-19-related experiences were analyzed separately for groups of stable chronic pain trajectories compared to chronic pain trajectories that changed during the pandemic. RESULTS: Chronic pain prevalence was lowest at the assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic (22.8% vs. 29.2% and 29.9% before the pandemic). However, 4.6% experienced new chronic pain onset during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was preceded by heightened depression and anxiety, as well as lowered quality of life scores. These students were also more likely to describe time with their family during the COVID-19 pandemic as tense compared to students who did not develop chronic pain. During the COVID-19 pandemic boys were more likely to recover from ongoing chronic pain than girls. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, during the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of chronic pain decreased. However, stressful situations and pre-existing vulnerabilities in psychological wellbeing can facilitate the development of chronic pain during the pandemic.","Rau, Lisa-Marie; Grothus, Susanne; Sommer, Ariane; Grochowska, Kamila; Claus, Benedikt B.; Zernikow, Boris; Wager, Julia",J Adolesc Health,153,1

The present study aimed to fill this gap by combining laboratory-based, computational and ecological assessments. Healthy individuals performed the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) before and after the induction of PC or a waiting period. Computational modeling was applied to dissociate the effects of PC on reward sensitivity and learning rate. Afterwards, participants underwent a one-week ecological momentary assessment of daily PC occurrence, as well as anticipatory and consummatory reward-related behavior. Induction of PC led to increased response bias on the PRT compared to waiting, likely due to an increase in learning rate but not in reward sensitivity, as suggested by computational modeling. In daily-life, PC increased the discrepancy between expected and obtained rewards (i.e., prediction error). Current converging experimental and ecological evidence suggests that PC is associated with abnormalities in the functionality of positive valence systems. Given the role of PC in the prediction, maintenance, and recurrence of psychopathology, it would be clinically valuable to extend research on this topic beyond the negative valence systems.","Schettino, Martino; Ghezzi, Valerio; Ang, Yuen-Siang; Duda, Jessica M.; Fagioli, Sabrina; Mennin, Douglas S.; Pizzagalli, Diego A.; Ottaviani, Cristina",Brain Sci,153,20

To address this issue, re-use of surgical face masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended; prior decontamination is paramount to their re-use. AIM: We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. METHODS: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, UV irradiation, vaporised H(2)O(2), and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. FINDINGS: UV irradiation, vaporised H(2)O(2) and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporised H(2)O(2) and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the FDA policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilisation in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Wielick, Constance; Dams, Lorène; Nauwynck, Hans; Demeuldre, Pierre-Francois; Napp, Aurore; Laperre, Jan; Haubruge, Eric; Thiry, Etienne",J Hosp Infect,153,30

Le diagnostic positif peut en être difficile. Les résultats cliniques chez 116 enfants hospitalisés en raison d’une infection adénovirale ont été repris rétrospectivement. Chez 71 enfants, le diagnostic virologique a été obtenu par immunofluorescence directe sur les aspirations nasales, 71 par culture virale de ces mêmes prélèvements. Le tableau clinique de l’infection adénovirale est caractérisé par une fièvre élevée (moyenne 39°1C) et prolongée (durée moyenne 4,3 jours). L’atteinte des voies aériennes supérieures (rhinopharyngite, angine, otite) et des voies aériennes inférieures (bronchite, bronchiolite, pneumopathie) sont les plus fréquentes. Douze enfants ont présenté des convulsions hyperpyrétiques, 6 avaient une méningite lymphocytaire. Les examens complémentaires ont objectivé des valeurs allant de la normalité à celles évocatrices d’infection bactérienne. Cinquante-neuf enfants furent adressés pour fièvre résistante à une antibiothérapie. Les symptômes de l’atteinte respiratoire dues aux infections adénovirales s’étendent de la rhinite à la pneumopathie et la bronchiolite. Les adénovirus peuvent entraîner des séquelles graves même chez l’enfant sain.

Abstract Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness; however, depending on the infecting serotype, they may also cause various other diseases. Diagnosis may be difficult to achieve. The clinical findings for 116 children hospitalised with adenoviral infection were studied retrospectively. In 71 children, the diagnosis was based on detection of adenovirus antigen in the nasopharyngeal specimens and in 71 children on viral culture. The clinical picture of adenoviral infection was characterised by high-grade (mean 39°1C) and prolonged fever (mean duration 4,3 days). Upper respiratory and lower respiratory symptoms were the most common infections. Twelve had been admitted to the hospital due to febrile convulsions, 6 had meningitis. Laboratory findings varied from normal values to values seen in bacterial infections. Thus it was difficult to distinguish adenoviral disease from a bacterial disease. Fifty-nine children were referred to the hospital due to infection unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. Symptoms of respiratory infection caused by adenovirus may range from the common cold syndrome to pneumonia, croup and bronchiolitis. Adenoviruses can be responsible for severe consequences, even in previously healthy children. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of viral infections of the airways could provide important insights into the nature of the inflammatory process involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most infections are mild and require no therapy or only symptomatic treatment. There are at present time no recognised antiviral agents that are effective in treating serious adenovirus disease. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen in nasopharygeal specimens proved to have a great clinical value in the diagnosis.","Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Bach, N.; Toutain, F.; Duhamel, J.

This article reviews how Taiwan strengthened the core capacities at the Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) and the Port of Kaohsiung (PoK) by applying a new, practicable model. DESIGN: An IHR PoE program was initiated for implementing the IHR core capacities at designated PoEs. The main methods of this program were 1) identifying the designated PoEs according to the pre-determined criteria, 2) identifying the competent authority for each health measure, 3) building a close collaborative relationship between stakeholders from the central and PoE level, 4) designing three stages of systematic assessment using the assessment tool published by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 5) undertaking action plans targeting the gaps identified by the assessments. RESULTS: Results of the self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment revealed a continuous progressive trend at the TIA (86, 91, and 100%, respectively), and at the PoK (77, 97, and 99.9%, respectively). The results of the follow-up external assessment indicated that both these designated PoEs already conformed to the IHR requirements. These achievements were highly associated with strong collaboration, continuous empowerment, efficient resource integration, and sustained commitments. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that many countries had requested for an extension on the deadline to fulfill the IHR 2005 core capacity requirements, Taiwan's experiences can be a source of learning for countries striving to fully implement these requirements. Further, in order to broaden the scope of public health protection into promoting global security, Taiwan will keep its commitments on multisectoral cooperation, human resource capacity building, and maintaining routine and emergency capacities.","Chiu, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsieh, Jui-Wei; Wu, Yi-Chun; Chou, Jih-Haw; Chang, Feng-Yee",Glob Health Action,153,3

While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The ‘wet’ or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the ‘dry’ or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem may be difficult, if not impossible. The background of the cat, its history, the clinical signs, laboratory changes, antibody titres and effusion analysis should all be used to help in decision-making about further diagnostic procedures. At the time of writing, there is no non-invasive confirmatory test available for cats without effusion. Disease management In most cases FIP is fatal. Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of corticosteroids. Vaccination recommendations At present, only one (intranasal) FIP vaccine is available, which is considered as being non-core. Kittens may profit from vaccination when they have not been exposed to FCoV (eg, in an early-weaning programme), particularly if they enter a FCoV-endemic environment.","Addie, Diane; Belák, Sándor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.",Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery,153,28

However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States – Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (n = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (n = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores. Internal consistency was acceptable in both samples. The current work provides initial support for use of the DASS-21 as an operationalisation of mental health symptomology in athletes. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Vaughan, Robert S.; Edwards, Elizabeth J.; MacIntyre, Tadhg E.",Front Psychol,153,1

Here we predict the clinical severity of COVID-19 in Malawi, quantifying the potential impact of intervention strategies and increases in health system capacity. METHODS: The infection fatality ratios (IFR) were predicted by adjusting reported IFR for China, accounting for demography, the current prevalence of comorbidities and health system capacity. These estimates were input into an age-structured deterministic model, which simulated the epidemic trajectory with non-pharmaceutical interventions and increases in health system capacity. FINDINGS: The predicted population-level IFR in Malawi, adjusted for age and comorbidity prevalence, is lower than that estimated for China (0.26%, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.12%–0.69%, compared with 0.60%, 95% CI 0.4% to 1.3% in China); however, the health system constraints increase the predicted IFR to 0.83%, 95% UI 0.49%–1.39%. The interventions implemented in January 2021 could potentially avert 54 400 deaths (95% UI 26 900–97 300) over the course of the epidemic compared with an unmitigated outbreak. Enhanced shielding of people aged ≥60 years could avert 40 200 further deaths (95% UI 25 300–69 700) and halve intensive care unit admissions at the peak of the outbreak. A novel therapeutic agent which reduces mortality by 0.65 and 0.8 for severe and critical cases, respectively, in combination with increasing hospital capacity, could reduce projected mortality to 2.5 deaths per 1000 population (95% UI 1.9–3.6). CONCLUSION: We find the interventions currently used in Malawi are unlikely to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission but will have a significant impact on mortality. Increases in health system capacity and the introduction of novel therapeutics are likely to further reduce the projected numbers of deaths.","Mangal, Tara; Whittaker, Charlie; Nkhoma, Dominic; Ng'ambi, Wingston; Watson, Oliver; Walker, Patrick; Ghani, Azra; Revill, Paul; Colbourn, Timothy; Phillips, Andrew; Hallett, Timothy; Mfutso-Bengo, Joseph",BMJ Open,153,10

The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of individuals aged 64 or older during the first COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in a convenience sample of 19 older adults (aged 64+) living at home in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland during the first COVID-19 lockdown, between April and May 2020. Participants varied in terms of gender, education, age, nationality, and socio-economic status. We conducted semi-structured phone interviews to elicit emotions, expectations and hopes in relation to the present situation, and the post-pandemic world. We inquired about opinions on the enforced public health measures, including those specifically targeting older adults, and on the societal portrayal of older adults. FINDINGS: We found that the epidemic and the public health response to it had both generated a variety of resentments and a high degree of ambivalence at the individual, micro-, meso- and macro-social levels. We also found that labelling older adults as an at-risk sub-population inevitably contributed to public and self-stigmatization. DISCUSSION: We conducted an in-depth qualitative investigation of lived experiences of older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in one of the most gravely hit region in Europe. Our findings on the complexity of unintended, detrimental consequences of outbreak responses on older adults have relevant implications for local adaptions of public health measures, and suggest that public health authorities should engage vulnerable sub-populations and promote bi-directional communication to inform and support communities.","Falvo, Ilaria; Zufferey, Maria Caiata; Albanese, Emiliano; Fadda, Marta",PLoS One,153,26

Apical (canalicular) transporters extrude compounds to the bile, while basolateral hepatocyte transporters promote the uptake of, or expel, various compounds from/into the venous blood stream. In the present work we have examined the in vitro interactions of some key repurposed drugs advocated to treat COVID-19 (lopinavir, ritonavir, ivermectin, remdesivir and favipiravir), with the key drug transporters of hepatocytes. These transporters included ABCB11/BSEP, ABCC2/MRP2, and SLC47A1/MATE1 in the canalicular membrane, as well as ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC4/MRP4, SLC22A1/OCT1, SLCO1B1/OATP1B1, SLCO1B3/OATP1B3, and SLC10A1/NTCP, residing in the basolateral membrane. Lopinavir and ritonavir in low micromolar concentrations inhibited BSEP and MATE1 exporters, as well as OATP1B1/1B3 uptake transporters. Ritonavir had a similar inhibitory pattern, also inhibiting OCT1. Remdesivir strongly inhibited MRP4, OATP1B1/1B3, MATE1 and OCT1. Favipiravir had no significant effect on any of these transporters. Since both general drug metabolism and drug-induced liver toxicity are strongly dependent on the functioning of these transporters, the various interactions reported here may have important clinical relevance in the drug treatment of this viral disease and the existing co-morbidities.","Ambrus, Csilla; Bakos, Éva; Sarkadi, Balázs; Özvegy-Laczka, Csilla; Telbisz, Ágnes",Sci Rep,153,17

Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal‐peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors d‐α‐hydroxyisovaleric acid and l‐lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate‐specificity‐conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.","Cheng, Yi‐Qiang",Chembiochem,153,23

OBJECTIVES: We examined COVID-19-related concerns for health, finances, and organizational support among workers with no disability, a physical, mental health, or both physical and mental health disability, and factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. METHODS: An online, cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of Canadians in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions asked about COVID-19 perceptions, demographics (gender, age, education), work context (e.g., sector, contract work) and employment conditions (e.g., job stress, control, accommodation needs). Descriptive, multivariable, and nested regression analyses examined factors associated with COVID-19 perceptions. RESULTS: A total of 3066 participants completed the survey. Workers with both a physical and mental health disability reported significantly greater health and financial concerns and less organizational support than those with no disability. Workers with a physical disability reported more health concerns and those with a mental health disability reported more financial concerns and less organizational support. Respondents with disabilities also reported significant differences in employment conditions (e.g., more contract work, stress, unmet accommodation needs) than those with no disability. Employment conditions were consistently significant predictors of COVID-19 perceptions and attenuated the significance of disability type in analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on one's health, finances, and organizational support reflected existing disability inequities in employment conditions and highlight the importance of creating more inclusive employment opportunities for people living with physical and mental health disabilities.","Gignac, Monique A.M.; Shahidi, Faraz V.; Jetha, Arif; Kristman, Vicki; Bowring, Julie; Cameron, Jill I.; Tonima, Sabrina; Ibrahim, Selahadin",Disabil Health J,153,16

Current instructions specify that the collection swab should be transported within its collection media to the laboratory. Developing a process whereby this swab is removed before transport to the lab would allow for improved automation and decreased manual manipulation of samples. METHODS: A proof of principle approach was taken by eluting viral particles from flocked swabs into collection buffer with and without a mucus background. Paired swab-free and swab-containing samples were transported to the laboratory and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 28) or RNaseP (n = 6). SARS-CoV-2 amplification was performed using the Hologic Panther Fusion Aptima and RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all proof of principle samples with Ct values indicative of dilution. The rare exception was for a few samples where the dilution pushed the viral load below the LOD. Paired samples were 100% concordant for SARS-CoV-2 and RNaseP detection. CONCLUSION: Discarding the swab after inoculating the transport buffer is an appropriate pre-analytical modification. Adopting this approach can save up to 1 minute/sample. For labs processing more than 500 samples/day this equates to one full time equivalent shift/day.,"Greene, Dina N; Matthys, Tawna; Lockwood, Christina M",J Appl Lab Med,153,20

Unsurprisingly, much of the contemporary literature focuses on the multifarious threats posed by human and, increasingly, non-human mobility. Prompted by current geopolitical concerns surrounding the public health implications of regular international air travel, this paper extends such research by exploring the ways in which the technology of the aeroplane stimulated the production of new international sanitary initiatives aimed at safeguarding global public health in an era of mass aeromobility. By tracing the development of sanitary regulations for aerial navigation, from their origins in the 1920s through the twentieth century in particular, we document the emergence of a series of public health interventions that were designed to limit the public health threat associated with increased international air travel and the concomitant rise in the mobility of infectious diseases. From inoculation certificates to quarantine and the routine ‘disinsection’ of passenger aircraft with powerful insecticides, modern air travel is replete with a complex set of procedures designed to lessen the risks associated with flying between different climatic and ecological zones. Our detailed examination of the historical context in which these procedures were devised and implemented leads us to consider the importance of time and space, power and efficacy, to the development of a more nuanced understanding of the shifting public health response to an increasingly fluid, mobile, and inter-connected society.","Budd, Lucy; Morag Bell; Brown, Tim",Polit Geogr,153,24

DESIGN: : Retrospective survey chart review of consecutive cohorts. Admissions to four acute IRHs within one system of care over the first consecutive 6-week period of admitting COVID-19 positive patients during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, April 1 to May 9, 2020. A comparison was made with the pre-COVID-19 period of 2020, January 1 to February 19, 2020. SETTING: : Four acute IRHs with admissions on a referral basis from acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: : A consecutive sample of pre-COVID-19 admissions (n = 768) and COVID-19 period admissions (n = 357); including persons who were COVID positive (n = 161) and COVID negative (n = 196). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): : Incidence of PIs on admission to IRH. RESULTS: : Prevalence of PIs on admission during the COVID-19 pandemic was increased when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period by 14.9% (p < 0.001). There was no difference in the prevalence of PIs in the COVID-19 period between patients who were COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative (35.4% to 35.7%). The severity of PIs, measured by the wound stage of the most severe PI the patient present with, worsened during the COVID-19 period in comparison to pre-COVID-19 (chi-squared 32.04%, p < 0.001). The length of stay in the acute care hospital prior to transfer to the IRH during COVID-19 was greater than in pre-COVID-19 by 10.9 % (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: : During the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic timeframe, there was an increase in the prevalence and severity of PIs noted on admission to our IRHs. This may represent the significant burden placed on the health care system by the pandemic, affecting all patients regardless of COVID-19 status. This information is important to help all facilities remain vigilant to prevent PIs as the pandemic continues, and potential future pandemics that place strain on medical resources.","Kendall, Jamila A.; Haberl, Jack K.; Hartsgrove, Caitlin; Murphy, Lauren F.; DeLuca, Robert; Diaz-Segarra, Nicole; Kirshblum, Steven C.",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,153,21

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting and participants Residents of Dutch NHs with clinically-suspected COVID-19 and who received RT-PCR test. Methods We collected data of NH residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19, via electronic health records between March 18th and May 13th, 2020. Registration was performed on diagnostic status (confirmed (COVID-19+)/ruled out (COVID-19-)) and symptomatology (typical and atypical symptoms). Information on mortality and risk factors for mortality were extracted from usual care data. Results In our sample of residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 (N=4007), COVID-19 was confirmed in 1538 residents (38%). Although, symptomatology overlapped between residents with COVID-19+ and COVID-19-, those with COVID-19+ were three times more likely to die within 30 days (hazard ratio (HR), 3·1; 95% CI, 2·7 to 3·6). Within this group, mortality was higher for men than for women (HR, 1·8; 95%, 1·5-2·2) and we observed a higher mortality for residents with dementia, reduced kidney function, and Parkinson’s Disease, even when corrected for age, gender, and comorbidities. Conclusions and implications About 40% of the residents with clinically-suspected COVID-19 actually had COVID-19, based on the RT-PCR test. Despite an overlap in symptomatology, mortality rate was three times higher for residents with COVID-19+. This emphasizes the importance of using low-threshold testing in NH residents which is an essential prerequisite to using limited personal protective equipment and isolation measures efficiently.","Rutten, Jeanine J.S.; van Loon, Anouk M.; van Kooten, Janine; van Buul, Laura W.; Joling, Karlijn J.; Smalbrugge, Martin; Hertogh, Cees M.P.M.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,153,1

The aetiology of this specific structure remains speculative. CASE SUMMARY: A 55-year-old man was admitted due to worsening effort angina during the previous 2 months. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the distal right coronary artery (RCA) with good collateral flow from the left coronary artery. We considered this lesion as a recent total occlusion, and planned a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). At the time of PCI, 7 days after admission, an angiogram showed a spontaneous recanalization of the occlusive RCA. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) depicted a HLS at the recanalized lesion, including atherosclerotic stenosis. We managed these lesions with drug-eluting stents. DISCUSSION: A recanalized thrombus may manifest as a HLS. In this case, the patient suffered from worsening effort angina during the previous 2 months, we confirmed a spontaneous recanalization of the occluded coronary lesion by serial angiographic images, and observed HLS adjacent to the atherosclerotic attenuated plaque by using high-resolution IVUS. Recanalized organizing thrombus is considered an entity of HLS. However, all previous studies on the HLS in vivo have detected the structure in an already recanalized state. Therefore, the aetiology remained speculative and evidence has been indirect. This present case demonstrates that recanalized atherosclerotic thrombosis might be one of the causes of HLS.","Kahata, Mitsuru; Satomi, Natsuko; Otsuka, Masato; Ishii, Yasuhiro",Eur Heart J Case Rep,153,20

The purpose of this study was to identify potential sociodemographic and food access-related factors that were associated with continuing or transitioning into food insecurity in a diverse population. An electronic survey was completed by 367 households living in low-income communities in Central Texas during June–July 2020. Multinomial logistic regression models were developed to examine the associations among food insecurity transitions during COVID-19 and various sociodemographic and food access-related factors, including race/ethnicity, children in the household, loss of employment/wages, language, and issues with food availability, accessibility, affordability, and stability during the pandemic. Sociodemographic and food access-related factors associated with staying or becoming newly food insecure were similar but not identical. Having children in the household, changes in employment/wages, changing shopping location due to food availability, accessibility and/or affordability issues, issues with food availability, and stability of food supply were associated with becoming newly food insecure and staying food insecure during the pandemic. Identifying as Latino and/or Black was associated with staying food insecure during COVID-19. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic did not create new food insecurity disparities.

Many respiratory viruses bind to glycans on the heavily glycosylated mucins that give mucus its gel-like characteristics. Influenza viruses, some paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses avoid becoming trapped in the mucus by releasing themselves by means of their envelope-embedded enzymes that destroy glycan receptors. For efficient infection, receptor binding and destruction need to be in balance with the host receptor repertoire. Establishment in a novel host species requires resetting of the balance to adapt to the different glycan repertoire encountered. Growing understanding of species-specific mucosal glycosylation patterns and the dynamic interaction with respiratory viruses identifies the mucus layer as a major host-range determinant and barrier for zoonotic transfer.","Wallace, Louisa E.; Liu, Mengying; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; de Vries, Erik; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.",Trends Microbiol,153,1

Owing to the rapid increase of genome sequences in public databases, the evolutionary relationship of species becomes more challenging. But traditional alignment-based methods are found inappropriate due to their time-consuming nature. Therefore, it is necessary to find a faster method, which applies to species phylogeny. In this paper, a new graph-theory based alignment-free sequence comparison method is proposed. A complete-bipartite graph is used to represent each genome sequence based on its nucleotide triplets. Subsequently, with the help of the weights of edges of the graph, a vector descriptor is formed. Finally, the phylogenetic tree is drawn using the UPGMA algorithm. In the present case, the datasets for comparison are related to mammals, viruses, and bacteria. In most of the cases, the phylogeny in the present case is found to be more satisfactory as compared to earlier methods.","Das, Subhram; Das, Arijit; Bhattacharya, D. K.; Tibarewala, D.

However, under specific conditions, it could affect significantly fetal brain development. Few studies, with inconsistent results, investigated whether fever, regardless the pathogen, could represent a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in the offspring. We aimed to explore further this question by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Peer-reviewed studies exploring the occurrence of NDD in offspring after a fetal exposure to maternal fever were included. We specifically considered the impact of fever severity and duration, taking into consideration some confounding variables such as the use of antipyretic during pregnancy, the trimester in which the fever arose, the maternal age or smoking at time of gestation. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched without language restriction. PRISMA recommendations were followed. Odds ratio (OR) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using random-effects meta-regression analysis. (PROSPERO CRD42020182801). RESULTS: We finally considered ten studies gathering a total of 10,304 children with NDD. Among them, 1394 were exposed to fever during pregnancy. The selected studies were divided into 5 case–control studies and 5 cohort studies. Maternal exposure to fever during pregnancy increased the risk of NDD in offspring with an OR of 1.24 [95% CI: 1.12–1.38]. Secondary analysis revealed an increased risk for NDD when fever occurred during the first trimester of gestation [OR 1.13–95% CI: 1.02–1.26]. LIMITATIONS: We excluded studies that considered infections with no evidence of fever. Another potential limitation may be the possible heterogeneity between study designs (cohorts and case–control). CONCLUSION: Additional evidence supported the association between fever during pregnancy and increased risk for NDD in offspring. Careful monitoring should be considered for children born from mothers with a febrile episode during pregnancy (specifically during the first trimester).

We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1β secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(+) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","Chen, I-Yin; Moriyama, Miyu; Chang, Ming-Fu; Ichinohe, Takeshi",Front Microbiol,153,16

Insurers headquartered in high-Catholic or low-Protestant areas are more likely to be annuity writers. Annuity writers located in high-Catholic or low-Protestant areas invest more in risky assets and exhibit higher investment return volatilities, as well as a higher volatility of their return on assets.

METHODS: Two health centers at 2 campuses of a large California corporation have chiropractic care integrated into physical medicine services. Care was suspended beginning on March 17, 2020 to prevent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among patients and staff. On March 19, the Governor of California issued a stay at home order. With musculoskeletal problems being common in the employee patient population, telehealth services were quickly developed to continue chiropractic care for patients. Using existing infrastructure, several members of the health center team developed chiropractic telehealth operations within 2 days. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal telehealth services included examinations, risk assessment, advice, and rehabilitative exercises. These telehealth visits facilitated care that would have otherwise been unavailable to employees. Patients reported that the appointments were helpful, addressed their concerns, and provided a safe method to see their doctor. Regular interprofessional teamwork and relations between the clinic operator and client company were key contributors to operationalizing this service in our integrated healthcare environment. CONCLUSION: We were able to quickly implement real time video conferencing and other forms of telehealth for chiropractic services at 2 worksite health centers. This paper includes information and insights to providers about setting up similar telehealth systems so they may also provide this benefit for patients in their communities during pandemics or disasters.","Green, Bart N.; Pence, Ti V.; Kwan, Lawrence; Rokicki-Parashar, Jesse",J Manipulative Physiol Ther,153,2

Here we report five X-ray crystal structures of sybodies (synthetic nanobodies) including those of binary and ternary complexes of Sb16–RBD, Sb45–RBD, Sb14–RBD–Sb68, and Sb45–RBD–Sb68, as well as unliganded Sb16. These structures reveal that Sb14, Sb16, and Sb45 bind the RBD at the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, and that the Sb16 interaction is accompanied by a large conformational adjustment of complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2). In contrast, Sb68 interacts at the periphery of the SARS-CoV-2 RBC/ACE2 interface. We also determined cryo-EM structures of Sb45 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Superposition of the X-ray structures of sybodies onto the trimeric S protein cryo-EM map indicates that some sybodies may bind in both ""up"" and ""down"" configurations, but others may not. Differences in sybody recognition of several recently identified RBD variants are explained by these structures.","Ahmad, Javeed; Jiang, Jiansheng; Boyd, Lisa F.; Zeher, Allison; Huang, Rick; Xia, Di; Natarajan, Kannan; Margulies, David H.",J Biol Chem,153,24

Certain groups, such as those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, may be especially at risk. The current study explored perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image during lockdown within the United Kingdom, using an online survey (n = 264). There were large individual differences in perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image in this period. Women were more likely than men to report increasing struggles with regulating eating, preoccupation with food and worsening body image. Those with a current/past diagnosis of eating disorders reported significantly greater difficulties in regulating eating, increased preoccupation with food, exercise thoughts and behaviours and concern about appearance, even when compared to those with other mental health and developmental disorders. Ongoing research to explore individual differences in the trajectories of change in eating, exercise and body image as lockdown measures ease will be important for understanding the full psychological impact of this pandemic and improve service and public health planning going forward.","Robertson, MacKenzie; Duffy, Fiona; Newman, Emily; Bravo, Cecilia Prieto; Ates, Hasan Huseyin; Sharpe, Helen",Appetite,153,1

METHODS: A electronic survey inquiring as to how institutions determined remdesivir allocation was developed. On June 17, 2020, an invitation with a link to the survey was posted on the Vizient Pharmacy Network Community pages and via email to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy’s Infectious Disease Practice and Research Network listserver. RESULTS: 66 institutions representing 28 states responded to the survey. The results showed that 98% of surveyed institutions used a multidisciplinary team to develop remdesivir allocation criteria. A majority of those teams included clinical pharmacists (indicated by 97% of respondents), adult infectious diseases physicians (94%), and/or adult intensivists (69%). Many teams included adult hospitalists (49.2%) and/or ethicists (35.4%). Of the surveyed institutions, 59% indicated that all patients with COVID-19 were evaluated for treatment, and 50% delegated initial patient identification for potential remdesivir use to treating physicians. Prioritization of remdesivir allocation was often determined on a “first come, first served” basis (47% of respondents), according to a patient’s respiratory status (28.8%) and/or clinical course (24.2%), and/or by random lottery (22.7%). Laboratory parameters (10.6%), comorbidities (4.5%), and essential worker status (4.5%) were rarely included in allocation criteria; no respondents reported consideration of socioeconomic disadvantage or use of a validated scoring system. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inconsistencies of US medical centers’ methods for allocating a limited pharmacotherapy resource that required rapid, fair, ethical and equitable distribution. The medical community, with citizen participation, needs to develop systems to continuously reevaluate criteria for treatment allocation as additional guidance and data emerge.","Mun, Frederick; Hale, Cory M; Hennrikus, Eileen F",Am J Health Syst Pharm,153,1

The same lessons can apply for plant viruses. There are plant viruses that have severely disrupted crop production in multiple countries, as recently seen with maize lethal necrosis disease in eastern and southern Africa. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is needed to detect new viral threats. Equally important is building local capacity to develop the tools required for rapid diagnosis of plant viruses. Most plant viruses are insect-vectored, hence, biological insights on virus transmission are vital in modelling disease spread. Research in Africa in these three areas is in its infancy and disjointed. Despite intense interest, uptake of HTS by African researchers is hampered by infrastructural gaps. The use of whole-genome information to develop field-deployable diagnostics on the continent is virtually inexistent. There is fledgling research into plant-virus-vector interactions to inform modelling of viral transmission. The gains so far have been modest but encouraging, and therefore must be consolidated. For this, I propose the creation of a new Research Centre for Africa. This bold investment is needed to secure the future of Africa’s crops from insect-vectored viral diseases.","Wamonje, Francis O.",Viruses,153,22

The most common motifs utilize hybridization to a complementary detection strand coupled with a sensitive reporter molecule. Here, a paper-based colorimetric assay for DNA detection based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-induced nanoparticle aggregation is reported as an alternative to traditional colorimetric approaches. PNA probes are an attractive alternative to DNA and RNA probes because they are chemically and biologically stable, easily synthesized, and hybridize efficiently with the complementary DNA strands. The acpcPNA probe contains a single positive charge from the lysine at C-terminus and causes aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the absence of complementary DNA. In the presence of target DNA, formation of the anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results in dispersion of the AgNPs as a result of electrostatic repulsion, giving rise to a detectable color change. Factors affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of this assay were investigated, including ionic strength, AgNP concentration, PNA concentration, and DNA strand mismatches. The method was used for screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA based on a colorimetric paper-based analytical device developed using the aforementioned principle. The oligonucleotide targets were detected by measuring the color change of AgNPs, giving detection limits of 1.53 (MERS-CoV), 1.27 (MTB), and 1.03 nM (HPV). The acpcPNA probe exhibited high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch, and noncomplementary DNA targets. The proposed paper-based colorimetric DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative approach for simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective DNA detection.","Teengam, Prinjaporn; Siangproh, Weena; Tuantranont, Adisorn; Vilaivan, Tirayut; Chailapakul, Orawon; Henry, Charles S.",Analytical Chemistry,153,21

As a precautionary measure, many clinical studies halted enrollment during the initial surge of the global Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this case report, we detail the successful treatment of a relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patient treated with an anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy immediately following clinical recovery from COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: The 57 year old Caucasian male patient had a 4-year history of MM and was considered penta-refractory upon presentation for CAR T cell therapy. He had a history of immunosuppression and received one dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) the day prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; this patient was able to mount a substantial immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antiviral antibodies remain detectable 2 months after receiving anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy. The recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient did not exacerbate CAR T-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and conversely the CAR T cell therapy did not result in COVID-19-related complications. One month after CAR T cell infusion, the patient was assessed to have an unconfirmed partial response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. CONCLUSION: Our case adds important context around treatment choice for MM patients in the era of COVID-19 and whether CAR T therapy can be administered to patients who have recovered from COVID-19. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, the decision of whether to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion weighing the potential risks and benefits of therapy. This case suggests that it is possible to successfully complete anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy after recovery from COVID-19.

Recent studies in mice have suggested that memory T cells that accumulate in tissues, termed tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells, play a crucial role in maintaining long-term protective immunity to mucosal pathogens. CD4 and CD8 T(RM) cells can be induced following infection at mucosal sites or the skin, where they are maintained and poised to respond rapidly to reinfection with the same pathogen. T(RM) cells can also be generated by vaccination, but their induction is influenced by a number of factors, including the type of vaccine, the adjuvant, and the route of immunization. Live attenuated vaccines appear to be more effective than killed or subunit vaccines at inducing T(RM) cells and mucosal immunization, especially by intranasal route, is more effective than parenteral delivery. However, evidence is emerging that formulation of killed or subunit vaccines with novel adjuvants, especially those that generate Th1 and Th17 responses, can promote the induction of T(RM) cells. While T(RM) cells are also present at high number in mucosal tissues in humans, one of the challenge will be to develop methodologies for routine quantification of these cells in humans. Nevertheless, the identification of approaches for optimum induction of T(RM) cells in mice should assist in the design of more effective vaccines that sustain protective immunity against a range of human pathogens.","Wilk, Mieszko M.; Mills, Kingston H.

During the early phase of the pandemic, recommendations for the management of oncology patients issued by various professional societies and government agencies did not recognize the significant regional differences in the impact of the pandemic. California initially experienced lower than expected numbers of cases, and the health care system did not experience the same degree of the burden that had been the case in other parts of the country. In light of promising trends in COVID‐19 infections and mortality in California, by late April 2020, discussions were initiated for a phased recovery of full‐scale cancer services.

Hence, nonprofit organizations may be interested in preventing negative consequences of these volunteers’ exposure to potentially traumatic events. The aim of this cross-sectional study was twofold. First, to examine to what extent self-compassion and self-determination would contribute to differentiating between volunteers with different levels of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth. Second, to identify the best predictors of the most extreme levels of each outcome. Participants were 211 Spanish Red Cross volunteers (60.7% women), who completed a survey. They were separately classified into three groups (low, medium, and high) according to the 33rd and 66th percentile scores on each outcome (compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth). Univariate analyses of variance and post-hoc comparisons revealed that self-compassion and self-determination contributed differently to distinguishing between levels of each outcome. Volunteers lowest in compassion fatigue stood out for showing fewer non-compassionate strategies and more mindfulness than the other groups. Moreover, those higher in satisfaction compassion also showed lower use of unhealthy strategies and higher scores in all other predictive variables. Volunteers highest in post-traumatic growth showed higher self-kindness and satisfaction of all psychological needs.

The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39–3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72–6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51–6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62–7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.","Billah, Md. Arif; Miah, Md. Mamun; Khan, Md.

The alarming rise of highly virulent and multi-drug-resistant pathogens, their rapid spread leading to frequent global pandemics, fears of bioterrorism, and continued life-threatening nosocomial infections in hospitals remain as major challenges to health care in the USA and worldwide. Early diagnosis and rapid monitoring are essential for appropriate management and control of infections. Tomographic molecular imaging enables rapid, noninvasive visualization, localization, and monitoring of molecular processes deep within the body and offers several advantages over traditional tools used for the study of infectious diseases. Noninvasive, longitudinal assessments could streamline animal studies, allow unique insights into disease pathogenesis, and expedite clinical translation of new therapeutics. Since molecular imaging is already in common use in the clinic, it could also become a valuable tool for clinical studies, for patient care, for public health, and for enabling precision medicine for infectious diseases.","Jain, Sanjay K.",Mol Imaging Biol,153,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (31 males and 28 females ranging from 25 to 70 years old) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section thorax CT. After 31.5±7.9 days (range, 24 to 39 days) of hospital admission, the results of CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups namely, groups A and B (with and without CT evidence of fibrosis), respectively. Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase. Also, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B). Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4±16.9 vs. 33.8±10.2 years) (P = 0.001), with longer LOS (19.1±5.2 vs. 15.0±2.5 days) (P = 0.001), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)) (P = 0.061), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7±26.4 vs. 18.1±17.9 mg/L) (P = 0.041), and higher maximal CT score (5.2±4.3 vs. 4.0±2.2) (P = 0.06) than those in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge. Older patients with severe illness during treatment were more prone to develop fibrosis according to thin-section CT results.","Wei, Jiangping; Yang, Hong; Lei, Pinggui; Fan, Bing; Qiu, Yingying; Zeng, Bingliang; Yu, Peng; Lv, Jian; Jian, Yinchao; Wan, Chengfeng",Journal of X-ray science and technology,153,30

Built on the concept of 'the' HPS framework, the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme includes ""Personal Health Skills"" as one of its key aspects to improve student hygiene knowledge and practices. This study examines the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using multi-stage random sampling was conducted among schools with awards (HSA) and those schools not involved in the award scheme nor adopting the concept of HPS (non-HPS). For HSA group, 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 510 students and 789 students sampled respectively. For the 'Non-HPS' group, 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 676 students and 725 students sampled respectively. A self-administered questionnaire was used as the measuring instrument. RESULTS: Students in the HSA category were found to be better with statistical significance in personal hygiene practice, knowledge on health and hygiene, as well as access to health information. HSA schools were reported to have better school health policy, higher degrees of community participation, and better hygienic environment. CONCLUSION: Students in schools that had adopted the HPS framework had a more positive health behaviour profile than those in non-HPS schools. Although a causal relationship is yet to be established, the HPS appears to be a viable approach for addressing communicable diseases.","Lee, Albert; Wong, Martin CS; Keung, Vera MW; Yuen, Hilda SK; Cheng, Frances; Mok, Jennifer SY",BMC Public Health,153,26

METHODS: The study included 48 patients diagnosed with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. Prior to dacryocystorhinostomy surgery, nasal swab sample was taken from the inferior meatus at the same side. During dacryocystorhinostomy, tissue biopsy sample (2 × 2 mm) was taken from the junction area of the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct. Following nucleic acid extraction, polymerase chain reaction was performed. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 9 (18.8%) men and 39 (81.2%) women with a mean age of 51.0 ± 14.3 years. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction showed viral genome in the nasal swabs of 10 (20.8%) patients, including coronavirus 229E (three cases), coronavirus HKU1 (two cases), respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus OC43 (one case), coronavirus NL63 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). In the dacryocystorhinostomy samples, viral genomes were detected in four (8.3%) cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus HKU1 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). There was a statistically significant agreement between nasal mucosal swab and dacryocystorhinostomy biopsy samples in terms of respiratory syncytial virus positivity (kappa = 1.000, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the viral genome was detected in the samples, a direct relationship between viruses and pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction could not be revealed because of the low number of positive results. However, considering the profibrotic characteristics of specific viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, viral infections may be one of the many predisposing factors of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","Yanık, Özge; Hoşal, Banu; Tekeli, Alper; Nalcı, Hilal",Eur J Ophthalmol,153,26

Current news and social media predictions of ventilator, medication, and personnel shortages are rampant. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are presenting with early respiratory distress and hypoxemia, but not hypercapnia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who maintain adequate alveolar ventilation, normocapnia, and adequate oxygenation may avoid the need for tracheal intubation. Facemask continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat patients with respiratory distress for decades, including those with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Of importance, protocols were successful in protecting caregivers from contracting the virus, obviating the need for tracheal intubation just to limit the spread of potentially infectious particles. CONCLUSIONS: During a pandemic, with limited resources, we should provide the safest and most effective care, while protecting caregivers. Continuous positive airway pressure titrated to an effective level and applied early with a facemask may spare ventilator usage. Allowing spontaneous ventilation will decrease the need for sedative and paralytic drugs and may decrease the need for highly skilled nurses and respiratory therapists. These goals can be accomplished with devices that are readily available and easier to obtain than mechanical ventilators, which then can be reserved for the sickest patients.","Downs, John B.; Weled, Barry; Räsänen, Jukka; Haines, Krista L.; Vidyasagar, Dharmapuri; Stock, M.

The spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and is a major target for PEDV neutralization and vaccine development. To understand the antigenicity of the new PEDV variant, we characterized the neutralizing epitopes of a new genotype 2b PEDV isolate from Taiwan, PEDV Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT), by the generation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs). Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1–10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575–639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1–10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435–485 within the S1(A) domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.","Chang, Chia-Yu; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Chang, Yen-Chen; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Lai, Seiu-Yu; Huang, Yu-Liang; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Pang, Victor Fei; Chang, Hui-Wen",Sci Rep,153,24

Recently, a lethal nonhuman primate model based on the CCHFV Hoti strain was reported. CCHFV Hoti caused severe disease in cynomolgus monkeys with 75% lethality when given by the intravenous (i.v.) route. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a series of experiments, eleven cynomologus monkeys were exposed i.v. to CCHFV Hoti and four macaques were exposed i.v. to CCHFV Afghanistan. Despite transient viremia and changes in clinical pathology such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia developing in all 15 animals, all macaques survived to the study endpoint without developing severe disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We were unable to attribute differences in the results of our study versus the previous report to differences in the CCHFV Hoti stock, challenge dose, origin, or age of the macaques. The observed differences are most likely the result of the outbred nature of macaques and low animal numbers often used by necessity and for ethical considerations in BSL-4 studies. Nonetheless, while we were unable to achieve severe disease or lethality, the CCHFV Hoti and Afghanistan macaque models are useful for screening medical countermeasures using biomarkers including viremia and clinical pathology to assess efficacy.","Cross, Robert W.; Prasad, Abhishek N.; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Geisbert, Joan B.; Agans, Krystle N.; Deer, Daniel J.; Fenton, Karla A.; Geisbert, Thomas W.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,153,22

Review of the mechanistic entry, sexual transmission and viral impacts for patients during major recent viral outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV), and SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) (the virus which causes COVID-19) provides a framework to discuss this potential. AIM: Comparative analysis of prior viral presence on seminal fluid against current (preliminary) findings for SARS-CoV-2 to predict biological implications of the novel coronavirus upon current sexual transmissibility, viral presence, and reproductive health. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. ZIKV and EBOV were found to be present in semen and to be sexually transmitted, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to update their guidelines on prevention of the two viruses to include refraining from sexual contact. There are conflicting studies regarding the presence of SARS-CoV in male reproductive tissue, but it has been linked to testicular atrophy and orchitis. To date, two studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen, while seven studies have reported no positive detection. CONCLUSIONS: Though unlikely in the majority of cases, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be present in seminal fluid, although there are no reports of sexual transmission to date. Prior epidemics raise significant concerns regarding the long-term reproductive health capacity for patients who are affected by entry of Sars-CoV-2 into the reproductive tract, therefore more study is needed to clarify the impacts to reproductive health.","Pike, James Frederick W.; Polley, Emily L.; Pritchett, David Y.; Lal, Arnav; Wynia, Blake A.; Roudebush, William E.; Chosed, Renee J.",Reprod Health,153,20

As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them. METHODS: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets. RESULTS: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping. CONCLUSION: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.","Kavuluru, Ramakanth; Noh, Jiho; Rose, Shyanika W.",medRxiv,153,1

METHODS: We described characteristics of AdV pneumonia (n = 91) versus non‐AdV pneumonia (n = 55) and compared clinico‐laboratory and radiological characteristics in patient groups categorized by RF. RESULTS: All 91 AdV pneumonia patients presented with acute respiratory symptoms and radiological infiltrations and had significantly lower levels of white blood cell counts and platelet counts compared with non‐AdV pneumonia. Of them, 67 patients had mild pneumonia without RF (non‐RF), 14 patients had no RF at admission but progressed to RF during hospitalization (progressed to RF) and 10 patients had RF at admission (initial RF). Initial monocyte percentage and absolute monocyte counts in RF patient groups (progressed to RF and initial RF) were significantly lower than those of non‐RF patients (both P < 0.001), and the differences among progressed to RF and initial RF patients were not significant. Chest computed tomography findings such as dominant pattern or distribution, clinical symptoms, and bacterial or viral co‐infections other than AdV were not discriminable between patients who had RF and those who did not. On univariate analysis, initial monocytopenia, multilobar infiltrations and pleural effusion were associated with RF. However, on multivariable analysis, only initial monocytopenia remained significant (P = 0.004) for predicting RF. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that initial monocytopenia may help to predict RF during the course of AdV pneumonia in non‐immunocompromised patients.","Yoon, Hee; Jhun, Byung Woo; Kim, Se Jin; Kim, Kang",Respirology,153,1

The regions considered were all 50 U.S. states and 110 countries (those which had enough data available by April 10th. We looked for associations between the above variables and an estimate of the growth rate of cases, the exponential coefficient, computed using data for 10 days starting when state/country reached 100 confirmed cases. The results for U.S. states indicate that one cannot expect that higher temperatures and higher levels of absolute humidity would translate into slower pace of Covid-19 infection rate, at least in the ranges of those variables during the months of February and March of 2020 (-2.4 to 24C and 2.3 to 15g/m3). In fact, the opposite is true: the higher the temperature and the absolute humidity, the faster the Covid-19 has expanded in the U.S. states, in the early stages of the outbreak. Secondly, using the highest county population density for each state, there is strong positive association between population density and (early) faster spread of Covid-19. Finally, there is strong negative association between the date when a state reached 100 accumulated cases and the speed of Covid-10 outbreak (the later, the lower the estimate of growth rate). When these variables are considered together, only population density and the timeline variable show statistical significance. We also develop the basic models for the collection of countries, without the demographic variable. Despite the evidence, in that case, that warmer and more humid countries have shown lower rates of Covid-19 expansion, the weather variables lose statistical significance when the timeline variable is added.","Pedrosa, Renato H.L.",,153,1

The cases of only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters are considered to analyze the dynamical behaviors of the system. For the case of one varying parameter, the periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic dynamical behaviors are investigated via the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, a Lyapunov diagram is applied. A tracking controller is designed to eliminate the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, such that the disease gradually disappears. In particular, the stability and bifurcation of the system for the case which is the degree of seasonality [Formula: see text] are considered. Then taking isolation control, the aim of elimination of the disease can be reached.

The treatment spectrum primarily includes ventilation support augmented with repurposed drugs and/or convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) from recovered COVID-19 patients. Despite vaccine variants being recently developed and administered in several countries, challenges in global supply chain logistics limit their timely availability to the wider world population, particularly in developing countries. Given the measured success of conventional CPT in treating several infections over the past decade, recent studies have reported its effectiveness in decreasing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. In this review, we conduct a literature search of published studies investigating the use of CPT to treat COVID-19 patients from January 2020 to January 2021. The literature search identified 181 records of which 39 were included in this review. A random-effects model was used to aggregate data across studies, and mortality rates of 17 vs. 32% were estimated for the CPT and control patient groups, respectively, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.49. The findings indicate that CPT shows potential in reducing the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However, early intervention (preferably within 3 days), recruitment of donors, and plasma potency introduce major challenges for its scaled-up implementation. Given the low number of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs, four with a total of 319 patients), unanticipated risks to CPT recipients are highlighted and discussed. Nevertheless, CPT remains a promising COVID-19 therapeutic option that merits internationally coordinated RCTs to achieve a scientific risk–benefit consensus.","Kanj, Saly; Al-Omari, Basem",Viruses,153,33

Recently, diverse mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in United Kingdom (Alpha) and South Africa (Beta) strains which raise concerns over the potential increase in binding affinity towards the host cell receptor and diminished host neutralization capabilities. In order to study the effect of mutation in the binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with anti-SARS-CoV/CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we have produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD and two variants SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Alpha RBD and Beta RBD) in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. Plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc, Alpha RBD-Fc and Beta RBD-Fc exhibited specific binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor determined by ELISA. Intriguingly, the binding of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins to plant-produced mAbs CR3022, B38, and H4 was found to be different depending on the variant mutation. In contrary to the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc and Alpha RBD-Fc, Beta RBD-Fc variant showed weak binding affinity towards the mAbs. The result suggested that the Beta RBD variant might have acquired partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies compared to other variants. However, further studies with sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals are required to confirm this finding.","Rattanapisit, Kaewta; Bulaon, Christine Joy I.; Khorattanakulchai, Narach; Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Wangkanont, Kittikhun; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",PLoS One,153,24

The objective was to compare between rural and urban areas, the psychological and social experiences of the older individuals with regard to the COVID‐19 crisis during the first French lockdown. METHODS: The sample included participants of three existing population‐based cohorts on aging. Telephone interviews conducted by psychologists focused on the lockdown period. Data collected included living environment, professional assistance, social support, contacts with relatives, difficulties encountered, health, and knowledge and representations of the epidemic. The negative experience was defined by the presence of at least two of the following items: high anxiety symptomatology, depressive symptoms, worries or difficulties during the lockdown and insufficient social support. RESULTS: The sample included 467 participants, aged on average 87.5 years (5.2), 58.9% were female and 47.1% lived in rural areas. Persons living in rural area had better social support, greater family presence, a less frequent feeling of imprisonment (OR = 0.60, 95 CI% = 0.36‐0.99), 95% had a garden (vs. 56%), fewer depressive symptoms and lower anxiety scores, but also tended to lower comply with the health measures. Finally, they had an almost twofold lower risk of having a negative experience of the lockdown compared to their urban counterparts (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.33–0.92, p = 0.0223). CONCLUSIONS: The oldest old living in rural area experienced the first lockdown better than the urbans. Living conditions, with access to nature, a greater social support and family presence, could have contributed to these findings.","Pérès, Karine; Ouvrard, Camille; Koleck, Michèle; Rascle, Nicole; Dartigues, Jean‐François; Bergua, Valérie; Amieva, Hélène",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,153,26

Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious. Association of the negative image of scientists as well as the private research companies with the research on human genetic enhancement reflects the authors’ concerns about the main motivations for conducting such research and the extent to which such research will benefit society.","Isa, Noor Munirah; Hj Safian Shuri, Muhammad Fakhruddin",Sci Eng Ethics,153,16

Objective: To examine bacterial infections in 20 patients who received umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series is a national public health investigation including case-finding, medical record review and abstraction, and laboratory investigation, including sterility testing of products and whole-genome sequencing of patient and product isolates. Participants included patients who developed bacterial infections following administration of umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment during August 2017 to September 2018. Data analysis was performed from March 2019 to September 2021. Exposures: Umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data were collected on patient infections and exposures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention performed sterility testing on undistributed and distributed vials of product marketed as stem cell treatment and performed whole-genome sequencing to compare patient and product bacterial isolates. Results: Culture-confirmed bacterial infections were identified in 20 patients (median [range] age, 63 [2-89] years; 13 male patients [65%]) from 8 US states who sought stem cell treatment for conditions including pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and injury; all but 1 required hospitalization. The most frequently isolated bacteria from patients with infections were common enteric species, including Escherichia coli (14 patients) and Enterobacter cloacae (7 patients). Of unopened, undistributed products sampled for testing, 65% (22 of 34 vials) were contaminated with at least 1 of 16 bacterial species, mostly enteric. A patient isolate from Arizona matched isolates obtained from products administered to patients in Florida, and patient isolates from Texas matched undistributed product sent from the company in California. Conclusions and Relevance: Unapproved stem cell products can expose patients to serious risks without proven benefit. Sequencing results suggest a common source of extensive contamination, likely occurring during the processing of cord blood into product. Patients and health care practitioners who are considering the use of unapproved products marketed as stem cell treatment should be aware of their unproven benefits and potential risks, including serious infections.","Hartnett, Kathleen P; Powell, Krista M; Rankin, Danielle; Gable, Paige; Kim, Janice J; Spoto, Samantha; Breaker, Erin; Hunter, Robert; Dotson, Nychie; McAllister, Gillian; Stevens, Valerie; Halpin, Alison Laufer; Houston, Hollis; Epson, Erin; Malarkey, Mary; Mendoza, Melissa; McNeill, Lorrie; Perkins, Kiran M",JAMA Netw Open,153,1

We studied factors associated with fatal outcomes in consecutive COVID-19 patients examined by computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Methods: This retrospective, single-center cohort analysis included 130 PCR-positive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [35 women and 95 men, median age 57 years (interquartile range 51–64)] with suspected pulmonary embolism based on clinical suspicion. The presence and extent of embolism and parenchymal abnormalities on CTPA were recorded. The severity of pulmonary parenchymal involvement was stratified by two experienced radiologists into two groups: lesions affecting ≤50% or >50% of the parenchyma. Patient characteristics, radiological aspects, laboratory parameters, and 60-day mortality data were collected. Results: Pulmonary embolism was present in 26% of the patients. Most emboli were small and peripheral. Patients with widespread parenchymal abnormalities, with or without pulmonary embolism, had increased main pulmonary artery diameter (p < 0.05) and higher C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), D-dimer (p < 0.01), and troponin T (p < 0.001) and lower hemoglobin (p < 0.001). A wider main pulmonary artery diameter correlated positively with C-reactive protein (r = 0.28, p = 0.001, and n = 130) and procalcitonin. In a multivariant analysis, D-dimer >7.2 mg/L [odds ratio (±95% confidence interval) 4.1 (1.4–12.0)] and ICU stay were significantly associated with embolism (p < 0.001). The highest 60-day mortality was found in patients with widespread parenchymal abnormalities combined with pulmonary embolism (36%), followed by patients with widespread parenchymal abnormalities without pulmonary embolism (26%). In multivariate analysis, high troponin T, D-dimer, and plasma creatinine and widespread parenchymal abnormalities on CT were associated with 60-day mortality. Conclusions: Pulmonary embolism combined with widespread parenchymal abnormalities contributed to mortality risk in COVID-19. Elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, troponin-T, P-creatinine, and enlarged pulmonary artery were associated with a worse outcome and may mirror a more severe systemic disease. A liberal approach to radiological investigation should be recommended at clinical deterioration, when the situation allows it. Computed tomography imaging, even without intravenous contrast to assess the severity of pulmonary infiltrates, are of value to predict outcome in COVID-19. Better radiological techniques with higher resolution could potentially improve the detection of microthromboses. This could influence anticoagulant treatment strategies, preventing clinical detoriation.","Jalde, Francesca Campoccia; Beckman, Mats O.; Svensson, Ann Mari; Bell, Max; Sköld, Magnus; Strand, Fredrik; Nyren, Sven; Kistner, Anna",Front Med (Lausanne),153,32

The gross anatomy course at Ulm University took place with a comprehensive hygiene concept and accompanied by a longitudinal study. This included in particular SARS-CoV-2 pathogen detection (swab with RT-PCR) at neuralgic time points, as well as antibody testing at the beginning and at the end of the semester for both students and teaching staff. The first SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test prior to the gross anatomy course revealed two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals of 327 students. All institute and student staff of this course tested negative at semester start (n=75). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 6.4% of the anatomy course students (22 out of 345). The second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test after the Christmas break was negative in all participants, including teaching staff (n=429).

OBJECTIVE: To explore academic, financial, psychological, & hygienic impact on medical students. METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of students at different medical schools in Jordan. It included both basic and clinical years. RESULTS: There were 415 responses. Females constituted 51.8%. Around 50% of the participants were from the 6th year (n = 194, 46.7%). University of Jordan students represented around 40% of the responders. 60% of the students have GPA (Grade Point Average) of less than 3 points. Nearly half of the students indicated that their academic grades were affected during the pandemic. Clinical years’ students (51.0%) were more likely to be negatively affected than students in basic years (36.1%), P value 0.026. Sixty three percent reported that they sanitize their hands before touching eyes, nose, or mouth. More than two thirds (70.4%) of students indicated that their mental health was affected in the pandemic. Financial influence was a major aspect in around 53% of students and 34% of students were not able to pay the university fees due to the pandemic.

The current paper introduces STYLE in clinical care, community service, training/supervision, and academic and advocacy contexts. Case examples are provided. Professionals in pediatric psychology must first focus on changing their STYLE to promote individual and infrastructural change consistent with anti-racism work.","Fix, Rebecca L.; Testa, Elizabeth Getzoff; Thurston, Idia B.; Gray, Wendy N.; Russell, Melvin T.",J Clin Psychol Med Settings,153,23

The 22 N‐glycan sites of Spike remain highly conserved among SARS‐CoV‐2 variants, opening an avenue for robust therapeutic intervention. Here we used a comprehensive library of mammalian carbohydrate‐binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on the full‐length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS‐CoV‐2. Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single‐molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD‐ACE2 interface and thus interferes with Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural modelling of lectin‐Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in Spike binding and SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. The capacity of CLEC4G and mCD209c lectins to block SARS‐CoV‐2 viral entry holds promise for pan‐variant therapeutic interventions.","Hoffmann, David; Mereiter, Stefan; Jin Oh, Yoo; Monteil, Vanessa; Elder, Elizabeth; Zhu, Rong; Canena, Daniel; Hain, Lisa; Laurent, Elisabeth; Grünwald‐Gruber, Clemens; Klausberger, Miriam; Jonsson, Gustav; Kellner, Max J; Novatchkova, Maria; Ticevic, Melita; Chabloz, Antoine; Wirnsberger, Gerald; Hagelkruys, Astrid; Altmann, Friedrich; Mach, Lukas; Stadlmann, Johannes; Oostenbrink, Chris; Mirazimi, Ali; Hinterdorfer, Peter; Penninger, Josef M",EMBO J,153,26

METHODS: Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose/1000 patient-days) of glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, fusidic acid, tigecycline, and daptomycin were analyzed. Yearly aggregated data on the number of nonduplicate clinical MRSA and VRE isolates causing HCAI were collected. RESULTS: Overall, the consumption of teicoplanin and linezolid significantly increased during the study period. A significant decrease in the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and a significant increase in the incidence of HCAI-VRE were found during the study period. A significant correlation was found between the increased use of teicoplanin and linezolid and the decreased incidence of HCAI-MRSA. By contrast, positive correlations were found between the consumption of teicoplanin and tigecycline and the incidence of HCAI-VRE. CONCLUSION: This study identified various correlations between the consumption of antibiotics and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and HCAI-VRE. Strict implementation of infection-control guidelines and reinforcement of administering appropriate antibiotic agents would be helpful in decreasing the incidence of MRSA and VRE in hospitals.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chu, Chen-Chen; Cheng, Aristine; Huang, Yu-Tsung; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,153,24

Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs complicates the development of selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors. We have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the vDUB activity through a rational protein design approach. Here, we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in the case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. Co-crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs, accounting for the observed binding specificity and high affinity. Finally, expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents. Our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies or through transgenic techniques.","Zhang, Wei; Bailey-Elkin, Ben A.; Knaap, Robert C.

With an increase in the off-label use of HCQ, concern for the safety of HCQ has been raised. We, therefore, performed this systematic review to analyze the safety data of HCQ against placebo and active treatment in various disease conditions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for Randomized Controlled trials (RCTs) and Observational studies (OSs) that evaluated HCQ for the treatment of any disease other than COVID19 in adult patients up to May 2020. We assessed the quality of the included studies using Risk of Bias 2 (for RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (for OSs). Data were analyzed with random-effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to identify heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 6641 studies were screened, and 49 studies (40 RCTs and 9 OSs) with a total sample size of 35044 patients were included. The use of HCQ was associated with higher risks of TDAEs as compared to placebo/no active treatment [RR 1.47, 95%CI 1.03-2.08]. When HCQ was compared with active treatments, the risks of AEs [RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.86] and TDAEs were less in the HCQ arm [RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39-0.81]. The outcomes did not differ in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the use of HCQ was associated with a lower risk of AEs and TDAEs as compared to active treatment, whereas posing higher risk of TDAEs as compared to placebo.","Konwar, Mahanjit; Maurya, Miteshkumar; Thatte, Urmila M; Gogtay, Nithya J; Bose, Debdipta",Current reviews in clinical and experimental pharmacology,153,20

METHODS: Following the World Health Organization’s declaration of a global pandemic, our department policy recommended Q-only SPECT/CT for all patients undergoing nuclear medicine evaluation for suspected PE to reduce the risk of aerosolization of respiratory droplets. We performed a retrospective review of sequential patients admitted with COVID-19 imaged with Q-SPECT/CT between March 17, 2020, and June 30, 2020, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We recorded patient demographics, clinical symptoms, Wells score (to stratify patients according to pre-test probability for PE prior to Q-SPECT/CT), and noted ancillary imaging findings on CT. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients imaged with Q-SPECT/CT, 6 patients (3 men, 3 women) had a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (mean age, 55, ± 11.4 years, range 33–68). All patients had a current diagnosis of malignancy and had a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE (mean Wells score 2.8, range 2–4). Q-SPECT/CT was positive in 4/6 (67%) of patients. Distribution of pulmonary emboli was bilateral and segmental in 75% of patients. Ancillary acute findings on SPECT/CT included bilateral parenchymal ground glass opacities (n = 5), pleural effusions (n = 2), and pneumomediastinum (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Q-SPECT/CT has clinical utility for diagnosing PE in patients with COVID-19 where there is a contraindication for iodinated contrast media and a moderate or high pre-test probability for PE.","Das, Jeeban P.; Yeh, Randy; Schöder, Heiko",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,153,24

Defensins are highly abundant innate immune factors in neutrophils and epithelial cells, including intestinal Paneth cells, and exhibit antimicrobial and immune-modulatory activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of human α- and β-defensins and RC101, a θ-defensin analog, on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) 1–3, human defensin (HD) 5 and RC101 exhibited potent antiviral activity against pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. HNP4 and HD6 had weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, whereas human β-defensins (HBD2, HBD5 and HBD6) had no effect. HNP1, HD5 and RC101 also inhibited infection by replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Pretreatment of cells with HNP1, HD5 or RC101 provided some protection against viral infection. These defensins did not have an effect when provided post-infection, indicating their effect was directed towards viral entry. Indeed, HNP1 inhibited viral fusion but not the binding of the spike receptor-binding domain to hACE2. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of defensins was influenced by the structure of the peptides, as linear unstructured forms of HNP1 and HD5 lost their antiviral function. Pro-HD5, the precursor of HD5, did not block infection by SARS-CoV-2. High virus titers overcame the effect of low levels of HNP1, indicating that defensins act on the virion. HNP1, HD5 and RC101 also blocked viral infection of intestinal and lung epithelial cells. The protective effects of defensins reported here suggest that they may be useful additives to the antivirus arsenal and should be thoroughly studied.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Marin, Mariana; Honnen, William; Ramasamy, Santhamani; Porter, Edith; Subbian, Selvakumar; Pinter, Abraham; Melikyan, Gregory B.; Lu, Wuyuan; Chang, Theresa L.",Viruses,153,3

Our objective was to study how the obligatory social isolation affected stress caregiver and burden of care of family members of subjects living with dementia in the community after the initial 4 weeks of quarantine in our setting. We did a questionnaire survey among 80 family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or related dementia collected on April 2020. We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive (mean, standard deviation, frequency and percent) and inferential statistics (chi-square test). The sample included older adults (mean age: 80.51 ± 7.65) with different stages of dementia. Family was the primary provider of care in 65%. Overall, COVID-19 confinement increased stress caregiver independently of the dementia stage, but those caring for severe cases had more stress compared to milder forms of the disease. Other findings were that half of the subjects with dementia experienced increased anxiety and that most family members discontinued all sort of cognitive and physical therapies. Family members’ main concerns were for severe dementia cases, fear of absence of the paid caregiver during the epidemic, and for mild cases fear of spreading the disease while assisting patients with instrumental activities. A partnership between departments of public health, care workers and families must be planned to guarantee continuity of care during these unique COVID-19 times.","Cohen, Gabriela; Russo, María Julieta; Campos, Jorge A.; Allegri, Ricardo F.",International psychogeriatrics,153,18

However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 sequence of a Q1 Italian strain revealed a close relationship with sequences of the 624I strains circulating in Italy in the early 1990s and this led to the idea that 624I was an ancestor of the Q1 genotype. Despite the fact that most heterogeneity of IBVs occurs in the S1 gene, the sequence analysis of this gene alone was not sufficient to confirm or deny this hypothesis.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","Pereira, Rodolfo M.; Bertolini, Diego; Teixeira, Lucas O.; Silla, Carlos N.; Costa, Yandre M.G.",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,153,24

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Qualitative and mixed methods studies reporting the experiences of PHPs, families and bystanders of death and dying in prehospital settings as a result of natural causes, trauma, suicide and homicide, >18 years of age, in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Searches identified 15 352 papers of which 51 met the inclusion criteria. The review found substantial evidence of PHP experiences, except call handlers, and papers reporting family and bystander experiences were limited. PHP work was varied and complex, while confident in clinical work, they felt less equipped to deal with the emotion work, especially with an increasing role in palliative and end-of-life care. Families and bystanders reported generally positive experiences but their support needs were rarely explored. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first review that explores the experiences of PHPs, families and bystanders. An important outcome is identifying current gaps in knowledge where further empirical research is needed. The paucity of evidence suggested by this review on call handlers, families and bystanders presents opportunities to investigate their experiences in greater depth. Further research to address the current knowledge gaps will be important to inform future policy and practice.","Myall, Michelle; Rowsell, Alison; Lund, Susi; Turnbull, Joanne; Arber, Mick; Crouch, Robert; Pocock, Helen; Deakin, Charles; Richardson, Alison",BMJ Open,153,14

I empirically estimate the effect of the EIP in April 2020 and use cellphone GPS data of 45 million smartphone devices as a proxy for human mobility across 216,069 Census Block Groups. The results show that when receiving the EIP, households significantly increased “Median Home Dwell Time” by an average of 3–5% (about 26–45 min). The paper highlights this unintended effect of the EIP, namely, that in addition to providing economic assistance, the EIP also helped increase individual contributions to mitigation efforts that slowed COVID-19 virus transmission in early 2020.

While emergency surgery has a major role to play in treatment of acute hernias, not all patients are fit for emergency surgery, nor are facilities for such surgery always available. Taxis is the manual reduction of incarcerated tissues from the hernia sack to its natural compartment, and can help delay the need for surgery from days to months. The aim of this study was to prepare a safe algorithm for performing manual reduction of incarcerated inguinal hernias in adults. METHODS: Medline, Scopus, Ovid and Embase were searched for papers related to emergency inguinal hernias and manual reduction. In addition, the British National Formulary and Safe Sedation Practice for Healthcare Procedures: Standards and Guidance were reviewed. RESULTS: A safe technique of manual reduction of an acute inguinal hernia, called GPS (Gentle, Prepared and Safe) Taxis, is described. It should be performed within 24 h from the onset of a painful irreducible lump in groin, and when concomitant symptoms and signs of bowel strangulation are absent. Conscious sedation guidelines should be followed. The most popular drug combination is of intravenous morphine and short-acting benzodiazepine, both titrated carefully for optimal and safe effect. The dose of drugs must be individualised, and the smallest effective dosage should be used to avoid oversedation. Following successful taxis, the patient should undergo a short period of observation. Urgent surgery can be undertaken during the same admission or up to several weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: Taxis is a benign/non-invasive method for patients with an acute, non-strangulated inguinal hernias. It likely reduces the risk and complications of anaesthesia and surgery in the emergency settings. GPS Taxis should be considered as first line treatment in the majority of patients presenting with an acute inguinal hernia when existing bowel infarction is unlikely.

Whilst potentially frustrating for participants, this makes video-mediated interaction a perspicuous setting for the study of social interaction: it is an environment that nurtures the occurrence of turn-taking problems. For this paper, we conducted secondary analysis of 25 video consultations recorded for heart failure, (antenatal) diabetes, and cancer services in the UK. By comparing video recordings of the patient's and clinician's side of the call, we provide a detailed analysis of how latency interferes with the turn-taking system, how participants understand problems, and how they address them.

While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests to manage the spread of infections.

However, its unsupervised nature increases ease of cheating, which is an academic integrity concern. This study's purpose was to evaluate the integrity of two online open book assessments with different formats (1. Tightly time restricted - 50 min for mid-semester and 2. Take home - any 4 h within a 24-h window for end of semester) implemented in a radiologic pathology unit of a Bachelor of Science (Medical Radiation Science) course during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving a review and analysis of existing information related to the integrity of the two radiologic pathology assessments. Three integrity evaluation approaches were employed. The first approach was to review all the Turnitin plagiarism detection software reports with use of ‘seven-words-in-a-row’ criterion to identify any potential collusion. The second approach was to search for highly irrelevant assessment answers during marking for detection of other cheating types. Examples of highly irrelevant answers included those not addressing question requirements and stating patients' clinical information not from given patient histories. The third approach was an assessment score statistical analysis through descriptive and inferential statistics to identify any abnormal patterns that might suggest cheating occurred. An abnormal pattern example was high assessment scores. The descriptive statistics used were minimum, maximum, range, first quartile, median, third quartile, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation, fail and full mark rates. T-test was employed to compare mean scores between the two assessments in this year (2020), between the two assessments in the last year (2019), between the two mid-semester assessments in 2019 and 2020, and between this and last years' end of semester assessments. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No cheating evidence was found in all Turnitin reports and assessment answers. The mean scores of the end of semester assessments in 2019 (88.2%) and 2020 (90.9%) were similar (p = 0.098). However, the mean score of the online open book mid-semester assessment in 2020 (62.8%) was statistically significantly lower than that of the traditional invigilated mid-semester assessment in 2019 (71.8%) with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: This study shows the use of the online open book assessments with tight time restrictions and the take home formats in the radiologic pathology unit did not have any academic integrity issues. Apparently, the strict assessment time limit played an important role in maintaining their integrity.","Ng, Curtise Kin Cheung",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,153,20

Local health systems aim to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic and hospitals and health care providers rush to provide the capacity for a surge of COVID‐19 patients. However, the short, medium‐ and long‐term outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases without COVID‐19 will be affected by the ability to develop locally adapted strategies to meet their service needs in the COVID‐19 setting. To mitigate risks for patients with GI diseases, it is useful to differentiate three phases: 1) the acute phase, 2) the adaptation phase and 3) the consolidation phase. During the acute phase, service delivery for patients with GI disease will be curtailed to meet competing health care needs of COVID‐19 patients. During the adaptation phase, GI‐services are calibrated towards a ‘new normal’ and the consolidation phase is characterised by rapid introduction and ongoing refinement of services. Proactive planning with engagement of relevant stakeholders including consumer representatives is required to be prepared for a variety of scenarios that are dictated by thus far undefined long‐term economic and societal impacts of the pandemic. Since substantial changes ‐to the delivery of services are likely to occur, it is important that these changes are embedded into quality and research frameworks to ensure that data are generated that support evidence‐based decision‐making during the adaptation and consolidation phases.","Holtmann, Gerald; Quigley, Eamonn M; Shah, Ayesha; Camilleri, Michael; Tan, Victoria PY; Gwee, Kok Ann; Sugano, Kentaro; Sollano, Jose D.; Fock, Kwong M; Ghoshal, Uday C; Chen, Minhu; Dignass, Axel; Cohen, Henry",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,153,3

Multimeric display of the antigen combined with potent adjuvant can enhance the potency and longevity of the antibody response. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we developed a trimeric form of the RBD and show that it induces a potent neutralizing antibody response against live virus with diverse effector functions and provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice and rhesus macaques. The trimeric form induces higher neutralizing antibody titer compared to monomer with as low as 1μg antigen dose. In mice, adjuvanting the protein with a TLR7/8 agonist formulation alum-3M-052 induces 100-fold higher neutralizing antibody titer and superior protection from infection compared to alum. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant loss of innate cells and pathology in the lung, and vaccination protects from changes in innate cells and lung pathology. These results demonstrate RBD trimer protein as a suitable candidate for vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Routhu, Nanda Kishore; Cheedarla, Narayanaiah; Bollimpelli, Venkata Satish; Gangadhara, Sailaja; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Lai, Lilin; Sahoo, Anusmita; Shiferaw, Ayalnesh; Styles, Tiffany M.; Floyd, Katharine; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Shin, Sally A.; Gumber, Sanjeev; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D.; Tomai, Mark; Fox, Christopher B.; Alter, Galit; Vanderford, Thomas H.; Gralinski, Lisa; Suthar, Mehul S.; Amara, Rama Rao",Nat Commun,153,2

However, only approximately 10% of patients with gallbladders left in situ will return with further biliary complications. Expectant management is alternately advocated. In this study, we compared the treatment strategies of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gallbladders left in situ. Methods: We randomized patients (>60 years of age) after endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of their bile duct stones to receive early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or expectant management. The primary outcome was further biliary complications. Other outcome measures included adverse events after cholecystectomy and late deaths from all causes. Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients entered into the trial (89 in each group); 82 of 89 patients who were randomized to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent the procedure. Conversion to open surgery was needed in 16 of 82 patients (20%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (9%). Analysis was by intention to treat. With a median follow-up of approximately 5 years, 6 patients (7%) in the cholecystectomy group returned with further biliary events (cholangitis, n = 5; biliary pain, n = 1). Among those with gallbladders in situ, 21 (24%) returned with further biliary events (cholangitis, n = 13; acute cholecystitis, n = 5; biliary pain, n = 2; and jaundice, n = 1; log rank, P = .001).

The purpose of this study is, after an exhaustive literature review and necessary interviews with specialists in this field, to propose a research framework that explores the factors that affect the ICPs’ willingness to adopt knowledge management (KM) into their tasks and to validate the usefulness of this research framework through a survey study. The research framework includes four constructs that affect infection control professionals’ decision and willingness to introduce and to adopt infection control KM, and they are namely: hospital characteristics, infection control department, external environment, and project planning. The study conducted a survey among ICPs from 425 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 227 valid questionnaire responses were returned from the ICPs from 90 hospitals. Among these responses, 55.00% are from medical centers and 47.83% are from regional hospitals. After analyzing the responses through the discriminant analysis method, the study found that “Hospital Resource Support,” “Colleagues’ Attitude,” and “Users’ Participation” are the three factors that significantly impact the professionals’ willingness for adopting KM in infection control departments. This study not only provides the healthcare industry an understanding about introduction and impact of KM, which can assist in their decision making, but also emphasizes the importance of use of actual data in the study of research framework for introduction of KM in healthcare industry. Therefore, this study presents important results in both practical and academic aspects.","Chen, Yu-Hui; Liu, Chung-Feng; Hwang, Hsin-Ginn",Expert Syst Appl,153,1

Most calves experienced an increase in the specific IgM and IgG1 titres about 6–10 days after infection with BRSV. The IgM titre was transient showing positive titres for only 5–10 days, while specific IgG1 was present for a longer time. IgA was detected concomitantly with IgM but at a lower level. Production of IgG2 anti-BRSV antibodies was detected from 3 weeks after infection. In two closed herds, repeated blood samplings were performed on young stock to analyse maternal immunity. The passively transferred antibodies were mainly of the IgG1 isotype and the half-life of IgG1 to BRSV was estimated to be 26.6 days. One of the herds had an outbreak of enzootic pneumonia, diagnosed to be caused by BRSV. Furthermore, another herd with acute BRSV was followed by weekly blood samples in six calves; in both herds IgM and IgG1 was detected shortly after the appearance of clinical signs. Serum samples from 50 Danish dairy herds (453 samples) were tested for immunoglobulins of the isotypes IgG1, IgG2 and IgM. The presence of antibodies to BRSV was widespread and more than 54% of the samples had BRSV antibodies of both the IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes indicating a high herd prevalence to BRSV.

So far, many prognostic models have been introduced to guide treatment and resource management. However, data on the impact of measurable respiratory parameters associated with the disease are scarce. Objective: To demonstrate the role of Comorbidity-Age-Lymphocyte count-Lactate dehydrogenase (CALL) score and to introduce Respiratory Assessment Scoring (RAS) model in predicting disease progression and mortality in COVID-19. Methodology: Data of 252 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected at Pak Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) from 10th April 2020 to 31st August 2020. The CALL score and proposed factors of RAS model, namely respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest, alveolar arterial gradient and minimal exercise desaturation test, were calculated on the day of admission. Progression of disease was defined and correlated with measured variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for each variable, its hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and a nomogram was made using the high-risk respiratory parameters to establish the RAS model. Results: Progression of disease and death was observed in 124 (49.2%) and 49 (19.4%) patients, respectively. Presence of more than 50% of chest infiltrates was significantly associated with worsening disease and death (p-value <0.001). Death was observed in 100% of patients who had critical disease category on presentation. Regression analysis showed that the presence of comorbidity (n: 180), in contrast to other variables of CALL score, was not a good prognosticator of disease severity (p-value: 0.565). Nonetheless, the CALL model itself was validated to be a reliable prognostic indicator of disease progression and mortality. Some 10 feet oxygen desaturation test (HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.95-1.04, p­-value: 0.706) was not a powerful predictor of the progression of disease. However, respiratory rate of more than 30 breaths/minute (b/m) (HR: 3.03, 95%CI: 1.77-5.19), resting oxygen saturation of less than 90% (HR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.15-5.06), and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (HR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.04-4.39) were considered statistically significant high-risk predictors of disease progression and death, in the formed RAS model. The model resulted in 85% (95%CI: 80%-89%) of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with substantial positive (76%, 95%CI: 68%-83%) and negative predictive values (80%, 95%CI: 73%-87%) for a cutoff value of seven. Patients with higher CALL and RAS scores also resulted in higher mortality. Conclusion: CALL and RAS scores were strongly associated with progression and mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kamran, Sultan M; Mirza, Zill-e-Humayun; Moeed, Hussain Abdul; Naseem, Arshad; Hussain, Maryam; Fazal, Imran; Saeed, Farrukh; Alamgir, Wasim; Saleem, Salman; Riaz, Sidra",Cureus,153,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This interventional case series study included 9 patients referred to the Ophthalmology Department, Minia University Hospital with unilateral combined endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis between April 2020 and March 2021. In addition to the COVID-19 work-up, all patients were subjected to full ophthalmological evaluation and managed according to their ophthalmic and systemic disease. RESULTS: The patients were 5 females and 4 males. They had clinical, laboratory and imaging findings that confirmed COVID-19 infection. All patients had unilateral endophthalmitis with orbital cellulitis and profound visual loss in the affected eye. Three patients died due to respiratory failure, while 6 patients recovered systemically. The survived patients developed atrophia bulbi in 4 patients and in 2 patients, the globe retained normal size but with complete visual loss. CONCLUSION: Combined endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis can be one of the early presentations of patients with COVID-19 infection with poor visual prognosis.

To overcome the present limitations to derive electron densities of macromolecules, the considered systems were reduced to appropriate substructures around the active centers. The combination of experimental X-ray structural information and aspherical atomic electron density data from theoretical calculations resulted in properties like the electrostatic potential and the Hirshfeld surface which allowed a study of electronic complementarity and the identification of sites and strengths of drug-receptor interactions. Applications were examined for three examples. The anilinoquinazoline gefitinib (Iressa®) belongs to a new class of anticancer drugs that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In the second example, the interaction of epoxide inhibitors with the main protease of the SARS coronavirus was investigated. Furthermore, the progesterone receptor complex was examined. The quantitative analysis of hydrogen bonding in the chosen substructure systems follows a progression elaborated earlier on the basis of accurate small molecule crystal structures. This finding and results from modified substructures suggest that also the surface properties seem robust enough to provide stable information about the recognition of interacting biomolecular species although they are obtained from medium molecular weighted subfragments of macromolecular complexes, which consist of no more than ∼40 residues.","Mebs, Stefan; Lüth, Anja; Luger, Peter",Bioorg Med Chem,153,1

Kidney transplantation (KT) has been tremendously affected due to limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities. To provide valid information on risk factors for ICU admission in a high-risk cohort of old kidney recipients from old donors in the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP), we retrospectively conducted a bi-centric analysis. Overall, 17 (16.2%) patients out of 105 KTs were admitted to the ICU. They had a lower BMI, and both coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertensive nephropathy were more frequent. A risk model combining BMI, CAD and hypertensive nephropathy gained a sensitivity of 94.1% and a negative predictive value of 97.8%, rendering it a valuable search test, but with low specificity (51.1%). ICU admission also proved to be an excellent parameter identifying patients at risk for short patient and graft survivals. Patients admitted to the ICU had shorter patient (1-year 57% vs. 90%) and graft (5-year 49% vs. 77%) survival.

Although COVID-19 has been established as a respiratory tract infection, it can manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms as a consequence of direct infection by the virus or due to inflammation-mediated cytotoxicity. It has been observed that COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms tend to progress to a severe form of disease with increased morbidity and mortality, thus indicating the need for timely management. COVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of radiologic findings on gastrointestinal tract imaging, encompassing bowel abnormalities, hepato-biliary and pancreatic involvement, vascular occlusion, and solid organ infarction. Early recognition of these imaging features can facilitate timely treatment of COVID-19 associated gastrointestinal tract complications and may prompt the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with atypical disease manifestations.

RECENT FINDINGS: Pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and collaborative care are evidence-based treatments for depression that can be delivered in primary care and extended to diverse populations. Recent research aligns with the core components of the PCMH model. SUMMARY: The core components of the PCMH are critical elements of depression treatment. Comprehensive care within the PCMH addresses medical and behavioral health concerns, including depression. Psychiatric and psychological care must be flexibly delivered so services remain accessible yet patient-centered. To ensure the quality and safety of treatment, depression symptoms must be consistently monitored. Coordination within and occasionally outside of the PCMH is needed to ensure patients receive the appropriate level of care. More research is needed to empirically evaluate depression treatment within the PCMH.","Bogucki, Olivia E.; Williams, Mark D.; Solberg, Leif I.; Rossom, Rebecca C.; Sawchuk, Craig N.",Curr Psychiatry Rep,153,1

Our previous study has confirmed that programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade inhibits peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) apoptosis and restores proliferation and anti-viral immune functions of lymphocytes after BVDV infection in vitro. However, the situation in vivo remains to be further studied and confirmed. Therefore, in this study, we established a BALB/c mouse model of acute BVDV infection with cytopathic (CP) BVDV (strain NADL) and non-cytopathic (NCP) BVDV (strain NY-1). Then, we examined the mRNA and protein levels of PD-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BVDV-infected mice and analyzed the effects of PD-1 blockade on the proportions of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cell subsets, the apoptosis and proliferation of PBL, and the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ. We found that leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia were developed in both CP and NCP BVDV-infected mice at day 7 of post-infection. The mRNA and protein expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 were significantly upregulated in CP and NCP BVDV-infected mice. Moreover, PD-1/PD-L1 upregulation was accompanied by leukopenia and lymphopenia. Additionally, PD-1 blockade inhibited PBL apoptosis and virus replication, restored the proportions of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cell subsets, and increased IFN-γ production and p-ERK expression in BVDV-infected mice. However, blocking PD-1 did not significantly affect PBL proliferation and IL-2 production in NCP BVDV-infected mice. Our findings further confirmed the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in peripheral blood lymphocytopenia in vivo and provided a scientific basis for exploring the molecular mechanism of immune dysfunction caused by acute BVDV infection.","Liu, Yu; Wu, Chenhua; Chen, Nannan; Li, Yang; Fan, Chunling; Zhao, Shangqi; Bai, Tongtong; Zhao, Zhibo; Chen, Jinwei; Su, Siyu; Zhang, Zecai; Zhou, Yulong; Zhu, Zhanbo",Front Immunol,153,24

Therefore, it is important to find novel methods for monitoring disease activity. Recent data have indicated that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is common, and that viral RNA can be detected in wastewater. This suggests that wastewater monitoring is a potentially efficient tool for both epidemiological surveillance, and early warning for SARS-CoV-2 circulation at the population level. In this study we sampled an urban wastewater infrastructure in the city of Ashkelon (~ 150,000 population), Israel, during the end of the first COVID-19 wave in May 2020 when the number of infections seemed to be waning. We were able to show varying presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from several locations in the city during two sampling periods, before the resurgence was clinically apparent. This was expressed with a new index, Normalized Viral Load (NVL) which can be used in different area scales to define levels of virus activity such as red (high) or green (no), and to follow morbidity in the population at the tested area. The rise in viral load between the two sampling periods (one week apart) indicated an increase in morbidity that was evident two weeks to a month later in the population. Thus, this methodology may provide an early indication for SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak in a population before an outbreak is clinically apparent.","Yaniv, Karin; Shagan, Marilou; Lewis, Yair E.; Kramarsky-Winter, Esti; Weil, Merav; Indenbaum, Victoria; Elul, Michal; Erster, Oran; Brown, Alin Sela; Mendelson, Ella; Mannasse, Batya; Shirazi, Rachel; Lakkakula, Satish; Miron, Oren; Rinott, Ehud; Baibich, Ricardo Gilead; Bigler, Iris; Malul, Matan; Rishti, Rotem; Brenner, Asher; Friedler, Eran; Gilboa, Yael; Sabach, Sara; Alfiya, Yuval; Cheruti, Uta; Nadav davidovich; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Berchenko, Yakir; Bar-Or, Itay; Kushmaro, Ariel",Chemosphere,153,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT images of 130 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia from several hospitals in China were collected and their imaging features were analyzed and interpreted in detail. RESULTS: Among the 130 patients, we can see (1) distribution: 14 cases with unilateral lung disease and 116 cases with bilateral disease, the distribution was mainly lobular core (99 cases) and subpleural (102 cases); (2) number: 9 cases with single lesion, 113 cases with multiple lesions, and 8 cases with diffuse distribution; (3) density: 70 cases of pure ground glass opacity (GGO), and 60 cases of GGO with consolidation; (4) accompanying signs: vascular thickening (100 cases), “parallel pleura sign” (98 cases), “paving stone sign” (100 cases), “halo sign” (18 cases), “reversed halo sign” (6 cases), pleural effusion (2 cases), and pneumonocele (2 cases). After follow-up CT examination on 35 patients, 21 cases turned better and 14 became worse. There were signs of consolidation with marginal contraction, bronchiectasis, subpleural line, or fibrous streak. CONCLUSION: GGO and consolidation are the most common CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia, mainly with lobular distribution and subpleural distribution. The main manifestations were tissue organization and fibrosis at late stage. The most valuable features are the parallel pleura sign and the paving stone sign. KEY POINTS: • The CT signs of the COVID-19 pneumonia are mainly distributed in the lobular core, subpleural and diffused bilaterally. • The CT signs include the “parallel pleura sign,” “paving stone sign,” “halo sign,” and “reversed halo sign.” • During the follow-up, the distribution of lobular core, the fusion of lesions, and the organization changes at late stage will appear.","Wu, Jing; Pan, Junping; Teng, Da; Xu, Xunhua; Feng, Jianghua; Chen, Yu-Chen",Eur Radiol,153,29

The pathogenic agent is a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that infects pulmonary cells with great effectiveness. In this study we focus on the codon composition for the viral proteins synthesis and its relationship with the proteins synthesis of the host. Our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 preferred codons have poor representation of G or C nucleotides in the third position, a characteristic which could conduct to an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected cells with serious implications in host protein synthesis. By integrating this observation with proteomic data from infected cells, we observe a reduced translation rate of host proteins associated with highly expressed genes, and that they share the codon usage bias of the virus. The functional analysis of these genes suggests that this mechanism of epistasis contributes to understand some deleterious collateral effect as result of the viral replication. In this manner, our finding contribute to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogeny and could be useful for the design of a vaccine based on the live attenuated strategy.","Alonso, Andres Mariano; Diambra, Luis",bioRxiv,153,9

Due to the scientific community’s efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus’ biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

Using P0DTD1, AKBA and KBA showed micromolar binding affinity to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and to the main proteinase complex Mpro . Phosphorylated BAs even bond in the nanomolar range. Due to their positive and negative charges, BAs and RGS-P3 bond to corresponding negative and positive areas of the protein. BAs and RGS-P3 docked in the tunnel-like cavity of RdRp. BAs also docked into the elongated surface rim of viral Mpro . In both cases, binding occurred with active site amino acids in the lower micromolecular to upper nanomolar range. KBA, BBA, and RGS-P3 also bond to P0DTC2 and P0DTC9. The binding energies for BAs were in the range of -5.8 to -6.3 kcal/mol.

An effective way to control IBDV would be to breed chickens with a reduced susceptibility to IBDV infection. In the present work, we used chickens selected for high and low specific responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (H and L, respectively) to assess the susceptibility of differential immune competent animals to IBDV infection. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high SRBC line (HL) and low SRBC line (LL) were infected with IBDV and viral RNA loads were determined at different time post-IBDV infection. Chicken orthologues of the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2); a Th2 cytokine, IL-10; a pro inflammatory cytokine, IL-6; the CCL chemokines, chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7; colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF; and a anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor β-2 (TGFβ-2) were quantified. The expression of chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7 was significantly higher in L line as compared to H line. However, in H line the viral RNA loads were significantly lower than in L line. Therefore, the upregulated chemokines might be associated with the susceptibility to IBDV. The expression of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-6 was significantly higher in H line as compared to L line. We assume that the higher proinflammatory cytokines expression in H line might be related to the rapid clearance of virus from PBMCs. Significantly higher levels of IL-10 and TGFβ-2 mRNAs in L line might be related to the pathogenesis of IBDV. In conclusion, selection for antibody responses appears to influence the expression profiles of chemokines and cytokines against IBDV. Further, the selection for high SRBC response might improve the immuno-competence of chickens against IBDV.","Jain, Preeti; Singh, Rani; Saxena, V.K.; Singh, K.B.; Ahmed, K.A.; Tiwari, A.K.; Saxena, M.; Sundaresan, N.R.",Res Vet Sci,153,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of psychotherapists with remote psychotherapy in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria (between March 24 and April 1, 2020). METHODS: Austrian psychotherapists were invited to take part in a web-based survey. The therapeutic orientations of the psychotherapists (behavioral, humanistic, psychodynamic, or systemic), their rating of the comparability of remote psychotherapy (web- or telephone-based) with face-to-face psychotherapy involving personal contact, and potential discrepancies between their actual experiences and previous expectations with remote psychotherapy were assessed. Data from 1162 psychotherapists practicing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were analyzed. RESULTS: Psychotherapy conducted via telephone or the internet was reported to not be totally comparable to psychotherapy with personal contact (P<.001). Psychodynamic (P=.001) and humanistic (P=.005) therapists reported a higher comparability of telephone-based psychotherapy to in-person psychotherapy than behavioral therapists. Experiences with remote therapy (both web- and telephone-based) were more positive than previously expected (P<.001). Psychodynamic therapists reported more positive experiences with telephone-based psychotherapy than expected compared to behavioral (P=.03) and systemic (P=.002) therapists. In general, web-based psychotherapy was rated more positively (regarding comparability to psychotherapy with personal contact and experiences vs expectations) than telephone-based psychotherapy (P<.001); however, psychodynamic therapists reported their previous expectations to be equal to their actual experiences for both telephone- and web-based psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapists found their experiences with remote psychotherapy (ie, web- or telephone-based psychotherapy) to be better than expected but found that this mode was not totally comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy with personal contact. Especially, behavioral therapists were found to rate telephone-based psychotherapy less favorably than therapists with other theoretical backgrounds.","Humer, Elke; Stippl, Peter; Pieh, Christoph; Pryss, Rüdiger; Probst, Thomas",J Med Internet Res,153,24

Despite extensive research work put forward by scientist around globe, so far, no suitable drug or vaccine (safe, affordable, and efficacious) has been identified to treat SARS-CoV-2. As an alternative way of improvising the COVID-19 treatment strategy, that is, strengthening of host immune system, a great deal of attention has been given to phytocompounds from medicinal herbs worldwide. In a similar fashion, the present study deliberately focuses on the phytochemicals of three Indian herbal medicinal plants viz., Mentha arvensis, Coriandrum sativum, and Ocimum sanctum for their efficacy to target well-recognized viral receptor protein through molecular docking and dynamic analyses. Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) of SARS-CoV-2, being a pivotal player in replication, transcription, and viral genome assembly, has been recognized as one of the most attractive viral receptor protein targets for controlling the viral multiplication in the host. Out of 127 phytochemicals screened, nine (linarin, eudesmol, cadinene, geranyl acetate, alpha-thujene, germacrene A, kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide, kaempferide, and baicalin) were found to be phenomenal in terms of exhibiting high binding affinity toward the catalytic pocket of target N-protein. Further, the ADMET prediction analysis unveiled the non-tumorigenic, noncarcinogenic, nontoxic, non-mutagenic, and nonreproductive nature of the identified bioactive molecules. Furthermore, the data of molecular dynamic simulation validated the conformational and dynamic stability of the docked complexes. Concomitantly, the data of the present study validated the anti-COVID efficacy of the bioactives from selected medicinal plants of Indian origin.","Muthumanickam, Sankar; Kamaladevi, Arumugam; Boomi, Pandi; Gowrishankar, Shanmugaraj; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha",Front Mol Biosci,153,20

Yet, funeral directors have been exposed to the same risks for compassion fatigue as other caregivers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was spread two times to 287 employees of funeral home DELA, in Belgium. Once during the height of the first wave of COVID-19 in Belgium, and a second time at the end of the first wave. The professional quality of life-scale 5 (PROQOL-5) was used to measure compassion fatigue, which includes burnout, compassion satisfaction and secondary trauma. Non-parametric tests were performed. RESULTS: In total, 104 participants answered the first survey, and 107 the second. Burnout increases from survey 1 to survey 2 (P < 0.001), while compassion satisfaction (P = 0.011) and secondary trauma decrease (P < 0.001). In survey 1, only age (P = 0.007) and gender (P = 0.040) were found to be significantly associated with secondary trauma. In survey 2, having more work experience is associated with having a higher burnout (P = 0.008) and secondary trauma (P = 0.001) score. Neither for burnout (P < 0.001), nor for secondary trauma (P < 0.001) are there any respondents in the highest category. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall funeral directors do not have acute problems with compassion fatigue, burnout scores increase significantly after the first wave.","Van Overmeire, Roel; Van Keer, Rose-Lima; Cocquyt, Marie; Bilsen, Johan",J Public Health (Oxf),153,16

This defect can be explained in a subset of patients by the presence of circulating autoantibodies (auto‐Abs) against IFN‐I. We set out to improve the detection and the quantification of IFN‐I auto‐Abs in a cohort of critically ill COVID‐19 patients, in order to better evaluate the prevalence of these Abs as the pandemic progresses, and how they correlate with the clinical course of the disease. METHODS: The concentration of anti‐IFN‐α(2) Abs was determined in the serum of 84 critically ill COVID‐19 patients who were admitted to ICU in Hospices Civils de Lyon, France, using a commercially available kit (Thermo Fisher, Catalog #BMS217). RESULTS: A total of 21 of 84 (25%) critically ill COVID‐19 patients had circulating anti‐IFN‐α(2) Abs above cut‐off (> 34 ng mL(−1)). Among them, 15 of 21 had Abs with neutralising activity against IFN‐α(2), that is 15 of 84 (18%) critically ill patients. In addition, we noticed an impairment of the IFN‐I response in the majority of patients with neutralising anti‐IFN‐α(2) Abs. There was no significant difference in the clinical characteristics or outcome of with or without neutralising anti‐IFN‐α(2) auto‐Abs. We detected anti‐IFN‐α(2) auto‐Abs in COVID‐19 patients' sera throughout their ICU stay. Finally, we also found auto‐Abs against multiple subtypes of IFN‐I including IFN‐ω. CONCLUSIONS: We reported that 18% of critically ill COVID‐19 patients were positive for IFN‐I auto‐Abs, whereas all mild COVID‐19 patients were negative, confirming that the presence of these antibodies is associated with a higher risk of developing a critical COVID‐19 form.","Goncalves, David; Mezidi, Mehdi; Bastard, Paul; Perret, Magali; Saker, Kahina; Fabien, Nicole; Pescarmona, Rémi; Lombard, Christine; Walzer, Thierry; Casanova, Jean‐Laurent; Belot, Alexandre; Richard, Jean‐Christophe; Trouillet‐Assant, Sophie",Clin Transl Immunology,153,1

A great deal of enthusiasm has been generated for the use of these drugs, which are by no means curative but clearly have a favorable impact on lung function decline over time. Amidst a flurry of newly developed and repurposed drugs to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its accompanying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), few have emerged as effective. Historically, survivors of severe viral pneumonia and related acute lung injury with ARDS often have near full recovery of lung function. While the pathological findings of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 can be diverse, current reports have shown significant lung fibrosis predominantly in autopsy studies. There is growing enthusiasm to study anti-fibrotic therapy for inevitable lung fibrosis, and clinical trials are underway using currently FDA-approved anti-fibrotic therapies. Given the relatively favorable outcomes of survivors of virus-mediated ARDS and the low prevalence of clinically meaningful lung fibrosis in survivors, this perspective examines if there is a rationale for testing these repurposed antifibrotic agents in COVID-19-associated lung disease.","Chaudhary, Sachin; Natt, Bhupinder; Bime, Christian; Knox, Kenneth S.; Glassberg, Marilyn K.",Front Med (Lausanne),153,30

We aimed to a priori identify specific patient profiles and then assess their association with the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms admitted specifically to hospital wards. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center study from February 2020 to April 2020. A non-supervised cluster analysis was first used to detect patient profiles based on characteristics at admission of 220 consecutive patients admitted to our institution. Then, we assessed the prognostic value using Cox regression analyses to predict survival. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified, with 47 patients in cluster 1, 87 in cluster 2, and 86 in cluster 3; the presentation of the patients differed among the clusters. Cluster 1 mostly included sexagenarian patients with active malignancies who were admitted early after the onset of COVID-19. Cluster 2 included the oldest patients, who were generally overweight and had hypertension and renal insufficiency, while cluster 3 included the youngest patients, who had gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed admission. Sixty-day survival rates were 74.3%, 50.6% and 96.5% in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This was confirmed by the multivariable Cox analyses that showed the prognostic value of these patterns. CONCLUSION: The cluster approach seems appropriate and pragmatic for the early identification of patient profiles that could help physicians segregate patients according to their prognosis.","Bondeelle, Louise; Chevret, Sylvie; Cassonnet, Stéphane; Harel, Stéphanie; Denis, Blandine; de Castro, Nathalie; Bergeron, Anne",PLoS One,153,16

Exploitation of topological band structure is an ideal starting point to realize correlated topological QMs. Here, we report that strain-induced symmetry modification in correlated oxide SrNbO(3) thin films creates an emerging topological band structure. Dirac electrons in strained SrNbO(3) films reveal ultrahigh mobility (μ(max) ≈ 100,000 cm(2)/Vs), exceptionally small effective mass (m* ~ 0.04m(e)), and nonzero Berry phase. Strained SrNbO(3) films reach the extreme quantum limit, exhibiting a sign of fractional occupation of Landau levels and giant mass enhancement. Our results suggest that symmetry-modified SrNbO(3) is a rare example of correlated oxide Dirac semimetals, in which strong correlation of Dirac electrons leads to the realization of a novel correlated topological QM.","Ok, Jong Mok; Mohanta, Narayan; Zhang, Jie; Yoon, Sangmoon; Okamoto, Satoshi; Choi, Eun Sang; Zhou, Hua; Briggeman, Megan; Irvin, Patrick; Lupini, Andrew R.; Pai, Yun-Yi; Skoropata, Elizabeth; Sohn, Changhee; Li, Haoxiang; Miao, Hu; Lawrie, Benjamin; Choi, Woo Seok; Eres, Gyula; Levy, Jeremy; Lee, Ho Nyung",Science advances,153,28

From this point of view, wastewater-based epidemiology represents a modern diagnostic tool for describing the health status of a certain part of the population in a specific region. Hospital wastewater is a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals, illegal drugs, and their metabolites as well as different susceptible and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, including viruses. Many studies pointed out that wastewater from healthcare facilities (including hospital wastewater), significantly contributes to higher loads of micropollutants, including bacteria and viruses, in municipal wastewater. In addition, such a mixture can increase the selective pressure on bacteria, thus contributing to the development and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Because many pharmaceuticals, drugs, and microorganisms can pass through wastewater treatment plants without any significant change in their structure and toxicity and enter surface waters, treatment technologies need to be improved. This short review summarizes the recent knowledge from studies on micropollutants, pathogens, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater from healthcare facilities. It also proposes several possibilities for improving the wastewater treatment process in terms of efficiency as well as economy.","Mackuľak, Tomáš; Cverenkárová, Klára; Vojs Staňová, Andrea; Fehér, Miroslav; Tamáš, Michal; Škulcová, Andrea Bútor; Gál, Miroslav; Naumowicz, Monika; Špalková, Viera; Bírošová, Lucia",Antibiotics (Basel),153,20

We observed strong inhibition of HIV-1 infection by CRISPR-Cas13a in human cells. We showed that CRISPR-Cas13a not only diminishes the level of newly synthesized viral RNA, either from the transfected plasmid DNA or from the viral DNA, which is integrated into cellular DNA, but it also targets and destroys the viral RNA that enters cells within viral capsid, leading to strong inhibition of HIV-1 infection.
