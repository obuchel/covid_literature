12725,The expanding vulnerabilities of being UTXless,2019-04-26,"STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional multi-center study using an on-line survey addressing utilization, knowledge, and perceptions of medicinal cannabis (MC) by people with spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVE: To characterize differences between current (CU), past (PU), and never users (NU) of MC with SCI; to determine why people with SCI use MC; to examine reports of MCs’ efficacy and tolerability by individuals with SCI. SETTING: Three academic medical centers in the United States. METHODS: Comparison of demographic and attitudinal differences between CU, PU, and NU and differences in the groups’ reports of pain, health, and quality of life (QOL). Evaluation of utilization patterns and perceived efficacy of MC among CU and PU and reports of side effects of MC versus prescription medications. Data were analyzed using either Chi Square, distribution-free exact statistics, or t-tests for continuous data. RESULTS: Among a nationwide sample (n = 353) of individuals with SCI, NU were less likely than CU and PU to believe that cannabis ought to be legalized and more likely to endorse risks of use. Current users and PU reported greater pain interference in daily life than did NU, but there were no between group differences in QOL or physical or emotional health. Current users and PU took MC to address pain (65.30%), spasms (63.30%), sleeplessness (32.70%), and anxiety (24.00%), and 63.30% reported it offered “great relief” from symptoms. Participants reported that MC is more effective and carries fewer side effects than prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: Medicinal cannabis is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for a number of SCI-related symptoms.","Stillman, Michael; Capron, Maclain; Mallow, Michael; Ransom, Tracy; Gustafson, Kristin; Bell, Alison; Graves, Daniel",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786285/,638
12761,Genome-wide identification of DNA-PKcs-associated RNAs by RIP-Seq,2019-07-05,"Right-sided colon cancer (RCC) and left-sided colon cancer (LCC) differ in their clinical and molecular features. An investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RCC and LCC could contribute to targeted therapy for colon cancer, especially RCC, which has a poor prognosis. Here, we identified HOXB13, which was significantly less expressed in RCC than in LCC and associated with prognosis in RCC, by using 5 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Tissue sample analysis showed that HOXB13 was differentially expressed between normal and only RCC tumor tissues. HOXB13 inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that HOXB13 might be regulated by DNMT3B and suppress C-myc expression to exert antitumor effects via β-catenin/TCF4 signals in RCC. In conclusion, the current study is the first to demonstrate that HOXB13 has a tumor-suppressive effect in RCC. High expression levels of HOXB13 are associated with prolonged overall survival in patients with RCC. The DNMT3B-HOXB13-C-myc signaling axis might be a molecular target for the treatment of RCC.","Xie, Binbin; Bai, Bingjun; Xu, Yuzi; Liu, Yunlong; Lv, Yiming; Gao, Xing; Wu, Fei; Fang, Zhipeng; Lou, Ying; Pan, Hongming; Han, Weidong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882800/,638
12763,EGFR TKIs impair lysosome-dependent degradation of SQSTM1 to compromise the effectiveness in lung cancer,2019-07-12,"BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies hold promise to enhance patient-related outcomes, to support health care staff by reducing their workload, and to improve the coordination of care. As key users of digital health technologies, health care workers are crucial to enable a meaningful digital transformation of health care. Digital health literacy and digital skills should become prerequisite competencies for health professionals to facilitate the implementation and leverage the potential of digital technologies to improve health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess European medical students’ perceived knowledge and opinions toward digital health, the status of digital health implementation in medical education, and the students’ most pressing needs. METHODS: The explanatory design of our mixed methods study was based on an online, anonymous, self-administered survey targeted toward European medical students. A linear regression analysis was used to identify the influence of the year of medical studies on the responses. Additional analysis was performed by grouping the responses by the self-evaluated frequency of eHealth technology use. Written responses to four qualitative questions in the survey were analyzed using an inductive approach. RESULTS: The survey received a total of 451 responses from 39 European countries, and there were respondents for every year of medical studies. The majority of respondents saw advantages in the use of digital health. While 40.6% (183/451) felt prepared to work in a digitized health care system, more than half (240/451, 53.2%) evaluated their eHealth skills as poor or very poor. Medical students considered lack of education to be the reason for this, with 84.9% (383/451) agreeing or strongly agreeing that more digital health education should be implemented in the medical curriculum. Students demanded introductory and specific eHealth courses covering data management, ethical aspects, legal frameworks, research and entrepreneurial opportunities, role in public health and health systems, communication skills, and practical training. The emphasis lay on tailoring learning to future job requirements and interprofessional education. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a lack of digital health-related formats in medical education and a perceived lack of digital health literacy among European medical students. Our findings indicate a gap between the willingness of medical students to take an active role by becoming key players in the digital transformation of health care and the education that they receive through their faculties.","Machleid, Felix; Kaczmarczyk, Robert; Johann, Doreen; Balčiūnas, Justinas; Atienza-Carbonell, Beatriz; von Maltzahn, Finn; Mosch, Lina",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7455864/,638

There are few data concerning the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in treating patients with stroke. OBJECTIVES To establish whether or not the application of IPC to the legs of immobile stroke patients reduced their risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DESIGN Clots in Legs Or sTockings after Stroke (CLOTS) 3 was a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial which allocated patients via a central randomisation system to IPC or no IPC. A technician blinded to treatment allocation performed compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) of both legs at 7-10 days and 25-30 days after enrolment. We followed up patients for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic VTE. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. SETTING We enrolled 2876 patients in 94 UK hospitals between 8 December 2008 and 6 September 2012. PARTICIPANTS INCLUSION CRITERIA patients admitted to hospital within 3 days of acute stroke and who were immobile on the day of admission (day 0) to day 3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA age < 16 years; subarachnoid haemorrhage; and contra-indications to IPC including dermatitis, leg ulcers, severe oedema, severe peripheral vascular disease and congestive cardiac failure. INTERVENTIONS Participants were allocated to routine care or routine care plus IPC for 30 days, or until earlier discharge or walking independently. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was DVT in popliteal or femoral veins, detected on a screening CDU, or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins, confirmed by imaging, within 30 days of randomisation. The secondary outcomes included death, any DVTs, symptomatic DVTs, pulmonary emboli, skin breaks on the legs, falls with injury or fractures and duration of IPC use occurring within 30 days of randomisation and survival, symptomatic VTE, disability (as measured by the Oxford Handicap Scale), quality of life (as measured by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 3 Level questionnaire) and length of initial hospital stay measured 6 months after randomisation. RESULTS We allocated 1438 patients to IPC and 1438 to no IPC. The primary outcome occurred in 122 (8.5%) of 1438 patients allocated to IPC and 174 (12.1%) of 1438 patients allocated to no IPC, giving an absolute reduction in risk of 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4% to 5.8%] and a relative risk reduction of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.86). After excluding 323 patients who died prior to any primary outcome and 41 who had no screening CDU, the primary outcome occurred in 122 of 1267 IPC participants compared with 174 of 1245 no-IPC participants, giving an adjusted odds ratio of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84; p = 0.001). Secondary outcomes in IPC compared with no-IPC participants were death in the treatment period in 156 (10.8%) versus 189 (13.1%) (p = 0.058); skin breaks in 44 (3.1%) versus 20 (1.4%) (p = 0.002); and falls with injury in 33 (2.3%) versus 24 (1.7%) (p = 0.221). Among patients treated with IPC, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival to 6 months (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.99; p = 0.042), but no improvement in disability. The direct cost of preventing a DVT was £1282 per event (95% CI £785 to £3077). CONCLUSIONS IPC is an effective and inexpensive method of reducing the risk of DVT and improving survival in immobile stroke patients. FUTURE RESEARCH Further research should test whether or not IPC improves survival in other groups of high-risk hospitalised medical patients. In addition, research into methods to improve adherence to IPC might increase the benefits of IPC in stroke patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN93529999. FUNDING The start-up phase of the trial (December 2008-March 2010) was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government (reference number CZH/4/417).

101931,"Modified percutaneous ethanol injection method combined with microwave ablation for the treatment of symptomatic, predominantly cystic, benign thyroid nodules: a retrospective study of 201 cases.",2021,"We conducted a 3-year longitudinal serologic survey on an open cohort of poultry workers, swine workers, and general population controls to assess avian influenza A virus (AIV) seroprevalence and seroincidence and virologic diversity at live poultry markets (LPMs) in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China. Of 964 poultry workers, 9 (0.93%) were seropositive for subtype H7N9 virus, 18 (1.87%) for H9N2, and 18 (1.87%) for H5N1. Of 468 poultry workers followed longitudinally, 2 (0.43%), 13 (2.78%), and 7 (1.5%) seroconverted, respectively; incidence was 1.27, 8.28, and 4.46/1,000 person-years for H7N9, H9N2, and H5N1 viruses, respectively. Longitudinal surveillance of AIVs at 9 LPMs revealed high co-circulation of H9, H7, and H5 subtypes. We detected AIVs in 726 (23.3%) of 3,121 samples and identified a high diversity (10 subtypes) of new genetic constellations and reassortant viruses. These data suggest that stronger surveillance for AIVs within LPMs and high-risk populations is imperative.","Ma, Mai-Juan; Zhao, Teng; Chen, Shan-Hui; Xia, Xian; Yang, Xiao-Xian; Wang, Guo-Lin; Fang, Li-Qun; Ma, Guan-Yuan; Wu, Meng-Na; Qian, Yan-Hua; Dean, Natalie E; Yang, Yang; Lu, Bing; Cao, Wu-Chun",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2407.172059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912708/,638

We, therefore, aim to assess the influence of COVID-19 infection on IVF treatments. DESIGN An observational study. SETTING A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS All consecutive couples undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) for IVF, before and after recovering from COVID-19 infection, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after recovering from COVID-19 infection were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables. RESULTS Nine couples (seven with the female partner infection and two with the male partner) resumed IVF treatment 8-92 d after recovering from the COVID-19 infection (negative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). No in-between cycles differences were observed in OS and embryological variables between the cycles before and after recovering from the COVID-19 infection, except for a significantly lower proportion of top-quality embryos. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection did not affect patients' performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle, except for a reduced proportion of top-quality embryos (TQEs). We therefore suggest, to postpone IVF treatment for a least 3 months (duration of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis) after recovering from COVID-19 infection, aiming to recruit healthy gametes that were not exposed to COVID-19 infection during their development.","Orvieto, Raoul; Segev-Zahav, Aliza; Aizer, Adva",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2021.1918080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974475/,638

395807,Conserved host-pathogen interactions identify novel treatment options in betacoronavirus infections,2021,"Purpose: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to in-person care has been limited. The aim of this study is to assess the value of telephone-based virtual visits in interventional radiology (IR) during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine their utility relative to in-person visits. Materials and Methods: In this study, we surveyed interventional radiologists and advanced practice providers (APPs) on their experience with telephone-based virtual follow-up visits in the first month of the pandemic. An internally validated survey was administered to participants assessing the following: appropriateness of visits, types of visits conducted and how virtual visits compare to traditional in-person visits. We also assessed efficiency, patient access, perceived patient experience, and provider experience using a 10-point Likert-scale (10 = best possible experience). Results: The study enrolled 10 providers who saw 97 patients for follow-up visits. 70% of providers had visits for drain assessments, 30% for interventional oncology, 20% for venous interventions, and 10% for TIPS. 66.7% of surveyed providers indicated that drain follow-up visits were best suited for telephone visits. 33.3% indicated that TIPS follow-up visits were suited for telephone visits, while 22.2% indicated that it was the case for interventional oncology and venous intervention follow-up visits. 60% of respondents stated that telephone-based visits were as helpful as in-person visits, and 90% found that they increased their clinic efficiency. 60% of providers stated that telephone-based visits improved patient access to the clinic by allowing access to appointments during the pandemic, quicker time to appointment scheduling, and shorter patient waiting room wait times. 100% of providers agreed that visits somewhat or greatly improved patients’ care experiences, and they rated their visit experience at an average of 7 ± 1.37 on a 10-point Likert scale. 40% of providers indicated that they might prefer the option of telephone-based follow-up visits in the future, and 50% of providers indicated they definitely would. Conclusions: Telephone-based virtual visits in IR improve patient access to care when in-person visits are restricted due to COVID-19. Many providers found these visits equally as helpful as in-person visits and expressed interest in implementing them in the future. Telephone-based virtual visits in IR contribute to a novel paradigm of care during the COVID-19 crisis and may help formulate a new standard of care after the pandemic.","Nambiar, N.; Panagides, J.; Chittle, M.; Salazar, G.; Daye, D.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,638
466450,Engaging the spikes: heparan sulfate facilitates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to ACE2 and potentiates viral infection,2021,"Social distancing is crucial for preventing the spread of viral diseases illnesses such as COVID-19. By minimizing the closely physical contact between people, we can reduce chances of catching the virus and spreading it to the community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how emerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, AI can enable, encourage, and even enforce social distancing. To that end, we provide a fundamental background of social distancing including basic concepts, measurements, models and propose practical scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies which are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep distance and monitor people. After that, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing. Finally, we provide important open issues and challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, cybersecurity) in implementing social distancing in practice.","Nguyen, Cong T.; Saputra, Yuris Mulya; Huynh, Nguyen Van; Nguyen, Ngoc-Tan; Khoa, Tran Viet; Tuan, Bui Minh; Nguyen, Diep N.; Hoang, Dinh Thai; Vu, Thang X.; Dutkiewicz, Eryk; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02816v1.pdf,638

With the spread of the disease, a better understanding of patient outcomes associated with their symptoms in diverse geographic levels is vital. We aimed to analysis clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients by disease symptoms in Ilam province of Iran. MethodsThis is a retrospective study. Data were collected from integrated health system records for all hospitals affiliated to Ilam University of Medical Sciences between 26 Jan 2020 and 02 May 2020. All patients with definite positive test were enrolled in this study. We used descriptive analyses, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to analyze the data using SPSS version 22. ResultsThe mean age was 46.47{+/-}18.24 years. Of 3608 patients, 3477 (96.1%) were discharged and 129 (3.9%) were died. 54.2% of the patients were male and were in the age group of 30-40 years old age. Cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and fever or chills were the most common symptoms. People with symptoms of shortness of breath, abnormal radiographic findings of the chest, and chest pain and pressure were relatively more likely to die. Based on the findings of binary logistic regression probability of death in people who showed shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiographic findings and chest pain was 1.34, 1.24 and 1.32 times higher than those who did not show these symptoms, respectively. ConclusionOur study provides evidence that presentation of some symptoms does significantly impact on outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Early detection of symptoms and proper management of outcomes can reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Sadeghifar, Jamil; Jalilian, Habib; Momeni, Khalil; Delam, Hamed; Sheleme, Tadesse; Rashidi, Ayoub; Hemmati, Fariba; Falahi, Shahab; Arab-Zozani, Morteza",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.10.20228908v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.20228908,638
