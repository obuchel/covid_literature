743,Low usage of government healthcare facilities for acute respiratory infections in guatemala: implications for influenza surveillance,2011-11-24,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals and influenza-like illness in ambulatory clinics is recommended to assist in global pandemic influenza preparedness. Healthcare utilization patterns will affect the generalizability of data from sentinel sites and the potential to use them to estimate burden of disease. The objective of this study was to measure healthcare utilization patterns in Guatemala to inform the establishment of a sentinel surveillance system for influenza and other respiratory infections, and allow estimation of disease burden. METHODS: We used a stratified, two-stage cluster survey sample to select 1200 households from the Department of Santa Rosa. Trained interviewers screened household residents for self-reported pneumonia in the last year and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the last month and asked about healthcare utilization for each illness episode. RESULTS: We surveyed 1131 (94%) households and 5449 residents between October and December 2006 and identified 323 (6%) cases of pneumonia and 628 (13%) cases of ILI. Treatment for pneumonia outside the home was sought by 92% of the children <5 years old and 73% of the persons aged five years and older. For both children <5 years old (53%) and persons aged five years and older (31%) who reported pneumonia, private clinics were the most frequently reported source of care. For ILI, treatment was sought outside the home by 81% of children <5 years old and 65% of persons aged five years and older. Government ambulatory clinics were the most frequently sought source of care for ILI both for children <5 years old (41%) and persons aged five years and older (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel surveillance for influenza and other respiratory infections based in government health facilities in Guatemala will significantly underestimate the burden of disease. Adjustment for healthcare utilization practices will permit more accurate estimation of the incidence of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the community.","Lindblade, Kim A; Johnson, April J; Arvelo, Wences; Zhang, Xingyou; Jordan, Hannah T; Reyes, Lissette; Fry, Alicia M; Padilla, Norma",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267779/,232

In this short communication we present a case report of a health care professional who became the first case of influenza H1N1 virus to be notified in the United Arab Emirates. There are several issues related to workplace considerations and general public health, including preventive measures, the need for isolation of the patient, dealing with contacts, return to work, and communication with the workforce.","Shah, Syed M.; Aw, Tar-Ching; Blair, Iain; Hashmey, Rayhan; Sheek-Hussein, Mahmoud",Saf Health Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3431893/,232
1213,Can informal social distancing interventions minimize demand for antiviral treatment during a severe pandemic?,2013-07-18,"BACKGROUND: In the case of a pandemic, individuals may alter their behaviour. A dynamic model incorporating social distancing can provide a mechanism to consider complex scenarios to support decisions regarding antiviral stockpile size while considering uncertainty around behavioural interventions. We have examined the impact of social distancing measures on the demand for limited healthcare resources such as antiviral drugs from a central stockpile during a severe pandemic. METHODS: We used an existing age-structured model for pandemic influenza in Canada and biologically plausible scenarios for severe influenza transmission within the population. We incorporated data from published reports regarding stated intentions to change behaviour during a pandemic as well as the magnitude and duration of time that individuals expected to maintain the behavioural change. We ran simulations for all combinations of parameter values to identify the projected antiviral requirements in each scenario. RESULTS: With 12 weeks of distancing, the effect is relatively small for the lowest R0 of 1.6 with a projected stockpile to treat 25.6% being required (IQR = 21.7 – 28.7%) unless the proportion of people involved (81%) and magnitude of the behaviour change is large (69% reduction in contacts). If 24 weeks of distancing occurs, with only a low to moderate reduction in contacts (38% or less), it is not possible to bring treatment requirements below 20% regardless of what proportion of the population engages in distancing measures when transmissibility is high (R0 = 2.0; stockpile size = 31%, IQR = 29.2 – 33.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the magnitude and duration of social distancing behaviours during a severe pandemic have an impact on the need for antiviral drugs. However, significant investments over a long period of time (>16 weeks) are required to decrease the need for antiviral treatment to below 10% of the total population for a highly transmissible viral strain (R0 > 1.8). Encouraging individuals to adopt behaviours that decrease their daily contact rate can help to control the spread of the virus until a vaccine becomes available however; relying on these measures to justify stockpiling fewer courses of treatment will not be sufficient in the case of a severe pandemic.","Greer, Amy L",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723680/,232
1606,Review: The Important Bacterial Zoonoses in “One Health” Concept,2014-10-14,"An infectious disease that is transmitted from animals to humans, sometimes by a vector, is called zoonosis. The focus of this review article is on the most common emerging and re-emerging bacterial zoonotic diseases. The role of “One Health” approach, public health education, and some measures that can be taken to prevent zoonotic bacterial infections are discussed. Key points: A zoonotic bacterial disease is a disease that can be very commonly transmitted between animals and humans. Global climate changes, overuse of antimicrobials in medicine, more intensified farm settings, and closer interactions with animals facilitate emergence or re-emergence of bacterial zoonotic infections. The global “One Health” approach, which requires interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment, will support public health in general. New strategies for continuous dissemination of multidisciplinary research findings related to zoonotic bacterial diseases are hence needed.","Cantas, Leon; Suer, Kaya",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196475/,232
1812,Beyond resistance: social factors in the general public response to pandemic influenza,2015-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Influencing the general public response to pandemics is a public health priority. There is a prevailing view, however, that the general public is resistant to communications on pandemic influenza and that behavioural responses to the 2009/10 H1N1 pandemic were not sufficient. Using qualitative methods, this paper investigates how members of the general public respond to pandemic influenza and the hygiene, social isolation and other measures proposed by public health. Going beyond the commonly deployed notion that the general public is resistant to public health communications, this paper examines how health individualism, gender and real world constraints enable and limit individual action. METHODS: In-depth interviews (n = 57) and focus groups (ten focus groups; 59 individuals) were conducted with community samples in Melbourne, Sydney and Glasgow. Participants were selected according to maximum variation sampling using purposive criteria, including: 1) pregnancy in 2009/2010; 2) chronic illness; 3) aged 70 years and over; 4) no disclosed health problems. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to inductive, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents did not express resistance to public health communications, but gave insight into how they interpreted and implemented guidance. An individualistic approach to pandemic risk predominated. The uptake of hygiene, social isolation and vaccine strategies was constrained by seeing oneself ‘at risk’ but not ‘a risk’ to others. Gender norms shape how members of the general public enact hygiene and social isolation. Other challenges pertained to over-reliance on perceived remoteness from risk, expectation of recovery from infection and practical constraints on the uptake of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, respondents were engaged with public health advice regarding pandemic influenza, indicating that the idea of public resistance has limited explanatory power. Public communications are endorsed, but challenges persist. Individualistic approaches to pandemic risk inhibit acting for the benefit of others and may deepen divisions in the community according to health status. Public communications on pandemics are mediated by gender norms that may overburden women and limit the action of men. Social research on the public response to pandemics needs to focus on the social structures and real world settings and relationships that shape the action of individuals.","Davis, Mark D M; Stephenson, Niamh; Lohm, Davina; Waller, Emily; Flowers, Paul",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419473/,232
1956,What’s Past is Prologue: A Scoping Review of Recent Public Health and Global Health Informatics Literature,2015-07-01,"Objective: To categorize and describe the public health informatics (PHI) and global health informatics (GHI) literature between 2012 and 2014. Methods: We conducted a semi-systematic review of articles published between January 2012 and September 2014 where information and communications technologies (ICT) was a primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups. Results: A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes. Discussion: There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles. Conclusion: While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.","Dixon, Brian E.; Pina, Jamie; Kharrazi, Hadi; Gharghabi, Fardad; Richards, Janise",Online J Public Health Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4576440/,232

C. parvum oocysts were identified by using the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique in 109 (19.7%) bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults. Positive animals were found in 19 (63.3%) farms. As much as 44.4% of calves aged 3–4 days were infected, but infection rates peaked at 6–15 days of age (76.7%). Nevertheless, prevalence was also high in weaning calves aged 1.5–4 months (14%), fattening calves and heifers 4–24 months old (7.7%) and adults (17.8%). Diarrhoea was recorded in 78.6% of suckling and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum, but it was only found to be statistically associated with infection in suckling calves (P < 0.01). All calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Cryptosporidial infections were always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in bovines older than 4 months (2.2%) (P < 0.001). Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection. In fact, infection rates were higher in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic calves.","Quílez, J.; Sánchez-Acedo, C.; del Cacho, E.; Clavel, A.; Causapé, A.C.",Vet Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131028/,232
11856,Picture of a pandemic: visual aids in the COVID-19 crisis,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: This is an ecological study that examines the relationship between antiviral drug collection during the 2009/2010 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, and area-level ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation and distance from an antiviral collection point (ACP). METHODS: Age-standardized antiviral collection rates (ACR) were calculated for each super output area (geographic areas representing a population of ∼1500) in Sandwell, UK for all residents who received an antiviral drug for influenza-like illness between 23 July 2009 and 7 February 2010. Multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship between ACR and ethnicity (percentage population non-white), socioeconomic deprivation (index of multiple deprivation, IMD) and distance from an ACP. RESULTS: Socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity and distance from an ACP were independently associated with a reduction in ACR. Each one-point increase in the IMD score was associated with a drop in the ACR of 15.7 prescriptions per 100 000 population (P= 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity and distance from an ACP may have influenced health-seeking behaviour during the 2009/2010 influenza pandemic. This suggests possible inequalities in access to antivirals during the most recent influenza pandemic. Qualitative research is needed to examine the reasons for this. Individual-level data on ethnicity should be routinely collected in the event of a future pandemic.","Haroon, Shamil M.M.; Barbosa, Gregory P.; Saunders, Patrick J.",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313879/,232

The white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, is one of the most abundant rodent species in the northeastern United States. We characterized the serum virome of 978 free-ranging P. leucopus mice caught in Pennsylvania. We identified many new viruses belonging to 26 different virus families. Among these viruses was a highly divergent segmented flavivirus whose genetic relatives were recently identified in ticks, mosquitoes, and vertebrates, including febrile humans. This novel flavi-like segmented virus was found in rodents and shares ˂70% aa identity with known viruses in the highly conserved region of the viral polymerase. Our data will enable researchers to develop molecular reagents to further characterize this virus and its relatives infecting other hosts and to curtail their spread, if necessary.","Vandegrift, Kurt J.; Kumar, Arvind; Sharma, Himanshu; Murthy, Satyapramod; Kramer, Laura D.; Ostfeld, Richard; Hudson, Peter J.; Kapoor, Amit",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392405/,232

16550,Public willingness to participate in personalized health research and biobanking: A large-scale Swiss survey,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVE: To study whether furosemide infusion in early-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill children would be associated with a reduced proportion of patients progressing to the higher stage (Injury or Failure) as compared to placebo. METHOD: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial was conducted. The authors enrolled children aged 1-mo (corrected) to 12-y, who were diagnosed with AKI (“risk” stage) using pediatric-Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End stage kidney disease (p-RIFLE) criteria, and achieved immediate resuscitation goals within 24 h of admission. Participants received either furosemide (0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg/h) or placebo (5%-dextrose) infusion. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients progressing to a higher stage (injury or failure). Secondary outcomes were (i) need for renal replacement therapy, (ii) the effect on neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (urine and blood), (iii) fluid balance, (iv) adverse effects, (v) time to achieve renal recovery, (vi) duration of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation, and (vii) all-cause 28-d mortality. RESULTS: The trial was stopped for futility, and data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis (furosemide-group: n = 38; placebo-group: n = 37). No significant difference was noted in the progression of AKI to a higher stage between furosemide and placebo groups (10.5% vs. 21.6%; relative risk = 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.48) (p = 0.22). There were no differences in the secondary outcomes between the study groups. All-cause 28-d mortality was similar between the groups (10.5% vs. 10.8%). No trial-related severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Furosemide infusion in early-onset AKI did not reduce the progression to a higher stage of AKI. A future trial with large sample size is warranted.","Abraham, Shilpa; Rameshkumar, Ramachandran; Chidambaram, Muthu; Soundravally, Rajendran; Subramani, Seenivasan; Bhowmick, Rohit; Sheriff, Abraar; Maulik, Kaushik; Mahadevan, Subramanian",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016612/,232
17376,"Note from the editors: Eurosurveillance, 1996 to 2021 – 25 years of public health impact",2021-05-06,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the third-leading cause of death worldwide, which is a severe economic burden to the healthcare system. Chronic bronchitis is the most common condition that contributes to COPD, both locally and systemically. Neutrophilic inflammation predominates in the COPD airway wall and lumen. Logically, repression of neutrophilia is an essential fashion to COPD treatment. However, currently available anti-neutrophilic therapies provide little benefit in COPD patients and may have serious side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore an effective and safe anti-neutrophilic approach that might delay progression of the disease. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-9 is a member of the Siglec cell surface immunoglobulin family. It is noteworthy that Siglec-9 is highly expressed on human neutrophils and monocytes. Ligation of Siglec-9 by chemical compounds or synthetic ligands induced apoptosis and autophagic-like cell death in human neutrophils. Furthermore, administration of antibody to Siglec-E, mouse functional ortholog of Siglec-9, restrained recruitment and activation of neutrophils in mouse models of airway inflammation in vivo. Given the critical role that neutrophils play in chronic bronchitis and emphysema, targeting Siglec-9 could be beneficial for the treatment of COPD, asthma, fibrosis, and related chronic inflammatory lung diseases.","Chen, Zi; Xu, Shuang-Lan; Ge, Lin-Yang; Zhu, Jin; Zheng, Tao; Zhu, Zhou; Zhou, Linfu",Chin Med J (Engl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104259/,232
19233,The outstanding relevance of the One Health approach,2021-07-11,"Diarrhoeal disease attributable to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes substantial morbidity and mortality predominantly in paediatric populations in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to acute illness, there is an increasing appreciation of the long-term consequences of enteric infections, including ETEC, on childhood growth and development. Provision of potable water and sanitation and appropriate clinical care for acute illness are critical to reduce the ETEC burden. However, these interventions are not always practical and may not achieve equitable and sustainable coverage. Vaccination may be the most cost-effective and equitable means of primary prevention; however, additional data are needed to accelerate the investment and guide the decision-making process for ETEC vaccines. First, to understand and quantify the ETEC disease burden, additional data are needed on the association between ETEC infection and physical and cognitive stunting as well as delayed educational attainment. Furthermore, the role of inappropriate or inadequate antibiotic treatment of ETEC-attributable diarrhoea may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and needs further elucidation. An ETEC vaccine that mitigates acute diarrhoeal illness and minimizes the longer-term disease manifestations could have significant public health impact and be a cost-effective countermeasure. Herein we review the ETEC vaccine pipeline, led by candidates compatible with the general parameters of the Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) recently developed by the World Health Organization. Additionally, we have developed an ETEC Vaccine Development Strategy to provide a framework to underpin priority activities for researchers, funders and vaccine manufacturers, with the goal of addressing globally unmet data needs in the areas of research, product development, and policy, as well as commercialization and delivery. The strategy also aims to guide prioritization and co-ordination of the priority activities needed to minimize the timeline to licensure and use of ETEC vaccines, especially in in low- and middle-income countries, where they are most urgently needed.","Khalil, Ibrahim; Walker, Richard; Porter, Chad K.; Muhib, Farzana; Chilengi, Roma; Cravioto, Alejandro; Guerrant, Richard; Svennerholm, Ann-Mari; Qadri, Firdausi; Baqar, Shahida; Kosek, Margaret; Kang, Gagandeep; Lanata, Claudio; Armah, George; Wierzba, Thomas; Hasso-Agopsowicz, Mateusz; Giersing, Birgitte; Louis Bourgeois, A.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8273896/,232

The present study evaluated the alleviative mechanism of the isolated polyphenolic fraction from seedless (pulp and skin) black Vitis vinifera (VVPF) on systemic oxidative and necroinflammatory stress in CCl(4)-intoxicated rats. Here, we found that the administration of VVPF to CCl(4)-intoxicated rats for ten days was obviously ameliorated the CCl(4)-induced systemic elevation in ROS, NO and TBARS levels, as well as MPO activity. Also, it upregulated the cellular activities of the enzymatic (SOD, and GPx) and non-enzymatic (TAC and GSH) antioxidants. Furthermore, the gene expression of the ROS-related necroinflammatory mediators (NF-κB, iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α) in the kidney, brain, and spleen, as well as IL-1β, and IL-8 in the lung were greatly restored. The histopathological studies confirmed these biochemical results and showed a noticeable enhancing effect in the architecture of the studied organs after VVPF intake.

20623,From Cells to Communities:: Addressing COVID-19 in Delaware Through Scientific Research,2020-07-01,"[Image: see text] In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.","Unke, Oliver T.; Chmiela, Stefan; Sauceda, Huziel E.; Gastegger, Michael; Poltavsky, Igor; Schütt, Kristof T.; Tkatchenko, Alexandre; Müller, Klaus-Robert",Chem Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391964/,232
21060,Public-private relationship in surgical hospitalizations through the Unified Health System,2021-08-30,"Although psoriatic arthritis (PsA) primarily leads to joint and skin damage, it is associated with higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, namely hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type II diabetes. Additionally, chronic inflammation is known to aggravate these cardiometabolic factors, thus explaining the enhanced cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in RA. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggest that some risk factors can fuel inflammation, thus pointing to a bidirectional crosstalk between inflammation and cardiometabolic factors. Therefore, dampening inflammation by disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be thought to ameliorate MetS burden and thus, CV risk and disease severity. In fact, recommendations for PsA management emphasize the need of considering comorbidities to guide the treatment decision process. However, the existing evidence on the impact of approved DMARDs in PsA on MetS and MetS components is far from being optimal, thus representing a major challenge for the clinical setting. Although a beneficial effect of some DMARDs such as methotrexate, TNF inhibitors and some small molecules is clear, no head-to-head studies are published and no evidence is available for other therapeutic approaches such as IL-23 or IL-17 inhibitors. This narrative review summarizes the main evidence related to the effect of DMARDs on MetS outcomes in PsA patients and identify the main limitations, research needs and future perspectives in this scenario.","Atzeni, Fabiola; Gerratana, Elisabetta; Francesco Masala, Ignazio; Bongiovanni, Sara; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435605/,232
21241,COVID-19—break the cycle of inequality,2021-01-21,"IMPORTANCE: Hyperglycemic crises (ie, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]) are life-threatening acute complications of diabetes. Efforts to prevent these events at the population level have been hindered by scarce granular data and difficulty in identifying individuals at highest risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with hyperglycemic crises in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the US from 2014 to 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed administrative claims and laboratory results for adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of emergency department or hospital visits with a primary diagnosis of DKA or HHS (adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region, and for year when calculating annualized rates) were calculated separately for patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The associations of sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and income), clinical factors (comorbidities), and treatment factors (glucose-lowering medications, hemoglobin A(1c)) with DKA or HHS in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were assessed using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Among 20 156 adults with type 1 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [16.5] years; 51.2% male; 72.6% White race/ethnicity) and 796 382 with type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [11.8] years; 50.3% female; 54.4% White race/ethnicity), adjusted rates of hyperglycemic crises were 52.69 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 48.26-57.12 per 1000 person-years) for type 1 diabetes and 4.04 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 3.88-4.21 per 1000 person-years) for type 2 diabetes. In both groups, factors associated with the greatest hyperglycemic crisis risk were low income (≥$200 000 vs <$40 000: type 1 diabetes incidence risk ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.46-0.81]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.86]), Black race/ethnicity (vs White race/ethnicity: type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01-1.74]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.09-1.27]), high hemoglobin A(1c) level (≥10% vs 6.5%-6.9%: type 1 diabetes IRR, 7.81 [95% CI, 5.78-10.54]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 7.06 [95% CI, 6.26-7.96]), history of hyperglycemic crises (type 1 diabetes IRR, 7.88 [95% CI, 6.06-9.99]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 17.51 [95% CI, 15.07-20.34]), severe hypoglycemia (type 1 diabetes IRR, 2.77 [95% CI, 2.15-3.56]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 4.18 [95% CI, 3.58-4.87]), depression (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.37-1.92]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.34-1.59]), neuropathy (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.39-1.93]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.17-1.34]), and nephropathy (type 1 diabetes IRR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48]; type 2 diabetes IRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.14-1.33]). Age had a U-shaped association with hyperglycemic crisis risk in patients with type 1 diabetes (compared with patients aged 18-44 years: 45-64 years IRR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.87]; 65-74 years IRR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.80]; ≥75 years IRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.66-1.38]). In type 2 diabetes, risk of hyperglycemic crises decreased progressively with age (45-64 years IRR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.63]; 65-74 years IRR, 0.44 [95% CI, .39-0.49]; ≥75 years IRR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.36-0.47]). In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher risk was associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy (IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.49) and insulin dependency (compared with regimens with bolus insulin: regimens with basal insulin only, IRR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.63-0.75]; and without any insulin, IRR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33-0.40]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, younger age, Black race/ethnicity, low income, and poor glycemic control were associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemic crises. The findings suggest that multidisciplinary interventions focusing on groups at high risk for hyperglycemic crises are needed to prevent these dangerous events.","McCoy, Rozalina G.; Galindo, Rodolfo J.; Swarna, Kavya Sindhu; Van Houten, Holly K.; O’Connor, Patrick J.; Umpierrez, Guillermo E.; Shah, Nilay D.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8411297/,232

These viruses do not primarily target the liver. These viruses include the herpes viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), parvovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus. The risk of acquiring infection from any of the non-hepatotropic viruses is specific to each virus. Infection with the herpesviruses is ubiquitous, with clinically significant hepatitis being less common. Considerations for determining the risk of hepatitis from non-hepatotropic viruses include prior exposure (risk of reactivation), host immune status (increase severity in immunosuppressed), and duration of infection in the contact. Diagnosis is made with a combination of serology, polymerase chain reaction, or liver biopsy. Treatment is supportive in the majority. In certain clinical scenarios, such as cytomegalovirus infection in transplant patients, and acute liver failure from herpes simplex virus, specific antiviral therapy is warranted.","Said, Adnan; Ghufran, Aiman",Liver Disorders,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124071/,232

This course of disease suggests that the virus often evades detection by the innate immune system. We suggest a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate the infection's severity, probability of complications and duration. We propose that priming an individual's innate immune system for viral attack shortly before it is expected to occur may allow pre-activation of the preferable trajectory of immune response, leading to early detection of the virus. Priming can be carried out, for example, by administering a standard vaccine or another reagent that elicits a broad anti-viral innate immune response. By the time that the expected SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs, activation cascades will have been put in motion and levels of immune factors needed to combat the infection will have been elevated. The infection would thus be cleared faster and with less complication than otherwise, alleviating adverse clinical outcomes at the individual level. Moreover, priming may also mitigate population-level risk by reducing need for hospitalizations and decreasing the infectious period of individuals, thus slowing the spread and reducing the impact of the epidemic. In view of the latter consideration, our proposal may have a significant epidemiological impact even if applied primarily to low-risk individuals, such as young adults, who often show mild symptoms or none, by shortening the period during which they unknowingly infect others. The proposed view is, at this time, an unproven hypothesis. Although supported by robust bio-medical reasoning and multiple lines of evidence, carefully designed clinical trials are necessary.","Kolodny, Oren; Berger, Michael; Feldman, Marcus W.; Ram, Yoav",Open Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7574546/,232

When analysing Israel’s deteriorating image, scholars and practitioners recommended to focus the country’s branding and diplomatic efforts on micro-marketing and in creating bypassing messages to the Israeli–Arab dispute. While other countries manage to use sports for such purposes, international politics often limited Israel’s possibilities. Being the number one country in the world in start-ups per capita, and having a growing sport-tech ecosystem used by some of the biggest international sport-related organizations, embody new opportunities especially in the context of “sport-tech diplomacy”. The article is significant as it contributes to existing literature on the branding of Israel as a “start-up nation”, on Israel’s sports diplomacy, and on public diplomacy and soft power through exploring the intersections of technology, innovation, sports, and diplomacy, using the term “sport-tech diplomacy”.","Dubinsky, Yoav",Place Brand Public Dipl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653986/,232

It is crucial for governments to take policy recommendations to enhance the supply chain resilience to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19. For such a major issue, it is a common occurrence that a large number of decision-makers (DMs) are invited to participate in the decision-making process so as to ensure the comprehensiveness and reliability of decision results. Since the attitudinal characteristics of DMs are important factors affecting decision results, this study focuses on capturing the attitudinal characteristics of DMs in the large-scale group decision making process. The capturing process combines the ordinal k-means clustering algorithm, gained and lost dominance score method and personalized quantifiers. To enable DMs to express their cognitions in depth, we use the probabilistic linguistic term set to express the evaluation information of DMs. A case study on selecting the optimal policy recommendation for improving the integration capability of supply chain is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed process. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is highlighted through sensitive analysis and comparative analysis.","Wen, Zhi; Liao, Huchang",Oper Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785333/,232

54200,Post-COVID-19 WHO Reform: Ethical Considerations,2021-05-19,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 infection and its persistent lingering symptoms on known risk factors for malnutrition. METHODS: Patients with confirmed history of COVID infection and persistent symptoms were referred to the Post-COVID Recovery Clinic. Standardized telehealth screening included: Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), Shortness of Breath (SOBQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), CDC 18 common symptom COVID, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), and (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living (I)ADL. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were evaluated in the first 2.5 months. Average age was 52 years (23–90), 67% were female, and 58% Caucasian. COVID+ test to clinic visit was 49 days (14–140). Forty eight percent did not require hospitalization, 62% were obese, and 73% had ≥1 comorbidity. At infection onset, 80% complained of GI symptoms (75% loss of taste, 61% loss of smell, 59% diarrhea, 57% nausea). At the telehealth visit, 51% reported lingering GI symptoms (45% taste, 41% smell, 41% diarrhea, 36% nausea). Other common symptoms were: dyspnea on exertion, chronic fatigue, cough, and weakness. Survivors required referrals for the following specialty services: 84% pulmonary, 77% physical/occupational therapy, 73% behavioral health, and 51% registered dietitian consult. Average PG-SGA score was 5.7 ± 5.02 with sub-scores: weight 1.37 ± 1.65, food 0.58 ± 0.64, symptoms 2.19 ± 3.30, activities/function 1.59 ± 0.93. Preliminary analysis of 2-day 24h dietary recalls of a subset of clinic patients (n = 33) found >50% of COVID survivors failed to meet basic dietary recommendations. Daily caloric intake was low, protein intake was below 0.8 g/kg, and the daily distribution of protein skewed towards a single meal. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the clinical symptoms experienced by COVID survivors, particularly fatigue, dyspnea, and eating difficulties (nausea, vomiting, changes in smell and taste, trouble breathing) created difficulties in maintaining an adequate nutritional intake. This is concerning because malnutrition, specifically inadequate protein, leads to weaker immune function, slower recovery from illness, and loss of lean body mass.

The present prebirth cohort study examined the relationship between BAIAP2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs8079781 and the risk of behavioral problems in Japanese children aged 5 years. Subjects were 1175 mother-child pairs. Emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, and low prosocial behavior were assessed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Compared with the CC genotype of SNP rs8079781, at least one T allele was significantly inversely related to childhood emotional problems: the adjusted OR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.998, P = 0.049). Nevertheless, this significant inverse association disappeared after adjustment for multiple comparisons (adjusted P = 0.245). No associations were observed between SNP rs8079781 and childhood conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, or low prosocial behavior. An independent positive relationship was observed between smoking in the household during the first year of life and emotional problems in children with the CC genotype, but not in those with at least one T allele (P for interaction = 0.04). This study is the first to show that at least one T allele of SNP rs8079781 was independently associated with a reduced risk of emotional problems in children aged 5 years, but this inverse association fell below significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of COVID-19-related state closures on consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, while controlling for changes in COVID-19 incidence and death. DESIGN The analysis estimated a difference-in-difference model, utilizing temporal and geographic variation in state closure orders to analyze their impact on the economy, while controlling for COVID-19 incidence and death. PARTICIPANTS State-level data on economic outcomes from the Opportunity Insights data tracker and COVID-19 cases and death data from usafacts.org. INTERVENTIONS The mitigation strategy analyzed within this study was COVID-19-related state closure orders. Data on these orders were obtained from state government Web sites containing executive or administrative orders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes include state-level estimates of consumer spending, business revenue, and employment levels. RESULTS Analyses showed that although state closures led to a decrease in consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, they accounted for only a small portion of the observed decreases in these outcomes over the first wave of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity likely reflects a combination of factors, in addition to state closures, such as individuals' perceptions of risk related to COVID-19 incidence, which may play significant roles in impacting economic activity.","Dunphy, Christopher; Miller, Gabrielle F; Rice, Ketra; Vo, Linda; Sunshine, Gregory; McCord, Russell; Howard-Williams, Mara; Coronado, Fátima",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016904/,232

60967,Changing landscapes of death and burial practices: public health response in time of COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-07,"Digital datasets in several health care facilities, as hospitals and prehospital services, accumulated data from thousands of patients for more than a decade. In general, there is no local team with enough experts with the required different skills capable of analyzing them in entirety. The integration of those abilities usually demands a relatively long-period and is cost. Considering that scenario, this paper proposes a new Feature Sensitivity technique that can automatically deal with a large dataset. It uses a criterion-based sampling strategy from the Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis. Called FS-opa, the new approach seems proper for dealing with any types of raw data from health centers and manipulate their entire datasets. Besides, FS-opa can find the principal features for the construction of inference models without depending on expert knowledge of the problem domain. The selected features can be combined with usual statistical or machine learning methods to perform predictions. The new method can mine entire datasets from scratch. FS-opa was evaluated using a relatively large dataset from electronic health records of mental disorder prehospital services in Brazil. Cox's approach was integrated to FS-opa to generate survival analysis models related to the length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, assuming that it is a relevant aspect that can benefit estimates of the efficiency of hospitals and the quality of patient treatments. Since FS-opa can work with raw datasets, no knowledge from the problem domain was used to obtain the preliminary prediction models found. Results show that FS-opa succeeded in performing a feature sensitivity analysis using only the raw data available. In this way, FS-opa can find the principal features without bias of an inference model, since the proposed method does not use it. Moreover, the experiments show that FS-opa can provide models with a useful trade-off according to their representativeness and parsimony. It can benefit further analyses by experts since they can focus on aspects that benefit problem modeling.","Gholi Zadeh Kharrat, Fatemeh; Shydeo Brandão Miyoshi, Newton; Cobre, Juliana; Mazzoncini De Azevedo-Marques, João; Mazzoncini de Azevedo-Marques, Paulo; Cláudio Botazzo Delbem, Alexandre",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609749/,232

Their early detection and management are usually overlooked in routine practice. This study aimed to explore preoperative nutritional status and its prognostic value in patients undergoing surgery for PC. METHODS Data from 73 patients who underwent surgery for PC from November 2015 to January 2018 at the General and Pancreatic Surgery Unit, The Pancreas Institute, University Hospital of Verona Hospital, Verona, Italy, were retrospectively evaluated. The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS)-2002 was used to evaluate the preoperative nutritional risk. Body composition was assessed using bioimpedance vectorial analysis (BIVA) on the day prior to surgery. The effect of clinical, pathological, and nutritional characteristics on overall survival (OS) was investigated using a Cox and logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS Most patients (80.8%) were at preoperative risk of malnutrition (NRS-2002 ≥ 3) despite a mean BMI of 24.1 kg/m2(± 4.3). Twenty-four patients (32.9%) received neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Preoperative NRS-2002 was significantly higher in this subset of patients (p = 0.026), with a significant difference by chemotherapy regimens (in favor of FOLFIRINOX, p = 0.035). In a multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factor for OS was the NRS-2002 score (HR 5.24, p = 0.013). Particularly, the likelihood of 2-year survival was higher in NRS < 3 (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Our analysis confirms that preoperative malnutrition has a detrimental impact on OS in PC patients undergoing radical surgery for PC. Careful preoperative nutritional evaluation of PC patients should be mandatory, especially in those who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy.","Trestini, Ilaria; Paiella, Salvatore; Sandini, Marta; Sperduti, Isabella; Elio, Giovanni; Pollini, Tommaso; Melisi, Davide; Auriemma, Alessandra; Soldà, Caterina; Bonaiuto, Clelia; Tregnago, Daniela; Avancini, Alice; Secchettin, Erica; Bonamini, Deborah; Lanza, Massimo; Pilotto, Sara; Malleo, Giuseppe; Salvia, Roberto; Bovo, Chiara; Gianotti, Luca; Bassi, Claudio; Milella, Michele",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08515-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388740/,232
61347,Distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Europe during the first 12 peak weeks of outbreak.,2021-03-01,"Fibromyalgia (FM) was frequently observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to evaluate the differences in psychiatric comorbidities and life adversities between patients with RA+FM (SFM) and people with primary FM (PFM). In a cross-sectional, observational study, patients with PFM and SFM underwent a structured interview for the lifetime diagnosis of major depression (MDD), panic (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and were assessed for childhood/adulthood adversities and FM-related symptoms severity. Thirty patients with PFM and forty with SFM were recruited. The univariate analysis showed that the lifetime rates of MDD were significantly higher in PFM vs SFM (76.7 % and 40% respectively, p <0.003), as well as the rates of PD (50 % and 15% respectively, p <0.003), whereas there was no difference in PTSD rates. The rates of sexual abuse and physical neglect were significantly higher in PFM patients vs SFM patients (p<0.005 and p<0.023). Life events occurring before FM onset were different in PFM and SFM groups. In the logistic regression model, lifetime PD and physical neglect remain independent risk factors for PFM. PFM and SFM differ in psychiatric comorbidities and environmental adversities, suggesting that common pathogenesis may develop through different pathways. This article is protected by copyright.

61788,Towards a syndemic public health response to COVID-19.,2021-01-07,"Background The 76-day lockdown of Wuhan city has successfully contained the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. However, to date few studies have evaluated the hospital bed shortage for COVID-19 during the lockdown and none for non-COVID-19 patients, although such data are important for better preparedness of the future outbreak. Methods We built a compartmental model to estimate the daily numbers of hospital bed shortage for patients with mild, severe and critical COVID-19, taking account of underreport and diagnosis delay. Results The maximal daily shortage of inpatient beds for mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients was 43,960 (95% confidence interval: 35,246, 52,929), 2,779 (1,395, 4,163) and 196 (143, 250) beds in early February 2020. An earlier or later lockdown would have greatly increased the shortage of hospital beds in Wuhan. The overwhelmed healthcare system might have delayed the provision of health care to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown. The second wave in Wuhan could have occurred in June 2020 if social distancing measures had waned in early March 2020. The hospital bed shortage was estimated much smaller in the potential second wave than in the first one. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the timing and strength of lockdown is important for the containment of the COVID-19 outbreaks. The healthcare needs of non-COVID-19 patients in the pandemic warrant more investigations.","Zhuang, Zian; Cao, Peihua; Zhao, Shi; Han, Lefei; He, Daihai; Yang, Lin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708827/,232
62017,Containing the first outbreak of COVID-19 in a healthcare setting in India: The sree chitra experience.,2020-06-01,"UNLABELLED A triple-detector, multipinhole SPECT system was optimally configured to perform simultaneous (201)Tl (stress)/(99m)Tc (rest) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using a protocol that permitted direct diagnostic comparison of this multipinhole SPECT system with conventional rotational SPECT. METHODS Both the rotational and the multipinhole SPECT systems used the same model gamma-detectors. The 2 systems were applied in tandem to study 26 patients with documented coronary status. Visual image evaluation of the MPI together with quantitative analysis using circumferential profile curves (CPC) were used for interpretation of stress/rest myocardial flow differences. A dual-peak attenuation compensation (DPAC) technique was applied to the stress (201)Tl multipinhole SPECT images by weighted combination of the images from the upper and lower peaks. RESULTS Detection of myocardial infarction by location and extent correlated closely, and correlation of differential flow changes between stress and rest indicated similar accuracy in terms of location and extent of myocardial blood flow differences as well. In addition, the application of DPAC clarified the multipinhole stress (201)Tl images through reduced background and increased statistics and also improved the relative superposition of the normalized CPC, especially for the inferior and more basal reconstructed regions. CONCLUSION The prototype 3-detector multipinhole SPECT system achieved diagnostic results comparable to those for rotational SPECT and required only a single image-acquisition session to generate stress/rest MPI and 16-segment poststress gated studies. This reduction in acquisition time significantly improves productivity without compromising diagnostic accuracy. In addition, DPAC is a useful adjunct to the multipinhole SPECT modality because it improves both the visual clarity of the stress images and the stress/rest quantitative comparability.","Steele, Peter P; Kirch, Dennis L; Koss, John E","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.107.040915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18552149/,232

A retrospective review was performed on the women who had received SPA surgeries from 2008 to 2018. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes including the incidence of postoperative incisional hernia were analyzed. There were 2498 Korean patients who received SPA surgeries for various gynecologic diseases. The median age of the patients was 40.3 ± 9.2 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 22.6 ± 3.2 kg/m2. A total of 3 postoperative incisional hernia occurred during the study period. Two patients whose fascial layers were closed in running sutures developed hernias 6 and 8 months after their operations. One patient whose fascial layers were closed in interrupted sutures developed hernia 11 months after her operation. The incidence of postoperative incisional hernia following SPA surgery is low in Asian women whose BMI is relatively lower than other patient populations. Interrupted suture technique may reduce postoperative incisional hernia by providing a distinct visualization of fascial layers during closure. Detailed descriptions of our surgical techniques of closing the port incision are provided.","Noh, Joseph J; Kim, Tae-Hyun; Kim, Chul-Jung; Kim, Tae-Joong",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74471-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33060799/,232
63049,Combating COVID-19-The role of robotics in managing public health and infectious diseases.,2020-03-25,"BACKGROUND The Japanese difficulty scoring system (DSS) was developed to assess the difficulty of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP). The study aimed to validate a modified DSS (mDSS) in a European high-volume center. METHODS Patients' clinical data underwent LDP for benign and malignant pancreatic lesion between September 2013 and February 2020 were reviewed. Expert laparoscopic surgeons performed the procedures. The mDSS consisted of seven variables, such as type of operation, malignancy, neoadjuvant therapy, pancreatic resection line, tumor close to major vessels, tumor extension to peripancreatic tissue, and left sided portal hypertension and/or splenomegaly. According to the difficulty level and previous score, the mDSS was subdivided into three classes: low, intermediate, and high. Surrogates of case complexity (operative time, intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirements, conversion rate) were used to validate the new scoring system. RESULTS The study population included 140 LDP. Ninety-five (68%), 35 (25%) and 10 (7%) patients belonged to low, intermediate, and high difficulty groups. The mDSS identified the complexity of the surgical case of the series for all the surrogates of complexity considered, namely conversion rate (p=0.004), operative time (p=0.033) and intraoperative blood loss (p=0.009). No differences were recorded in the postoperative outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSION The mDSS for LDP better stratified the pancreatic procedures according to their complexity. The new scoring system may allow an appropriate preoperative evaluation of surgical difficulty, facilitating LDP's training program. Future prospective studies are needed to validate the mDSS.","Deiro, G; De Pastena, M; Paiella, S; Balduzzi, A; Montagnini, G; Andreotti, E; Casetti, L; Landoni, L; Salvia, R; Esposito, A",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jhbp.1010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114743/,232

63378,Public health policies can reduce inequalities as we come out of lockdown.,2020-05-18,"INTRODUCTION The prevalence of children with overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide. Multicomponent interventions incorporating diet, physical activity and behavioural change have shown limited improvement to body mass index (BMI). However, the impact of psychotherapy is poorly explored. This systematic review aims to assess the effects of psychotherapeutic approaches for children with all degrees of overweight. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include randomised clinical trials involving children and adolescents between 0 and 18 years with overweight and obesity, irrespective of publication type, year, status or language up to April 2020. Psychotherapy will be compared with no intervention; wait list control; treatment as usual; sham psychotherapy or pharmaceutical placebo. The following databases will be searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and LILACS. Primary outcomes will be BMI z-score, quality of life measured by a validated scale and proportion of patients with serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be body weight, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and proportion of patients with non-serious adverse events. Exploratory outcomes will be body fat, muscle mass and serious adverse events. Study inclusion, data extraction and bias risk assessments will be conducted independently by at least two authors. We will assess risk of bias according to Cochrane guidelines and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care guidance. We will use meta-analysis and control risks of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis. The quality of the evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Tool. The systematic review will be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As individual patient data will not be included, we do not require ethics approval. This review will be published in a peer review journal.

65170,Public Health Crises In Comparison: China's Epidemic Response Policies From SARS To COVID-19.,2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND Although error identification and recovery skills are essential for the safe practice of surgery, they have not traditionally been taught or evaluated in residency training. This study validates a method for assessing error identification and recovery skills in surgical residents using a thoracoscopic lobectomy simulator. METHODS We developed a 5-station, simulator-based examination containing the most commonly encountered cognitive and technical errors occurring during division of the superior pulmonary vein for left upper lobectomy. Successful completion of each station requires identification and correction of these errors. Examinations were video recorded and scored in a blinded fashion using an examination-specific rating instrument evaluating task performance as well as error identification and recovery skills. Evidence of validity was collected in the categories of content, response process, internal structure, and relationship to other variables. RESULTS Fifteen general surgical residents (9 interns and 6 third-year residents) completed the examination. Interrater reliability was high, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.78 between 4 trained raters. Station scores ranged from 64% to 84% correct. All stations adequately discriminated between high- and low-performing residents, with discrimination ranging from 0.35 to 0.65. The overall examination score was significantly higher for intermediate residents than for interns (mean, 74 versus 64 of 90 possible; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The described simulator-based examination with embedded errors and its accompanying assessment tool can be used to measure error identification and recovery skills in surgical residents. This examination provides a valid method for comparing teaching strategies designed to improve error recognition and recovery to enhance patient safety.","Sternbach, Joel M; Wang, Kevin; El Khoury, Rym; Teitelbaum, Ezra N; Meyerson, Shari L",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.06.079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27659596/,232

Toward this end, we have identified a core peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated patients with COVID-19 who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression. Hence, contingent upon independent validation in other COVID-19 cohorts, individual traits within this signature may collectively and individually guide treatment options; offer insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis; and aid early, risk-based patient stratification that is particularly beneficial in phasic diseases such as COVID-19.","Laing, Adam G; Lorenc, Anna; Del Molino Del Barrio, Irene; Das, Abhishek; Fish, Matthew; Monin, Leticia; Muñoz-Ruiz, Miguel; McKenzie, Duncan R; Hayday, Thomas S; Francos-Quijorna, Isaac; Kamdar, Shraddha; Joseph, Magdalene; Davies, Daniel; Davis, Richard; Jennings, Aislinn; Zlatareva, Iva; Vantourout, Pierre; Wu, Yin; Sofra, Vasiliki; Cano, Florencia; Greco, Maria; Theodoridis, Efstathios; Freedman, Joshua; Gee, Sarah; Chan, Julie Nuo En; Ryan, Sarah; Bugallo-Blanco, Eva; Peterson, Pärt; Kisand, Kai; Haljasmägi, Liis; Chadli, Loubna; Moingeon, Philippe; Martinez, Lauren; Merrick, Blair; Bisnauthsing, Karen; Brooks, Kate; Ibrahim, Mohammad A A; Mason, Jeremy; Lopez Gomez, Federico; Babalola, Kola; Abdul-Jawad, Sultan; Cason, John; Mant, Christine; Seow, Jeffrey; Graham, Carl; Doores, Katie J; Di Rosa, Francesca; Edgeworth, Jonathan; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Hayday, Adrian C",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1038-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807934/,232
66147,COVID-19 crisis and increased risks of elder abuse in caregiving spaces.,2021-06-11,"PURPOSE Surgical esophagectomy is the gold standard treatment of early-stage esophageal cancer. The procedure is complicated with significant morbidity; the most severe complication being the anastomotic leakage. Anastomotic fistulas are reported in 5-25% of cases and are mainly due to gastric transplant ischemia. Here, we report our experience of ischemic pre-conditioning using preoperative arterial embolization (PreopAE) before esophagectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of all patients who underwent oncologic esophagectomy from 2008 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who received PreopAE, and a control group of patients who did not benefit from ischemic pre-conditioning. The target arteries selected for PreopAE were the splenic artery, left gastric artery, and right gastric artery. Evaluation of the results was based on anastomotic leakage, postoperative mortality, technical success of PreopAE, and complications related to the embolization procedure. RESULTS Forty-six patients underwent oncologic esophagectomy with PreopAE and 13 patients did not receive ischemic conditioning before surgery. Thirty-eight PreopAE were successfully performed (83%), but right gastric artery embolization failed for 8 patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 6 PreopAE patients (13%) and in 6 patients (46%) in the control group (p = 0.02). The mortality rate was 2% in the PreopAE group and 23% in the control group (p = 0.03). Eighteen patients suffered from partial splenic infarction after PreopAE, all treated conservatively. CONCLUSION Preoperative ischemic conditioning by arterial embolization before oncologic esophagectomy seems to be effective in preventing anastomotic leakage.","Ghelfi, Julien; Brichon, Pierre-Yves; Frandon, Julien; Boussat, Bastien; Bricault, Ivan; Ferretti, Gilbert; Guigard, Sébastien; Sengel, Christian",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1556-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28050659/,232

In a preregistered study, we hypothesized that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain modifications in the healthy population, not infected with the virus. We examined volumetric changes in 50 participants who underwent MRI scans before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in Israel. Their scans were compared with those of 50 control participants who were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. Following COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, the test group participants uniquely showed volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic induced transient volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety.

68753,The 1918 Influenza Pandemic Has Lessons for COVID-19: An Anthropology Student Perspective.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND The risk of brain swelling after dural opening is high in patients with midline shift undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery. Brain swelling may result in increased intracranial pressure, impeded tumor exposure, and adverse outcomes. Mannitol is recommended as a first-line dehydration treatment to reduce brain edema and enable brain relaxation during neurosurgery. Research has indicated that mannitol enhanced brain relaxation in patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery; however, these results need further confirmation, and the optimal mannitol dose has not yet been established. We propose to examine whether different doses of 20% mannitol improve brain relaxation in a dose-dependent manner when administered at the time of incision. We will examine patients with preexisting mass effects and midline shift undergoing elective supratentorial brain tumor surgery. METHODS This is a single-center, randomized controlled, parallel group trial that will be carried out at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated table. The study will include 220 patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery whose preoperative computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging results indicate a brain midline shift. Patients in group A, group B, and group C will receive dehydration treatment at incision with 20% mannitol solutions of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.4 g/kg, respectively, at a rate of 600 mL/h. The patients in the control group will not receive mannitol. The primary outcome is an improvement in intraoperative brain relaxation and dura tension after dehydration with mannitol. Secondary outcomes are postoperative outcomes and the incidence of mannitol side effects. DISCUSSION The aim of this study is to determine the optimal dose of 20% mannitol for intraoperative infusion. We will examine brain relaxation and outcome in patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery. If our results are positive, the study will indicate the optimal dose of mannitol to improve brain relaxation and avoid side effects during brain tumor surgery.

A plethora of neurochemical changes involved in the pathophysiological process of SCI may serve as a new source of biomarkers for patient outcomes. Five dogs were included in this study. We characterized the plasma cytokine profiles in acute phase (0, 1, and 3 days after SCI) and subacute phase (7, 14, and 21 days after SCI) with microarray analysis. The motor function recovery following SCI was monitored by Olby scores. The expression level of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, correlations with the Olby scores and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed. We identified 12 DEPs including 10 pro-inflammatory and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines during the 21-day study period. Among those, the expression levels of erythropoietin (EPO), IL-17A, and IFNγ significantly correlated with the Olby scores with R2 values of 0.870, 0.740, and 0.616, respectively. The results of the ROC analysis suggested that plasma EPO, IL-17A, and IFNγ exhibited a significant predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.656, 0.848, and 0.800 for EPO, IL-17A, and IFNγ, respectively. Our results provide a longitudinal description of the changes in plasma cytokine expression in the acute and subacute stages of canine SCI. These data reveal novel panels of inflammation-related cytokines which have the potential to be evaluated as biomarkers for predicting motor function prognosis after SCI.","Zhang, Lijian; Zhuang, Xiaoqing; Chen, Yao; Niu, Zhanfeng; Xia, Hechun",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-020-01575-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418163/,232

70800,Achieving Blood Pressure Targets and Antihypertensive Effects through Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Hypertension.,2020-11-16,"Accurate imaging of the lymphatic system can aid in cancer staging, optimize surgical procedures to reduce lymphedema, and may one day be a means of delivering intralymphatic therapy. The Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) concept has been pivotal in driving new imaging techniques. Metastasis to a SLN is a critical indicator of advanced disease. However, presently, few tools are available for imaging the lymphatics, and even fewer are available for locating the SLN for biopsy. Recently, new macromolecular agents, including gadolinium-labeled dendrimers, fluorescent quantum dots, and fluorescently-labeled immunoglobins, have been used to image the lymphatics and SLN with MRI and optical techniques, and new fluorescent nanoparticles such as upconverting nanocrystals are potential future agents. Additionally, multi-modality probes combining two modalities such as optical/MR dendrimers have been designed to provide both preoperative imaging, and intraoperative guidance during lymph node resections. These probes can map the lymphatic system for maximal therapeutic benefit while minimizing complications such as lymphedema. Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic spread of tumors offer the opportunity for more targeted imaging of the lymphatic system. Additionally, these imaging agents could be used as powerful research tools for tracking immunological cells and monitoring the immune response as well as providing the means to deliver lymphatic-targeted therapies. The future holds great promise for the translation of these methods to the clinic.","Lucarelli, Richard T; Ogawa, Mikako; Kosaka, Nobuyuki; Turkbey, Baris; Kobayashi, Hisataka; Choyke, Peter L",Lymphatic research and biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/lrb.2009.0021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20143919/,232

73737,Enhancing the WHO's Proposed Framework for Distributing COVID-19 Vaccines Among Countries.,2021-03-01,"The outbreak of COVID-19 poses unprecedent challenges to global health1. The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus RaTG132. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses3,4, whether SARS-CoV-2 has other hosts remains ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from a Malayan pangolin showed 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain within the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one noncritical amino acid difference. Results of comparative genomic analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. The Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 of 25 Malayan pangolins analyzed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against Pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins suggests that they have the potential to act as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.","Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhai, Junqiong; Feng, Yaoyu; Zhou, Niu; Zhang, Xu; Zou, Jie-Jian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Li, Xiaobing; Shen, Xuejuan; Zhang, Zhipeng; Shu, Fanfan; Huang, Wanyi; Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Chen, Rui-Ai; Wu, Ya-Jiang; Peng, Shi-Ming; Huang, Mian; Xie, Wei-Jun; Cai, Qin-Hui; Hou, Fang-Hui; Chen, Wu; Xiao, Lihua; Shen, Yongyi",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2313-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380510/,232

The data used herein is obtained from simulations of airflow dynamics and deposition fractions of drug particle aerosols in the downstream airways of asthma patients using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete particle motion (DPM). Three main parameters, including airflow rate, drug dose, and particle size, affecting aerosol deposition in the lungs of asthma patients are examined. The highest deposition fraction (DF) is obtained at the flow rate of 45 L·min-1, the drug dose of 200 μg·puff-1, and the particle diameter of 5 μm. The optimized combination of levels for the three parameters for maximum drug deposition is performed via the Taguchi method. The importance of the influencing factors rank as particle size > drug dose > flow rate. RSM reveals that the combination of 30 L·min-1, 5 μm, 200 μg·puff- has the highest deposition fraction. In part, this research also studied the deposition of bioaerosols contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus, and their lowest DF is 1.15%.

76706,Will There Be an Epidemic of Corollary Illnesses Linked to a COVID-19-Related Recession?,2020-05-14,"OBJECTIVES to describe and compare the effectiveness of national and local lockdowns in controlling the spread of COVID-19. METHODS a rapid review of published and grey literature on COVID-19 pandemic was conducted following predefined eligibility criteria by searching electronic databases, repositories of pre-print articles, websites and databases of international health, and research related institutions and organisations. RESULTS of 584 initially identified records up to 5 July 2020, 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies (No. 11) used the reproduction number (Rt) as a measure of effect and in all of them areduction of the estimated value at post-intervention period was found. The implementation of lockdown in 11 European countries was associated with an average 82% reduction of Rt, ranging from a posterior Rt of 0.44 (95%CI 0.26-0.61) for Norway to a posterior Rt of 0.82 (95%CI 0.73- 0.93) for Belgium. Changes in infection rates and transmission rates were estimated in 8 studies. Daily changes in infection rates ranged from -0.6% (Sweden) to -11.3% (Hubei and Guangdong provinces). Additionally, other studies reported a change in the trend of hospitalizations (Italy, Spain) and positive effects on the doubling time of cases (Hubei, China) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS results of this rapid review suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive. Rigorous research is warranted to evaluate which approach is the most effective in each stage of the epidemic and in specific social contexts, in particular addressing if these approaches should be implemented on the whole population or target specific risk groups.","Caristia, Silvia; Ferranti, Margherita; Skrami, Edira; Raffetti, Elena; Pierannunzio, Daniela; Palladino, Raffeele; Carle, Flavia; Saracci, Rodolfo; Badaloni, Chiara; Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Belleudi, Valeria; Ancona, Carla",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412795/,232

Symptoms of COVID-19 may vary from mild (fever, dry cough, shortness of breath) to severe pneumonia-like respiratory symptoms as exacerbation of disease occurs. Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptors which signify its higher transmission rate from person to person. Even though ACE-2 is significant in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation that exhibits protection to various organs, they play a significant role in COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Viral interferences with the ACE-2 peptidase activity are found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients leading to pro-inflammatory responses, hypertension and multi-organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is constrained to a variety of organ systems but surface ACE-2 receptors on lung epithelia are largely affected, that lead to pathological alterations in lung histology which may progress to respiratory failure. The viral tropism mainly occurs by the attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzymes-2 receptors in the host cell, thus drugs targeting ACE-2 expressions may arise as the future therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 infections.The innovative approach of repurposing of drugs has shown temporary effectiveness to the rising pandemic. This article mainly focuses on the prominence of ACE-2 receptors which are expressed during the COVID infections and repurposing strategy of available drug therapies.","Joseph, Sherin; Nair, Bhagyalakshmi; Nath, Lekshmi R",Current molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210204212024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563197/,232

BCG vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. BCG and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between BCG, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides (MPs) and NOD2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for ARI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, MPs have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. MPs and peptidoglycans containing MPs determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). MPs were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. MPs determine the NOD2-dependent ability of BCG to induce trained immunity. Probably, MPs provide NOD2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) as a NOD2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that MPs, in particular GMDP, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of BCG and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing ARI during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.01.200554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720635/,232

This high infection rate resulted in the spread of the virus in China, Europe, and, eventually, the rest of the world, including Mexico. At present, around 9 million people are infected, and around 470,000 have died worldwide. In this context, the need to generate protective immunity, and especially the generation of a vaccine that can protect the world population against infection in the shortest possible time, is a challenge that is being addressed in different countries using different strategies in multiple clinical trials. This opinion article will present the evidence of the induction of immune response in some of the viruses of the coronavirus family before COVID-19, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).

81609,On symbols and scripts: The politics of the American COVID-19 response.,2021-03-19,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? In order to discern information about testing modalities when assessing neuroplastic responses to squat resistance training, the present study investigated whether corticospinal and intracortical function was different between a joint-angle-matched isometric squat and isometric knee extension. What is the main finding and its importance? The present data show poor agreement of corticospinal and intracortical function between the isometric squat and isometric knee extension. The data reinforce the notion that task specificity is of the utmost importance for assessing neuroplasticity. ABSTRACT It has been suggested that task-specific changes in neurophysiological function (neuroplasticity) should be assessed using testing modalities that replicate the characteristics of the intervention. The squat is a commonly prescribed resistance exercise that has been shown to elicit changes in CNS function. However, previous studies have assessed squat-induced neuroplasticity using isometric knee extension, potentially confounding the results. The aim of the present study was to assess the agreement between corticospinal and intracortical activity relating to the knee extensors during isometric knee extension compared with an isometric squat task. Eleven males completed a neurophysiological assessment in an isometric squat (IS) and knee-extension (KE) task matched for joint angles (hip, knee and ankle). Single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered during isometric contractions at a range of intensities to assess short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and corticospinal excitability. Group mean values for SICI (70 ± 14 versus 63 ± 12% of unconditioned motor evoked potential during IS and KE, respectively) and corticospinal excitability (mean differences 2-5% of the maximal compound muscle action potential at 25, 50, 75 and 100% maximal voluntary contraction between the IS and KE) were not different between the two tasks (P > 0.05) in the vastus lateralis. However, limits of agreement were wide, with poor-to-moderate average intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (SICI, ICC3,1 = 0.15; corticospinal excitability, average ICC3,1 range = 0.0-0.63), indicating disparate corticospinal and intracortical activity between the IS and KE. These data highlight the importance of task specificity when assessing the modulation of corticospinal excitability and SICI in response to interventions resulting in neuroplastic changes.","Brownstein, Callum G; Ansdell, Paul; Škarabot, Jakob; Frazer, Ash; Kidgell, Dawson; Howatson, Glyn; Goodall, Stuart; Thomas, Kevin",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep086982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928769/,232

Care in both the inpatient and outpatient setting has transformed considerably. Driven by the need to reduce the use of personal protective equipment and exposure for patients and providers alike, we transitioned inpatient diabetes management services to largely ""virtual"" or remotely provided care at our hospital. Methods: Implementation of a diabetes co-management service under the direction of the University of North Carolina division of endocrinology was initiated in July 2019. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the diabetes service was largely transitioned to a virtual care model in March 2020. Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients were implemented. Glycemic outcomes from before and after transition to virtual care were evaluated. Results: Data over a 15-week period suggest that using virtual care for diabetes management in the hospital is feasible and can provide similar outcomes to traditional face-to-face care. Conclusion: Automatic consults for COVID-19 patients ensure that patients with serious illness receive specialized diabetes care. Transitioning to virtual care models does not limit the glycemic outcomes of inpatient diabetes care and should be employed to reduce patient and provider exposure in the setting of COVID-19. These findings may have implications for reducing nosocomial infection in less challenging times and might address shortage of health care providers, especially in the remote areas.","Jones, Morgan S; Goley, April L; Alexander, Bonnie E; Keller, Scott B; Caldwell, Marie M; Buse, John B",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2020.0206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396395/,232

This study compared the outcomes of circular stapled anastomoses with semi-mechanical technique using a linear stapler. METHODS Perioperative data were extracted from a contemporaneously collected database of all consecutive esophagectomies for cancer with intrathoracic anastomoses performed in the Trent Oesophago-Gastric Unit between January 2015 and April 2018. Anastomotic techniques: circular stapled versus semi-mechanical, were evaluated and outcomes were compared. The primary outcome was anastomotic leak rate. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic stricture, overall complication rates, length of stay (LOS) and 30 day all-cause mortality. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-nine consecutive esophagectomies with intrathoracic anastomosis were performed during the study period. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, Charlson comorbidity index and neoadjuvant therapies received. Circular stapled anastomoses were performed in 85 patients, while 74 patients received a semi-mechanical anastomosis. Clavien-Dindo complications II or more were higher in the circular stapled group (p = 0.02). There were 16 (10%) anastomotic leaks overall, three (4%) in semi-mechanical group versus 13 (15%) in the circular stapled group (p < 0.019). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of LOS, 30-day mortality or the need for endoscopic dilatation of the anastomosis at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSION The move from a circular stapled to a semi-mechanical intrathoracic anastomosis has been associated with a reduced postoperative anastomotic leak rate following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.","Yanni, Fady; Singh, Pritam; Tewari, Nilanjana; Parsons, Simon L; Catton, James A; Duffy, John; Welch, Neil T; Vohra, Ravinder S",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05057-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222637/,232
83375,The Health Behavior Model of Personality in the Context of a Public Health Crisis.,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND Hereditary transthyretin (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, systemic, progressive, and life-threatening disease in which transthyretin proteins misfold and aggregate as insoluble amyloid deposits, disrupting nervous, cardiac, gastrointestinal, and other organ tissues. There are limited available data about the experience of patients living with hATTR amyloidosis. This study used a qualitative, non-interventional design to explore the humanistic burden of hATTR amyloidosis from the patient's perspective. RESULTS Fourteen adults with hATTR amyloidosis, recruited from a patient advocacy group or an academic clinical center, participated in individual semi-structured interviews either in person or by telephone. Patients were asked to describe their experiences living with the condition, including symptoms and disease-related impacts on functioning and well-being, work, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for key concepts using a grounded theory approach. Patients described many symptoms of hATTR amyloidosis, particularly those associated with peripheral neuropathy such as pain, numbness, weakness, and paresthesia. Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction, and symptoms related to cardiac dysfunction were also common. Worsening symptoms, especially those impacting patients' ability to walk or use their hands, often led to a loss of autonomy and an inability to work or perform ADLs. Disease-related disability also interfered with patients' participation in social activities, and contributed to feelings of fear, frustration, or sadness. CONCLUSIONS The impacts of hATTR amyloidosis were profound for the patients interviewed for this study. They described a sense of loss as their condition progressed and impacted them physically, emotionally, and socially. Patients' reports of symptoms and impacts of hATTR amyloidosis illustrate the complex and varied manifestations of this disease. The progression of symptoms and increasing impacts of hATTR amyloidosis also highlight the need for an earlier diagnosis and effective clinical intervention to preserve patients' functioning and well-being.","Lovley, Andrew; Raymond, Kimberly; Guthrie, Spencer D; Pollock, Michael; Sanchorawala, Vaishali; White, Michelle K",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-020-00273-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411323/,232

85742,School Closures During COVID-19: Opportunities for Innovation in Meal Service.,2020-09-17,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are ~95% effective in preventing coronavirus disease 20191-5. The dynamics of antibody secreting plasmablasts (PBs) and germinal centre (GC) B cells induced by these vaccines in humans remain unclear. We examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n=41) and draining lymph nodes (LNs) in 14 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene1. Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting PBs targeting the S protein peaked one week after the second immunization then declined, becoming undetectable three weeks later. These PB responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serologic responses. By examining fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of draining axillary LNs, we identified GC B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were sustained in these draining LNs for at least twelve weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the receptor binding domain of the S protein, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. The latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation compared to those that only recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity.","Turner, Jackson S; O'Halloran, Jane A; Kalaidina, Elizaveta; Kim, Wooseob; Schmitz, Aaron J; Zhou, Julian Q; Lei, Tingting; Thapa, Mahima; Chen, Rita E; Case, James Brett; Amanat, Fatima; Rauseo, Adriana M; Haile, Alem; Xie, Xuping; Klebert, Michael K; Suessen, Teresa; Middleton, William D; Shi, Pei-Yong; Krammer, Florian; Teefey, Sharlene A; Diamond, Michael S; Presti, Rachel M; Ellebedy, Ali H",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03738-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182569/,232
86479,Incentivized Public Service Response to COVID-19 in Rural and Marginalized Urban Communities.,2020-09-01,"Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) is a myosin activator (myotrope), developed as a potential therapeutic agent for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. To characterize the potential pro-arrhythmic risk of this novel sarcomere activator, we evaluated OM in a series of International Conference on Harmonization S7B core and follow-up assays, including an in silico action potential (AP) model. OM was tested in: (i) hERG, Nav1.5 peak, and Cav1.2 channel assays; (ii) in silico computation in a human ventricular AP (hVAP) population model; (iii) AP recordings in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers (PF); and (iv) electrocardiography analysis in isolated rabbit hearts (IRHs). OM had low potency in the hERG (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50 ] = 125.5 µM) and Nav1.5 and Cav1.2 assays (IC50 > 300 µM). These potency values were used as inputs to investigate the occurrence of repolarization abnormalities (biomarkers of pro-arrhythmia) in an hVAP model over a wide range of OM concentrations. The outcome of hVAP analysis indicated low pro-arrhythmia risk at OM concentration up to 30 µM (100-fold the effective free therapeutic plasma concentration). In the isolated canine PF assay, OM shortened AP duration (APD)60 and APD90 significantly from 3 to 30 µM. In perfused IRH, ventricular repolarization (corrected QT and corrected JT intervals) was decreased significantly at greater than or equal to 1 µM OM. In summary, the comprehensive proarrhythmic assessment in human and non-rodent cardiac models provided data indicative that OM did not delay ventricular repolarization at therapeutic relevant concentrations, consistent with clinical findings.","Qu, Yusheng; Gao, BaoXi; Arimura, Ziva; Fang, Mei; Vargas, Hugo M",Clinical and translational science,https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.13039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955165/,232

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Departments of Infection Disease, Internal Medicine and Radiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between March and May 2020. METHODOLOGY This study was consisted of 100 adult patients having rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 pneumonia diagnossed by thorax CT. The clinical features, thorax USG and CT findings of these patients were recorded and expressed. USG and thorax CT findings were scored using a method described before. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (±SD) values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for the normal distribution test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. USG and CT performed at time of admission to the hospital. Descriptive statistics were conducted based on the structures of variable. RESULTS A total of 100 patients (54 men and 46 women; mean age, 59.88±13.03 years; range, 28-91years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Involvement areas on the lower posterior of the right side were detected as 70% by ultrasound and 74% by CT. Positively correlation was detected in lung scans assessed by USG and CT (p<0.001, r=0.705). CONCLUSION Ultrasound has several advantages including no ionizing radiation exposure for health care workers, being a safe, fast and non-invasive diagnostic technique with bedside usage. Hence, ultrasound is an efficient alternative to diagnosis and monitor of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

87051,Capacity building of Public Health Nursing Officers on delivering psychosocial oncology care in Sri Lanka.,2020-10-21,"The major route of entry for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) into human host cells is by means of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) transmembrane receptor. This zinc-containing carboxypeptidase and membrane-integral surface receptor is ubiquitous and widely expressed in multiple cell types. Hence SARS-CoV-2, an unusually large RNA virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the remarkable capacity to invade many different types of human host cells simultaneously. Although COVID-19 is generally considered to be primarily an acute respiratory disease SARS-CoV-2 also targets specific anatomical regions of the central nervous system (CNS). In the normal CNS the highest ACE2 levels of expression are found within the medullary respiratory centers of the brainstem and this, in part, may explain the susceptibility of numerous COVID-19 patients to severe respiratory distress. About ~35% of all COVID-19 patients experience neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a pre-existing diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) predicts the highest risk of COVID-19 yet identified, with the highest mortality among elderly AD patients. In the current study of multiple anatomical regions of AD brains compared to age-, post-mortem interval- and gender-matched controls (n = 10 regions, n = 32 brains), ACE2 expression was found to be significantly up-regulated in AD in the occipital lobe, temporal lobe neocortex and hippocampal CA1. The temporal lobe and hippocampus of the brain are also targeted by the inflammatory neuropathology that accompanies AD, suggesting a significant mechanistic overlap between COVID-19 and AD, strongly centered on invasion by the neurotropic SARS-CoV-2 virus via the increased presence of ACE2 receptors in limbic regions of the AD-affected brain.","Zhao, Yuhai; Li, Wenhong; Lukiw, Walter",Folia neuropathologica,https://doi.org/10.5114/fn.2021.109495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34628788/,232

Data were collected in the year prior to the hurricane as well as approximately 1 and 3 years thereafter. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), we detected 6 distinct trajectory groups. Over half of the participants fit into a trajectory consistent with resilience; that is, they maintained low levels of psychological distress over the course of the study, but experienced an elevation in symptoms at the first predisaster time point followed by a return to predisaster levels. The other trajectories reflected a range of psychological responses to disasters and indicated that predisaster functioning had a major influence on postdisaster psychological outcomes. Degree of exposure to hurricane-related stressors, experiences of human and pet bereavement, perceived social support, and socioeconomic status were significant predictors of trajectory group membership.

The aim was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among staff to clarify the impact of different risk factors for infection. The entire staff of the otolaryngology unit was tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Symptomatic staff members were tested with nasal/pharyngeal swabs. All answered a survey focused on the number of in- and extrahospital positive contacts and type of activities in the unit. Five (9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The only variable associated with a higher risk of infection was the number of extrahospital contacts without personal protective equipment (P = .008). Our study shows that in non-COVID-19 departments, the use of adequate personal protective equipment leads to low rates of infection among health care workers.

Therefore, there is great concern about susceptibility to the outcome of COVID-19-infected patients with MM. This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by myeloma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were performed for hospitalized MM patients. Among hospitalized patients, the median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, International Staging System stage 3 (ISS3), high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and 1 or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis, nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient- and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID-19 infection.","Chari, Ajai; Samur, Mehmet Kemal; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin; Cook, Gordon; Biran, Noa; Yong, Kwee; Hungria, Vania; Engelhardt, Monika; Gay, Francesca; García Feria, Ana; Oliva, Stefania; Oostvogels, Rimke; Gozzetti, Alessandro; Rosenbaum, Cara; Kumar, Shaji; Stadtmauer, Edward A; Einsele, Hermann; Beksac, Meral; Weisel, Katja; Anderson, Kenneth C; Mateos, María-Victoria; Moreau, Philippe; San-Miguel, Jesus; Munshi, Nikhil C; Avet-Loiseau, Hervé",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020008150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367546/,232

90589,COVID-19 on TikTok: harnessing an emerging social media platform to convey important public health messages.,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Modern treatment strategies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are postulated to change the natural disease course. Inception cohort studies are the gold standard for investigating such changes. We have initiated a new population-based inception cohort study; Inflammatory bowel disease in South Eastern Norway III (IBSEN III). In this article, we describe the study protocol and baseline characteristics of the cohort. METHODS IBSEN III is an ongoing, population-based observational inception cohort study with prospective follow-up. Adult and pediatric patients with suspected IBD in the South-Eastern Health Region of Norway (catchment area of 2.95 million inhabitants in 2017), during the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019, were eligible for inclusion. Comprehensive clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, demographic, and patient-reported data were collected at the time of diagnosis and throughout standardized follow-up. For a portion of the patients, extensive biological material was biobanked. RESULTS The study included 2168 patients, of whom 1779 were diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease: 626, ulcerative colitis: 1082, IBD unclassified: 71). In 124 patients, there were subtle findings indicative of, but not diagnostic for, IBD. The remaining 265 patients were classified as symptomatic non-IBD controls. CONCLUSION We have included patients in a comprehensive population-based IBD cohort from a catchment population of 2.95 million, and a unique biobank with materials from newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve IBD patients and symptomatic non-IBD controls. We believe this cohort will add important knowledge about IBD in the years to come.","Kristensen, Vendel A; Opheim, Randi; Perminow, Gøri; Huppertz-Hauss, Gert; Detlie, Trond Espen; Lund, Charlotte; Andersen, Svend; Olsen, Bjørn C; Johansen, Ingunn; Medhus, Asle W; Vatn, Simen; Brackmann, Stephan; Olbjørn, Christine; Rove, Jon; Henriksen, Magne; Løvlund, Emma Elisabeth; Bengtson, May-Bente; Aabrekk, Tone Bergene; Tønnessen, Tor; Vikskjold, Florin Berge; Yassin, Hussain; Frigstad, Svein Oskar; Hasund, Audun; Høie, Ole; Schmidt, Katharina; Cetinkaya, Raziye Boyar; Torp, Roald; Skogestad, Erik; Holm, Hans Kristian; Ahmad, Tahir Riaz; Hovde, Øistein; Ystrøm, Carl Magnus; Aballi, Batool; Sagosen, Arnt; Pedersen, Aina; Dahler, Stein; Pallenschat, Jens; Ricanek, Petr; Høivik, Marte Lie",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.1922746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154494/,232

Black Soldier Fly (BSF) biowaste treatment is an attractive treatment option as it offers a solution for waste management while also providing a protein source to help alleviate the rising global demand for animal feed. However, to-date very little information is available on how this technology performs with regard to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP). This paper presents a study that uses a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to assess the GWP of a BSF waste treatment facility in the case of Indonesia and compares it with respective values for an open windrow composting facility. Direct CH4 and N2O samples were extracted from BSF treatment units and analyzed by gas chromatography. Results show that direct CO2eq emissions are 47 times lower the emissions from composting. Regarding the overall GWP, the LCA shows that composting has double the GWP of BSF treatment facility based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biowaste (wet weight). The main GWP contribution from a BSF facility are from: (1) residue post-composting (69%) and (2) electricity needs and source (up to 55%). Fishmeal production substitution by BSF larvae meal can reduce significantly the GWP (up to 30%). Based on this study, we conclude that BSF biowaste treatment offers an environmentally relevant alternative with very low direct GHG emissions and potentially high GWP reduction. Further research should improve residue post-treatment.","Mertenat, Adeline; Diener, Stefan; Zurbrügg, Christian",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.11.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691890/,232

Patients implanted with DBS require life-long management of the medical device as well as medications. Patients are often challenged to frequently visit the specialized DBS centers and such challenges are aggravated depending on geography, socioeconomic factors, and support systems. We discuss the need for digital health solutions to overcome these barriers to better and safely take care of patients, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of the literature was conducted for technology and logistics necessary in forming a digital health program. RESULTS Digital health encounters can take place in both a synchronous and asynchronous manner. Factors involving patients include cognitive capacity, physical safety, physical capacity, connectivity, and technological security. Physician factors include examining the patient, system diagnostics, and adjusting stimulation or medications. Technology is focused on bridging the gap between patient and physician through integrating the DBS lead, implantable pulse generator (IPG), programmer, novel devices/applications to grade motor function, and teleconference modalities. CONCLUSIONS For patients with Parkinson's disease, digital health has the potential to drastically change the landscape after DBS surgery. Furthermore, technology is fundamental in connectivity, diagnostic evaluation, and security in order to create stable and useful patient-focused care.","Rammo, Richard; Gostkowski, Michal; Rasmussen, Peter A; Nagel, Sean; Machado, Andre",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.13307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174292/,232

METHODS A consecutive sample of 15 ICU patients with COVID-19 was treated with oXiris membrane for blood purification or for support of renal function due to acute kidney injury. We have included 19 non treated ICU COVID-19 patients as a control group. Two chest X-rays were analyzed for determining the chest x-ray severity score. RESULTS We have found a significant decrease of SOFA score, respiratory status improved and the chest X-ray severity score was significantly decreased after 72h of treatment. Il-6 significantly decreased after 72h of treatment while other inflammatory markers did not. Respiratory status in the control group worsened as well as increase in SOFA score and chest X-ray severity score. Survived patients have shorter time from the onset of symptoms before starting with extracorporeal blood purification treatment and shorter time on vasoactive therapy and invasive respiratory support than deceased patients. CONCLUSION Critically-ill patients with COVID-19 treated with extracorporeal blood purification survived significantly longer than other ICU COVID-19 patients. Treatment with oXiris membrane provides significant reduction of Il-6, leads to improvement in respiratory status, chest X-ray severity score, and reduction of SOFA score severity. Our results can suggest that ICU COVID-19 patients in an early course of a disease could be potentially a target group for earlier initiation of extracorporeal blood purification.

Data were obtained from 8 tertiary centers in 8 countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Turkey, Singapore, India, Pakistan, and Japan. The correlation between the number of patients with COVID-19 per 1 million population vs. the maximum number of inpatients with COVID-19 in a representative tertiary hospital in each country was determined, as was the correlation between COVID-19 deaths per 1 million population vs. the maximum number of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). What was noteworthy was that none of the 8 hospitals reduced emergency room (ER) activity even at the peak of the pandemic although treatment of patients without COVID-19 decreased by 0-70% depending on the extent of the epidemic. Although various measures are being actively implemented to slow the spread of the virus and reduce the strain on the health care system, the reality is that there are still a significant number of hospitals at risk of being overloaded in the event of a future surge in cases.","Kokudo, Norihiro; Sugiyama, Haruhito",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2021.01031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937565/,232

As this human pandemic virus has spread across the world, the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on native North American bat populations are unknown, as is the ability of North American bats to serve as reservoirs or intermediate hosts able to transmit the virus to humans or to other animal species. To help determine the impacts of the pandemic virus on North American bat populations, we experimentally challenged big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-3 conditions. We inoculated the bats both oropharyngeally and nasally, and over the ensuing three weeks we measured infectivity, pathology, virus concentrations in tissues, oral and rectal virus excretion, virus transmission, and clinical signs of disease. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any examined bat, including no viral excretion, no transmission, no detectable virus in tissues, and no signs of disease or pathology. Based on our findings it appears that big brown bats are resistant to infection with the SARS-CoV-2. The potential susceptibility of other North American bat species to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated.","Hall, Jeffrey S; Knowles, Susan; Nashold, Sean W; Ip, Hon S; Leon, Ariel E; Rocke, Tonie; Keller, Saskia; Carossino, Mariano; Balasuriya, Udeni; Hofmeister, Erik",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295095/,232

However, the application of laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. RESULTS Between May 2016 and May 2018, twenty-five consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy: eighteen patients (72%) underwent distal gastrectomy, four patients (16%) underwent total gastrectomy, and three patients (12%) underwent proximal gastrectomy. The median number of lymph nodes retrieved was 18 (5-35). A positive proximal margin was detected in 2 patients (8%). The median operative time and amount of blood loss were 240 min (200-330) and 250 ml (200-450), respectively. Conversion to an open procedure was performed in seven patients (28%). The median hospital stay period was 8 days (6-30), and the median time to start oral fluids was 4 days (3-30). Postoperative complications were detected in 4 patients (16%). There were two cases of mortality (8%) in the postoperative period, and two patients required reoperation (8%).

Expectant women experienced unexpected social disruption and isolation within their day-to-day life that have not been described in their own voice. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of women who became mothers during the outbreak and the ways in which these experiences impacted their early post-partum mothering. A phenomenological research design was chosen. The participants' responses then led the interview process. As the women's experiences had many similarities, saturation was reached after eight interviews. Four themes emerged: living with uncertainty, intense vigilance, isolation, and disrupted expectations. The participants spoke of disrupted daily routines as they tried to eliminate their risk of contracting this disease, including relationship difficulties with their spouse. None of the women had the birth experience they had hoped for because of changes in hospital practices.","Dodgson, Joan E; Tarrant, Marie; Chee, Yuet-Oi; Watkins, Amanda",Nursing & health sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-2018.2010.00520.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20602692/,232

We aimed to assess the association between mtTKIs treatment and appearance of SMF on computed tomography (CT). METHODS We performed retrospective evaluation of patients who started mtTKI treatment between 2016 and 2018, with a comparison patient cohort treated with single-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stTKIs). SMF amount for each gastrointestinal tract segment (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, terminal ileum, right colon, left colon) was scored as follows: 0 = none; 1 = low amount (<2 mm thick); 2 = high amount (>2 mm layer). For each CT, segment scores were aggregated to create an SMF index (SMFI). Maximal increase in SMFI between pretreatment and posttreatment CTs was documented. SMF ⩾3 was defined as positive. RESULTS Forty patients treated with mtTKIs and 23 patients receiving stTKIs were included. Maximal increase in SMFI during treatment was 0-1 in 56/63 patients (89%) and 3-6 in 7/63 patients (11%). All patients with positive SMFI received mtTKIs compared to 0 patients treated with stTKIs (17.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.04). mtTKI treatment was associated with higher incidence of nausea/vomiting (4/7) and diarrhea (4/7) when positive SMF was noted, as compared to patients with negative SMF (6/33 patients each; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION Gastrointestinal tract SMF deposition occurs in a considerable proportion of patients treated with mtTKIs with association to abdominal symptoms. This may be unique to mtTKIs and was not found in patients receiving stTKIs.","Tamir, Shlomit; Gavrielli, Shlomo; Abitbol, Chen; Tau, Noam; Grubstein, Ahuva; Neiman, Victoria; Yosef, Lilach; Atar, Eli; Zer, Alona",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891621995893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594961/,232

An experiment was carried out to determine the response of digestibility, growth performance, and carcass quality in local Kandol pigs to incremental levels of FBS in rations. A total of 20 castrated male pigs were randomly allocated to five diets, containing 0, 400, 500, 600, and 700 g FBS of the ration. Daily feed on offer was provided as 4% of the body weight on a dry matter basis and offered three times per day. As result, the inclusion level of FBS was positively correlated with NR (p < 0.001, r = 0.68). The linear regression equation was y = 0.002x + 2.4276 (R2 = 0.63). Furthermore, it was also correlated with ADG (p < 0.05, r = 0.46) and with FCR (p < 0.05, r = - 0.45). The regression equation was y = 0.0634x + 174.2 (R2 = 0.43) and y = - 0.0009x + 4.6521 (R2 = 0.62) for ADG and FCR, respectively. The correlation between inclusion level of FBS and large intestine weight was also observed (p < 0.05, r = - 0.61). The R2 value was 63. However, there was no any correlation between the inclusion level of FBS and the percentages of hanging carcass, dressing carcass, pH, color score, marbling score of the meat, and WHC (p > 0.05). The economic benefit of using FBS to improve pig diets will depend on the availability of banana stems and the labor and processing costs.","Huy, Sokchea; Khieu, Borin; Chhay, Ty; Philp, Joshua N M; Le, Ngoan Duc; Tran, Hong Thi Thu",Tropical animal health and production,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-020-02488-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423094/,232
109125,Environmental Health Threats to Latino Migrant Farmworkers.,2021-01-04,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein (S) is a class I viral fusion protein that binds to its receptor glycoprotein, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and mediates virus entry and cell-cell fusion. The juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of S is an aromatic amino acid-rich region proximal to the transmembrane domain that is highly conserved in all coronaviruses. Alanine substitutions for one or two of the six aromatic residues in the JMD did not alter the surface expression of the SARS-CoV S proteins with a deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids (S Delta19) or reduce binding to soluble human ACE2 (hACE2). However, hACE2-dependent entry of trypsin-treated retrovirus pseudotyped viruses expressing JMD mutant S Delta19 proteins was greatly reduced. Single alanine substitutions for aromatic residues reduced entry to 10 to 60% of the wild-type level. The greatest reduction was caused by residues nearest the transmembrane domain. Four double alanine substitutions reduced entry to 5 to 10% of the wild-type level. Rapid hACE2-dependent S-mediated cell-cell fusion was reduced to 60 to 70% of the wild-type level for all single alanine substitutions and the Y1188A/Y1191A protein. S Delta19 proteins with other double alanine substitutions reduced cell-cell fusion further, from 40% to less than 20% of wild-type levels. The aromatic amino acids in the JMD of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein play critical roles in receptor-dependent virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. Because the JMD is so highly conserved in all coronavirus S proteins, it is a potential target for development of drugs that may inhibit virus entry and/or cell-cell fusion mediated by S proteins of all coronaviruses.","Howard, Megan W; Travanty, Emily A; Jeffers, Scott A; Smith, M K; Wennier, Sonia T; Thackray, Larissa B; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01805-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199653/,232

AIM To describe nursing leaders' experiences with reorganizing healthcare pathways, through management data and personal accounts. METHODS A retrospective quali-quantitative observational study was conducted at the Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, with 484 beds and over 1,700 workers. Quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistical indices and integrated with qualitative data collected through semi-structured telephone interviews. The analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data provided an objective and experiential representation of the implemented interventions. RESULTS We described the impact of interventions introduced by the nursing leadership during the pandemic on hospital services. In particular, the reorganization of the emergency department and of the prevention and psychological support services for the hospital's health workers. In addition, specific initiatives to support the discharge of COVID-19 positive patients, and to support and manage contacts with family members both during the hospitalization of their loved ones and following death are described. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study contributes to the discussion on some crucial issues: the increasingly clear relationship between adequate staffing and safety of patients and professionals, the importance of a good working environment and a solid leadership, the importance of continuing education for professionals and adequate skill mixes; all highlighted by the pandemic.","Costamagna, Gabriella; Dasso, Nicoletta; Ottonello, Giulia; Zanini, Milko; Catania, Gianluca; Sasso, Loredana; Bagnasco, Annamaria",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2021.741021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089638/,232

The type and severity of inflammation varied between nerve roots, being composed of mainly neutrophils in some and mainly lymphocytes and macrophages in others. Immunohistochemistry showed a combination of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrating the nerve roots and ganglia. The majority of the lymphocytes were T lymphocytes; only a few B lymphocytes were seen. Neurons within the affected ganglia showed central chromatolysis and necrosis. Wallerian-like degeneration and demyelination were observed in the nerve roots. A sensory and motor polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed.

118120,Reopening the United States: Black and Hispanic Workers Are Essential and Expendable Again.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES Regulatory changes requiring the use of capnographic monitoring for endoscopic procedures using moderate sedation have placed financial challenges on ambulatory and hospital endoscopy centers across the United States due to the increased cost of training endoscopy personnel and purchasing both capnography-monitoring devices and specialized sampling ports. To date, there has been no published data supporting the use of capnographic monitoring in adult patients undergoing routine endoscopic procedures with moderate sedation. The aim of this randomized, parallel group assignment trial was to determine whether intervention based on capnographic monitoring improves detection of hypoxemia in patients undergoing routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or colonoscopy with moderate sedation. METHODS Healthy patients (ASA Physical Classification (ASAPS) I and II)) scheduled for routine outpatient EGD or colonoscopy under moderate sedation utilizing opioid and benzodiazepine combinations were randomly assigned to a blinded capnography alarm or open capnography alarm group. In both study arms, standard cardiopulmonary monitoring devices were utilized with additional capnographic monitoring. The primary end point was the incidence of hypoxemia defined as a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO2) to <90% for ≥10 s. Secondary outcomes included severe hypoxemia, apnea, disordered respirations, hypotension, bradycardia, and early procedure termination for any cause. RESULTS A total of 452 patients were randomized; 218 in the EGD and 234 in the colonoscopy groups; 75 subjects in the EGD group (35.9%) and 114 patients (49.4%) in the colonoscopy group were male, and average body mass index was 27.9 and 29.1 (kg/m(2)), respectively. The blinded and open alarm groups in each study arm were similar in regards to use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines and ASAPS classification. There was no significant difference in rates of hypoxemia between the blinded and open capnography arms for EGD (54.1% vs. 49.5; P=0.5) or colonoscopy (53.8 vs. 52.1%; P=0.79). CONCLUSIONS Capnographic monitoring in routine EGD or colonoscopy for ASAPS I and II patients does not reduce the incidence of hypoxemia (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01994785).","Mehta, Paresh P; Kochhar, Gursimran; Albeldawi, Mazen; Kirsh, Brian; Rizk, Maged; Putka, Brian; John, Binu; Wang, Yinghong; Breslaw, Nicole; Lopez, Rocio; Vargo, John J",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2015.437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902229/,232
118122,COVID-19's First Year: A Bipartisan Appraisal.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and the workload of nurses has increased. High workload can reduce efficiency and quality of life. In the meantime the percived social support may had a moderating role. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of workload and perceived social support on quality of life in nurses who work in COVID-19 inpatient wards. METHODS This was a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study. 336 nurses who worked in inpatient wards with COVID-19 patients were randomly selected and studied. NASA-TLX Workload Questionnaire, WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire and Multidimensional Social Support Perception Scale were used to data collection. Structural equation modelling in PLS software was used to modelling. RESULTS The results showed that the average score of workload, perceived social support and quality of life were 80.87±20.17, 56.23±11.46 and 55.87±13.74, respectively. A significant inverse relationship was observed between workload and quality of life (P < 0.05). Also, perceived social support had a moderator effect on relationship between workload and quality of life (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS High workload can upset the balance between work and life that leads to decrease the quality of life. Perceived social support as a moderator can reduce the negative impact of workload on quality of life. In the COVID-19 pandemic where nurses' workload have increased, by increasing the perceived social support can manage the negative effect of workload.","Ebrahimi, Hossein; Jafarjalal, Ezat; Lotfolahzadeh, Asghar; Kharghani Moghadam, Seyedeh Melika",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633341/,232

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. METHODS Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). RESULTS In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were three deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and one serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. CONCLUSION Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI.

The use of a rigid barrier disc (HeartShield™) has been suggested to offer protection against this lethal complication by preventing the heart from being drawn up by the negative pressure and damaged by the sharp sternum bone edges. Seven patients treated with conventional NPWT and seven patients treated with NPWT with a protective barrier disc (HeartShield) were compared with regard to bacterial clearance and infection parameters including C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts. C-reactive protein levels and leucocyte counts dropped faster and bacterial clearance occurred earlier in the HeartShield® group compared with the conventional NPWT group. Negative biopsy cultures were shown after 3·1 ± 0·4 NPWT dressing changes in the HeartShield group, and after 5·4 ± 0·6 NPWT dressing changes in the conventional NPWT group (P < 0·001). All patients were followed up with clinical check-up after 3 months. None of the patients in the HeartShield group had any signs of reinfection such as deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) or sternal fistulas, whereas in the conventional NPWT group, two patients had signs of sternal fistulas that demanded hospitalisation. HeartShield hinders the right ventricle to come into contact with the sharp sternal edges during NPWT and thereby protects from heart damage. This study shows that using HeartShield is beneficial in treating patients with DSWI. Improved wound healing by HeartShield may be a result of the efficient drainage of wound effluents from the thoracic cavity.","Lindstedt, Sandra; Malmsjö, Malin; Ingemansson, Richard",International wound journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.12079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651118/,232

These disparities are in large measure the result of longstanding patterns of structural, interpersonal, and cultural racism in US society, which in aggregate represent an underpinning of systemic racism that permeates the long-term care system's organization, administration, regulations, and human services. Mechanisms underlying the role of systemic racism in producing the observed disparities are numerous. Long-term care is fundamentally tied to geography, thereby reflecting disparities associated with residential segregation. Additional foundational drivers include a fragmented payment system that advantages persons with financial resources, and reimbursement policies that systematically undervalue long-term care workers.

Methods From January 2007 to February 2015 200 patients underwent 207 endovascular procedures for carotid artery stenosis. Of all, 113 arteries (56.5%) were symptomatic. Significant changes across time were calculated with the use of Change Point analysis using bootstrap and mean squared error estimates. Results The technical success was 98.6% (204/207 cases). Thirty-day neurological events included stroke in four patients (2%) and transient ischemic attack in two (1%). None of the patients died during the first 30 days. The most significant change of radiation duration occurred after the 33rd patient with a decrease from 25.31 min to 12.31 min, while for the total operative time that change occurred between the 31st and 33rd patient where mean operation time decreased from 88.89 min to 49.22 min. The most significant change of contrast media used occurred at the 40th patient with a decrease from 91.58 ml to 62 ml. During a mean follow-up period of 42 ± 20.02 months none of the patients experienced any cerebrovascular event. There was one case of significant recurrent stenosis, which was successfully treated by endovascular means. Conclusions Endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis performed in a single center with the use of a cerebral protection device seems to consist a safe therapeutic choice with acceptable results, within the referenced benchmarks proposed in the latest guidelines. Certain perioperative parameters such as the amount of contrast media used, the fluoroscopy and operation time, seem to decline overtime indicating increasing operator's experience. A number of performed cases above 40 was related to the significant decrease of those parameters and may represent the learning curve of the procedure.","Kouvelos, George; Koutsoumpelis, Andreas; Arnaoutoglou, Eleni; Nassis, Christos; Bouris, Vasilios; Peroulis, Michalis; Papadopoulos, George; Matsagkas, Miltiadis",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/1708538117691431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28142887/,232
121796,Spatial analysis of hypothyroidism and ground water pH in an Urban Area of Kerala using the geographic information system.,2020,"BACKGROUND Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) is a debilitating complication of vaginal delivery which has yet to receive ample attention in adolescents. The aim of this study was to describe risk for OASI in adolescent mothers compared to adults. We further attempted to compare risk factors for OASI between these two age groups. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study between 2003 and 2019. Primiparous women who delivered vaginally, 21 years and younger were compared to women ages 26-35. Excluded were preterm, multifetal, non-vertex, cesarean deliveries as well as intrauterine fetal death. Rate of OASI as well as obstetric and labor characteristics of women with OASI, were compared between groups. Finally, risk factors were assessed for each group separately. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model were performed. RESULTS Final analysis was performed on 5113 nulliparous adolescents and 13,845 nulliparous in the 26-35 age group. Allocation to study groups was according to OASI - Sixty-seven adolescents (1.3%) had a 3rd or 4th degree perineal tear and were defined as the OASI group, while 5046 patients (98.7%) did not have such a tear. In the adult group, 199 out of 13,845 patients (1.4%) were diagnosed with OASI. Occurrence of OASI did not differ between groups (p = 0.510). Comparison of women with OASI in the adolescent group vs. adult group found differences with regard to operative vaginal delivery, (20.9% vs. 36.2%, respectively; p = 0.023) and meconium stained amniotic fluid (9.1% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.027). Following multivariate analysis the only parameter independently associated with OASI in the adolescent age group was head circumference ≥ 90th percentile with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.08 (CI 1.48-6.38, p = 0.003). In the adult group the similar analysis revealed operative vaginal delivery (OR = 2.44, CI 1.72-3.47, p < 0.001) and a birthweight≥90th percentile (OR = 2.23, CI 1.19-4.18, p = 0.012) to be independent risk factors for OASI. CONCLUSION Adolescents have similar risk for OASI compared to adults but differ in risk factors leading to OASI. Head circumference ≥ 90th percentile was found to be associated with OASI in this age group.","Chill, Henry H; Lipschuetz, Michal; Atias, Eyal; Shimonovitz, Tzvika; Shveiky, David; Karavani, Gilad",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04045-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407794/,232

123021,Career Transition During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Postdoc Perspective.,2021-06-01,"Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions. Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.","Feng, K; Yun, Y X; Wang, X F; Yang, G D; Zheng, Y J; Lin, C M; Wang, L F",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200210-00071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234131/,232

The use of opioids has been associated with noninfectious inflammatory masses at the tip of the intrathecal catheter, which can result in neurologic complications. METHODS The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference is a meeting of a group of well-published and experienced practitioners; the purpose of the meeting is to update the standard of care for intrathecal therapies to reflect current knowledge gleaned from literature and clinical experience. An exhaustive literature search was performed, and information from this search was provided to panel members. Analysis of the published literature was coupled with the clinical experience of panel participants to form recommendations regarding intrathecal inflammatory masses or granulomas. RESULTS The panel has made recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of intrathecal granulomas. CONCLUSION The use of chronic infusions of intrathecal opioids is associated with the formation of inflammatory masses at the intrathecal catheter tip in a small minority of treated patients. Nonetheless, the appearance of these space-occupying lesions can lead to devastating neurologic sequelae. The prevention, early detection, and successful treatment of intraspinal granulomas are important considerations when offering intrathecal drug therapy to patients with chronic intractable pain.","Deer, Timothy R; Prager, Joshua; Levy, Robert; Rathmell, James; Buchser, Eric; Burton, Allen; Caraway, David; Cousins, Michael; De Andrés, José; Diwan, Sudhir; Erdek, Michael; Grigsby, Eric; Huntoon, Marc; Jacobs, Marilyn S; Kim, Philip; Kumar, Krishna; Leong, Michael; Liem, Liong; McDowell, Gladstone C; Panchal, Sunil; Rauck, Richard; Saulino, Michael; Sitzman, B Todd; Staats, Peter; Stanton-Hicks, Michael; Stearns, Lisa; Wallace, Mark; Willis, K Dean; Witt, William; Yaksh, Tony; Mekhail, Nagy",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00449.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494332/,232
125314,"""Do I Have to Be Tested?"": Understanding Reluctance to Be Screened for COVID-19.",2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION Working time regulations, senior led service delivery and increasing complexity of surgical technology has led to significant strains in surgical training. Additionally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed substantial limitations on surgical training worldwide. Contact free, remote, web-based, validated learning tools which are easily accessible and allows repeated, sustained practice are the need of the hour. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) have been used extensively to train pilots and military personnel and has shown excellent early results within orthopaedic training. We designed a femoral nailing CTA tool which showed objective benefits in the enhancement of cognitive knowledge in medical students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this CTA tool to enhance practical skills in orthopaedic trainees in a real time interactive simulation setting (Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)). METHODS This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. 14 junior orthopaedic residents who met the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups. The intervention group were given the CTA learning tool, the control group were given a standard operative technique manual used for antegrade femoral intramedullary nailing. The participants were assessed on a high-fidelity phantom femur model with actual femoral nailing instruments in a simulation mobile operating theatre where the candidate had a simulation patient, an acting anesthetist and a scrub nurse (DIS). They were assessed using the modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) rating scale which has been validated for orthopaedic trauma. RESULTS The median OSATS score in the intervention group was 49 (±4.93, range 39-55) compared to 17 in the control group (±14.98, range 12-51). The median improvement was by 32 points (p = 0.02). The ICC between the two raters was 0.977. CONCLUSIONS This study has demonstrated objective benefits of a novel femoral nailing CTA tool in the enhancement of practical skills for junior trainees in the DIS setting. This adds to the growing evidence supporting the use of CTA in orthopaedic training. This tool can be accessed remotely, is contact free and allows repeated sustained practice which is key in simulation training.","Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Al-Obaidi, Bilal; Sugand, Kapil; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Gupte, Chinmay M",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2021.02.090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745697/,232

This study aims to systematically review the hematologic autoimmune complications in these patients. METHOD Data from three online databases including Medline (via PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science were searched on 19 December 2020, and after excluding duplicate, irrelevant and inappropriate records, eligible documents were identified. Afterwards, information such as patients' history, presentations, paraclinical data, treatment course and outcome were extracted from the records. RESULTS A total of 58 documents were considered to be eligible for data extraction which described 94 patients with COVID-19 who developed hematologic autoimmune disorder in their course of infection. Of these patients with COVID-19, the most common hematologic autoimmune disorder was immune thrombocytopenic purpura (55 cases) followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (22 cases). Other hematologic autoimmune disorders include antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Evans syndrome and autoimmune neutropenia. CONCLUSION The current study would help us to always consider an autoimmune etiology for cases with abnormal hematologic finding which further lead to an appropriate treatment of the patients, especially when the symptoms present in about 1-2 weeks after the first manifestation of the infection symptoms. Maybe, at least in this pandemic, it should be recommended to evaluate patients with unexpected and unexplained decrease in their hemoglobulin or platelet count for COVID-19. Another challenging issue is the treatment options. Given the multiorgan involvement and multifaceted nature of the infection, an individualized approach should be taken for each patient.","Taherifard, Erfan; Taherifard, Ehsan; Movahed, Hamed; Mousavi, Mohammad Reza",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2021.1881225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594951/,232
127673,Time to consider the role of rationalisation in health psychology.,2021-06-17,"Over the past decade, uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has evolved dramatically into a sophisticated technique capable of performing some of the most complex thoracic procedures. The idea of operating through fewer surgical incisions and, therefore, with potentially better cosmesis, less postoperative pain and paraesthesia, has led to uniportal VATS increasing in popularity worldwide. The uniportal approach demands instrument design to be better suited for operating with multiple instruments through a single small incision. Furthermore, the drive by surgeons and industry to develop novel, smaller, more specialized procedure-specific instruments for uniportal VATS to further allow reduction in incision size is relentless. Refinement of uniportal VATS instruments, angulated and narrower endostaplers, and improvements in video-camera systems, including 3D systems, and 120° articulating lens will make uniportal VATS major lung resection easier to perform and learn. In the future, we could see the development of subcostal or e-NOTES access, endorobotic arms that open and operate within the chest cavity, and cross-discipline imaging assistance for uniportal VATS procedures.","Ng, Calvin S H; Rocco, Gaetano; Wong, Randolph H L; Lau, Rainbow W H; Yu, Simon C H; Yim, Anthony P C",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivu200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24994696/,232

COVID-19 interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels, increasing morbidity in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions and favoring acute myocardial injury and dysfunction. COVID-19 infection may also have long-term implications for overall cardiovascular health. Many issues regarding the involvement of the cardiovascular system remain controversial. Despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 serving as the site of entry of the virus into the cells, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 blockers is not clear and requires further investigation. Therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Treatment of COVID-19, especially the use of antivirals, must be closely monitored.

Among the most serious issues since the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has been whether those who had it can experience a second episode of infection and what that implies for immunity. The earlier studies on COVID-19 disease focused primarily on the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19. However, conclusions of these studies still require to be warranted by more careful design, larger sample size and statistically well structured studies. COVID-19 is an under-studied infection, and several aspects of viral transmission and clinical progress remain at present unclear. There is a concern about the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and in the respiratory system of patients who have survived. One of the most concerning issues since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 is persistence in patients and whether patients can be re-infected. After hospital discharge, recovered patients were reported to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test in China, Japan, and South Korea. In addition to the persistence of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may occur in survivors. In this paper, we focused on the evidence of persistence and re-infection of SARS-CoV-2.","Alhusseini, L B; Yassen, L T; Kouhsari, E; Al Marjani, M F",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443283/,232

LTRs have increased susceptibility to infection due to the combination of a graft continually exposed to the outside world, multiple mechanisms for impaired mucus clearance, and immunosuppression. Community-acquired respiratory viral infections (CARVs) are common in LTRs. Picornaviruses have roughly 40% cumulative incidence followed by respiratory syncytial virus and coronaviruses. Although single-center retrospective and prospective series implicate CARV in rejection and mortality, conclusive evidence for and well-defined mechanistic links to long-term outcome are lacking.

DESIGN An epidemiological, cross-sectional (prevalence cut), multicenter study was performed using an electronic survey. Comparison of results with quality indexes of the Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the American College of Chest Physician guidelines and international studies. SETTING Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in the Community of Madrid (Spain). PATIENTS All patients admitted to the ICU on the day of the survey. VARIABLES OF INTEREST General aspects of venous thromboembolic prophylaxis and protocols used (risk stratification and ultrasound screening). A descriptive analysis was performed, continuous data being expressed as the mean or median, and categorical data as percentages. RESULTS A total of 234 patients in 18 ICUs were included. Eighteen percent (42/234) received no prophylaxis, and 55% had no contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis. Of the 192 patients receiving prophylaxis, 84% received pharmacological prophylaxis, 14% mechanical prophylaxis and 2% combined prophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin was the only pharmacological prophylaxis used, with a majority use of enoxaparin (17 of 18 ICUs). In patients with mechanical prophylaxis (31/192), antiembolic stockings were the most commonly used option (58%). Pharmacological prophylaxis contraindications were reported in 20% of the patients (46/234), the most frequent cause being thrombocytopenia (28% of the cases). Fifty percent of the ICUs used no specific venous thromboembolic prophylaxis protocol. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacological prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin was the most frequently used venous thromboembolic prophylactic measure. In patients with contraindications to pharmacological prophylaxis, mechanical measures were little used. The use of combined prophylaxis was anecdotal.

Chitosan nanoparticles were formulated with native (CN) or toxoids (CT) of extracellular proteins (ECP) of C. perfringens, both surface-tagged with Salmonella flagellar proteins. In a pH stability assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 6% and 0% of their protein at 8.0 pH. In a protein release assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 16% and 10% of their protein respectively at 7.4 pH after 24 h. CN and CT nanoparticles incubated at 100 μg/mL PBS with Chicken RBCs released 1% and 0% hemoglobin respectively. Ninety broilers were randomly assigned to treatments; sham-vaccinated (Control), CN-vaccinated (CN), and CT-vaccinated (CT). Each bird was orally gavaged with 50 μg vaccine in 0.5 mL PBS or 0.5 mL PBS only on d 0, 3, 7 and 14 of age. At 21 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 21 d of age, the CN and CT group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 17 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgG than control (P < 0.05). At 10 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgA than control (P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE SM is highly toxic to the respiratory system, leading to hacking cough, rhinorrheachest tightness, acute pharyngitis and laryngitis, chronic bronchitis and lung fibrosis. In this review, based on the scientific literature, we provide an updated summary of information on SM exposures and their differences with asthma and COPD. METHOD Information of this review was obtained by searching Medline/PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge and Chemical Abstracts. RESULTS SM exposure can decrease pulmonary function tests (PFTs) values. In addition, inflammatory cell accumulation in the respiratory tract and increased expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), IL-1a, IL-1β, and reactive oxygen radicals due to SM exposure have been shown. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) which degrade extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to inflammatory cell recruitment, tissue injury and fibrosis are also up-regulated in the lung after SM exposure. In the lung, SM exposure also can cause serious pathological changes including airway inflammation, parenchymal tissue destruction and airway obstruction which can lead to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Following SM poisoning, DNA damage, apoptosis and autophagy are observed in the lung along with the increased expression of activated caspases and DNA repair enzymes. CONCLUSION In the present article, respiratory symptoms, changes in PFTs, lung pathology and lung inflammation due to SM exposure and the similarities and differences between them and those observed in asthma and COPD were reviewed.","Khazdair, Mohammad Reza; Boskabady, Mohammad Hossein; Ghorani, Vahideh",Inhalation toxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08958378.2015.1114056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635274/,232

It is usually seen to be the most common cause of bowel obstruction in neonates since birth. It may be associated with other congenital anomalies. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE A 4 day old neonate presented with abdominal distension, billous vomiting & non passage of stools since birth. On further examination, it was seen that the abdominal distension was mostly central & there was hyperperistaltic bowel sounds on auscultation. The infant also had scoliosis. There was decreased appetite & features of dehydration. Diagnosed by USG(W/A), infantogram & X-Ray plain picture abdomen. DISCUSSION The mortality from the atresia of ileum is greater owing to the incidence of early perforation. Infants may present with features discussed above. They usually present during the 1st week of life but majority of the babies presenting late have significant mortality. Early surgical intervention with excision of the dilated bowel segment with anastomosis of the proximal (normal caliber bowel) to the distal part of the bowel has been seen to have been associated with decreased morbidity & mortality. CONCLUSION It has been observed that one of the many causes for neonatal intestinal obstruction is attributed to small bowel atresia. This has been associated with successful outcome depending on the presentation of the child to the hospital to the timing of surgical intervention along with resuscitation & starting of enteral feeds. Small bowel atresia can be associated with antenatal morbidity in the mother as cited here.","Dhar, Pinak Pani; Mohanty, Upasana",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.08.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892125/,232

133365,Employer-Mandated Vaccination for COVID-19.,2021-02-04,"UNLABELLED Feline infectious peritonitis and virulent, systemic calicivirus infection are caused by certain types of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and feline caliciviruses (FCVs), respectively, and are important infectious diseases with high fatality rates in members of the Felidae family. While FCoV and FCV belong to two distinct virus families, the Coronaviridae and the Caliciviridae, respectively, they share a dependence on viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) for their replication. Since 3CLpro is functionally and structurally conserved among these viruses and essential for viral replication, 3CLpro is considered a potential target for the design of antiviral drugs with broad-spectrum activities against these distinct and highly important viral infections. However, small-molecule inhibitors against the 3CLpro enzymes of FCoV and FCV have not been previously identified. In this study, derivatives of peptidyl compounds targeting 3CLpro were synthesized and evaluated for their activities against FCoV and FCV. The structures of compounds that showed potent dual antiviral activities with a wide margin of safety were identified and are discussed. Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of 3CLpro inhibitors was evaluated using a mouse model of coronavirus infection. Intraperitoneal administration of two 3CLpro inhibitors in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus A59, a hepatotropic coronavirus, resulted in significant reductions in virus titers and pathological lesions in the liver compared to the findings for the controls. These results suggest that the series of 3CLpro inhibitors described here may have the potential to be further developed as therapeutic agents against these important viruses in domestic and wild cats. This study provides important insights into the structure and function relationships of 3CLpro for the design of antiviral drugs with broader antiviral activities. IMPORTANCE Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is the leading cause of death in young cats, and virulent, systemic feline calicivirus (vs-FCV) causes a highly fatal disease in cats for which no preventive or therapeutic measure is available. The genomes of these distinct viruses, which belong to different virus families, encode a structurally and functionally conserved 3C-like protease (3CLpro) which is a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral drug development. However, no studies have previously reported a structural platform for the design of antiviral drugs with activities against these viruses or on the efficacy of 3CLpro inhibitors against coronavirus infection in experimental animals. In this study, we explored the structure-activity relationships of the derivatives of 3CLpro inhibitors and identified inhibitors with potent dual activities against these viruses. In addition, the efficacy of the 3CLpro inhibitors was demonstrated in mice infected with a murine coronavirus. Overall, our study provides the first insight into a structural platform for anti-FIPV and anti-FCV drug development.","Kim, Yunjeong; Shivanna, Vinay; Narayanan, Sanjeev; Prior, Allan M; Weerasekara, Sahani; Hua, Duy H; Kankanamalage, Anushka C Galasiti; Groutas, William C; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03688-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694593/,232
133584,Can prophylactic drugs keep fragile health systems running?,2020-04-10,"An increasing number of NIRS devices are used to provide measurements of peripheral tissue oxygen saturation (StO2). The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that despite technological differences between devices, similar trend values will be obtained during a vascular occlusion test. The devices compared are NIRO-200NX, which measures StO2 and oxyhemoglobin by spatially resolved spectroscopy and the Beer-Lambert law, respectively, and INVOS 5100C and Foresight Elite, which both measure StO2 with the Beer-Lambert law, enhanced with the spatial resolution technique. Forty consenting adults scheduled for CABG surgery were recruited. The respective sensors of the three NIRS devices were applied over the brachioradial muscle. Before induction of anesthesia, 3 min of ischemia were induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff at the upper arm, whereafter cuff pressure was rapidly released. Tissue oxygenation measurements included baseline, minimum and maximum values, desaturation and resaturation slopes, and rise time. Comparisons between devices were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Mann-Whitney pairwise comparisons. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Oxyhemoglobin measured with NIRO responded faster than the other NIRS technologies to changes in peripheral tissue oxygenation (20 vs. 27-40 s, p ≤ 0.01). When comparing INVOS with Foresight, oxygenation changes were prompter (upslope 311 [92-523]%/min vs. 114[65-199]%/min, p ≤ 0.01) and more pronounced (minimum value 36 [21-48] vs. 45 [40-51]%, p ≤ 0.01) with INVOS. Significant differences in tissue oxygen saturation measurements were observed, both within the same device as between different devices using the same measurement technology.","Steenhaut, Kevin; Lapage, Koen; Bové, Thierry; De Hert, Stefan; Moerman, Annelies",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9962-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878503/,232

Given documented racial disparities in other parts of the country, longitudinal convergence of COVID-19 rates around race groups warrants assessment. METHODS County-level cases for COVID-19 were collected from the Johns Hopkins University, and racial distributions were collected from the American Community Survey. Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed for each day since COVID-19 was first reported in California, and the longitudinal distribution of each race-specific set of correlation coefficients was assessed for stationarity, linear trend and exponential trend. RESULTS Earlier in the outbreak, the distribution of COVID-19 was most highly correlated with Asian American communities; after approximately 100 days, the distribution of COVID-19 most closely resembled that of African American communities. For every day in this dataset, the county-level distribution of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with the distribution of White American communities in California. DISCUSSION The geospatial distribution of COVID-19 in California has increasingly resembled that of African American communities within the state. Further study should be conducted to characterise potentially disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across race groups.","Cuomo, Raphael E",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067251/,232

Here we evaluated the impact of a virtual educational camp (vEC) on glucose control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using a closed-loop control (CLC) system. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective multicenter study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using the Tandem Basal-IQ™ system. Insulin pumps were upgraded to Control-IQ™, and children and their parents participated in a three-day multidisciplinary vEC. Clinical data, glucose metrics, and HbA1c were evaluated over the 12 weeks prior to the Control-IQ update and over the 12 weeks after the vEC. RESULTS Forty-three children and adolescents (aged 7-16 years) with type 1 diabetes and their families participated in the vEC. The median percentage of time in target range (70-180 mg/dL; TIR) increased from 64% (interquartile range [IQR] 56-73) with Basal-IQ to 76% (IQR 71-81) with Control-IQ (p < 0.001). After the vEC, over 75% of participants achieved TIR >70%. The percentage of time between 180-250 mg/dL and above 250 mg/dL decreased by 5% (p < 0.01) and 6% (p < 0.01), respectively, while the time between 70-54 mg/dL and below 54 mg/dL remained low and unaltered. HbA1c decreased by 0.5% (p < 0.01). There were no diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia episodes. CONCLUSIONS In this study of children managing their diabetes in the real-world setting, over 75% of children who participated in a vEC after starting a CLC system could obtain and maintain a TIR >70%. The vEC was feasible and resulted in a significant and persistent improvement in TIR in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This article is protected by copyright.

136293,"The ""trust"" heuristic: arguments from authority in public health.",2014,"BACKGROUND Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition recognized as one of the most serious causes of disability and impaired quality of life. In the literature, there is no review about sexual dysfunction and satisfaction in OCD. The current paper presents the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize data (1) comparing the presence of sexual dysfunction between groups with OCD and non-clinical groups, (2) investigating prevalence of each one of the sexual dysfunctions in patients with OCD, (3) comparing risk for sexual dysfunction in OCD groups with the prevalence in control groups, (4) comparing sexual satisfaction between OCD groups and non-clinical groups, and (5) investigating moderators of sexual dysfunction in OCD groups as compared with control groups. Gender, age, marital status, OCD symptom severity and subtypes, comorbid depressive disorders, comorbid anxiety disorders, concurrent psychiatric medications, comorbid general medical disease, and study quality will be investigated as moderators. METHODS The protocol is reported according to PRISMA-P guidelines. The search will be conducted by independent reviewers during the second week of December 2019 by using electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library), by contacting the authors of the included studies to identify further data, by examining the references of the included studies, and by handsearching conference proceedings and theses/doctoral dissertations. The study quality will be independently evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random-effect meta-analyses will be computed. If there is insufficient data for a specific outcome, only a systematic review will be performed. DISCUSSION This review may support clinical practice highlighting the importance of the assessment of sexuality in patients with OCD and suggesting the use of therapeutic strategies dedicated to sexuality in this clinical population with the aim of improving patients' quality of life. Potential limitations will regard the heterogeneity of the studies in terms of the instruments used to assess sexual dysfunction/satisfaction and of the definitions used to conceptualize sexual dysfunction.

We describe a consultation process organised by the Department of Health and Social Care and convened by the Chief Medical Officer to consider high level goals for future research efforts and to begin to identify UK-specific targets to measure research impact. The process took account of new scientific methods and evidence, the UK context with a universal health care system (the NHS) and the embedded research support from the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network, as well as the views of individual service users and service user organisations.

137984,The Intergenerational Cycles of Rural Health.,2020-09-01,"The transcription factor STAT3 is frequently activated in human solid and hematological malignancies and remains a challenging therapeutic target with no approved drugs to date. Here, we develop synthetic antibody mimetics, termed monobodies, to interfere with STAT3 signaling. These monobodies are highly selective for STAT3 and bind with nanomolar affinity to the N-terminal and coiled-coil domains. Interactome analysis detects no significant binding to other STATs or additional off-target proteins, confirming their exquisite specificity. Intracellular expression of monobodies fused to VHL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor, results in degradation of endogenous STAT3. The crystal structure of STAT3 in complex with monobody MS3-6 reveals bending of the coiled-coil domain, resulting in diminished DNA binding and nuclear translocation. MS3-6 expression strongly inhibits STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation and disrupts STAT3 interaction with the IL-22 receptor. Therefore, our study establishes innovative tools to interfere with STAT3 signaling by different molecular mechanisms.","La Sala, Grégory; Michiels, Camille; Kükenshöner, Tim; Brandstoetter, Tania; Maurer, Barbara; Koide, Akiko; Lau, Kelvin; Pojer, Florence; Koide, Shohei; Sexl, Veronika; Dumoutier, Laure; Hantschel, Oliver",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17920-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807795/,232

METHODS At baseline, participants were randomly assigned to test and control group, and either consumed two kiwifruits/day for 5 months or no kiwifruit. In the first 2 months, no periodontal treatment was delivered (2 M). Subsequently, a session of full-mouth IPT within 24 hours was performed. Participants were then re-assessed after 3 months (5 M). Blood samples, evaluating systemic biomarkers and vital signs, were also collected atbaseline, 2 M, and 5 M. RESULTS Groups were balanced at baseline. At 2 M no within-groups differences could be detected for any parameter but the bleeding score, which decreased significantly in the kiwifruit group by 6.67% ± 11.90% (P < 0.01). Comparison of test and control group showed that 2 months of kiwifruit consumption resulted in significant lower values of bleeding, plaque, and attachment loss. After IPT both groups demonstrated substantial significant clinical benefits however the control group showed significant greater reductions of bleeding, plaque and attachment loss than the test group. Systemic biomarkers and vital signs did not show clinically relevant differences between test and control group.

A review of all reproductive-aged women diagnosed with iTTP during 2010-2019 in seven university hospitals in Israel. Of 42 cases of iTTP, 12 (28.6%) were pregnancy-related. At presentation, the laboratory profiles did not differ significantly between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related iTTP, including hemoglobin (median 8.4 vs 8.0 g/dL), platelet count (12.5 vs. 11.5 X 109/L); and levels of bilirubin (1.23 vs. 1.82 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1615 vs. 1701 U/L), creatinine (0.61 vs. 0.79 mg/dL) and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer (75 vs. 82 U/mL).

In this article we describe our experience at Richmond University Medical Center with Chembio serological IgM, IgG testing. METHODS In this prospective cohort study of patients and hospital employees, we utilized Chembio COVID-19 IgM/IgG serological testing in addition to Cepheid RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS We evaluated the performance of Chembio serological test for IgM and IgG as an employee screening tool in a community hospital setting. The total number of currently asymptomatic employees screened was 1,866 from the Richmond University Medical Center. The non-exposed group included 1,253 (67.1%) employees with no significant clinical history and non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies. The convalescent group included 255 (13.7%) of the employees with elevation of IgG only, 18 (1%) employees with past history of positive PCR and COVID-19 who currently have non-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies or demonstrate elevated IgG only, followed by 3 employees (< 1%) with no past clinical history who demonstrated reactive IgM and IgG antibodies and negative follow up by PCR. The reported 14.9% exposure/convalescent rate is lower than the reported 20% by the Department of Health and Governor Andrew Cuomo and may represent a better utilization of personal protective equipment, better hand washing techniques, and better disinfection procedures combined with strict social distancing. CONCLUSIONS Chembio's performance is satisfactory; however, hospitals must design their own policies addressing: who needs to be screened and who will interpret the results as well as constructing management algorithms for employees with no previous history and current double positive antibodies.","Bardarov, S; Cesare, J; Kopolovich, H; Otterbeck, P; LaBarbera, M; Nfonoyim, J; Salhany, R; Rotatori, F; Mantello, G",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180450/,232
142777,Contact Tracing Could Exacerbate COVID-19 Health Disparities: The Role of Economic Precarity and Stigma.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Primary achalasia is a rare oesophageal motor disorder characterized by the absence of swallow-induced relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter and diminished or absent oesophageal body peristalsis. Around 5% of these patients will develop end-stage achalasia, where oesophagectomy may be advocated. We present the laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty as an alternative 'oesophagus-preserving' procedure in patients with end-stage achalasia. METHODS We present a retrospective review of four patients who underwent laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty. Data collected included pre-operative demographic information and investigations; and post-operative outcomes. Patients were scored pre- and post-operatively using Reflux Symptom Index, Eating Assessment Tool-10 and Voice Handicap Index-10 questionnaires. RESULTS Four patients underwent laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty during the study period. In one patient, it was performed as a rescue procedure during attempted myotomy following multiple perforations of friable mucosa. In the other three patients, laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty was performed for end-stage achalasia. None of the patients had post-operative complications and all patients were discharged on the second post-operative day. All patients experienced improvement in swallowing symptoms (EAT-10; p = 0.03) but developed post-operative gastroesophageal reflux. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first published case series of laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty for end-stage achalasia. It appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of end-stage achalasia, offering an alternative minimally invasive procedure to oesophagectomy. Laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty can also be used as a 'rescue' procedure during myotomy in patients who have poor-quality mucosa which perforates intra-operatively or is at high risk of perforation/leaking post-operatively.","Senra, Fátima; Navaratne, Lalin; Acosta-Mérida, Asunción; Gould, Stuart; Martínez-Isla, Alberto",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-021-02117-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760978/,232

143058,Preparing for Complex Emergencies While Combating COVID-19: The Role of Public Health Nurses in Japan.,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Numerous outcome studies and interventional trials in hemodialysis (HD) patients are based on uremic toxin concentrations determined at one single or a limited number of time points. The reliability of these studies however entirely depends on how representative these cross-sectional concentrations are. We therefore investigated the variability of predialysis concentrations of uremic toxins over time. METHODS Prospectively collected predialysis serum samples of the midweek session of week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16 were analyzed for a panel of uremic toxins in stable chronic HD patients (N = 18) while maintaining dialyzer type and dialysis mode during the study period. RESULTS Concentrations of the analyzed uremic toxins varied substantially between individuals, but also within stable HD patients (intra-patient variability). For urea, creatinine, beta-2-microglobulin, and some protein-bound uremic toxins, Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was higher than 0.7. However, for phosphorus, uric acid, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and the protein-bound toxins hippuric acid and indoxyl sulfate, ICC values were below 0.7, implying a concentration variability within the individual patient even exceeding 65% of the observed inter-patient variability. CONCLUSION Intra-patient variability may affect the interpretation of the association between a single concentration of certain uremic toxins and outcomes. When performing future outcome and interventional studies with uremic toxins other than described here, one should quantify their intra-patient variability and take into account that for solutes with a large intra-patient variability associations could be missed.","Eloot, Sunny; Van Biesen, Wim; Roels, Sanne; Delrue, Willem; Schepers, Eva; Dhondt, Annemieke; Vanholder, Raymond; Glorieux, Griet",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29016645/,232

The porcine uterine horn is similar to the human vermiform appendix. Therefore, the resection of the porcine uterine horn is an established animal model for the human appendectomy. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of a pure transvesical NOTES approach to uterine horn resection in a porcine model.

The laparoscope at the umbilicus was used only for the purpose of documentation. We used a rigid ureteroscope and a customized access system that prevented gas leakage and facilitated in-and-out passage of the instruments. A vesicostomy was created on the posterolateral bladder wall by using a needle knife through the channel of the ureteroscope. The uterine horn resection was performed by using an electric needle knife, hot forceps, and a polypectomy snare through the access system placed in vesicostomy. Bladder closure was performed with extracorporeal ties using metal clip tagged threads and a knot-pusher. RESULTS We successfully performed the pure transvesical NOTES uterine horn resections. The mean total operative time was 141.8 (± 58.7) min, and blood loss was minimal in all cases. No leakage was observed at the bladder repair sites after filling with normal saline. The removed uterine horns were approximately 6-12-cm long and 0.6-0.8 cm in diameter. On final inspection, the urethras were not damaged. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of a pure transvesical NOTES uterine horn resection in a porcine model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world's first report on a pure transvesical NOTES with a therapeutic purpose. This study shows the potential for adoption of the transvesical approach in NOTES procedures.","Jeong, Chang Wook; Oh, Jong Jin; Abdullajanov, Murad; Yeon, Jaeseung; Lee, Hahn-Ey; Jeong, Seong Jin; Hong, Sung Kyu; Byun, Seok-Soo; Lee, Seung Bae; Kim, Hyeon Hoe; Lee, Sang Eun",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1905-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002199/,232

Methods A total of 13 patients with COVID-19 confirmed at PUMCH from January 20 to February 6,2020 were selected as the research subjects.Their epidemiological histories,clinical characteristics,laboratory tests,and chest CT findings were analyzed retrospectively.The location,distribution,density,and other accompanying signs of abnormal lung CT lesions were recorded,and the clinical types of these patients were assessed. Results The clinical type was ""common type"" in all these 13 patients aged(46.8±14.7)years(range:27-68 years).Ten patients had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan,2 cases had recent travel histories,and 1 case had a travel history to Beijing suburb.The white blood cell(WBC)count was normal or decreased in 92.3% of the patients and the lymphocyte count decreased in 15.4% of the patients.Twelve patients(92.3%)had a fever,among whom 11 patients were admitted due to fever and 2 patients(15.4%)had low fever.Eight patients(61.5%)had dry cough.The CT findings in these 13 patients were all abnormal.The lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchi and under the pleura.The lesions were relatively limited in 8 patients(affecting 1-3 lobes,predominantly in the right or left lower lobe),and diffuse multiple lesions of bilateral lungs were seen in 5 patients.The CT findings mainly included ground glass opacities(GGOs)(n=10,76.9%),focal consolidation within GGOs(n=7,53.8%),thickened vascular bundle passing through the lesions(n=10,76.9%),bronchial wall thickening(n=12,92.3%),air bronchogram(n=10,76.9%),vacuole signs in the lesions(n=7,53.8%),fine reticulation and interlobular septal thickening(n=3,23.1%),reversed halo-sign(n=2,15.4%),crazy-paving pattern(n=2,15.4%),and pleural effusion(n=2,15.4%).Conclusions Most of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at PUMCH had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan.The first symptoms of COVID-19 mainly include fever and dry cough,along with normal or reduced counts of WBC and lymphocytes.CT may reveal that the lesions distribute along the bronchi and under the pleura;they are typically localized GGOs in the early stage but can become multiple GGOs and infiltrative consolidation in both lungs in the advanced stage.Scattered vacuole signs may be visible inside the lesions in some patients.","Song, Lan; Song, Wei; Sui, Xin; DU, Tiekuan; Liu, Wu; Wang, Baiyu; Lu, Xiaoping; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qiwen; Cao, Wei; Jin, Zhengyu",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

145701,COVID-19's Impact on Women: A Stakeholder-Engagement Approach to Increase Public Awareness Through Virtual Town Halls.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can severely influence sexual function. Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly used to treat POP, but studies describing its effect on sexual function are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate sexual function after robot-assisted POP surgery. METHODS This prospective cohort study included all patients who underwent a robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) or supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicopexy (RSHS). Exclusion criteria were unknown preoperative sexual activity status or concomitant surgery. In sexually active women, sexual function was measured with the translated validated version of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Changes in sexual activity were scored. Prolapse stages were described using the simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (S-POP) system. RESULTS A total of 107 women were included (median follow-up 15.3 months). No difference was found in the total number of sexually active women before and after surgery [63 (58.9%) vs. 61 (63.5%), p = 0.999]. Significantly fewer women avoided sexual intercourse postoperatively compared with preoperatively. Preoperatively, sexual intercourse was avoided due to vaginal bulging (2% vs. 24%, respectively, p = 0.021). Total mean PISQ-12 scores improved significantly 1 year after prolapse correction (33.5 vs. 37.1; p = 0.004), mainly due to improved scores on the physical and behavioral-emotive domain. No significant difference in pre- and postoperative complains of dyspareunia was found. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted middle-compartment surgery improved sexual function 1 year after surgery according to enhanced physical and emotional scores. The total number of sexually active women and complains of dyspareunia before and after surgery did not differ.","van Zanten, Femke; Brem, Cherèl; Lenters, Egbert; Broeders, Ivo A M J; Schraffordt Koops, Steven E",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-018-3645-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687171/,232
145876,Potential pharmacological agents for COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic that originated in China in December 2019. Cancer patients are immunosuppressed and very susceptive to acquiring infections; thus, they are at greater risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. People infected with COVID-19 display increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Excessive inflammation may cause damage to the body's tissues, thereby potentially contributing to alveolar damage and the severity of COVID-19. We hypothesize that since a pro-inflammatory state may worsen COVID-19 prognosis, modulating systemic inflammation through dietary modification may be efficacious in improving the clinical sequelae of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to present current nutritional and dietary approaches in the context of inflammation with a specific focus on cancer patients with and without COVID-19. The main topics reviewed include nutrition in inflammation and immunity. A systematic literature search on Google Scholar, Medline, and PubMed databases was performed between March 22, 2020 and May 6, 2020 using the keywords ""COVID-19,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""cancer,"" ""inflammation,"" ""probiotics,"" ""vitamin D,"" and ""nutrition prevention."" Healthy dietary habits, omega-3-rich diets, probiotics use, and vitamin D supplementation, as well as obesity prevention, are likely the most efficacious preventive approaches to controlling hyperinflammation, improving immune function, and decreasing the severity of inflammatory diseases.","Garófolo, Adriana; Qiao, Lyon; Maia-Lemos, Priscila Dos Santos",Nutrition and cancer,https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.1797126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696665/,232

149337,Clinical Decision Support for Immunization Uptake and Use in Immunization Health Information Systems.,2020,"Background: Warfarin is a commonly used oral anticoagulant. It has a narrow therapeutic window and wide variation in individualized dosing, and is used clinically for the treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Due to the widespread use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China and the complex composition and diverse mechanisms of action of TCM, the combination of TCM and warfarin in patients has led to fluctuations in the international normalized ratio of warfarin or bleeding. To ensure rational clinical use, we summarize the TCMs with which warfarin interacts and the possible mechanisms, with a view to providing a clinical reference. Aim of the study: To summarize the mechanisms by which Chinese herbal medicines affect the enhancement or weakening of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, to provide theoretical references for clinicians and pharmacists to use warfarin safely and rationally, and to avoid the adverse effects associated with the combination of Chinese herbal medicines and warfarin. Methods: A computerized literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WANFANG Data was performed. Key words used in the literature search were ""warfarin"", ""Chinese medicine"", ""traditional Chinese medicine"", ""Chinese patent medicine"" etc. and their combinations in a time limit from January 1, 1990 to May 1, 2021. A total of 64 articles were obtained following the selection process, including clinical reports, pharmacological experiments and in vitro experiments which were reviewed to determine the mechanism of the anticoagulant effect of herbal medicine on warfarin. Results: The mechanisms affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin are complex, and herbal medicines may enhance and diminish the anticoagulant effect of warfarin through a variety of mechanisms; thus, clinical use needs to be cautious. Some herbal medicines have shown inconsistent results in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments, pharmacology and clinical studies, and should be the focus of future research. Conclusion: With the widespread use of TCM, the combination of warfarin and TCM is more common. This article will promote clinicians' knowledge and understanding of the TCMs which interact with warfarin, in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse clinical treatment processes, and improve the efficacy and safety.","Zhuang, Wei; Liu, Shaoli; Zhao, Xusheng; Sun, Nan; He, Tao; Wang, Yali; Jia, Beibei; Lin, Xiaolan; Chu, Yanqi; Xi, Shengyan",Frontiers in pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.751107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616303/,232

151060,Implications of Gastrointestinal Involvement in COVID-19.,2020-08-30,"BACKGROUND It has been reported worldwide that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 usually suffer a loss of smell and taste. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the severity of the disease and the loss of smell and taste. In addition, we evaluated patients' smell and taste functions after recovery. METHODS Between March and May 2020, 418 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were divided into 3 groups: home-quarantined, hospitalized, and intensive care patients. The disease, smell, and taste functions of patients were evaluated with visual analog scores before diagnosis of COVID-19, during the disease, and fourth week after recovery. The types of smell loss and types of taste flavor loss occurring during the disease were questioned. RESULTS In all 3 groups, changes in smell and taste loss during the disease were statistically detected (P = 0.001). The smell loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3 were 45%, 43.7%, and 31.2%, respectively. The taste loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3were 46.6%, 32.1%, and 31.2% respectively. The rate of patients with a total recovery of smell loss in groups 1 to 3 were 95.5%, 93.7%, and 100%, respectively (P = 0.768). The rate of patients with a total recovery of taste loss in groups 1 to 3 were 97.1%, 91.4%, and 100%, respectively (P = 0.423). CONCLUSION COVID-19 causes significant loss of smell and taste in patients. The loss of smell and taste does not correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. The loss of smell and taste improves at a high rate after the disease.","Bulğurcu, Suphi; Öztutgan, Turgut; Baz, Eyup; Yonem, Ayşegül; Koç, Niyazi Günsu; Erkul, Evren; Çekin, Engin",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252531/,232
151588,Public Health Disease Surveillance Networks.,2014,"Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the predictive effect of intraoperative amylase value from pancreatic remnant on the development of clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy. Methods Patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy between June 2017 and October 2018 were studied retrospectively. The intraoperative amylase value was measured followed by drain fluid for amylase on postoperative day 3. The analysis of clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula predictors was carried out using the logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminative capacity of intraoperative amylase value as a predictive risk factor. Results The study population consisted of 40 patients. The clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred in 13 patients, no grade C pancreatic fistula (PF). The intraoperative amylase value correlated significantly with clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula. An intraoperative amylase value > 3089 U/L was proposed as the cut-off level to predict clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula by the receiver operating characteristic curve. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of this level were respectively 84.6%, 88.9% and 88.5%. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that intraoperative amylase value and suture closure for the pancreatic stump were the significant predictive risk factors for the clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula. Conclusion The intraoperative amylase value can be early and easily measured as a predictive risk factor, which seems useful for postoperative management of clinical relevant-postoperative pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy. While, the stapler closure might be a feasible way for the pancreatic transection during the operation.","Wang, Weishen; Qian, Hao; Lin, Jiewei; Weng, Yuanchi; Zhang, Jun; Wang, Jiancheng",Surgery open science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sopen.2019.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754691/,232

151944,An Overburdened Charitable Food System: Making the Case for Increased Government Support During the COVID-19 Crisis.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Recently, new technologies have been developed for antenna placement in laparoscopic liver tumor ablation (LLTA). At this point, it is important to analyze the efficacy of free-hand targeting to identify deficiencies and opportunities for improvement. METHODS This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective study. Video recordings of 30 consecutive patients with 77 lesions who underwent LLTA were reviewed. Tumor-specific anatomic and targeting-related parameters were analyzed using χ, t test, and regression analyses. RESULTS Neuroendocrine metastasis was the dominant tumor type, with median tumor size 1.4 cm (range, 0.5 to 5.2). In total, 41 (53%) tumors were superficial and 36 (47%) deep. In 68 lesions (88%), an optimal targeting was achieved with first attempt, without a need for repositioning; whereas 9 lesions (12%) required repositioning of antenna. For 37% (15/41) of superficial and 56% (20/36) of deep lesions, a straight avascular needle trajectory was not present, requiring steering of the antenna around vascular and biliary structures. All procedures were completed laparoscopically without bleeding or biliary complications. Local treatment recurrence rate in follow-up was 10% (n=8). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that in experienced hands, LLTA through free-hand technique is safe and efficacious, providing an accurate targeting with the first pass in 90% of tumors. Although newer technology is being developed to guide less-experienced surgeons in needle targeting, it should be kept in mind that a straight trajectory is not available for 1/3 of superficial and half of deep lesions. Hence, ablation surgeons need to develop free-hand skills to avoid possible hemorrhagic and biliary complications in LLTA.","Li, Pengpeng; Erten, Ozgun; Akbulut, Serkan; Gokceimam, Mehmet; Berber, Eren","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048898/,232

Earlier we reported that modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 receptor (S1P1R) signaling provided a chemically tractable approach for the effective blunting of cytokine storm, leading to the improvement of clinical and survival outcomes. Here, we show that S1P1R agonist treatment suppresses global cytokine amplification. Importantly, S1P1R agonist treatment was able to blunt cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune cell recruitment in the lung independently of endosomal and cytosolic innate sensing pathways. S1P1R signaling suppression of cytokine amplification was independent of multiple innate signaling adaptor pathways for myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and IFN-β promoter stimulator-1 signaling, indicating a common pathway inhibition of cytokine storm. We identify the MyD88 adaptor molecule as responsible for the majority of cytokine amplification observed following influenza virus challenge.","Teijaro, John R; Walsh, Kevin B; Rice, Stephanie; Rosen, Hugh; Oldstone, Michael B A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1400593111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572573/,232

Recent studies revealed the role of miRNAs as powerful biomarkers in disease diagnosis and for the development of innovative therapeutic applications in several human conditions, including intestinal diseases. In this review, we explored the literature and summarized the role of identified dysregulated fecal miRNAs in intestinal diseases, with particular focus on colorectal cancer (CRC) and celiac disease (CD). The aim of this review is to highlight one fascinating aspect of fecal miRNA function related to gut microbiota shaping and bacterial metabolism influencing. The role of miRNAs as ""messenger"" molecules for inter kingdom communications will be analyzed to highlight their role in the complex host-bacteria interactions. Moreover, whether fecal miRNAs could open up new perspectives to develop novel suitable biomarkers for disease detection and innovative therapeutic approaches to restore microbiota balance will be discussed.","Sarshar, Meysam; Scribano, Daniela; Ambrosi, Cecilia; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Masotti, Andrea",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12082174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764361/,232
156046,Policy Lessons From Early Reactions to the COVID-19 Virus in China.,2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND There are increasing opportunities for healthcare professionals outside medicine to be involved in and lead clinical research. However, there are few roles within these professions that include time for research. In order to develop such roles, and evaluate effective use of this time, the range of impacts of this clinical academic activity need to be valued and understood by healthcare leaders and managers. To date, these impacts have not been comprehensively explored, but are suggested to extend beyond traditional quantitative impact metrics, such as publications, citations and funding awards. METHODS Ten databases, four grey literature repositories and a naïve web search engine were systematically searched for articles reporting impacts of clinical academic activity by healthcare professionals outside medicine. Specifically, this did not include the direct impacts of the research findings, rather the impacts of the research activity. All stages of the review were performed by a minimum of two reviewers and reported impacts were categorised qualitatively according to a modified VICTOR (making Visible the ImpaCT Of Research) framework. RESULTS Of the initial 2704 identified articles, 20 were eligible for inclusion. Identified impacts were mapped to seven themes: impacts for patients; impacts for the service provision and workforce; impacts to research profile, culture and capacity; economic impacts; impacts on staff recruitment and retention; impacts to knowledge exchange; and impacts to the clinical academic. CONCLUSIONS Several overlapping sub-themes were identified across the main themes. These included the challenges and benefits of balancing clinical and academic roles, the creation and implementation of new evidence, and the development of collaborations and networks. These may be key areas for organisations to explore when looking to support and increase academic activity among healthcare professionals outside medicine. The modified VICTOR tool is a useful starting point for individuals and organisations to record the impact of their research activity. Further work is needed to explore standardised methods of capturing research impact that address the full range of impacts identified in this systematic review and are specific to the context of clinical academics outside medicine.","Newington, Lisa; Wells, Mary; Adonis, Adine; Bolton, Lee; Bolton Saghdaoui, Layla; Coffey, Margaret; Crow, Jennifer; Fadeeva Costa, Olga; Hughes, Catherine; Savage, Matthew; Shahabi, Lillie; Alexander, Caroline M",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06354-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926441/,232

Urticaria is constituted by evanescent erythematous-edematous lesions (wheals and flare), which does not persist in the same site for more than 24-48 hours and appears in other topographic localization, resolving without residual hyper pigmentation. During the SARS-CoV-2 infection, some cytokines are synthesized, including Interferon type I, TNF-α, and chemokines which may induce mast cells and basophils degranulation by mechanisms similar to the autoinflammatory monogenic or polygenic diseases. In this article we discuss the spectrum of the urticaria and urticarial-like lesions in the COVID-19's era, besides other aspects related to innate and adaptative immune response to viral infections, interactions between dermal dendritic cells and mast cells, degranulation of mast cells by different stimuli. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells share in allergic patients expression of the high affinity IgE receptors on cell membranes and demonstrated a low pattern of type I interferon secretion in viral infections.

157517,Using Remote Medical Care Services to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.,2020-05-13,"Outbreaks of human adenovirus (HAdV) acute respiratory illness (ARI) have been well documented among civilians and unvaccinated military recruits. Among the 7 recognized HAdV species (A to G), species B (particularly serotypes 3, 7, 11, 14, and 21) and E (serotype 4) have more often been associated with epidemic ARI. Rapid detection and type-specific identification of these viruses would enhance outbreak response and help guide prevention and control measures. To this end, we developed type-specific real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for HAdV types 3, 4, 7, 11, 14, 16, and 21 targeting the HAdV hexon gene. All type-specific qPCR assays reproducibly detected as few as 10 copies/reaction of quantified hexon recombinant plasmids with a linear dynamic range of 8 log units (10(1) to 10(8) copies); in contrast, a generic qPCR assay that detects all HAdV types run concurrently detected between 10 and 100 copies/reaction, depending on the virus type. No nonspecific amplifications were observed with concentrated nucleic acid from 51 HAdV prototype strains or other common respiratory pathogens. All members of a panel of 137 previously typed HAdV field isolates and positive clinical specimens were correctly characterized by the type-specific qPCR assays; two different HAdV types were detected in three of the clinical specimens and confirmed by amplicon sequencing. The qPCR assays permit sensitive, specific, and quantitative detection and identification of seven clinically important respiratory HAdVs and should provide a convenient adjunct to classical typing methods for a rapid response to HAdV outbreaks.","Lu, Xiaoyan; Trujillo-Lopez, Elizabeth; Lott, Lisa; Erdman, Dean D",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.03297-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23325827/,232

In South Korea, drive-through swab test is used for screening system and community treatment centers (CTCs), which admit and treat confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms, are being used. This retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to a CTC on March 6, 2020. A total of 313 patients were admitted. The nasal and throat swabs were collected from the upper respiratory tract, and a sputum test was performed to obtain lower respiratory samples. The positive rate of the first set of test, sputum test was higher than that of the swab test (p = 0.011). In the second set of test, 1 week after the first ones, the rate of positive swab tests was relatively high (p = 0.026). In the first set of test, 66 of 152 (43.4%) patients showed 24-h consecutive negative swab test results, when the sputum test results were considered together, that number fell to 29 patients (19.1%) (p < 0.001). Also, in the second set of test, 63 of 164 (38.4%) patients met the discharge criteria only when the swab test was considered; that number fell to 30 (18.3%) when the sputum test results were also considered (p < 0.001). Using the swab test alone is insufficient for screening test and discharge decision. Patients who may have positive result in the sputum test can be missed.","Choi, Sungwoo; Choi, Hyo Jeong; Kim, Ho Jung",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211026152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143699/,232

The pathogenesis of respiratory infections caused by viruses ranging from respiratory syncytial virus to influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 differs between the sexes across the life course. Generally, males are more susceptible to severe outcomes from respiratory viral infections at younger and older ages. During reproductive years (i.e., after puberty and prior to menopause), females are often at greater risk than males for severe outcomes. Pregnancy and biological sex affect the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections. In addition to sex differences in the pathogenesis of disease, there are consistent sex differences in responses to treatments, with females often developing greater immune responses but experiencing more adverse reactions than males. Animal models provide mechanistic insights into the causes of sex differences in respiratory virus pathogenesis and treatment outcomes, where available.

This problem is divided into two sectors: health and economy. In relation to health, there has been an alarming exponential rise in deaths, those who do not belong to the risk group are precisely those who contaminate and lead to disease. The economy also bleeds globally, and companies are failing. Thus, thousands of people are out of work. This paper is focused on predicting whether an individual is possible with symptoms of COVID-19 and proposing the use of technology. In a context of ambient assisted living, it can save thousands of lives and builds the world economy. Therefore, a preliminary mobile diagnosis may provide a reduction in government costs and a potential alternative to the existing tests. In view of all that has been mentioned, sensors are the best solution to detect the symptoms of the disease. This project will try to identify different symptoms, such as high body temperature, breathing difficulties, and cough. The sensors that may be used to identify these symptoms are a thermometer, an electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, an electromyography (EMG) sensor and an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Capris, T.; Melo, P.; Pereira, P.; Morgado, J.; Garcia, N.

The severity of the epidemic has largely been controlled in many countries, but continues to inflict severe public health and socioeconomic burden in some parts of Nigeria. One of the major reasons for Nigeria's failure in the fight against the epidemic is lack of effective health care system and awareness programs which play a vital role in the control of the blinding trachoma epidemic. This study proposed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of blinding trachoma in Nigeria that consider both person to person and vector transmission dynamics. The analysis shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R(0)1. We fit the model with field data instances from Northern Nigeria and provide a detailed estimation of the model parameters. Our result shows that, the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly implemented. We obtained some simulation results with the aid of mesh plots for the reproductive number R-0 as a function of two different biological parameters. Using forward sensitivity index approach, we perform sensitive analysis to point out the most sensitive parameters that should be considered to effectively control the epidemic. Finally, This research suggest that, the awareness programs and improvement of personal hygiene will play a significant role in controlling the spread of the epidemic.","Muhammad, S.

Since gender differences in mental health may exist between males and females, it would prove interesting to see if a large scale stressor such as the pandemic will cause variances in the psychological distress between both genders. This study assessed and compared the psychological distress of COVID-19 among male and female medical students in medical schools in South-Western Nigeria Materials and methods: A cross-sectional online survey using was carried out among 1010 medical students from three largest universities in south western Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were purposively selected, data was obtained on participants demographic and psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 21 statistical software, chi square was used to assess gender differences, multivariate regression analysis assessed the predictors of psychological distress among both gendersand p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Female medical students are at a higher risk of psychological distress compared to their male counterparts (p<0.005). Females were almost twice at risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic than males (OR=1.534, 95% p=0.003). Females with a positive history of mental illness were five times more at risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to females with no previous mental health history (OR=5.102, p=0.002) Conclusion: Females were at higher risk of psychological distress compared to male students.

The authors applied a conditional mixed process to a panel recursive bivariate probit model with robust standard errors.Findings The authors obtained three key results. First, intermediate imports do not always contribute to improving innovation, since their effects vary depending on their source. Second, intermediate imports from foreign suppliers (external source) are more advantageous for product innovation than those from intra-firm trade (internal source). Third, intermediate imports from intra-firm trade are more important for process innovation than those from foreign suppliers. Thus, the impact of importing intermediate inputs on innovation is contingent on the source of the imports, the ownership of the MNE and the type of innovation.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to this topic with new insights and results for MNEs. It identifies which import source is best for innovation depending on the type of innovative result expected. Moreover, it helps to uncover simultaneity and causal relationships between product and process innovation, issues which have not previously been considered in the literature.","Ramírez-Alesón, Marisa Fernández-Olmos Marta",Baltic Journal of Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/bjm-09-2020-0348,232

In this report we share key lessons learned from an adaptive COVID-19 testing program implemented at a mid-sized university in the Midwest. The program utilized two simple, diverse, and easily interpretable machine learning models to quickly and accurately predict which students were at elevated risk for contracting COVID-19 and should be called proactively for testing. Our adaptive testing cohorts produced positivity rates that were 26% higher than the random cohort: 0.58% positivity (95% CI 0.47% to 0.68%) from 19,171 tests, and 0.46% positivity (95% CI 0.41% to 0.51%) from 64,003 tests, respectively. Within 14 days of their selection, 2.94% of the adaptive cohort tested positive, compared to 1.27% of the random cohort. Close contacts who were predicted by the adaptive testing models received a COVID-19 test within an average of 0.94 days (95% CI 0.78 to 1.11) of the source testing positive, while those who were manually contact traced were tested in an average of 1.92 days (95% CI 1.81 to 2.02). These results suggest that machine learning strategies can improve surveillance testing effectiveness, especially in a university setting, by effectively distributing testing resources and potentially reducing community transmission.","Krieg, S.

181146,"Vaccination is Australia's most important COVID-19 public health action, even though herd immunity is unlikely",2021-07-19,"PurposeThis study explores how compassionate managerial leadership style can help to mitigate workplace stressors and alleviate stress experiences among employees — particularly in an extreme situation, such as the current global COVID-19 pandemic. The study's context is Nigeria's banking, manufacturing and healthcare sectors, which have a history of high employee stress levels.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative, interpretive methodology, the study adopts the thematic analysis process (TAP) to draw and analyse data from semi-structured telephone interviews with 10 banking, 11 manufacturing and 9 frontline healthcare workers in Nigeria.FindingsIt was found that a compassionate managerial leadership can drive a considerate response to employees' “fear of job (in)security”, “healthcare risk” and concerns about “work overload, underpayment and delayed payment”, which respondents considered to be some of the key causes of increased stress among employees during the current COVID-19 pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited to exploring the relationship between compassionate managerial leadership and an organisation's ability to manage employee stress in the COVID-19 situation, using 30 samples from organisations operating in three Nigerian cities and sectors. Future studies may involve more Nigerian cities, sectors and samples. It may also possibly include quantitative combination to allow generalisation of findings.Practical implicationsIn order to survive in extreme situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations are forced to take drastic and often managerialist-driven work measures which can trigger high stress levels, low productivity and absenteeism among employees. Hence, organisations would benefit from implementing compassion-driven policies that are more inclusive and responsive to the workplace stressors facing employees.Originality/valueEmployee stress has been widely explored in many areas, including definitions, stressors, strains, possible interventions and coping strategies. There remains, however, a dearth of scholarship on how management-leadership compassion can help to reduce employee stress levels in extreme conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic — particularly in emerging economies.","Emeka Smart, Oruh Chima Mordi Chianu Harmony Dibia Hakeem Adeniyi Ajonbadi",Employee Relations,https://doi.org/10.1108/er-06-2020-0302,232

This study analyses how travel bubbles can contribute towards the sustainability and reconstruction of the tourism industry. Several examples have emerged worldwide, manifesting the strong need to create ‘safe’ routes to transform tourism. Through a theoretical approach and by drawing from previous research, official reports, and news media, this study analyses the rationale for travel bubbles and examines how they can support short-term responses to the pandemic and enhance long-term planning pertaining to tourism mobility for a sustainable future. It discusses the political, economic, psychological, socioeconomic, environmental, and hygiene impacts of travel bubbles. The study shows that sustainability can be achieved through a cooperative regional approach. It examines the challenges and opportunities of travel bubbles towards redeveloping tourism in neighbouring destinations and offers strategies to support sustainable tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as backyard tourism.

Despite a land administration system based on cadaster and land registries in place, 25% of the arable land with an estimated 10 million spatial units on the ground are informally occupied and are off-register. Recently, a strong political will has emerged to ensure land rights for all. Providing tenure security to all these occupants using the conventional surveying and land administration approach demands a large amount of skilled human resources, a long timeframe and a huge budget. To assess the suitability of the fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA) approach for nationwide mapping and registration of informality in the Nepalese context, the identification, verification and recordation (IVR) of the people-to-land relationship was conducted through two pilot studies using a participatory approach covering around 1500 and 3400 parcels, respectively, in an urban and a rural setting. The pilot studies were based on the FFPLA National Strategy and utilized satellite imageries and smartphones for identification and verification of land boundaries. Data collection to verification tasks were completed within seven months in the urban settlements and for an average cost of 7.5 USD per parcel;within the rural setting, the pilot study was also completed within 7 months and for an average cost of just over 3 USD per parcel. The studies also informed the discussions on building the legislative and institutional frameworks, which are now in place. With locally trained ‘grassroots surveyors’, the studies have provided a promising alternative to the conventional surveying technologies by providing a fast, inexpensive and acceptable solution. The tested approach may fulfill the commitment to resolve the countrywide mapping of informality. The use of consistent data model and mapping standards are recommended.","Uma Shankar, Panday Raja Ram Chhatkuli Joshi Janak Raj Deuja Jagat Antonio Danilo Enemark Stig",Land,https://doi.org/10.3390/land10070744,232

Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of mental health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019 to October 31, 2020, written in English language and published in peer-reviewed journals. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize the findings according a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis.Results62 studies met the inclusion out of the 278 search results. Data converged on: strengths in minimizing the risk of Covid-19 transmission, reduction of travel time and costs, comparable effectiveness to in-person care;weaknesses i.e. decreased ability to detect non-verbal cues, lower therapeutic alliance, possible technical connection problems;opportunities in improving the healthcare system and expanding its accessibility for patients also for the future;threats such as privacy and legal issues, and risk to overlook vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly, marginalized ethnic minorities).ConclusionsIn the midst of a global mental health emergency, telehealth may represent a “virtually perfect” solution. However, further implementations facing issues of quality, justice and healthcare equity are required to ensure that all patients receive the care they need.","Sarajlic Vukovic, I.; Valeriani, G.; Mijaljica, G.; Osmanovic Thunström, A.; Gonzales, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.686,232

With its outbreak, clinical studies in medical schools were discontinued throughout the country, and the pre-clinical studies channeled into online learning, like all other university teaching activities. Since similar situations occurred in most western countries, a methodological approach of online teaching is required - principles, goals and implementation, with reference to the tension between the duty of care versus the duty of maintaining the clinician's and student's health. In this paper we will present the dilemmas faced by the various medical education institutions in the world, along with the ways of coping and the experience gained from similar situations - including in Israel. We will discuss the techno-pedagogical principles that are at the heart of online teaching, demonstrate the experience gained in Israel and around the world, and offer a framework for comprehensive discussion for situations that threaten medical education learners.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of population median age and mean ambient temperature on the COVID-19 global pandemic burden. METHODS We used databases from open access public domains to record population median age, mean ambient temperature, and the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths on days 14 and 28 from the pandemic outbreak for each country in the world. We then calculated the correlation between these parameters. RESULTS The analysis included 202 countries. A univariate analysis showed that population median age significantly correlated with the cumulative number of cases and deaths, while mean ambient temperature showed a significant inverse correlation with the cumulative number of deaths on days 14 and 28 from the epidemic outbreak. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis only population median age retained its statistically significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS Country population median age significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic burden while mean ambient temperature shows a significant inverse correlation only in univariate analysis. Countries with older populations encountered a heavier burden from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities. However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations. Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.","Dumusc, Alexandre; Dan, Diana",Revue medicale suisse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348046/,232

However, DNA-based stool sample tests may be useful for colorectal cancer screening when colonoscopy is not available. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the potential utility of enhanced DNA-based stool testing for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis during crises that strain available healthcare resources, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review shows that DNA-based stool sample tests have the potential to enable colorectal cancer screening to prioritize patients to elective colonoscopy procedures, the continued delay of which during the COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a burden on future elective procedures.","Dockter, Andrew G; Angelos, George C",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347964/,232

201495,The spread of novel coronavirus has created an alarming situation worldwide,2020,"Background and Aim Radiotherapy (RT) plays a key role in the control of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Throughout the years, different doses and fractionations of RT have been used in an attempt to optimize the results. Recently, special interest has been given to hypofractionation (hypoRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). HypoRT is a relatively widespread treatment, although the accompanying level of evidence is limited. For its part, SBRT has been used specially to overdose specific areas of the disease as a boost after radiochemotherapy. In both cases, the study of how to integrate these RT tools with chemotherapy and immunotherapy is fundamental. In addition, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic situation has sparked increased interest in hypofractionated treatments. In this review, we analyze the role of SBRT and hypoRT in the management of LA-NSCLC in accordance with current scientific evidence. Relevance for Patients The objective of this article is to introduce professionals to the role that hypoRT and SBRT can play in the treatment of LA-NSCLC to offer the best treatment to their patients.","Rico, Mikel; Martínez, Maribel; Rodríguez, Maitane; Rosas, Lombardo; Barco, Andrea; Martínez, Enrique",Journal of clinical and translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104822/,232

Vitamin D is an important modulator of the immune system. Although serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels can be raised through diet or supplements, most vitamin D in the body is the result of dermal synthesis from ultraviolet radiation. The production of vitamin D in the skin, however, can be limited by latitude, skin-covering clothes, the use of sunblock, and skin pigmentation. Vitamin D deficiency affects a high percentage of the world population. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are suboptimal, not only in specific risk groups but also in adults from many countries. Low vitamin D levels, therefore, represent a risk factor for several different pathologies, including SAR-CoV-2. This study used an ecological design to assess the association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 incidence, complications, and mortality across 46 countries. All data were obtained from published sources. The results of the study suggest an association at the population level between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the risk of being infected with COVID-19, severity of the disease, and risk of dying from it.","Mariani, Javier; Giménez, Virna Margarita Marín; Bergam, Ivana; Tajer, Carlos; Antonietti, Laura; Inserra, Filipe; Ferder, León; Manucha, Walter",Health Secur,,232

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on coronavirus disease 2019 patients, included between March 10, and April 30, 2020. SETTING: ICU of an University Hospital in Belgium. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Critically ill adult mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients were eligible if they underwent a CT pulmonary angiography, as part of the routine management in case of persistent hypoxemia or respiratory deterioration. The primary endpoint of this study was the occurrence of pulmonary embolism according to the use of standard thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4,000 international units once daily) or high regimen thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4,000 international units bid or therapeutic unfractioned heparin). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 49 mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019, 40 underwent CT pulmonary angiography after a median of 7 days (4-8 d) since ICU admission and 12 days (9-16 d) days since the onset of symptoms. Thirteen patients (33%) were diagnosed of pulmonary embolism, which was bilateral in six patients and localized in the right lung in seven patients. D-dimers on the day of CT pulmonary angiography had a predictive accuracy of 0.90 (95% CIs: 0.78-1.00) for pulmonary embolism. The use of high-regimen thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower occurrence of pulmonary embolism (2/18; 11%) than standard regimen (11/22, 50%-odds ratio 0.13 [0.02-0.69]; p = 0.02); this difference remained significant even after adjustment for confounders. Six patients with pulmonary embolism (46%) and 14 patients without pulmonary embolism (52%) died at ICU discharge (odds ratio 0.79 [0.24-3.26]; p = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, one third of coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated patients have a pulmonary embolism visible on CT pulmonary angiography. High regimen thromboprophylaxis may decrease the occurrence of such complication.","Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Gevenois, Pierre Alain; Peluso, Lorenzo; Pletchette, Zoe; Lheureux, Olivier; Brasseur, Alexandre; Garufi, Alessandra; Talamonti, Marta; Motte, Serge; Nobile, Leda; Grimaldi, David; Creteur, Jacques; Vincent, Jean-Louis",Crit Care Med,,232

Samples were prepared via direct current magnetron sputter deposition and cyclic voltammetry was used to characterize the insertion and extraction behavior of protons in V2 O5 in a trifluoroacetic acid containing electrolyte. With the same setup chronopotentiometry was done to intercalate a well-defined number of protons in the Hx V2 O5 system in the range of x=0 and x=1. These films were characterized with optical reflectometry in the near-IR region (between 700 and 1700â nm wavelength) and the refractive index n and extinction coefficient k were determined using Cauchy's dispersion model.

Abdominal manifestations of COVID on imaging are not yet established. The goal of this study was to quantify the frequency of positive findings on abdominopelvic CT in COVID-positive patients, and to identify clinical factors associated with positive findings to assist with imaging triage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included adult COVID-positive patients with abdominopelvic CT performed within 14 days of their COVID PCR nasal swab assay from 3/1/2020 to 5/1/2020. Clinical CT reports were reviewed for the provided indication and any positive abdominopelvic findings. Demographic and laboratory data closest to the CT date were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression model with binary outcome of having no reported positive abdominopelvic findings was constructed. RESULTS: Of 141 COVID-positive patients having abdominopelvic CT (average age 64 years [± 16], 91 [64%] women), 80 (57%) had positive abdominopelvic findings. Abdominal pain was the most common indication, provided in 54% (43/80) and 74% (45/61) of patients with and without reported positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.015). 70% (98/141) of patients overall had reported findings in the lung bases. Findings either typical or intermediate for COVID were reported in 50% (40/80) and 64% (39/61) of patients with and without positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.099). Of 80 patients with positive abdominopelvic findings, 25 (31%) had an abnormality of gastrointestinal tract, and 14 (18%) had solid organ infarctions or vascular thromboses. In multivariate analysis, age (OR 0.85, p = 0.023), hemoglobin (OR 0.83, p = 0.029) and male gender (OR 2.58, p = 0.032) were independent predictors of positive abdominopelvic findings, adjusted for race and Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSION: Abdominopelvic CT performed on COVID-positive patients yielded a positive finding in 57% of patients. Younger age, male gender, and lower hemoglobin were associated with higher odds of having reportable positive abdominopelvic CT findings.","Goldberg-Stein, Shlomit; Fink, Adam; Paroder, Viktoriya; Kobi, Mariya; Yee, Judy; Chernyak, Victoria",Abdom Radiol (NY),,232

211942,The last rites in a time of pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Renal involvement in Covid-19 infection is varied and can affect glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a strong predictor of mortality. Routine urinalysis gives an insight into the renal pathology of the patient. We studied the incidence of urinary abnormalities in hospitalised Covid-19 patients and analysed their impact on development of AKI and mortality. METHODS: Information on 110 hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 was retrospectively collected and analysed. The demographic data such as age, gender, comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, the need for dialysis and laboratory data such as urine for albumin, glucose, RBC and WBC, and serum creatinine were collected. The diagnosis of AKI was based on the KDIGO criteria. The outcomes studied were development of AKI and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Urine abnormalities were seen in 71% of the patients. Proteinuria in 58.2%, haematuria in 17.3%, pyuria in 8.2% of patients and concurrent proteinuria and haematuria was seen in 13.6% of patients. AKI was seen in 28.2% of patients and hospital mortality was 24.5%. AKI was strongly associated with mortality. Proteinuria and haematuria were good predictors of development of AKI, more strongly when they occurred concurrently (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that urine analysis is a simple test, which can be used to predict development of AKI and mortality and may be used for risk stratification of Covid-19 patients, especially in low resource settings.","Sundaram, Supraja; Soni, Mamta; Annigeri, Rajeev",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,232
212005,Post-COVID-19 Public-Private Public Health Partnerships: A Student's Perspective,2021,"Declining birth rates are one of the problems facing society today. Male counterparts are responsible for about half of the infertility cases, and genitourinary tract infections may play a contributing role in approximately 15% of male infertility cases. Leukocytospermia is an established indicator of infection in the male urogenital tract, although other microorganisms such as bacteria and virus may also be contributors to the etiology of male infertility. The pathophysiology of these infectious agents may be initiated by a local inflammatory reaction resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). This results in testicular injury, thereby affecting sperm morphology, sperm motility, sperm viability and elevation of the seminal leukocyte as a result of the genital tract infection. The infectious and inflammatory changes can result in male infertility. It is proposed that high concentrations of seminal leukocyte and infectious agents may affect sperm function resulting in clumping of motile spermatozoa, decreasing acrosomal functionality and also causing alterations in sperm morphology. However, the literature has poorly clarified the role of infection in male infertility, provoking further debate and research on this topic.","Henkel, Ralf; Offor, Ugochukwu; Fisher, David",Andrologia,,232

212787,Picture of a pandemic: visual aids in the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"Research on traumatic events often emphasizes the importance of posttraumatic growth (PTG) and resilience, yet few studies have explored their trends and their relationship throughout the progression of traumatic events. This paper explores the longitudinal relationship between resilience and PTG, as well as the role of job burnout in this relationship, among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, who have been exposed to high-risk work environments over extraordinarily long workdays. In Study 1, 134 Chinese frontline healthcare workers completed a three-wave survey (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3) in February-May 2020. In Study 2, 401 frontline healthcare workers completed a cross-sectional survey. The cross-lagged analysis suggested that resilience at Time 1 positively predicted PTG at Time 2, which in turn positively predicted resilience at Time 3. PTG at Time 1 also positively predicted resilience at Time 2 (Study 1). However, job burnout was negatively related to both resilience and PTG; in particular, emotional exhaustion moderated the link between PTG and resilience (Study 2). Our findings support a cycle of reinforcement between resilience and PTG over time. The positive effect of PTG on resilience, however, is undermined by emotional exhaustion. Implications for future intervention research and workplace support are discussed.","Lyu, Yizhi; Yu, Yongju; Chen, Shuquan; Lu, Shuang; Ni, Shiguang",Applied psychology.

Objective: To identify associations between demographic characteristics, residential characteristics, and/or preexisting health conditions and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality for people with IDD receiving residential support services. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study tracked COVID-19 outcomes for 543 individuals with IDD. Participants were receiving support services from a single organization providing residential services in the 5 boroughs of New York City from March 1 to October 1, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed from December 2020 to February 2021. Exposures: Resident-level characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, disability status, residential characteristics, and preexisting medical conditions. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory test. COVID-19 mortality indicated that the individual died from COVID-19 during the course of the study. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between demographic characteristics, residential characteristics, and preexisting health conditions and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality. Results: Among the 543 individuals with IDD in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 57.0 (45-65) years; 217 (40.0%) were female, and 274 (50.5%) were Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native, or Hispanic. The case rate was 16â¯759 (95% CI, 13â¯853-20â¯131) per 100â¯000; the mortality rate was 6446 (95% CI, 4671-8832) per 100â¯000; and the case-fatality rate was 38.5% (95% CI, 29.1%-48.7%). Increased age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06), Down syndrome (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.49-5.69), an increased number of residents (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00-1.14), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.90-9.15) were associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Heart disease (OR, 10.60; 95% CI, 2.68-41.90) was associated with COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, similar to the general population, increased age and preexisting health conditions were associated with COVID-19 outcomes for people with IDD receiving residential support services in New York City. As with older adults living in nursing homes, number of residents was also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Unique to people with IDD was an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis for people with Down syndrome.","Landes, Scott D; Turk, Margaret A; Damiani, Marco R; Proctor, Philip; Baier, Sarah",JAMA Netw Open,,232

However, it only demonstrates on mucosal tunic, the index of lesion and morphologic preserved cells, but not the index of viable functional cells, present in the sample. With this purpose, a colorimetric method was used, employing Methyl Thiazolyl Blue (MTT). The experiment was conducted in 30 Wistar male rats, distributed in 3 groups: Group Control (GC), Group ischemia and reperfusion-1 (GIR-1) and Group ischemia and reperfusion-3 (GIR-3), with 10 animals each. The Groups GIR-1 and GIR-3 were submitted to intestinal ischemia for 30 minutes by a false ligature of superior mesenteric artery, and submitted to euthanasia after 1 and 3 days of reperfusion, when material was picked for absorbency and histological procedures. It was observed a smaller proportion of viable cells and a larger degree of mucosal lesion in GIR-3 group (p 0.05), while GC group was the one with the larger proportion of viable cells and smaller degree of the mucosal injury (p 0.05). This way we concluded that MTT is as effective and reliable as the histological study at evaluating alterations produced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion.","Vinicius Henriques Brito, Marcus; de Araújo, Marialva; June Sasaki Acácio, Glayce; Josy Sasaki Acácio, Glayce; Maciel Caldas dos Reis, José",Acta cir. bras.,,232

So far, few cases of COVID-19 disease in patients with PH have been reported. Caution is warranted in interpreting this observation as data are evolving and several factors may influence the number of reported cases of PH and COVID-19. Social distancing and quarantine could play a role, especially for patients with chronic diseases who might be more vigilant of their potential for respiratory infection. In addition, PH is a rare disease, and because testing is not universal, we could be underestimating the number of cases. Other hypothetical factors to consider are the underlying pathophysiology of PH and the medications used to treat PH and their implications in COVID-19.","Farha, Samar",Clevel. clin. j. med,,232

227844,COVID-19 and homelessness: when crises intersect,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mental health status of college students during the epidemic of COVID-19 and identify the factors influencing the mental health of the students. METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","Chang, Jinghui; Yuan, Yuxin; Wang, Dong",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,232

The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a massive surge in the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. To avoid being overwhelmed, hospitals had to adapt and support the ICU teams in structured ICU care including involving surgical teams. This work aims at describing the collaborative efforts between the ICU care team and the Surgical Task Force (STF) during a surge of ICU activity in a University Hospital in a French high-density COVID-19 cluster. Study Design. This retrospective single center study analyzed the STF workflow and the ICU population. The study included 55 patients hospitalized in our ICU, ICU-converted step-down units, and post-anesthesia care units. The primary measure was the global daily STF activity. The secondary measure was the daily activity for each of the 5 tasks accomplished by the STF. Results. The STF attempted 415 phone calls for 55 patients' families, 237 mobilizations of patients requiring prone positions, follow-up of 20 patients requiring medevac, and contribution to ethical discussion for 2 patients.

In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly important to contain disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting their intention to use this platform. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use. Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ""strongly disagree"" (1 point) to ""strongly agree"" (5 points). Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software. RESULTS: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected (female: 219/350, 62.6%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0%; university-level education: 228/350, 65.1%; occupation as student: 195/350, 56.6%; average monthly income <NT $30,000 [<US $1054.89]: 230/350, 65.7%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4%; and health status perceived as ""good"": 171/350, 48.9%). Five indicators, including chi-square test (X2310=2.63), goodness-of-fit index (0.85), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (0.81), comparative fit index (0.91), and root mean square error of approximation (0.07), were calculated. The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated that the most important factor affecting respondents' behavioral intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07). CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation model with a strong goodness of fit. The results of our analysis are consistent with the technology acceptance model. Through the diverse value-added services of MHB, Taiwan's experience in pandemic prevention with smart technology can facilitate future responses to unknown, emerging infectious diseases.","Tsai, Wen-Hsun; Wu, Yi-Syuan; Cheng, Chia-Shiang; Kuo, Ming-Hao; Chang, Yu-Tien; Hu, Fu-Kang; Sun, Chien-An; Chang, Chi-Wen; Chan, Ta-Chien; Chen, Chao-Wen; Lee, Chia-Cheng; Chu, Chi-Ming",J Med Internet Res,,232

Among presented data, we were surprised to see that serum albumin (ALB) concentrations during hospitalization did not significantly predict patient death at the multivariate analysis (MA), even if 86.6% of patients showed ALB values <35 g/L, i.e. the lower reference limit. In a similar COVID-19 population enrolled in our national reference center for infectious diseases, we recently analysed a group of common biochemistry tests, including ALB, as major predictor of COVID-19 severity (2). Although the patient rate showing an ALB <35 g/L was quite similar (89%) to that of Hundt's study, at MA low ALB concentrations remained significantly associated (P=0.003) with higher odds of death, ALB values &#8804;18 g/L giving a positive likelihood ratio of 12.2 for predicting in-hospital death. In terms of absolute ALB levels in the respective populations, it is however somewhat difficult to compare our results with those of Hundt et al. as the authors do not mention the methodology used to determine ALB in their hospital network. It is known that immunoturbidimetric assays for ALB determination, such as the one in use in our institution, are specific for the ALB measurement contrary to nonspecific colorimetric methods, which are in use in the majority of U.S. healthcare institutions, also reacting with proteins other than ALB (3). The well-known lack of specificity of the latter methods, especially at low ALB and high globulin (including ""acute phase reactants"") concentrations, i.e. the typical COVID-19 situation, may have influenced the Hundt's results. Figure 1 depicts ALB distribution in our COVID-19 patients showing that even survivors displayed a median (interquartile range) [28 g/L (25-32)] quite lower that patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled by Hundt et al. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the inability of ALB to predict death in the Hundt's study was due to spuriously higher ALB values measured with non-specific methods in the evaluated COVID-19 patients. The accuracy of ALB methods may become critical in COVID-19 cases, where ALB is decreased but acute-phase proteins are increased, and thus use of immunological assays should be preferred in this condition (4).","Pasqualetti, Sara; Aloisio, Elena; Panteghini, Mauro",Hepatology (Baltim.),,232

In particular, promising results have been obtained in the experimental therapy of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which represents the most threatening complication of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, more recently, great interest has been devoted to the possible clinical applications of extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs, nanoparticles that convey much of the biological effects and of the therapeutic efficacy of their cells of origin.

Results from a Preliminary Assessment in the French Elderly Population,2020,"Sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus, responsible for severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19). A large number of natural compounds are under trial for screening compounds, possessing potential inhibitory effect against the viral infection. Keeping in view the importance of marine compounds in antiviral activity, we investigated the potency of some marine natural products to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID 6MO3). The crystallographic structure of Mpro in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100 ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant. In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.[Figure: see text].","Khan, Muhammad Tahir; Ali, Arif; Wang, Qiankun; Irfan, Muhammad; Khan, Abbas; Zeb, Muhammad Tariq; Zhang, Yu-Juan; Chinnasamy, Sathishkumar; Wei, Dong-Qing",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,232

Successful management of acute bacterial infections requires early diagnosis and treatment, which are not always easy to achieve. Structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often applied to this problem. However, these methods generally rely on secondary inflammatory changes and are frequently not specific to infection. The use of nuclear medicine (NM) techniques can add crucial complementary information, allowing visualization of infectious pathophysiology beyond morphologic imaging. This review will discuss the current structural and functional imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of bacterial infection and their roles in different clinical scenarios. We will also present several new radiotracers in development, with an emphasis on probes targeting bacteria-specific metabolism. As highlighted by the current COVID-19 epidemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, similar thinking may apply in imaging viral pathogens; for this case prominent effects on host proteins most notably ACE2 might also provide worthwhile imaging targets.","Polvoy, Ilona; Flavell, Robert R; Ohliger, Michael; Rosenberg, Oren; Wilson, David M",J. nucl. med,,232

257309,Will There Be an Epidemic of Corollary Illnesses Linked to a COVID-19-Related Recession?,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the widespread outbreak of novel coronavirus diseases 2019(COVID-19), more and more death cases were reported, however, limited data are available for the patients who died. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of deaths with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We abstracted and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 83 death cases with COVID-19 pneumonia in East Hospital of Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, between January 26, 2020, and February 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 83 deaths, none was the medical staff. The mean age was 71.8 years (SD 13.2; range, 34-97 years) and 53(63.9%) were male. The median from onset to admission was 10 days (IQR 7-14: range, 2-43 days), to death was 17 days (IQR 14-21: range, 6-54 days). Most deaths (66[80%]) had underlying comorbid diseases, the most of which was hypertension [47(57%)]. The main initial symptoms of these 83 deaths were shortness of breath(98.8%), fever(94%), and myalgia or fatigue(90.4%). Laboratory analyses showed the lymphocytopenia in 69(83%) deaths, hypoalbuminemia in 77(93%) deaths, the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase in 79(95%) deaths, procalcitonin in 69(83%) deaths and C-reactive protein in 79(95%) deaths. All 83 patients received antiviral treatment, 81(97.6%) deaths received antibiotic therapy, 54(65.1%) deaths received glucocorticoid therapy, and 20(24.1%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Most of the deaths with COVID-19 pneumonia were elderly patients with underlying comorbid diseases, especially those over 70 years of age. The time of death after the onset of the disease was mostly 15-21 days. More care should be given to the elderly in further prevention and control strategies of COVID-19.","Yao, Tao; Gao, Yan; Cui, Qin; Peng, Bo; Chen, Yan; Li, Jiansheng; Huang, Chao; He, Chunping; Pu, Jie; Wei, Jiajun; Zhan, Yanqiang; Yan, Jie; Tian, Jinghua; Zhang, Zhaohui; Liu, Zhichao",BMC Infect Dis,,232

Ketoacidosis is associated with materno-fetal morbidity and mortality necessitating prompt diagnosis and management. Physiological increases in insulin resistance render pregnancy a diabetogenic state with increased susceptibility to ketosis. COVID-19 is associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes and is an independent risk factor for ketoacidosis in normoglycaemic individuals. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe two cases of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women presenting with normoglycaemic metabolic ketoacidosis. Both cases were associated with maternal and fetal compromise, requiring aggressive fluid and insulin resuscitation and early delivery. CONCLUSION: We discuss possible physiology and propose a management strategy for euglycaemic ketoacidosis in pregnancy.","Pikovsky, Margaret; Tan, Min Yi; Ahmed, Amanda; Sykes, Lynne; Agha-Jaffar, Rochan; Yu, Christina K H",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,232

METHODS: This was a quantitative descriptive/correlational research design. Research announcement was sent out via Facebook to 1200 possible participants. Six surveys were condensed into a single Survey Monkey questionnaire for participants to complete. Surveys asked questions relating to risk factors linked to weight gain. RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of our sample stated they spend more time at home now than before COVID-19. Twenty-two percent of the sample stated they gained 5-10 pounds. Within those who gained 5-10 pounds, there was a significantly higher percentage of the total sample who reported they increased eating in response to sight and smell (p = .048), eating in response to stress (p = .041), and snacking after dinner (p = .016) compared to those who stated they did not change those behaviors at all. There were significant relationships between predictor variables hours of sleep per night and physical activity time on reported weight gain (r = -.195, p = .021, r = -.155, p = .034, respectively). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for weight gain during self-quarantine are inadequate sleep, snacking after dinner, lack of dietary restraint, eating in response to stress, and reduced physical activity.","Zachary, Zeigler; Brianna, Forbes; Brianna, Lopez; Garrett, Pedersen; Jade, Welty; Alyssa, Deyo; Mikayla, Kerekes",Obes Res Clin Pract,,232

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastrointestinal involvement has been described in COVID-19; however, no clear figures of incidence, epidemiology and economic impact exist for de-novo surgical diseases in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a prospective study including all patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR, between 1 March and 15 May 2020 at two Tertiary Hospitals. Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation. RESULTS: Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay (LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days, p = 0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p = 0.0004). A median of two post-surgical complications were registered for each patient undergoing surgery. Complication-associated costs were as high as 38,962 USD per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of de-novo surgical diseases is low in COVID-19, but it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Future studies should elucidate the mechanism underlying the condition and identify strategies to prevent the need for surgery.","Kraft, Miquel; Pellino, Gianluca; Jofra, Mariona; Sorribas, Maria; Solís-Peña, Alejandro; Biondo, Sebastiano; Espín-Basany, Eloy",Surg.

Motivated by an industrial company restructuring its manufacturing system with the layout of fixed-position assembly islands (FPAI) during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper introduces the synchronization-oriented reconfiguration of FPAI under Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (GiMS). Inspired by the graduation ceremony, a novel manufacturing mode-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) with ticket-based reconfigurable structures, is designed for organizing production operations with simplicity and resilience for the layout of FPAI. The IIoT and digital twin-enabled GiMS is developed for transforming real-time visibility in operations to support the reconfiguration of the manufacturing system. A synchronization-oriented reconfiguration mechanism is proposed to achieve the synchronous interaction among changing customer demand, island configuration, and production activities allocation rapidly and cost-effectively. Cloud services integrating the proposed reconfiguration mechanism are developed for managers and onsite operators for supporting the successful reconfiguration implementation with enhanced operational visibility. Through the case study of an industrial company, the effectiveness of the proposed concept and approach is verified.","Guo, Daqiang Li Mingxing Ling Shiquan Zhong Ray Y.; Rong, Yiming Huang George Q.",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,,232

271369,UK NICE Guidelines for EVAR: Cost Implications for Post-COVID Australian Public Health,2021,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common pruritic inflammatory skin disease characterized by impaired epidermal barrier function and dysregulation of Thelper-2 (TH2)-biased immune responses. While the lineage of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are implicated to play decisive roles in T-cell immune responses, their requirement for the development of AD remains elusive. Here, we describe the impact of the constitutive loss of cDCs on the progression of AD-like inflammation by using binary transgenic (Tg) mice that constitutively lacked CD11chi cDCs. Unexpectedly, the congenital deficiency of cDCs not only exacerbates the pathogenesis of AD-like inflammation but also elicits immune abnormalities with the increased composition and function of granulocytes and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as well as B cells possibly mediated through the breakdown of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-mediated homeostatic feedback loop. Furthermore, the constitutive loss of cDCs accelerates skin colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), that associated with disease flare. Thus, cDCs maintains immune homeostasis to prevent the occurrence of immune abnormalities to maintain the functional skin barrier for mitigating AD flare.","Nishikawa, Yotaro; Fukaya, Tomohiro; Fukui, Takehito; Uto, Tomofumi; Takagi, Hideaki; Nasu, Junta; Miyanaga, Noriaki; Riethmacher, Dieter; Choijookhuu, Narantsog; Hishikawa, Yoshitaka; Amano, Masahiro; Sato, Katsuaki",Front Immunol,,232

METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included 87 eyes: 40 eyes in the WFG LASIK group and 47 eyes in the SMILE group. Manual cyclotorsion compensation by marking the horizontal axis before SMILE surgery was used for optimized SMILE. Refractive diopter, aberrations, and contrast sensitivity were assessed 3 months postoperatively. The Alpins vector analysis method was used to analyze the astigmatic changes after surgery. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the corrected distance visual acuity and refraction between the two groups after surgery. The fitted curve of surgically induced astigmatism versus target induced astigmatism was described as y = 0.9905 x + 0.0009 in the WFG LASIK group and y = 0.9672 x + 0.0026 in the SMILE group. The percentage of corneal astigmatism axis change within 5 degrees was statistically significant (chi-square test: 10.632, P = .001). HOAs increased in both the WFG LASIK and SMILE groups after surgery (t = -3.655, P = .001, t = -3.784, P = .001, respectively). However, comparison of the changes of HOAs between both groups was not significant (t = -0.565, P = .575). The improvement in contrast sensitivity in the WFG LASIK group was significantly higher than that in the SMILE group. CONCLUSIONS: WFG LASIK and optimized SMILE can achieve similar outcomes for astigmatism correction. Optimized SMILE with marking could achieve good astigmatism correction, even without an eye tracking system.

279749,Pulmonary immuno-thrombosis in COVID-19 ARDS pathogenesis,2021,"A semiempirical model, based in the logistic map, has been succesfully applied to forecast important quantities along the several phases of the outbreak of the covid-19 for different countries. This paper shows how the model was calibrated and applied to perform predictions of people needing to be hospitalized, needs of ventilators, or the number of deaths which would be produced. It is shown specifically the results obtained in the case of Spain, showing a prediction of diagnosed infected and deaths which will be observed after the ease of the total lockdown produced the 13th of March. Is also shown how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the different regions of Spain is forecasted. The model predicts for Spain for the end of May more than 400,000 diagnosed infected cases, number which will be probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for that date is 46,000 +/- 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of infection at Catalonia than the level at Madrid, according with this model. All of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize resources and to avoid future outbreaks of the covid-19.","Mora, Juan C.; P'erez, Sandra; Rodr'iguez, Ignacio; N'unez, Asunci'on; Dvorzhak, Alla",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08990v1.pdf,232

282256,"Pre-testing of the WHO's Educational Video: ""How to Protect Yourself against COVID-19""",2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is spread from human to human and has resulted in a global pandemic, posing a disastrous public health risk worldwide. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to their immunocompromised status and frail condition. The home treatment setting of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has advantages in terms of implementing self-care when routine hospital visits and social activities are restricted, thus greatly reducing exposure of PD patients to the virus. Methods and Results: We outline general operational considerations in PD management during the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures for PD patients and healthcare staff. Precautionary measures for PD patients include education on prevention of, and screening for, COVID-19, preclinic screening, in-clinic management, meticulous remote patient management and special hospitalization arrangements. The diagnosis and treatment of PD patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Precautionary measures for PD staff include continuous education on, and training in, COVID-19, exposure history surveillance and self-monitoring for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, organization of medical activities and staffing, and adequate environment cleaning. Conclusions: This is a battle of the entire human society against the novel coronavirus. Integrated teamwork among healthcare providers, supported by society as a whole, is needed as part of the ongoing public health response to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhikai; Dong, Jie",Clin Kidney J,,232

282440,Role of the Health System in Combating Covid-19: Cross-Section Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Simulation for 124 Country Cases,2020,"Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December of 2019, clinicians and scientists all over the world have faced overwhelming new challenges that not only threaten their own communities and countries but also the world at large. These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries, including developing ones, had little or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries, such as Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case, and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound (US) found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. US is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality that has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and, in this way, is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit that keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This article presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of the US for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing US technologies that are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3-D systems.","Qian, Xuejun; Wodnicki, Robert; Kang, Haochen; Zhang, Junhang; Tchelepi, Hisham; Zhou, Qifa",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,,232

METHODS: This observational study recruited a convenience sample of three patients. Procedures were performed in a positive pressure operating room. Particle image velocimetry and spectrometry with air sampling were used for aerosol detection. RESULTS: Intubation and extubation generated small particles (< 5 µm) in mean concentrations 12 times greater than background noise (p < 0.001). The mean particle concentrations during endonasal access were 4.5 times greater than background (p = 0.01). Particles were typically large (> 75 µm), remained airborne for up to 10 s and travelled up to 1.1 m. Use of a microdebrider generated mean aerosol concentrations 18 times above baseline (p = 0.005). High-speed drilling did not produce aerosols greater than baseline. Pituitary tumour resection generated mean aerosol concentrations less than background (p = 0.18). Surgical drape removal generated small and large particles in mean concentrations 6.4 times greater than background (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Intubation and extubation generate large amounts of small particles that remain suspended in air for long durations and disperse through theatre. Endonasal access and pituitary tumour resection generate smaller concentrations of larger particles which are airborne for shorter periods and travel shorter distances.","Dhillon, Rana S; Nguyen, Lana V; Rowin, Wagih Abu; Humphries, Ruhi S; Kevin, Kevin; Ward, Jason D; Yule, Andrew; Phan, Tuong D; Zhao, Yi Chen; Wynne, David; McNeill, Peter M; Hutchins, Nicholas; Scott, David A",Pituitary,,232
296452,Commentary: COVID-19 Mortality: A Matter of Vulnerability Among Nations Facing Limited Margins of Adaptation,2021,"Among the many efforts done by the scientific community to help coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most important has been the creation of models to describe its propagation, as these are expected to guide the deployment of containment and health policies. These models are commonly based on exogenous information, as e.g. mobility data, whose limitedness always compromise the reliability of obtained results. In this contribution we propose a different approach, based on extracting relationships between the evolution of the disease in different regions through information theoretical metrics. In a way similar to what is commonly done in neuroscience, propagation is understood as information transfer, and the resulting propagation patterns are represented and studied as functional networks. By applying this methodology to the dynamics of COVID-19 in several countries and regions thereof, we were able to reconstruct static and time-varying propagation graphs. We further discuss the advantages, promises and open research questions associated with this functional approach.","Zanin, Massimiliano; Papo, David",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,232

With no effective treatments and with time needed to develop a vaccine, alternative approaches are being used to control this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to identify topics, opinions, and recommendations about the COVID-19 pandemic discussed by medical professionals on the Twitter social medial platform. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed COVID-19-related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content. We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the pandemic using qualitative coding. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions. RESULTS: Data were collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. We identified eight topics, namely actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, the health care system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission. The tweets mainly focused on needed actions and recommendations (2827/10,096, 28%) to control the pandemic. Many tweets warned about misleading information (2019/10,096, 20%) that could lead to infection of more people with the virus. Other tweets discussed general knowledge and information (911/10,096, 9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the health care systems and workers (909/10,096, 9%). The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (810/10,096, 8%), immunity (707/10,096, 7%), testing (605/10,096, 6%), and virus infection and transmission (503/10,096, 5%).

False-positive virus detection tests not only aggravate the situation in the healthcare sector, but also provide ground for speculations. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of software choice and data interpretation in virome studies. We aimed to further expand theoretical and practical knowledge in bioinformatics-driven virome studies by focusing on short, virus-like DNA sequences in metagenomic data. Analyses of datasets obtained from different sample types (terrestrial, animal and human related samples) and origins showed that coronavirus-like sequences have existed in host-associated and environmental samples before the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the analyzed datasets, various Betacoronavirus-like sequences were detected that also included SARS-CoV-2 matches. Deepening analyses indicated that the detected sequences are not of viral origin and thus should not be considered in virome profiling approaches. Our study confirms the importance of parameter selection, especially in terms of read length, for reliable virome profiling. Natural environments are an important source of coronavirus-like nucleotide sequences that should be taken into account when virome datasets are analyzed and interpreted. We therefore suggest that processing parameters are carefully selected for SARS-CoV-2 profiling in host related as well as environmental samples in order to avoid incorrect identifications.","Mora, Maximilian; Wicaksono, Wisnu Adi; Egamberdieva, Dilfuza; Krause, Robert; Martinez, Jose Luis; Cernava, Tomislav; Berg, Gabriele",Sci Total Environ,,232

The simultaneous use of different treatments for COVID-19 was taken into account, both in sub-cohorts matching and in COX regression. Results: There were 187 patients treated with glucocorticoids; of these, 25 patients could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched sub-cohorts, no significant difference was observed in time to discharge (log-rank: p = 0.291) or the increment in SAFI at 48 hours of treatment (glucocorticoides: -0.04; controls: +0.37; p = 0.095). Multivariate models using Cox regression showed a significantly longer time to discharge in patients treated with glucocorticoids (hazard ratio: 7.26; 95% IC: 3.30-15.95). Conclusions: We have not found improvement in respiratory function or time until discharge, associated with the use of glucocorticoids at high doses.","Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro; Pérez-López, Carlos; Gálvez-Barrón, César; Miñarro, Antonio; Rodríguez Gullello, Ezequiel A; Collado Pérez, Isabel; Milà Ràfols, Núria; Mónaco, Ernesto E; Hidalgo García, Antonio; Añaños Carrasco, Gemma; Chamero Pastilla, Antonio",,,232

305782,Mass gathering events and reducing further global spread of COVID-19: a political and public health dilemma,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in global healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of COVID-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute COVID-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated COVID-19 clinics.","Nalbandian, Ani; Sehgal, Kartik; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; McGroder, Claire; Stevens, Jacob S; Cook, Joshua R; Nordvig, Anna S; Shalev, Daniel; Sehrawat, Tejasav S; Ahluwalia, Neha; Bikdeli, Behnood; Dietz, Donald; Der-Nigoghossian, Caroline; Liyanage-Don, Nadia; Rosner, Gregg F; Bernstein, Elana J; Mohan, Sumit; Beckley, Akinpelumi A; Seres, David S; Choueiri, Toni K; Uriel, Nir; Ausiello, John C; Accili, Domenico; Freedberg, Daniel E; Baldwin, Matthew; Schwartz, Allan; Brodie, Daniel; Garcia, Christine Kim; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Connors, Jean M; Bilezikian, John P; Landry, Donald W; Wan, Elaine Y",Nat Med,,232
307812,Essential Strategies to Curb COVID-19 Transmission in Prisons and Jails,2021,"ABSTRACT: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not a proven foodborne pathogen, the COVID-19 pandemic has put the food system on alert, and food safety has been identified as an important pillar in mitigating the crisis. Therefore, an understanding of how popular media are used as a vital disseminator of food safety and health information for the public is more important than ever. YouTube deserves particular attention as one of the most highly trafficked Web sites on the Internet, especially because YouTube has been blamed during the pandemic for spreading misleading or untrustworthy information that contradicts validated information. This study was conducted to evaluate the food safety information and practices circulating on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic and the alignment of these practices with recommendations from government agencies. A search for videos on YouTube was conducted using the key words ""food and COVID-19,"" ""food safety and COVID-19,"" and ""groceries and COVID-19."" After applying a series of inclusive and exclusive criteria, 85 videos from the United States and Canada were evaluated. More than half (69%) of the videos presented hand washing procedures, 26% showed kitchen disinfection, and most (86%) showed take-out food or grocery store practices. Multiple produce washing procedures were also shown throughout videos. Food was not considered hazardous in 39% of the videos, but 24% mentioned that food packaging is potentially hazardous. Most videos cited government agencies and had a host or guest who was a health care professional, professor, or expert. Three videos were not aligned with a government agency's guideline or information cited; two were presented by a health care professional. These findings reveal the need to develop educational interventions that increase YouTube video host and guest awareness of social media use as a tool for food safety dissemination and the need to provide trustworthy information.","Thomas, Merlyn; Haynes, Peyton; Archila-Godínez, Juan C; Nguyen, Mai; Xu, Wenqing; Feng, Yaohua",J Food Prot,,232

310369,Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Building individuals' positive attitudes during a pandemic is essential for facilitating psychological resilience. However, little is known about how public health measures may improve people's positive attitudes during a pandemic. We investigated the potential mechanism underlying the association between individuals' perceived effectiveness of public health measures and positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic, by examining the parallel mediating effects of three types of threat appraisals: concerns about contracting the virus, perceived impact of the pandemic on life and estimated duration of the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In February 2020 when the COVID-19 infection was spreading rapidly in China, a large cross-sectional survey was conducted among 132 054 adults from the 16 districts in Shanghai, China. OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived effectiveness of the public health measures, positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control and threat appraisals. RESULTS: Results of structural equation modelling supported the hypothesised mediation model: perceived effectiveness of public health measures was associated with lower levels of concerns about contracting the virus (ß=-0.20), perceived impact of the pandemic (ß=-0.13) and perceived duration of the pandemic (ß=-0.20), which were then associated with higher levels of positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control (ßs=-0.12 to -0.25). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that threat appraisals may be important pathways through which individuals' evaluations of prevention strategies may influence their attitudes towards the success of pandemic control. The health authorities should consider reducing people's inappropriate threat appraisals when designing public health policies to facilitate people's positive attitudes during a pandemic.","Chu, Qiao; Gu, Tian; Li, Anqi; Chen, Junjie; Wang, Hui; Liu, Ningning; Wu, Ruijun; He, Yaping",BMJ Open,,232

The present study is mainly related to the airborne transmission of novel coronavirus through airway. Similarly, our mother planet is suffering from drastic effects of air pollution. There are sufficient probabilities or evidences proven for contagious virus transmission through polluted airborne-pathway in formed aerosol molecules. The pathways and sources of spread are detailed along with the best possible green control technologies or ideas to hinder further transmission. The combined effects of such root causes and unwanted outcomes are similar in nature leading to acute cardiac arrest of our planet. To maintain environmental sustainability, the prior future of such emerging unknown biological hazardous air emissions is to be thoroughly researched. So it is high time to deal with the future of hazardous air pollution and work on its preventive measures. The lifetime of such an airborne virus continues for several hours, thus imposing severe threat even during post-lockdown phase. The world waits eagerly for the development of successful vaccination or medication but the possible outcome is quite uncertain in terms of equivalent economy distribution and biomedical availability. Thus, risk assessments are to be carried out even during the post-vaccination period with proper environmental surveillance and monitoring. The skilled techniques of disinfection, sanitization, and other viable wayouts are to be modified with time, place, and prevailing climatic conditions, handling the pandemic efficiently.

314707,Rapid antigen screening of asymptomatic people as a public health tool to combat COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Children are discussed as hidden SARS-CoV-2 virus reservoir because of predominantly mild or even asymptomatic course of disease. The objective of this cross-sectional study in May-July 2020 was to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and virus RNA in schoolchildren, consistent with previous infection by contact tracing. METHODS: School authorities approached parents for voluntary participation. Interested families were contacted by the study team. A nasal and oropharyngeal swab, a blood sample, and a questionnaire were employed. Primary endpoint was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and antibody-positive children. Antibody positivity was assessed by a highly sensitive first-line ELISA, and a neutralization assay and two other immunoassays as confirmatory assays. RESULTS: Of 2069 children (median age 13 years, IQR 10-15), 2 cases (0.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 26 cases (1.3%) tested positive for specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies exhibited detectable virus-neutralizing activity in 92% (24 of 26 samples). Seropositivity was associated with a history of mild clinical symptoms in 14 children (53.8%), while 12 children (46.2%) remained asymptomatic. Among 13 seropositive children being tested concomitantly with their siblings, only one pair of siblings was seropositive. Contact tracing revealed adult family members and school teachers as potential index cases. CONCLUSION: In schoolchildren, the infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 is low and associated with a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. Virus spreading seemed to occur more likely in intergenerational contacts than among siblings in the same household. The presence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children may reflect protective adaptive immunity.","Szépfalusi, Zsolt; Schmidthaler, Klara; Sieber, Justyna; Kopanja, Sonja; Götzinger, Florian; Schoof, Anja; Hoz, Jakub; Willinger, Birgit; Makristathis, Athanasios; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Stiasny, Karin; Bohle, Barbara; Krotka, Pavla; Graf, Alexandra; Frischer, Thomas",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,232

Diagnosis errors in chronic parenchymal parotitis are frequent and important but represent an underemphasized and understudied area of patient safety. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to elaborate the most effective and acceptable strategies for the diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the histories of 211 patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis. All patients underwent ultrasound diagnostic, as well as medical and genetic counseling and examination of 1st degree relatives and probands. RESULTS: After additional examinations, 100 children were given other diagnoses. Having analyzed the results of medical-genetic and echographic examinations of 111 patients with chronic parenchymal parotitis and their family members, we have developed a pattern of chronic parenchymal parotitis inheritance. All patients were divided into 3 groups according to the type of inheritance: monogenic inheritance, multifactorial inheritance, and sporadic cases. CONCLUSION: A complex approach to the differential diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis is what is needed to reduce the frequency of diagnostic errors.","Klinovskaya, A S; Smislenova, M V; Gurgenadze, A P; Abrahamyan, K D; Bazikyan, O A",Stomatologiia (Mosk),,232

324285,Migrant health is public health: a call for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. Health care systems globally are amid an unprecedented challenge. Since its emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to 185 countries worldwide, with more than 2.63 million cases confirmed and more than 183 thousand related deaths (as of 23/04/2020). According to current evidence, the novel coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human mainly via respiratory droplets of different sizes, contact with bodily fluids, or from contaminated surfaces. In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed. The common clinical symptoms of the highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic virus include fever, cough, fatigue, ageusia and anosmia and in some patients, gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and patients with comorbidities are susceptible to infection and prone to severe complications, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokines storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. Under these circumstances, it is critical for health care settings, including nuclear medicine departments to take infection control measures, to prevent a potential spread not just among patients but also to staff members as well as to reconsider the performance of randomized clinical trials. There have already been papers on the radiology preparedness that should be applied to radiology and nuclear medicine departments to support the care of patients with COVID-19 and maintain radiologic diagnostic and interventional support for the entirety of the hospital and healthcare system, particularly for emergencies, without jeopardizing an outbreak in the units. Since most nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are non-urgent, the general guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for infection prevention and control is to postpone scheduled procedure after cautious risk assessment, with certain exceptions. Individualized approach of each case is a sine qua non of ensuring low transmission of COVID-19 as well as effective and safe management of patients admitted to nuclear medicine departments. Another major issue raised is the possible impact COVID-19 on the transport of medical radioisotopes. By the 1st of April 2020, the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) co-chaired the European Observatory on Supply of Medical Radioisotope expressing their concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and inconsequence on the availability of the most vital medical radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Due to the current lockdown situation, extended border controls, reductions and elimination of many commercial passenger flights, competition and cost of cargo and charter options, required appropriate additional support. The new era of nuclear medicine practice worldwide coincides with a new era for the Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine (HSNM) and the Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine (HJNM). The founder and Editor in Chief for more than 28 consecutive years, Professor Emeritus Philip Grammaticos, resigned leaving behind a benchmark for the presidencies and editors to come. His commitment to the conservation of a high level of scientific excellence of the published papers is the legacy which we wish to maintain in the future publications.

Desde entonces su distribución se ha ampliado mundialmente causando una emergencia en los sistemas de salud. MÉTODO: Corresponde al reporte de caso clínico. Este estudio es descriptivo y se basa en el manejo realizado a paciente embarazada con COVID-19 confirmado. Esta publicación cuenta con la autorización del comité de ética local para la revisión de ficha clínica. CASO: Mujer de 40 años con un embarazo de 31 semanas, se le diagnostica COVID-19 tras contacto estrecho con caso confirmado. Evoluciona con disnea y por posibilidad de interrupción del embarazo se traslada a centro de mayor complejidad. Allí se pesquisa compromiso de función pulmonar, uso de musculatura accesoria y alteración sensorial, requiriendo oxigenoterapia. Se evalúa interdisciplinariamente decidiendo intubar y realizando manejo en unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI). Se realiza cesárea de urgencia a las 31+4 semanas debiendo realizarse histerectomía total por inercia uterina. Tras el procedimiento evoluciona tórpidamente con deterioro de función pulmonar, describiéndose un pronóstico catastrófico con probabilidad de fallecer por insuficiencia respiratoria. Un mes después despierta con una mejoría en su función pulmonar, sin otra falla orgánica. Actualmente se encuentra en buenas condiciones y es tratada multidisciplinariamente para lograr una rehabilitación integral. DISCUSIÓN: En epidemias pasadas, las embarazadas mostraron altas tasas de letalidad y riesgo de ingreso a UCI. Basados en una revisión de reportes de casos, parece ser que COVID-19 durante el embarazo se asocia a morbilidad materna severa, riesgo que aumenta en mujeres con comorbilidades, lo cual hace cuestionarnos si la infección por COVID-19 intensifica el riesgo materno o estos casos ya eran embarazos de riesgo.

332515,The Covid-19 pandemic: a veritable storm of ethical tensions,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, which is a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted rapidly via contaminated surfaces and aerosols, emphasizing the importance of environmental disinfection to block the spread of virus. Ultraviolet C radiation and chemical compounds are effective for SARS-CoV-2 disinfection, but can only be applied in the absence of humans due to their toxicities. Therefore, development of disinfectants that can be applied in working spaces without evacuating people is needed. Here we showed that TiO2-mediated photocatalytic reaction inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in a time-dependent manner and decreases its infectivity by 99.9% after 20 min and 120 min of treatment in aerosol and liquid, respectively. The mechanistic effects of TiO2 photocatalyst on SARS-CoV-2 virion included decreased total observed virion count, increased virion size, and reduced particle surface spike structure, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Damage to viral proteins and genome was further confirmed by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively.

332516,The Covid-19 pandemic: a veritable storm of ethical tensions,2021,"The initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria is ruled by three canonical factors: IF1, IF2, and IF3. This system persists in human mitochondria; however, it functions in a rather different way due to specialization and adaptation to the organellar micro-environment. We focused on human mitochondrial IF3, which was earlier studied in vitro, but no knock-out cellular models have been published up to date. In this work, we generated human HeLa cell lines deficient in the MTIF3 gene and analyzed their mitochondrial function. Despite the lack of IF3mt in these cells, they preserved functional mitochondria capable of oxygen consumption and protein synthesis; however, the translation of ATP6 mRNA was selectively decreased which compromised the assembly of ATP synthase. Together with the analogous results obtained earlier for baker's yeast mitochondrial IF3, our findings point to a functional divergence of mitochondrial initiation factors from their bacterial ancestors.","Chicherin, Ivan V; Baleva, Maria V; Levitskii, Sergey A; Dashinimaev, Erdem B; Krasheninnikov, Igor A; Kamenski, Piotr",Sci Rep,,232

We examined the alterations of sublingual microcirculation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 during VV-ECMO treatment and assessed the relationship between microvascular parameters and ventilation, hemodynamics, and laboratory tests. Nine patients were included in the study and the following microcirculatory parameters were estimated: TVD 16.81 (14.46-18.6) mm/mm2; PVD 15.3 (14.09-17.96) mm/mm2; PPV 94.85% (93.82%-97.79%); MFI 2.5 (2.5-2.92); HI 0.4 (0.18-0.4). TVD and PVD were inversely related to D-dimer levels (rho = -0.667, p = 0.05 and rho = -0.733, p = 0.025 respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (rho = -0.886, p = 0.019 and rho = -0.886, p = 0.019 respectively) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (rho = -0.829, p = 0.042 and rho = -0.829, p = 0.042 respectively). Our results showed an altered sublingual microcirculation in patients receiving VV-ECMO for severe SARS-CoV-2 and suggest a potential contribution of endothelia dysfunction to determine microvascular alteration.","Carsetti, Andrea; Damiani, Elisa; Casarotta, Erika; Scorcella, Claudia; Domizi, Roberta; Montomoli, Jonathan; Gasparri, Francesco; Gabbanelli, Vincenzo; Pantanetti, Simona; Carozza, Roberto; Adrario, Erica; Donati, Abele",Microvasc Res,,232

The present study presents the result of the monitoring of sanitary sewerage in the municipality of Niterói, a metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and its use as a complementary indicator in the surveillance of COVID-19 cases, thus assisting actions of public health from local authorities. Twelve composite raw sewage samples were weekly collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and alternately from 17 sewer pipes (SP) from surrounding neighbourhoods and slums throughout 20 weeks (April 15th to August 25th, 2020). Two hundred twenty-three samples were concentrated using the ultracentrifugation-based method and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected and quantified by RT-qPCR using primers and probe targeting the N2 genome. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 84.3% (188/223) of samples with a positive rate ranging from 42% (5/12) in the first week of monitoring to 100% during the peak of epidemic with viral concentration ranging from 3.1 to 7.1 log10 genome copies /100 mL throughout the studied period. Positive rates were higher in WWTPs when compared to SP, being useful tool for monitoring trends in the evolution of the COVID-19 curve, while SP data were more effective when health public interventions were needed. Whole-genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq System confirmed the lineage of three genomes as B.1.1.33 (clade G) containing the nucleotide substitutions observed in strains that circulate in the Rio de Janeiro during the period of this study.

Especially in times of social isolation and governmental restrictions, mental health should not be neglected. Innovative approaches are required to support psychologically burdened people. The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme's usability, feasibility and participants' satisfaction with 'CoPE It' (tertiary outcome). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' consists of four 30 min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The widely applied and previously established content has been adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by experts in psychosomatic medicine and stress prevention. In our longitudinal study, adult participants-with adequate German language and computer skills, and who have provided informed consent-will be recruited via emergency support hotlines in Germany. Flyers will be distributed, and online channels will be used. Participants will complete a baseline assessment (T0), a postintervention assessment (T1) and assessments 1 and 3 months later (T2 and T3, respectively). We will perform repeated measures analysis of covariance, mixed linear models, standard analyses of variance and regression, and correlation coefficients. In case of binary outcome variables, either mixed logistic regression or &#967;² tests will be used.

343354,Good stewardship: In the service of more health for all,2020,"Introduction Typical orofacial manifestations of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) include rhinitis and sinusitis, but salivary gland involvement is rare. Treatment of GPA increases risk of opportunistic infections. In light of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this places this population in a particularly vulnerable position. Here we describe a case of suppurative parotitis as the presenting sign of GPA, treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, subsequently complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, disseminated MRSA infection, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with aspergillosis of the pancreas. Presentation A 71-year-old male with COPD was admitted to hospital for progressive facial pain with left parotid gland swelling despite outpatient antibiotics. Basic laboratory workup was unremarkable. He developed hemoptysis, and CT chest revealed a new left upper lobe (LUL) cavitary lesion with bilateral nodules. Diagnostic bronchoscopy showed thickened, nodular mucosa in the LUL with luminal narrowing. Endobronchial biopsy showed inflammation with necrosis but no malignancy;culture showed no microorganisms. Parotid gland pus grew normal oral flora. CT-guided core biopsy of the LUL lesion showed fibrotic and necrotic tissue with inflammation and multi-nucleated giant cells, again without tumor cells. Initial autoimmune workup revealed ANA positivity, but he elected for discharge to outpatient autoimmune workup. Four weeks later he was admitted to another hospital with acute renal failure where testing revealed hypocomplementemia, elevated c-ANCA and anti-PR-3 antibodies. Renal biopsy demonstrated focal necrotizing and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis. A diagnosis of GPA was made and treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide was initiated. After three months of this regimen, he was re-admitted to our facility for SARSCoV- 2 infection. Hospital course was complicated by MRSA endocarditis and presumed fungal pneumonia. Despite aggressive treatment of both, he developed septic shock and ultimately expired. Autopsy revealed invasive aspergillus in the lungs and necrotizing pancreatitis from aspergillus. Discussion Salivary gland involvement is a rare manifestation of GPA and documented infrequently in case reports. The presence of parotitis in a patient with hemoptysis and negative malignant or infectious workup should prompt the consideration of GPA. Importantly, IPA associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompetent patients has been frequently documented in the literature, and immunosuppressed individuals such as this patient are surely at increased risk. The rare, incidental finding of aspergillus invading the pancreas on autopsy was likely related to his immunocompromised state. Given the high mortality rate, there should be a low threshold to treat for presumed IPA in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for which secondary infection is suspected.","Chang, A.; Lee, J.

343568,Strengthening collaborations at the public health system-academic interface: a call to action. (Special Section: COVID-19.),2020,"T cells play a critical role in coronavirus diseases. How they do so in COVID-19 may be revealed by analyzing the epigenetic chromatin accessibility of cis- and trans-regulatory elements and creating transcriptomic immune profiles. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC) and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (seq) on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of severely ill/critical patients (SCPs) infected with COVID-19, moderate patients (MPs), and healthy volunteer controls (HCs). About 76,570 and 107,862 single cells were used, respectively, for analyzing the characteristics of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic immune profiles by the application of scATAC-seq (nine cases) and scRNA-seq (15 cases). The scATAC-seq detected 28,535 different peaks in the three groups; among these peaks, 41.6 and 10.7% were located in the promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. Compared to HCs, among the peak-located genes in the total T cells and its subsets, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, from SCPs and MPs were enriched with inflammatory pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. The motifs of TBX21 were less accessible in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs compared with those in MPs. Furthermore, the scRNA-seq showed that the proportion of T cells, especially the CD4+ T cells, was decreased in SCPs and MPs compared with those in HCs. Transcriptomic results revealed that histone-related genes, and inflammatory genes, such as NFKBIA, S100A9, and PIK3R1, were highly expressed in the total T cells, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, both in the cases of SCPs and MPs. In the CD4+ T cells, decreased T helper-1 (Th1) cells were observed in SCPs and MPs. In the CD8+T cells, activation markers, such as CD69 and HLA class II genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB5), were significantly upregulated in SCPs. An integrated analysis of the data from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq showed some consistency between the approaches. Cumulatively, we have generated a landscape of chromatin epigenetic status and transcriptomic immune profiles of T cells in patients with COVID-19. This has provided a deeper dissection of the characteristics of the T cells involved at a higher resolution than from previously obtained data merely by the scRNA-seq analysis. Our data led us to suggest that the T-cell inflammatory states accompanied with defective functions in the CD4+ T cells of SCPs may be the key factors for determining the pathogenesis of and recovery from COVID-19.","Li, Shun; Wu, Bin; Ling, Yun; Guo, Mingquan; Qin, Boyin; Ren, Xiaonan; Wang, Chao; Yang, Hua; Chen, Lixiang; Liao, Yixin; Liu, Yang; Peng, Xiuhua; Xu, Chunhua; Wang, Zhenyan; Shen, Yinzhong; Chen, Jun; Liu, Li; Niu, Bowen; Zhu, Mengmin; Liu, Lingling; Li, Feng; Zhu, Tongyu; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Zhou, Xiaohui; Lu, Hongzhou",Front Immunol,,232

This paper describes a plan developed to understand and mitigate these risks. METHODS: Public health and psychiatric literature was reviewed and clinicians in CMH teams and infectious disease were consulted. Key risks posed by COVID-19 to CMH patients were identified and mitigation plans were prepared. RESULTS: A public health response plan for CMH teams was developed to support vulnerable individuals and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan will be reviewed regularly to respond to changes in public health recommendations, research findings and feedback from patients and clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The strategic response plan developed to address risks to vulnerable patients from COVID-19 can assist other CMH services in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thomson, Sumana; Doan, Trung; Liu, Dennis; Schubert, Klaus Oliver; Toh, Julian; Boyd, Mark A; Galletly, Cherrie",Australas Psychiatry,,232

The repertoire of effective therapies for severe courses of the disease has remained limited. A large proportion of the world population suffers from vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, with prevalence being particularly high among the COVID-19 high-risk populations. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.","Brenner, Hermann",Nutrients,,232

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable with common hyperactivity of immune responses known as a ""cytokine storm"". In fact, this massive release of inflammatory cytokines into in the pulmonary alveolar structure is a main cause of mortality during COVID-19 infection. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive and there is no common clinical protocol applied to suppress this pathological state. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron binding protein, is a first line defense protein that is present in neutrophils and excretory fluids of all mammals, and is well recognized for its role in maturation and regulation of immune system function. Also, due to its ability to sequester free iron, LF is known to protect against insult-induced oxidative stress and subsequent ""cytokine storm"" that results in dramatic necrosis within the affected tissue. Review of the literature strongly suggests utility of LF to silence the ""cytokine storm"", giving credence to both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches towards combating COVID-19 infection.","Zimecki, Michal; Actor, Jeffrey K; Kruzel, Marian L",Int Immunopharmacol,,232
352759,"The planet, people and public health",2021,"The extended and diverse interference of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in multiple host functions and the diverse associated symptoms implicate its involvement in fundamental cellular regulatory processes. The activity of ten-eleven translocase 2 (TET2) responsible for selective DNA demethylation, has been recently identified as a regulator of endogenous virus inactivation and viral invasion, possibly by proteasomal deregulation of the TET2/TET3 activities. In a recent report, we presented a detailed list of factors that can be affected by TET activity, including recognition of zinc finger protein binding sites and bimodal promoters, by enhancing the flexibility of adjacent sequences. In this review, we summarize the TET-associated processes and factors that could account for SARS-CoV-2 diverse symptoms. Moreover, we provide a correlation for the observed virus-induced symptoms that have been previously associated with TET activities by in vitro and in vitro studies. These include early hypoxia, neuronal regulation, smell and taste development, liver, intestinal, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, we propose that the high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 among adult patients, the different clinical symptoms of adults compared to children, the higher risk of patients with metabolic deregulation, and the low mortality rates among women can all be accounted for by the complex balance of the three enzymes with TET activity, which is developmentally regulated. This activity is age-dependent, related to telomere homeostasis and integrity, and associated with X chromosome inactivation via (de)regulation of the responsible XIST gene expression.","Kouidou, Sofia; Malousi, Andigoni; Andreou, Alexandra-Zoi",,,232

356868,Rethinking spitting in public spaces in the light of COVID-19 transmission through saliva,2021,"The risk of airborne infection for COVID-19 needs to be better understood and is especially urgent during the current pandemic. We present a method to determine the relative risk that can be readily deployed on either modelled or monitored CO$_2$ data and occupancy levels within an indoor space. Moreover, for spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at work or school. In so doing, we are able to calculate the expected number of infections arising from a single regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining pre/asymptomatic, i.e. we present a robust methodology to calculate the absolute reproductive number of these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. Results suggest that attendance at work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic if relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate ventilation. However, these spaces are likely to contribute significantly to the pandemic if ventilation is inadequate and/or activity levels increase.","Burridge, Henry C.; Noakes, Catherine J.; Linden, P.

Different number of the mortality rate in various societies have been reported. However, it seems the underlying comorbidities increase the risk of mortality and the severity of presentation. In this study we evaluated the pattern of presentation of COVID-19 among cancerous patients in terms of severity. METHOD: between 20th February to 22nd April of 2020, among 214 hospitalized patients because of COVID-19. 41 patients revealed the cancer as a synchronous comorbidity. These patients based on the severity of COVID-19 infection presentation were divided to mild and severe groups. Then, the demographic characteristics, manifestation and laboratory data between these groups were compared. RESULT: about 19 (46.34%) of 41 cases were categorized as severe forms of COVID-19 with malignancy. The mean age of severe groups was significantly higher (P=0.00). Dyspnea (48.78%), cough (46.34%) and myalgia (24.39%) were the most common clinical features among cancerous patients with COVID-19. diarrhea and nearly cough caused significant effects on severe form of presentation of COVID-19 infection (P=0.05, P=0.06, respectively). Hematological cancers were the most frequent types of cancer among these patients (46.34%). White Blood Cell counts were significantly lower in severe groups (P=0.03, P=.0.06, respectively). C-reactive protein is another item that nearly significantly was higher in severe groups of cancerous patients (P=0.06). CONCLUSION: The elderly age, the positive chemotherapy history, diarrhea, cough, declined WBC, PLT and elevated CRP correlated with a severe form of this infection in malignant cases.","Sadeghi, Amir; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Eslami, Pegah; Pirsalehi, Ali; Shojaee, Sajad; Sanadgol, Ghazal; Jalilian Khave, Laya; Vahidi, Mohammad; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Nazemalhosseini Mojarad, Ehsan",Acta Biomed,,232
358931,The relation between the social and the biological and COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection rate and mortality among Nigerian health care workers appear to be on the increase. This study determined the level of knowledge, attitude, practices, and impact of COVID-19 infection on healthcare workers (HCWs) working in a South-Eastern Nigerian state. METHODOLOGY: This was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers in South-eastern, Nigeria during the lockdown period. Socio-demographic profile, knowledge of COVID-19, fears and impact concerning COVID-19, attitude of health workers to work, preventive practices during this pandemic period were obtained. Data were analysed using STATA 16.0. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests of association were used to determine the association between variables, with the significance level set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 403 health care workers participated in the study. Majority of participants (n = 357, 88.59%) had good knowledge and good preventive practices (n = 328, 81.39%) of COVID-19. A significant proportion of respondents had a poor attitude to work (n = 101, 25.06%) and an attitude of indifference (n = 233, 57.82%). Almost half (48.64%) of participants had been negatively affected by COVID-19. Knowledge significantly influenced practice (p = 0.029). Lack of Personal protective equipment, fear of dying and going to common places, had a significant impact on the attitude of workers. CONCLUSION: Good knowledge which influenced practice, high use of preventive practices, with associated poor and indifferent attitude was noted among healthcare workers. Fear of death and lack of personal protective equipment had a strong impact on attitude. Female HCWs had poorer attitude to work than males.","Mbachu, Chioma Ngozichukwu Pauline; Azubuike, Chimaobi Marie-Claire; Mbachu, Ikechukwu Innocent; Ndukwu, Chizalu Ifeyinwa; Ezeuko, Amaka Yves-Ann; Udigwe, Ifeoma Bridget; Nnamani, Chioma Phyllis; Umeh, Uche Marian; Ezeagwuna, Dorothy Amauche; Onah, Stanley Kenechi; Eze, Henry Obinna; Okereke, Uzoma Chidi; Orji-Ifeanyi, Esther Nkiruka",J Infect Dev Ctries,,232

A mannequin was modified to emit an air stream containing aerosols and CO2. The aerosols have a size distribution with a peak diameter (Î´) close to 0.3 µm and a horizontal initial particle velocity (vp,x) of 2.4 m/s. The CO2-concentration (c) emitted simultaneously is 7500 ppm. It is investigated, if the spatial dissipation of aerosols and CO2 can be correlated. This would allow the use of technically easier CO2 measurements to monitor compliance with aerosol concentration limits. Both aerosol and CO2 concentrations are mapped by different sensors placed around the mannequin. As a result, no significant enrichment of aerosols and CO2 was obtained outside a radius of 1.5 m when the fresh air ventilation in the concert hall has a steady vertical flow with a velocity of vg,z=0.05&nbsp;m/s and the installed ventilation system was operating at an air change rate per hour (ACH) of 3, corresponding to an air exchange rate of 51,000 m3/h.

368633,Rebuilding public trust: a clarified response to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy predicament,2021,"Since early April 2020, there has been intense debate over proposed clinical use of ionizing radiation to treat life-threatening pneumonia in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. At least twelve relevant papers appeared by 20 May 2020. The radiation dose proposed for clinical trials are a single dose (0.1-1 Gy) or two doses (a few mGy followed by 0.1-0.25 Gy involving a putative adaptive response, or 1-1.5 Gy in two fractions 2-3 days apart). The scientific rationale for such proposed so-called low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) is twofold (note that only doses below 0.1 Gy are considered as low doses in the field of radiation protection, but here we follow the term as conventionally used in the field of radiation oncology). Firstly, the potentially positive observations in human case series and biological studies in rodent models on viral or bacterial pneumonia that were conducted in the pre-antibiotic era. Secondly, the potential anti-inflammatory properties of LDRT, which have been seen when LDRT is applied locally to subacute degenerative joint diseases, mainly in Germany. However, the human and animal studies cited as supportive evidence have significant limitations, and whether LDRT produces anti-inflammatory effects in the inflamed lung or exacerbates ongoing COVID-19 damage remains unclear. Therefore, we conclude that the available scientific evidence does not justify clinical trials of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia, with unknown benefit and known mortality risks from radiogenic cancer and circulatory disease. Despite the significant uncertainties in these proposals, some clinical trials are ongoing and planned. This paper gives an overview of current situations surrounding LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Salomaa, Sisko; Bouffler, Simon D; Atkinson, Michael J; Cardis, Elisabeth; Hamada, Nobuyuki",Int J Radiat Biol,,232

368709,Triaging ethical issues in the coronavirus pandemic: how to prioritize bioethics research during public health emergencies,2021,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic poses the general question on how infectious diseases can persistently affect human health. A growing body of literature has found a significant amount of evidence on the long-term adverse effects of infectious diseases, such as influenza, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. However, we must be careful about the fact that little is known about the long-term consequences of the acute diarrheal disease pandemic cholera - Vibrio cholerae bacillus - which still threatens the health of the population in many developing countries. To bridge this gap in the body of knowledge, we utilized unique census-based data on army height at age 20 in early 20th-century Japan, with a difference-in-differences estimation strategy using regional variation in the intensity of cholera pandemics. We found that early-life exposure to a cholera pandemic had heterogeneous stunting effects on the final height of men; the magnitude of the stunting effects increased as the intensity of exposure increased.","Ogasawara, Kota; Inoue, Tatsuki",Econ Hum Biol,,232

We studied three commercially available immunoassays for their diagnostic accuracy from blood specimens collected from 93 patients. METHODS: Blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were analysed using three different Immunoassays (Roche total antibody assay, Abbott IgG assay and Euroimmun IgG assay). Sensitivity, specificity, precision and time of seroconversion were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivity of Roche, Abbott and Euroimmun assays was 38.7%, 35.5% and 25.0% respectively for specimens collected <10 days and 84.4%, 84.4% and 70.0% respectively for specimens collected &#8805;10 days after the first positive RT-PCR. The specificity of all the three assays in this study was 100%. The timing of seroconversion occurred at day 1, 7 or 14. CONCLUSIONS: The assays evaluated in this study have different sensitivities for detecting antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sensitivity for detecting antibodies for all three assays was higher for specimens collected &#8805;10 days after first positive PCR compared with specimens collected <10 days. Time of seroconversion is variable and assay-dependent.","Alatoom, Adnan; Atef, Shereen; AbdelWareth, Laila; Murthy, Jay; Jones, Matthew; Cox, Gerald; Harris, Jonathan; Altrabulsi, Basel",J Infect Public Health,,232

We report the perceptions of undergraduate mathematics students and preservice mathematics teachers who interacted in online “workshops.” In the online workshops, students worked on mathematics problems in small groups while preservice teachers supported their work. Two rounds of semi-structured interviews with both groups were conducted, wherein participants compared and contrasted their experiences with in-person and online group work. Analyses revealed three challenges with respect to online communication: (a) limited access to one another’s written mathematical work, (b) limited ability to have one-on-one conversations, and (c) the tendency for students to leave their cameras turned off during the workshops. In particular, we emphasize that the multimodal nature of mathematics requires extra attention to strategies for sharing symbolic, diagrammatic, gestural, and other non-verbal ways of communicating mathematics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","LaRochelle, R.; Cirillo, M.; Berk, D.","2nd International Conference on Technology and Innovation in Learning, Teaching and Education, TECH-EDU 2020",,232

However, the environmental impacts of synthetic fibre-based clothing are significant and well-documented. Despite growing environmental concerns with single-use plastic-based protective clothing, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant increase in their use, that could result in a further surge of oceanic plastic pollution, adding to mass of plastic waste that already threatens marine life. In this review, we briefly discuss the nature of the raw materials involved in the production of such clothing, as well as manufacturing techniques and the PPE supply chain. We identify the environmental impacts at critical points in the protective clothing value chain from production to consumption, focusing on water use, chemical pollution, CO2 emissions and waste. On the basis of these environmental impacts, we outline the need for fundamental changes in the business model, including increased usage of reusable protective clothing, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, establishing better waste management, and the use of sustainable materials and processes without associated environmental problems.","Uddin, Mohammad Abbas; Afroj, Shaila; Hasan, Tahmid; Carr, Chris; Novoselov, Kostya S; Karim, Nazmul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01037v1.pdf,232

Using surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19",2020,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually treated with stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MPH). ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures and, in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, 4 large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general and stimulant drugs in particular are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures; these studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds. These reassuring results support the results of many small, short-duration trials that found that MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk. One other observational study however found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation; in any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with a current or past history of epilepsy; however, prudence dictates that attention be paid to potential seizure triggers during the first month of treatment. This risk needs to be specifically reexamined in future research.","Andrade, Chittaranjan",J. clin. psychiatr,,232

We therefore overview the changes in the curves of COVID-19 confirmed cases and fatality rate in China and outside of China from 31st of December 2019 to 25th of March 2020. We also aimed to assess the temporal developments and death rate of COVID-19 in China and worldwide. More than 414,179 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 197 countries, including 81,848 cases in China and 332,331 outside of China. Furthermore, 18,440 infected patients died from COVID-19 infection; 3,287 cases were from China and 15,153 fatalities were reported worldwide. Among the worldwide infected cases, 113,802 patients have been recovered and discharged from different hospitals. Effective prevention and control measures should be taken to control the disease. The presented Chinese model (protocol) of disease prevention and control could be utilized in order to curb the pandemic situation.","Baloch, Saira; Baloch, Mohsin Ali; Zheng, Tianli; Pei, Xiaofang",Tohoku J Exp Med,,232

Amyloidoses are classified into two as systemic and localized. Out of the systemic forms, AL (light chain) amyloidosis is the most prevalent type; however, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is more frequently encountered in the rheumatology practice. AA amyloidosis stands out as a major complication of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Splenic and renal involvement is more likely in FMF-associated systemic amyloidosis. The involvement of thyroid and adrenal glands has also been described, although infrequently. Amyloidoses have a heterogeneous plethora of clinical manifestations, with certain phenotypes associated with specific amyloid forms. Gynecological amyloidosis is a rare condition. Uterine involvement may occur in a localized fashion or may also arise as a part of systemic involvement, albeit at a lesser ratio. Several cases of uterine AL amyloidosis have been documented so far as an organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis. On the other hand, uterine amyloidosis associated with AA amyloidosis has been described merely in one case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we presented a 40-year-old female patient with FMF known for 38 years who underwent splenectomy and hysterectomy due to massive splenomegaly, deep anemia, and persistent menometrorrhagia. Histological examinations of materials revealed uterine and splenic AA amyloidosis. This case report is first-of-its-kind to describe FMF-associated uterine AA amyloidosis and also provides a discussion of possible mechanisms of amyloidosis-induced uterine bleeding.","Cansu, Döndü Üsküdar; Teke, Hava Üsküdar; Arik, Deniz; Korkmaz, Cengiz",Rheumatol.Int,,232
397417,COVID-19's First Year: A Bipartisan Appraisal,2021,"The current main issue in the construction sector in Europe concerns the energy refurbishment and the reactivation of investments in existing buildings. Guidance for enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging member states to create a market for deep renovation is provided by a number of European policies. Innovative methods and strategies are required to attract and involve citizens and main stakeholders to undertake buildings’ renovation processes, which actually account for just 1% of the total building stock. This contribution proposes technical and financial solutions for the promotion of energy efficient, safe, and attractive retrofit interventions based on the creation of volumetric additions combined with renewable energy sources. This paper focuses on the urban reality of Athens as being an important example of a degraded urban center with a heavy heat island, a quite important heating demand, and a strong seismic vulnerability. The design solutions presented here demonstrate that the strategy of additions, because of the consequent increased value of the buildings, could represent an effective densification policy for the renovation of existing urban settings. Hence, the aim is to trigger regulatory and market reforms with the aim to boost the revolution towards nearly zero energy buildings for the existing building stocks.","Fotopoulou, Anastasia Mazzoli Cecilia",Sustainability,,232
399284,Nurses responding to the World Health Organization (WHO) priority for emergency care systems for universal health coverage,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It frequently presents with unremitting fever, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and systemic complications (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, and hepatic involvement), encephalopathy, and thrombotic events. The respiratory symptoms are similar to those accompanying other genetically related beta-coronaviruses (CoVs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Hypoxemic respiratory symptoms can rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, leading to multi-organ system dysfunction syndrome. Severe cases are typically associated with aberrant and excessive inflammatory responses. These include significant systemic upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory mediators, associated with increased acute-phase proteins (APPs) production such as hyperferritinemia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as lymphocytopenia. The neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are high among those with severe and critical illnesses. This review highlights the central nervous system (CNS) complications associated with COVID-19 attributed to primary CNS involvement due to rare direct neuroinvasion and more commonly secondary CNS sequelae due to exuberant systemic innate-mediated hyper-inflammation. It also provides a theoretical integration of clinical and experimental data to elucidate the pathogenesis of these disorders. Specifically, how systemic hyper-inflammation provoked by maladaptive innate immunity may impair neurovascular endothelial function, disrupt BBB, activate CNS innate immune signaling pathways, and induce para-infectious autoimmunity, potentially contributing to the CNS complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Direct viral infection of the brain parenchyma causing encephalitis, possibly with concurrent neurovascular endotheliitis and CNS renin angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation, is also reviewed.","Najjar, Souhel; Najjar, Amanda; Chong, Derek J; Pramanik, Bidyut K; Kirsch, Claudia; Kuzniecky, Ruben I; Pacia, Steven V; Azhar, Salman",J Neuroinflammation,,232

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were &#8805;70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics. The magnitude and severe outcomes of this outbreak were major factors contributing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to halt cruise ship travel in U.S. waters in March 2020.","Plucinski, Mateusz M; Wallace, Megan; Uehara, Anna; Kurbatova, Ekaterina V; Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Schneider, Zachary D; Ishizumi, Atsuyoshi; Bozio, Catherine H; Kobayashi, Miwako; Toda, Mitsuru; Stewart, Andrea; Wagner, Riley L; Moriarty, Leah F; Murray, Rachel; Queen, Krista; Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton; Mauldin, Matthew R; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yan; Elkins, Christopher A; Lu, Xiaoyan; Herzig, Carolyn T A; Novak, Ryan; Bower, William; Medley, Alexandra M; Acosta, Anna M; Knust, Barbara; Cantey, Paul T; Pesik, Nicki T; Halsey, Eric S; Cetron, Martin S; Tong, Suxiang; Marston, Barbara J; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin. infect. dis,,232

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26-1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70-0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06-1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68-0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

407900,"A call for a gender-responsive, intersectional approach to address COVID-19",2020,"Given a set of unlabeled images or (image, text) pairs, contrastive learning aims to pre-train an image encoder that can be used as a feature extractor for many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose EncoderMI, the first membership inference method against image encoders pre-trained by contrastive learning. In particular, given an input and a black-box access to an image encoder, EncoderMI aims to infer whether the input is in the training dataset of the image encoder. EncoderMI can be used 1) by a data owner to audit whether its (public) data was used to pre-train an image encoder without its authorization or 2) by an attacker to compromise privacy of the training data when it is private/sensitive. Our EncoderMI exploits the overfitting of the image encoder towards its training data. In particular, an overfitted image encoder is more likely to output more (or less) similar feature vectors for two augmented versions of an input in (or not in) its training dataset. We evaluate EncoderMI on image encoders pre-trained on multiple datasets by ourselves as well as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder, which is pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet and released by OpenAI. Our results show that EncoderMI can achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall. We also explore a countermeasure against EncoderMI via preventing overfitting through early stopping. Our results show that it achieves trade-offs between accuracy of EncoderMI and utility of the image encoder, i.e., it can reduce the accuracy of EncoderMI, but it also incurs classification accuracy loss of the downstream classifiers built based on the image encoder.","Liu, Hongbin; Jia, Jinyuan; Qu, Wenjie; Gong, Neil Zhenqiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11023v1.pdf,232

However, there is political pressure for this type of measures to be lifted. This work considers the impact that such a termination would have on how the virus evolves locally. This was done by extending the SEIR model with an on / off strategy. Given the simplicity of SEIR we also attempted to gain more insight by developing a neural regressor. We chose to employ features that current clinical studies have pinpointed has having a connection to the lethality of COVID-19.

414420,Improving Understanding of and Response to Infodemics During Public Health Emergencies,2021,"BACKGROUND: In polymorbid patients with bronchopulmonary infection, malnutrition is an independent risk factor for mortality. There is a lack of interventional data investigating whether providing nutritional support during the hospital stay in patients at risk for malnutrition presenting with lower respiratory tract infection lowers mortality. METHODS: For this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (EFFORT), we analyzed data of a subgroup of patients with confirmed lower respiratory tract infection from an initial cohort of 2028 patients. Patients at nutritional risk (Nutritional Risk Screening [NRS] score &#8805;3 points) were randomized to receive protocol-guided individualized nutritional support to reach protein and energy goals (intervention group) or standard hospital food (control group). The primary endpoint of this analysis was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 378 of 2028 EFFORT patients (mean age 74.4 years, 24% with COPD) into this analysis. Compared to usual care hospital nutrition, individualized nutritional support to reach caloric and protein goals showed a similar beneficial effect of on the risk of mortality in the subgroup of respiratory tract infection patients as compared to the main EFFORT trial (odds ratio 0.47 [95%CI 0.17 to 1.27, p = 0.136] vs 0.65 [95%CI 0.47 to 0.91, p = 0.011]) with no evidence of a subgroup effect (p for interaction 0.859). Effects were also similar among different subgroups based on etiology and type of respiratory tract infection and for other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: This subgroup analysis from a large nutrition support trial suggests that patients at nutritional risk as assessed by NRS 2002 presenting with bronchopulmonary infection to the hospital likely have a mortality benefit from individualized inhospital nutritional support. The small sample size and limited statistical power calls for larger nutritional studies focusing on this highly vulnerable patient population.

Recently 2 CARDS phenotypes have been described, Type L and Type H. Most patients stabilize at the milder form, Type L, while an unknown subset progress to Type H, resembling full-blown ARDS. If uncorrected, phenotypic conversion can induce a rapid downward spiral towards progressive lung injury, vasoplegia, and pulmonary shrinkage, risking ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) known as the ""VILI vortex"". No cases of in-hospital phenotypic conversion have been reported, while ventilation strategies in these patients differ from the lung-protective approaches seen in classic ARDS. CASE REPORT A 29-year old male was admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by severe ARDS, multi-organ failure, cytokine release syndrome, and coagulopathy during his admission. He initially resembled CARDS Type L case, although refractory hypoxemia, fevers, and a high viral burden prompted conversion to Type H within 8 days. Despite ventilation strategies, neuromuscular blockade, inhalation therapy, and vitamin C, he remained asynchronous to the ventilator with volumes and pressures beyond accepted thresholds, eventually developing a fatal tension pneumothorax. CONCLUSIONS Patients that convert to Type H can quickly enter a spiral of hypoxemia, shunting, and dead-space ventilation towards full-blown ARDS. Understanding its nuances is vital to interrupting phenotypic conversion and entry into VILI vortex. Tension pneumothorax represents a poor outcome in patients with CARDS. Further research into monitoring lung dynamics, modifying ventilation strategies, and understanding response to various modes of ventilation in CARDS are required to mitigate these adverse outcomes.","Deliwala, Smit S; Ponnapalli, Anoosha; Seedahmed, Elfateh; Berrou, Mohammed; Bachuwa, Ghassan; Chandran, Arul",Am J Case Rep,,232

Comorbidities such as chronic degenerative diseases are frequently associated with complications in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory and procoagulant biomarkers in COVID-19 patients from a public hospital in Mexico. Blood was sampled within the first 48 h after admission in 119 confirmed COVID-19 patients that were classified in 3 groups according to oxygen demand, evolution and the severity of the disease as follows: 1) Non severe: nasal cannula or oxygen mask; 2) Severe: high flow nasal cannula and 3) Death: mechanical ventilation eventually leading to fatal outcome. Blood samples from 20 healthy donors were included as a Control Group. Analysis of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers including D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, PAI-1, P-selectin and VWF was performed in plasma. Routine laboratory and clinical biomarkers were also included and compared among groups. Concentrations of D-dimer (14.5 ± 13.8 µg/ml) and PAI-1 (1223 ± 889.6 ng/ml) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (P < 0.0001). A significant difference was found in interleukin-6, PAI-1 and P-selectin in non-severe and healthy donors when compared to Severe COVID-19 and deceased patients (P < 0.001). VWF levels were also significantly different between severe patients (153.5 ± 24.3 UI/dl) and non-severe ones (133.9 ± 20.2 UI/dl) (P < 0.0001).

Key issues we encountered and addressed were related to equipment/software, provider engagement, workflow/triage, and training. On reflection, the key drivers of our success were provider engagement and dedicated support from a physician champion, who plays a critical role understanding stakeholder needs. Before COVID-19, physician interest in telemedicine was mixed. However, in response to county and state stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19, physician engagement changed completely; all providers wanted to convert a majority of visits to video visits as quickly as possible. Rapid deployment of neurology video visits across all its subspecialties is feasible. Our experience and lessons learned can facilitate broader utilization, acceptance, and normalization of video visits for neurology patients in the present as well as the much anticipated postpandemic era.","Yang, Laurice; Brown-Johnson, Cati G; Miller-Kuhlmann, Rebecca; Kling, Samantha M R; Saliba-Gustafsson, Erika A; Shaw, Jonathan G; Gold, Carl A; Winget, Marcy",Neurology,,232

(2) Objective: To evaluate percutaneous discectomy effectivity for decompressing LDH lesions. (3) Case Report: Three patients suffered from drop feet, numbness, and bowel and bladder problems due to LDH compression. Patient #1 is a male (35 years old, basal metabolism index (BMI) = 23.9), point 1 on manual muscle test (MMT), with protrusion on L3 to S1 discs; Patient #2 is a female (62 years old, BMI = 22.4), point 3 on MMT, with protrusion on L2-4 and L5-S1 discs; Patient #3 is a female (43 years old, BMI = 26.6), point 4 on MMT, with extrusion on T12-L1 and L1-2 and L3-4 protruded discs. Six months follow-up showed of stand and walkability improvement with Patient #1 and #2. Patient #3 showed improvement in bowel and bladder problems within 10 weeks, without suffering of postoperative pain syndromes. (4) Discussion: Patient #1 and #2 showed better outcomes than Patient #3 who affected epiconus and cauda equina syndromes. Triamcinolone and lidocaine have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties for improving intraepidural circulation adjacent to the lesion sites. (5) Conclusion: Drop foot caused by mechanical compression of LDH ought to be treated immediately. Lateral or posterolateral compression has better outcomes associated with anatomical structures. Discectomy through transforaminal approach that is followed by caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) under fluoroscopic guidance is a safer and minimally invasive treatment with promising outcomes.","Budisulistyo, Trianggoro; Atmaja, Firmansyah",,,232

This study evaluated the suitability of video calls for the phonetic analysis of vowel configurations, mergers, and nasalization by comparing simultaneous recordings from three popular video conferencing apps (Zoom; Microsoft Skype, Redmond, WA; Microsoft Teams, Redmond, WA) to those taken from professional equipment (H4n field recorder) and an offline iPad (Apple, Cupertino, CA) identical to those running the apps. All three apps conveyed vowel arrangements and nasalization patterns relatively faithfully, but absolute measurements varied, particularly for the female speaker and in the 750-1500 Hz range, which affected the locations (F1 × F2) of low and back vowels and reduced nasalization measurements (A1-P0) for the female's prenasal vowels. Based on these results, we assess the validity of remote recording using these apps and offer recommendations for the best practices for collecting high fidelity acoustic phonetic data from a distance.","Freeman, Valerie; De Decker, Paul",J Acoust Soc Am,,232

International updated recommendations alert that professionals must maintain regular observation of local health department reports, ensure personal protective equipment, and screen all patients for COVID-19 signs and symptoms. Telehealth strategies, patient screening, rescheduling when presenting COVID-19 symptoms and/or history of contact with infected people and hand/environment hygiene practices are reinforced. Appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection are mandatory. The dental staff must be trained to use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), following a risk assessment and standard precautions: gloves; fluid resistant disposable gown, eye protection (face shield or goggles) and a medical mask. A fit tested N95 or KN95 respirator (or higher) is recommended when aerosol generating procedures are performed. Only essential accompanying persons should attend to dental appointment with the patient and must wear a cloth face covering or facemask. Social distancing and mask wearing by all staff are necessary in all areas of the office. Dental health care providers should keep up to date to the current guidance of clinical practice during the pandemic.","Pereira, Luciano José; Murata, Ramiro Mendonça; Pardi, Vanessa; Mattos, Flávio Freitas",Braz. oral res.

The planning in regard to further action for the coming weeks and months has to take place now. Methods: With the help of the principles of the German philosopher Kant, the thinking and planning is framed. Results: The modelling by the researchers of the Imperial College, London, make an oversized second wave in autumn/winter 2020 most likely, if the current countermeasures are kept in place for too long. A timely relaxation of the measures is warranted to allow a staggered attack by the virus onto the population (German: “Durchseuchung”) before the next influenza season 2020/2021 without overburdening the health care infrastructure especially the respiratory care bed capacity. The tempting perspective of a vaccine available before the second wave in autumn, should not lead to any delay in the intermittent relaxation of the countermeasures. A pre-licensure marginally tested vaccine would only be eligible for people with an anyway high risk in regard to SARS-CoV‑2. Conclusions: Further, more detailed and from each other independent models on the basis of data from Germany are urgently needed.

Results: The overall attitude and practice score of parents in maintaining their child's oral hygiene was low, with mean value of 2.36 ± 1.36 and 2.51 ± 1.50, respectively. 60.8% of parents reported the need of dental treatment for their child during the lockdown period whereas 50.8% parents contacted the dentist during this period; majority (37.5%) of which reported due to toothache. 68.3% of parents would like to visit nearby dental hospital for emergencies during lockdown period. Only 33.3% of parents took extra efforts to maintain their child's oral hygiene while 45% made dietary changes in their child's diet to prevent tooth decay. Conclusion: The overall attitude and practices of the parents were poor toward the oral health of their children during the lockdown period in COVID-19 pandemic. There is urgent need of increasing awareness among parents regarding the importance of maintaining their child's oral health. The inability to see the doctor should at least encourage better home practice measures for future. The concept of tele-dentistry is very new and will be the need of the coming modern times.","Goswami, Mridula; Grewal, Monika; Garg, Aditi",J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent,,232

442420,COVID-19: When Teaching Public Health Became Personal,2020,"Healthcare providers commonly experience symptoms of anxiety during public health crises and pandemics. The objective of the study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in general practitioners and to estimate the association with particular psychosocial and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional study, where a total of 531 general practitioners completed an online form that contained sociodemographic variables, questions about fear and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), questionnaire on psychosomatic problems and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals. The authors suggest mental health providers should be deployed during times of crisis to decrease the risk of developing mental illness.","Monterrosa-Castro, Alvaro; Redondo-Mendoza, Velia; Mercado-Lara, María",J Investig Med,,232
443197,Will COVID force public health to confront America's epic inequality?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The case fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies significantly between countries. We aimed to describe the associations between health indicators and the national CFRs of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified for each country health indicators potentially associated with the national CFRs of COVID-19. We extracted data for 18 variables from international administrative data sources for 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We excluded the collinear variables and examined the 16 variables in multivariable analysis. A dynamic web-based model was developed to analyse and display the associations for the CFRs of COVID-19. We followed the Guideline for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, the variables significantly associated with the increased CFRs were percentage of obesity in ages >18 years (ß = 3.26; 95%CI = 1.20, 5.33; p 0.003), tuberculosis incidence (ß = 3.15; 95%CI = 1.09, 5.22; p 0.004), duration (days) since first death due to COVID-19 (ß = 2.89; 95%CI = 0.83, 4.96; p 0.008), and median age (ß = 2.83; 95%CI = 0.76, 4.89; p 0.009). The COVID-19 test rate (ß = -3.54; 95%CI = -5.60, -1.47; p 0.002), hospital bed density (ß = -2.47; 95%CI = -4.54, -0.41; p 0.021), and rural population ratio (ß = -2.19; 95%CI = -4.25, -0.13; p 0.039) decreased the CFR. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic hits population-dense cities. Available hospital beds should be increased. Test capacity should be increased to enable more effective diagnostic tests. Older patients and patients with obesity and their caregivers should be warned about a potentially increased risk.","Ergönül, Önder; Akyol, Merve; Tanriöver, Cem; Tiemeier, Henning; Petersen, Eskild; Petrosillo, Nicola; Gönen, Mehmet",Clin. microbiol. infect,,232
445451,Outlier knowledge management for extreme public health events: Understanding public opinions about COVID-19 based on microblog data,2020,"Genebanks collect and preserve vast collections of plants and detailed passport information, with the aim of preserving genetic diversity for conservation and breeding. Genetic characterization of such collections has the potential to elucidate the genetic histories of important crops, use marker-trait associations to identify loci controlling traits of interest, search for loci undergoing selection, and contribute to genebank management by identifying taxonomic misassignments and duplicates. We conducted a genomic scan with genotyping by sequencing (GBS) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 10,038 pepper (Capsicum spp.) accessions from worldwide genebanks and investigated the recent history of this iconic staple. Genomic data detected up to 1,618 duplicate accessions within and between genebanks and showed that taxonomic ambiguity and misclassification often involve interspecific hybrids that are difficult to classify morphologically. We deeply interrogated the genetic diversity of the commonly consumed Capsicum annuum to investigate its history, finding that the kinds of peppers collected in broad regions across the globe overlap considerably. The method ReMIXTURE-using genetic data to quantify the similarity between the complement of peppers from a focal region and those from other regions-was developed to supplement traditional population genetic analyses. The results reflect a vision of pepper as a highly desirable and tradable cultural commodity, spreading rapidly throughout the globe along major maritime and terrestrial trade routes. Marker associations and possible selective sweeps affecting traits such as pungency were observed, and these traits were shown to be distributed nonuniformly across the globe, suggesting that human preferences exerted a primary influence over domesticated pepper genetic structure.","Tripodi, Pasquale; Rabanus-Wallace, Mark Timothy; Barchi, Lorenzo; Kale, Sandip; Esposito, Salvatore; Acquadro, Alberto; Schafleitner, Roland; van Zonneveld, Maarten; Prohens, Jaime; Diez, Maria José; Börner, Andreas; Salinier, Jérémy; Caromel, Bernard; Bovy, Arnaud; Boyaci, Filiz; Pasev, Gancho; Brandt, Ronny; Himmelbach, Axel; Portis, Ezio; Finkers, Richard; Lanteri, Sergio; Paran, Ilan; Lefebvre, Véronique; Giuliano, Giovanni; Stein, Nils",Proc.

447600,COVID-19 and the decolonization of Indigenous public health,2020,"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of patients with cancer during COVID-19 pandemic is still pending. METHODS: Our patients were advised to maintain their scheduled appointments, and planned cancer treatment was continued without unnecessary delays in an outpatient setting. Additional strict preventive infection measures were rapidly implemented at our outpatient department. When COVID-19 test became widely available, universal testing of healthcare workers and vigorous screening of all patients coming to our facility for COVID-19 infection were performed by SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR on rhinopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: As of the data cut-off on 9 April 2020, a total of 156 oncology patients with a median age of 67 (range 26-86) years and 63 haematology patients (median age 69 years, range 23-89) were screened for COVID-19 during active cancer treatment. Prevalence (1.8%; 4/219) of COVID-19 in patients with cancer was significantly higher compared with a respective control group of asymptomatic counterparts (p=0.018). Outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients were good, with only one observed death due to progression of advanced metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that continuation of anticancer treatment in epidemic areas during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be safe and feasible, if adequate and strict preventive measures are vigorously and successfully carried out.","Fong, Dominic; Rauch, Simon; Petter, Christian; Haspinger, Eva; Alber, Monika; Mitterer, Manfred",,,232

457997,Disparities in use of telehealth at the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency,2020,"Background: COVID-19 is a novel virus that affects the upper respiratory tract, as well as the lungs. The scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic, its spreading rate, and deaths are increasing regularly. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be used carefully to detect and analyze COVID-19 cases. In CT images/scans, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is found in the early stages of infection. While in later stages, there is a superimposed pulmonary consolidation. Methods: This research investigates the quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches for the analysis of COVID-19 images. The recent developments in quantum computing have led researchers to explore new ideas and approaches using QML. The proposed approach consists of two phases: in phase I, synthetic CT images are generated through the conditional adversarial network (CGAN) to increase the size of the dataset for accurate training and testing. In phase II, the classification of COVID-19/healthy images is performed, in which two models are proposed: CML and QML. Result: The proposed model achieved 0.94 precision (Pn), 0.94 accuracy (Ac), 0.94 recall (Rl), and 0.94 F1-score (Fe) on POF Hospital dataset while 0.96 Pn, 0.96 Ac, 0.95 Rl, and 0.96 Fe on UCSD-AI4H dataset. Conclusion: The proposed method achieved better results when compared to the latest published work in this domain.","Amin, Javaria; Sharif, Muhammad; Gul, Nadia; Kadry, Seifedine; Chakraborty, Chinmay",Cognit Comput,,232
459339,"We're Not All in This Together: On COVID-19, Intersectionality, and Structural Inequality",2020,"BACKGROUND: The scale and quality of the global scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic have unquestionably saved lives. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented ""infodemic""; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis-related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19-related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world's largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19-related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators' critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19-related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA's design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers' critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world's largest COVID-19-related data corpora for searches and curation.","Vaghela, Uddhav; Rabinowicz, Simon; Bratsos, Paris; Martin, Guy; Fritzilas, Epameinondas; Markar, Sheraz; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Stringer, Karl; Singh, Harshdeep; Llewellyn, Charlie; Dutta, Debabrata; Clarke, Jonathan M; Howard, Matthew; Serban, Ovidiu; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,,232

METHODS: We studied 572 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed using polymerase chain reaction) for whom a chest CT was performed at hospital admission. Visual quantification was used to classify patients as per the percentage of lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 lesions: normal CT, 0-10%, 11-25%, 26-50%, 51-75% and >75%. The primary endpoint was severe disease, defined by death or admission to the intensive care unit in the 7 days following first admission. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 66.0 ± 16.0 years, and 343/572 (60.0%) were men. The primary endpoint occurred in 206/572 patients (36.0%). The extent of lesions on initial CT was independently associated with prognosis (odds ratio = 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.24-4.46; p < 0.01). Most patients with lung involvement >50% (66/95, 69.5%) developed severe disease compared to patients with lung involvement of 26-50% (70/171, 40.9%) and &#8804;25% (70/306, 22.9%) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively).

Objective The chief objective of this survey was to evaluate and compare dermatology programs’ resident research requirements and guidelines. Methods This cross-sectional study employed a 13-item survey administered online in early 2021 to assess the degree to which dermatology residency programs require and support their new physician graduates in scholarly research endeavors. Results Thirty-two program directors representing 30 dermatology residency programs (30/138=22% out of the 138 accredited programs contacted) responded to the survey. Almost all programs described quality improvement project requirements for residents, and were able to provide funding for resident conference participation. Most programs also reported resident publication requirements and the availability of research electives. However, the vast majority did not have required research rotations or a formal mentorship program. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a substantial impact on residency research requirements. Conclusions Our survey provides objective data about the current dermatology resident research requirements across the United States. These findings may prove valuable to prospective applicants, residency programs, and accrediting agencies in improving, advancing, and structuring dermatology residency guidelines and resources with the aim of encouraging new physician trainees to pursue research.","Anand, Pratibha Szeto Mindy D.; Flaten, Hania D039; Angelo, Josephine Dunnick Cory A.; Dellavalle, Robert P.",International Journal of Women&#039;s Dermatology,,232

With the advent of remote learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the school moved its admissions process, including the multiple mini-interview (MMI), from an in-person to online format in mid-March 2020. APPROACH: The UH COM selected Zoom as the video conferencing platform for its virtual admissions process, including the MMI. On each interview day (3-4 hours), 14-16 applicants joined administrators, faculty, and staff in a virtual meeting room. Applicants were divided into two groups: one viewed short presentations about the school, curriculum, and departments, while the other participated in 7 MMI stations (one-on-one interactions with interviewers) via virtual breakout rooms; the groups then switched. The MMI stations were the same as those used in person in early March. Applicants were able to ask questions at multiple points during the day. Technical support was provided for participants with connectivity issues or unfamiliar with Zoom. OUTCOMES: Of the 180 applicants interviewed in March-April 2020, 134 (74%) participated in the virtual process and 46 (26%) in the on-site process. Twenty-five (83%) of the 30 members of the inaugural class of 2025 interviewed virtually. Advantages of the virtual format included ease of access for faculty and more flexibility and less expense for applicants. Challenges included the need for applicants to decide whether to accept an offer of admission from a new school without visiting and missed opportunities for faculty to have relatively unstructured interactions with applicants. NEXT STEPS: This virtual admissions process was a feasible alternative for the inaugural class but is not sustainable. The UH COM plans to leverage lessons learned to refine the virtual format for use in future admissions cycles, even when in-person interviews are possible.","Carroll Turpin, Michelle A; Steele, Kenya; Matuk-Villazon, Omar; Rowland, Kevin; Dayton, Catherine; Horn, Kathryn",Acad. med,,232

The SARS-CoV-2 human cell receptor ACE2 has recently received extensive attention for its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many studies have also explored the association between ACE2 and cancer. However, a systemic investigation into associations between ACE2 and oncogenic pathways, tumor progression, and clinical outcomes in pan-cancer remains lacking. Using cancer genomics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we performed computational analyses of associations between ACE2 expression and antitumor immunity, immunotherapy response, oncogenic pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical outcomes in 13 cancer cohorts. We found that ACE2 upregulation was associated with increased antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression, and favorable anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy response. ACE2 expression levels inversely correlated with the activity of cell cycle, mismatch repair, TGF-ß, Wnt, VEGF, and Notch signaling pathways. Moreover, ACE2 expression levels had significant inverse correlations with tumor proliferation, stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. ACE2 upregulation was associated with favorable survival in pan-cancer and in multiple individual cancer types. These results suggest that ACE2 is a potential protective factor for cancer progression.

Typically these include what employees believe they will receive by way of compensation, benefits, work assignments, organizational support, resources, career development, work–life balance, job security, and interpersonal treatment in return for their talent, effort, performance output and quality, cooperation, loyalty, and commitment to the organization’s objectives. Interestingly, research shows that the effect of the objective breach is less significant than that of the employees’ emotional feelings of violation, distrust, and anger toward the other party, for example, the manager or organization (Zhao etal., 2007). [...]questions could be examined using the lenses of work–life balance, work–family conflict, job-demands resources theory, job-demands control theory, organizational justice, and perceived organizational support.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four leading experts were selected and recruited to participate in this iterative web-based Delphi study. An open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect the expert panel's views in the first round. In the second round, the panel was asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement with individual items gleaned from qualitative content analysis of views expressed in the first round. The participants were offered the opportunity to reevaluate and correct their initial responses in subsequent rounds. Responses in the second and following rounds were analyzed using quantitative descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The first and second rounds were completed by 54.2% (n=13/24) and 58.3% (n=14/24) of the selected panel, respectively, while 10 out of these 14 participants completed the third round. The panel cited in-person essential medical services, telehealth for fever/respiratory symptoms, surveillance for influenzae-like illness, and minimization of spread to staff as important and appropriate roles of primary care, which are urgent and feasible during a pandemic. Regarding conditions/support for these roles, the panel indicated that institutional support and funding for separate areas, workforce, and telehealth, along with public-private collaborative governance, are urgent, but not feasible. CONCLUSION: This study provides guidance on strategies for continuing the required roles of primary care and highlights a need to strengthen public-private partnerships during pandemic events in Korea.","Shin, Woo Young; Kim, Changsoo; Lee, Sei Young; Lee, Won; Kim, Jung Ha",Yonsei Med J,,232

486148,The need to devise government-spearheaded measures to prevent loneliness and isolation in conjunction with the spread of COVID-19 in Japan,2021,"We analysed publicly available data on place of occurrence of COVID-19 deaths from national statistical agencies in the UK between March 9 2020 and February 28 2021. We introduce a modified Weibull model that describes the deaths due to COVID-19 at a national and place of occurrence level. We observe similar trends in the UK where deaths due to COVID-19 first peak in Homes, followed by Hospitals and Care Homes 1-2 weeks later in the first and second waves. This is in line with the infectious period of the disease, indicating a possible transmission vehicle between the settings. Our results show that the first wave is characterised by fast growth and a slow reduction after the peak in deaths due to COVID-19. The second and third waves have the converse property, with slow growth and a rapid decrease from the peak. This difference may result from behavioural changes in the population (social distancing, masks, etc). Finally, we introduce a double logistic model to describe the dynamic proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in each setting. This analysis reveals that the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in Care Homes increases from the start of the pandemic and past the peak in total number of COVID-19 deaths in the first wave. After the catastrophic impact in the first wave, the proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in Care Homes gradually decreased from is maximum after the first wave indicating residence were better protected in the second and third waves compared to the first.","Thomas, Spencer A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15381v1.pdf,232

This article aimed to systematically identify and summarize (1) the studies that have found a relationship between training load and salivary IgA in team sports, and (2) the studies that have highlighted a relationship between IgA and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in team sports. A systematic review of relevant articles was carried out using two electronic databases (PubMed and WoK) until 3 October 2020. From a total of 174 studies initially found, 24 were included in the qualitative synthesis. This systematic review confirmed that lower values of IgA occurred after greater training load (intensity/volume) and congested periods. In this scenario, a low level of IgA was correlated with higher URTI, which makes training load management mandatory to healthcare avoiding immunosuppression. Therefore, physical fitness and conditioning coaches should carefully manage training load progression, avoiding high-intensity sessions in two consecutive days. In addition, they should not program high-intensity training sessions during at least the two days following competition.","Rico-González, Markel; Clemente, Filipe Manuel; Oliveira, Rafael; Bustamante-Hernández, Naia; Pino-Ortega, José",,,232

We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened.

The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death.

MethodsWe used blood samples from health care workers (HCW) with or without history of COVID-19 to define test accuracy of a novel interferon-release assay. Usefulness of qualitative and quantitative results after COVID-19 vaccination was examined in HCW receiving homologous or heterologous vaccination regimens. For a real-life performance evaluation, we analysed interferon-response to complete vaccination in 149 patients receiving immunosuppressive or immune modulating therapies. ResultsUsing a double-cut-off strategy integrating the result of background stimulation the assay had a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of the IGRA was 83.5 and 100% in HCW after SARS-CoV-2 infection more or less than 6 months ago. Quantitative results showed significant differences between first and second vaccine dose, but no difference between homologous and heterologous vaccination regimen. The majority of immunocompromised patients showed no immune response or isolated T-cell or antibody response to complete vaccination. ConclusionsThe novel IGRA proved to be a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 vaccination. In perspective, it may serve as a standardized tool in COVID-19 vaccine trials and in clinical care of immunosuppressed patients.","Huzly, Daniela; Panning, Marcus; Smely, Franziska; Enders, Martin; Komp, Johanna; Steinmann, Daniel",,,232

492710,Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID-19. METHODS: A global expert response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian ß-regression model was used to estimate 12-week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case-mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease), were determined. This case mix was applied to country-level surgical volumes. The 12-week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate the total number of cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28 404 603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19 (2 367 050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (90·2 per cent, 25 638 922 of 28 404 603). The overall 12-week cancellation rate would be 72·3 per cent. Globally, 81·7 per cent of operations for benign conditions (25 638 922 of 31 378 062), 37·7 per cent of cancer operations (2 324 070 of 6 162 311) and 25·4 per cent of elective caesarean sections (441 611 of 1 735 483) would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increased their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID-19 disruption. CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed owing to disruption caused by COVID-19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to restore surgical activity safely.",,Br. j. surg,,232

We analyzed patient material using enzyme immune assays, flow cytometry and heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay and performed autopsies on two fatal cases. Eight patients (5 female, 3 male) with a median age of 41.5 years (range, 24 to 53) were referred to us with suspected thrombotic complications 6 to 20 days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. All patients had thrombocytopenia at admission. Patients had a median platelet count of 46.5 x109/L (range, 8 to 92). Three had a fatal outcome and 5 were successfully treated. Autopsies showed arterial and venous thromboses in various organs and the occlusion of glomerular capillaries by hyaline thrombi. Sera from VITT patients contain high titer antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) (OD 2.59±0.64). PF4 antibodies in VITT patients induced significant increase in procoagulant markers (P-selectin and phosphatidylserine externalization) compared to healthy volunteers and healthy vaccinated volunteers. The generation of procoagulant platelets was PF4 and heparin dependent. We demonstrate the contribution of antibody-mediated platelet activation in the pathogenesis of VITT.","Althaus, Karina; Möller, Peter; Uzun, Günalp; Singh, Anurag; Beck, Annika; Bettag, Martin; Bösmüller, Hans; Guthoff, Martina; Dorn, Franziska; Petzold, Gabor C; Henkes, Hans; Heyne, Nils; Jumaa, Hassan; Kreiser, Kornelia; Limpach, Caroline; Luz, Beate; Maschke, Matthias; Müller, Janis A; Münch, Jan; Nagel, Simon; Pötzsch, Bernd; Müller, Jens; Schlegel, Christoph; Viardot, Andreas; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Wolf, Marc; Pelzl, Lisann; Warm, Verena; Willinek, Winfried A; Steiner, Jochen; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole; Vollherbst, Dominik; Sachs, Ulrich J; Fend, Falko; Bakchoul, Tamam",Haematologica,,232

MATERIAL AND METHODS Using a cross-sectional design, 311 Chinese scholars visiting 41 states in the United States were interviewed on 20 and 21 April 2020 through WeChat using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. RESULTS Of these 311 visiting scholars, 69 (22.2%) reported no symptoms of anxiety or depression, whereas 63 (20.3%) reported severe anxiety and 67 (21.5%) reported severe depression. Risk of anxiety was 93% higher in visiting scholars with than without accompanying parents in the US (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-3.68) and was 1.72-fold (95% CI, 1.04-2.84) higher in those experiencing stress about family members with COVID-19. Stresses about personal security and return to China on schedule were associated with 1.73-fold (95% CI, 1.03-2.92) and 3.00-fold (95% CI, 1.51-5.95) higher risks of anxiety, respectively. Risks of depression were 1.86-fold (95% CI, 1.14-3.05), 1.84-fold (95% CI, 1.10-3.07), and 3.45-fold (95% CI, 1.72-6.92) higher in visiting Chinese scholars who were than were not experiencing stresses about financial support, personal security and return to China on schedule, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Chinese scholars visiting the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced severe psychological distress. Surveys that include larger numbers of visiting scholars are warranted.","Zhao, Yanjie; Wang, Ping; Wu, Jiangping; Wang, Ruibin; Song, Qingkun",Med Sci Monit,,232

In hospitals, it has been confirmed by several studies that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate surfaces and medical equipment especially in hospitals dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, high-touch public surfaces such as ATMs require further disinfection procedures to limit the transmission of the infection.","Elbadawy, Hossein M; Khattab, Amin; Alalawi, Ali; Dakilallah Aljohani, Fahad; Sundogji, Hamza; Mahmoud, Ameira S; Abouzied, Meky; Eltahir, Heba M; Alahmadey, Ziab; Bahashwan, Saleh; Suliman, Bandar A",J Med Virol,,232

Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus-containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most versus none of the viral content settles in the first 1-2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei versus on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than [Formula: see text] versus more than [Formula: see text]. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules: (I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes; (I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei versus liquid droplets.","Rosti, M E; Olivieri, S; Cavaiola, M; Seminara, A; Mazzino, A",Sci Rep,,232

In this regard, this study aimed to investigate the challenges ESL teachers faced in implementing e-learning during COVID-19. Using a qualitative approach, this research was a case study which involved 20 primary ESL teachers. Data collection was done through an in-depth interview to explore teachers’ e-learning experiences and challenges in teaching the English language. Based on the findings, the majority of teachers expressed that the use of e-learning was effective with various limitations such as teachers’ readiness to adopt e-learning, accessibility to mobile phones and Internet connectivity, classroom management in term of low students’ participation and assessment. Thus, the researcher recommended more studies to highlight teachers’ insight regarding the significance of e-learning.

501764,"COVID-19: home poisoning throughout the containment period (vol 5, pg e314, 2020)",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, known as coronavirus disease 2019, has resulted in a global pandemic. Reports are emerging of a new severe hyperinflammatory syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 in children and adolescents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated this disease multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Our objective was to develop a clinical inpatient protocol for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with this syndrome. DATA SOURCES: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team based on relevant literature related to coronavirus disease 2019, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and related inflammatory syndromes, as well as our experience caring for children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Data were obtained on patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children at our institution from the pre-protocol and post-protocol periods. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our protocol was developed in order to identify cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with high sensitivity, stratify risk to guide treatment, recognize co-infectious or co-inflammatory processes, mitigate coronary artery abnormalities, and manage hyperinflammatory shock. Key elements of evaluation include case identification using broad clinical characteristics and comprehensive laboratory and imaging investigations. Treatment centers around glucocorticoids and IV immunoglobulin with biologic immunomodulators as adjuncts. Multidisciplinary follow-up after discharge is indicated to manage continued outpatient therapy and evaluate for disease sequelae. In nearly 2 months, we admitted 54 patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, all of whom survived without the need for invasive ventilatory or mechanical circulatory support. After institution of this protocol, patients received earlier treatment and had shorter lengths of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides guidance to clinicians on evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with a novel hyperinflammatory syndrome related to coronavirus disease 2019 known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. It is based on the relevant literature and our experience. Instituting such a protocol during a global pandemic is feasible and is associated with patients receiving treatment and returning home more quickly.","Jonat, Brian; Gorelik, Mark; Boneparth, Alexis; Geneslaw, Andrew S; Zachariah, Philip; Shah, Amee; Broglie, Larisa; Duran, Juan; Morel, Kimberly D; Zorrilla, Maria; Svoboda, Leanne; Johnson, Candace; Cheng, Jennifer; Garzon, Maria C; Silver, Wendy G; Gross Margolis, Kara; Neunert, Cindy; Lytrivi, Irene; Milner, Joshua; Kernie, Steven G; Cheung, Eva W",Pediatric critical care medicine,,232

Working at the frontlines against the pandemic, health care providers' level of knowledge about COVID-19, attitude towards their work, and confidence in the preparedness of their facilities are essential factors in mounting a successful response. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the knowledge level of HCP in Ethiopia on this novel coronavirus, and their perspectives on whether their workplaces have sufficient preparedness to handle this disease. METHODS: A self-administered online survey was conducted. RESULTS: The knowledge related to COVID-19 among HCPs was high, with an overall average of 91.5%. The majority of our respondents were supportive to the government's measures to minimize disease transmission, but most of them were also frustrated by how COVID affected their day to day lives. The majority of them were worried about contracting COVID at work and transmitting the infection to their families. Most respondents did not feel safe going to work (P<0.001). Apart from providing adequate information on COVID-19, most workplaces did not have sufficient PPE (P<000.1) and medical supplies (P<0.001). Close to 50% of respondents agreed and disagreed that their workplaces had clear protocols for handling COVID-19 (P = 0.144). Those who handled known COVID patients were more likely to agree their workplaces had clear protocols (OR = 2.69, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Improving supplies of PPEs and establishing a clear communicating protocol in handling COVID patients are highly recommended.","Gebreselassie, Agazi Fitsum; Bekele, Abebe; Tatere, Heaven Yeshaneh; Wong, Rex",PLoS One,,232

We recruited 38 (aged 22-74 years; 27 males) patients hospitalized for complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonintensive COVID units. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing about 5 months after hospital discharge. Of all patients, 42.1% had processing speed deficits, while 26.3% showed delayed verbal recall deficits. Twenty-one percent presented with deficits in both processing speed and verbal memory. Bivariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between the lowest arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) (P/F) ratio during hospitalization and verbal memory consolidation performance (SRT-LTS score, r = 0.404, p = 0.027), as well as a positive correlation between SpO2 levels upon hospital arrival and delayed verbal recall performance (SRT-D score, rs = 0.373, p = 0.042). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during hospitalization was associated with worse verbal memory performance (ARDS vs. no ARDS: SRT-LTS mean score = 30.63 ± 13.33 vs. 44.50 ± 13.16, p = 0.007; SRT-D mean score = 5.95 ± 2.56 vs. 8.10 ± 2.62, p = 0.029).

504038,"COVID-19 as an ""Infodemic"" in Public Health: Critical Role of the Social Media",2021,"This study explores the influence of political risk on firms in the tourism industry. It addresses a research gap regarding the impact of political risk on firm-level performance and failure and uncovers the role of organizational slack in this relationship. Firm-level political risk is estimated from 2002 to 2019 financial data for firms across six tourism sectors in a developed economy, the United States. Such risk is found to be significantly associated with firm performance and business failure. From the perspectives of the resource-based view and the threat-rigidity hypothesis, the results support the moderating effects of absorbed and unabsorbed slack on links between risk, performance, and business failure. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the tourism industry’s vulnerability, this study will be of interest to tourism firms seeking to improve business sustainability and resilience.

505687,Framing health stories: Highlights 2020 photography competition open for submissions,2020,"Type I interferons play a pivotal role in innate immune response to virus infection. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was reported to function as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting activation of NF-&#954;B and MAPKs during bacterial infection, however, the role of SHP-1 in regulating type I interferons remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that knockout or knockdown of SHP-1 in macrophages promoted both HSV-1- and VSV-induced antiviral immune response. Conversely, overexpression of SHP-1 in L929 cells suppressed the HSV-1- and VSV-induced immune response; suppression was directly dependent on phosphatase activity. We identified a direct interaction between SHP-1 and TRAF3; the association between these two proteins resulted in diminished recruitment of CK1Îµ to TRAF3 and inhibited its K63-linked ubiquitination; SHP-1 inhibited K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 by promoting dephosphorylation at Tyr116 and Tyr446. Taken together, our results identify SHP-1 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity and suggest that SHP-1 may be a target for intervention in acute virus infection.","Hao, Doudou; Wang, Yu; Li, Liuyan; Qian, Gui; Liu, Jing; Li, Manman; Zhang, Yihua; Zhou, Ruixue; Yan, Dapeng",FASEB j,,232

506644,The challenges of the outbreak: the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system,2020,"Purpose: COVID-19, an infectious disease first identified in China, has resulted in an ongoing pandemic all over the world. Most of the countries have been experiencing a difficult period during the fighting of this pandemic. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of privacy concerns and cultural differences on public opinion related to the pandemic. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of public opinion in the US and in China as a case study, in order to determine the results. Design/methodology/approach: National policies on important issues faced during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and in China were examined through a comparative analysis. The authors used text clustering and visualization to mine public opinion on two popular social media platforms, Twitter and Weibo. From the perspectives of concern for privacy and of national culture, this study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to discover the acceptance level of national policies by the public in the two countries. Findings: The anti-pandemic policies and measures of the US and China reflect the different characteristics of their respective political systems and national cultures. When considering the culture of the US, it is hard to establish and enforce a rigorous regulation on either mask wearing in public or home quarantine on the national level. The opinions of US people are diverse, regarding national COVID-19 policies, but they are rather unified on privacy issues. On the other hand, Chinese people show a high acceptance of national policies based on their mask-wearing customs and their culture of collectivism. Originality/value: Prior studies have paid insufficient attention to the ways in which user privacy and cultural difference affect public opinion on national policies between the US and China. This case study that compares public opinion on current and topical issues which are closely bound up with public life shows originality, as it innovatively provides a cross-cultural perspective on the research of public opinion dissemination during emergencies by considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Xing, Y.; Li, Y.; Wang, F.

Here we report that the expression of PSGL-1 in virus-producing cells impairs the incorporation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoproteins into pseudovirions and blocks pseudovirus attachment and infection of target cells. These findings suggest that PSGL-1 may potentially inhibit coronavirus replication in PSGL-1+ cells.","He, Sijia; Waheed, Abdul A; Hetrick, Brian; Dabbagh, Deemah; Akhrymuk, Ivan V; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Freed, Eric O; Wu, Yuntao",Viruses,,232

Male fetus is biologically weaker and more vulnerable to prenatal events than female fetuses. Hence, premature death (and consequently decline the SRB) is higher in boys than girls. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been known to have a variety of stressful and psychological impacts. This stress may consequently enhance maternal inflammation, pregnancy complication, and fetal loss. Also, male fetuses have more adverse outcomes than female fetuses among asymptomatic pregnant women with SARS-Cov-2 infection. Inasmuch as the male fetus are more vulnerable to prenatal events and premature death, it is proposed that the SRB can decline in pregnant women following the COVID-19 stress.

People's adherence to control measures is influenced by their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the disease. Therefore, in the present study we assessed pharmacy senior students' knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was created and it consisted of 12 questions testing their knowledge about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, transmission routes and prevention and control steps. Among senior pharmacy students (n = 238), 70% were females and 63% were living in greater Cairo. Their main source of information included social media (70%), published articles (48%) and television (48%). The overall correct knowledge score was 83%. Most of the students displayed a good COVID-19 knowledge level (72.5% of the students). The students were least informed when trying to answer questions about hyper-coagulation, as a major cause for death in patients with severe COVID-19, and about the timings on the necessity to wear masks. Assessment of students' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 reflected that 87% of them were confident that health care teams and scientists could win the fight against the virus. In addition, 72% of students agreed that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully. The greater the students' knowledge, the more confident they felt that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-4.72). Good behavioral practice towards COVID-19 control was confirmed when 87% of students answered that they didn't go out to any crowded place. Females were 3.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-3.11) more likely to avoid going out than males.

Our existence highly depends on the vaccine's availability, which demands in-depth research of the available strains and their mutations. In this work, we have analyzed all the available SARS-COV2 genomes isolated from the Kingdom of Bahrain in terms of their variance and origin analysis. We have predicted various known and unique mutations in the SARS-COV2 isolated from Bahrain. The complexity of the phylogenetic tree and dot plot representation of the strains mentioned above with other isolates of Asia indicates the versatility and multiple origins of Bahrain's SARS-COV2 isolates. We have also identified two high impact spike mutations from these strains which increase the virulence of SARS-COV2. Our research could have a high impact on vaccine development and distinguishes the source of SARS-COV2 in the Kingdom of Bahrain.","Bindayna, Khalid Mubarak; Deifalla, Abdel Halim Abdel Fattah Salem; Mokbel, Hicham Ezzat Mohamed",Microb Pathog,,232

Antigen-specific responses are of unquestionable value for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Here, we investigated the kinetics of IgM, IgG against the spike (S) and nucleoproteins (N) proteins and their neutralizing capabilities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different disease presentations (i.e., mild, moderate or severe), need for intensive care units (ICU) admission or outcomes (i.e., survival vs death). We show that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were readily detectable in almost all COVID-19 patients with various clinical presentations. Interestingly, significantly higher levels of nAbs as well as anti-S1 and -N IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patients with more severe symptoms, patients requiring admission to ICU or those with fatal outcomes. More importantly, early after symptoms onset, we found that the levels of anti-N antibodies correlated strongly with disease severity. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the kinetics of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.","Hashem, Anwar M; Algaissi, Abdullah; Almahboub, Sarah A; Alfaleh, Mohamed A; Abujamel, Turki S; Alamri, Sawsan S; Alluhaybi, Khalid A; Hobani, Haya I; AlHarbi, Rahaf H; Alsulaiman, Reem M; ElAssouli, M-Zaki; Hala, Sharif; Alharbi, Naif K; Alhabbab, Rowa Y; AlSaieedi, Ahdab A; Abdulaal, Wesam H; Bukhari, Abdullah; Al-Somali, Afrah A; Alofi, Fadwa S; Khogeer, Asim A; Pain, Arnab; Alkayyal, Almohanad A; Almontashiri, Naif A M; Ahmad, Bakur Mahmoud; Li, Xuguang",Viruses,,232

In a prospective multi-country cohort of COVID-19 patients, we found that increased Notch4 expression on circulating regulatory T (Treg) cells was associated with disease severity, predicted mortality, and declined upon recovery. Deletion of Notch4 in Treg cells or therapy with anti-Notch4 antibodies in conventional and humanized mice normalized the dysregulated innate immunity and rescued disease morbidity and mortality induced by a synthetic analog of viral RNA or by influenza H1N1 virus. Mechanistically, Notch4 suppressed the induction by interleukin-18 of amphiregulin, a cytokine necessary for tissue repair. Protection by Notch4 inhibition was recapitulated by therapy with Amphiregulin and, reciprocally, abrogated by its antagonism. Amphiregulin declined in COVID-19 subjects as a function of disease severity and Notch4 expression. Thus, Notch4 expression on Treg cells dynamically restrains amphiregulin-dependent tissue repair to promote severe lung inflammation, with therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and related infections.","Harb, Hani; Benamar, Mehdi; Lai, Peggy S; Contini, Paola; Griffith, Jason W; Crestani, Elena; Schmitz-Abe, Klaus; Chen, Qian; Fong, Jason; Marri, Luca; Filaci, Gilberto; Del Zotto, Genny; Pishesha, Novalia; Kolifrath, Stephen; Broggi, Achille; Ghosh, Sreya; Gelmez, Metin Yusuf; Oktelik, Fatma Betul; Cetin, Esin Aktas; Kiykim, Ayca; Kose, Murat; Wang, Ziwei; Cui, Ye; Yu, Xu G; Li, Jonathan Z; Berra, Lorenzo; Stephen-Victor, Emmanuel; Charbonnier, Louis-Marie; Zanoni, Ivan; Ploegh, Hidde; Deniz, Gunnur; De Palma, Raffaele; Chatila, Talal A",Immunity,,232
518167,"COVID-19 Employment Crisis in Vietnam: Global Issue, National Solutions",2020,"BACKGROUND: We undertook a prospective qualitative survey to ascertain the perceptions and experience of National Health Service patients in the United Kingdom who underwent planned or elective procedures and surgery at alternate 'clean' hospital sites during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These alternate 'clean' hospital sites were independent hospitals running active staff and patient testing programmes for COVID-19 and which did not admit or treat patients suffering with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective survey was undertaken to include patients at least 30 days after a planned surgery or procedure conducted at a 'clean' alternate hospital site during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using structured interviews undertaken by trained assessors. A 20% sample group of patients were randomly selected to participate in this study. Qualitative data related to confidence, safety and perceptions of safety were collected. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (60%) reported that they had prior worries or concerns about undergoing an elective procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 47 patients (30%) had delayed their surgery at least once because of these concerns. A total of 150 patients (95%) felt that the precautions in place to protect their safety in the setting of an alternate 'clean' hospital site were well thought out and proportionate. Patients reported high levels of confidence in the measures undertaken. Separation of patient pathways using the independent sector and patient testing were identified by patients as having the greatest impact on their perception of safety. CONCLUSIONS: Patient confidence will be key to ensuring uptake of planned and elective procedures and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceptions of safety will be key to this confidence and efforts to demonstrably enhance safety are well received by patients. In particular, patients felt that a dedicated programme of patient testing and separation of patient pathways provided the greatest levels of confidence in the safety of their treatment.","Lee, George; Clough, Oliver T; Walker, Joseph A; Anakwe, Raymond E",Patient Saf Surg,,232
520534,Sanctions on Syria,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Somatization, defined as a number of medically unexplained physical symptoms for many years, is a resource-intensive condition with much suffering. Adult somatization has been linked to childhood trauma in both men and women. Among women, sexual trauma affects somatization level to a greater extent than non-sexual trauma. Early diagnosis of a somatization disorder would be of great help for both patients and society. The purpose of this scoping review is to map and summarize the literature on symptoms within somatization in women who have been sexually abused, and if any specific symptom can be linked to previous sexual abuse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A scoping review methodology was used. The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for original qualitative and quantitative research published between 2008 and 2019 that matched the objectives of the review. RESULTS: The database search identified 195 articles, of which 43 were retrieved in full text. Seven articles were included, involving 2076 women. All studies were quantitative. The included studies were heterogeneous. Four studies showed inconsistent findings regarding a link between sexual abuse and chronic or acute pain. Two studies showed an association between sexual abuse and increased incidence of somatic symptoms. One study showed an association between sexual abuse and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. No specific somatic symptoms in somatization were identifiable within the scope of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is to our knowledge the first scoping review on sexual abuse and symptoms of somatization. The findings suggest a link between sexual abuse and somatic symptoms, but the identified association with pain and irritable bowel syndrome is inconsistent. No studies have clearly identified specific symptoms within somatization associated to sexual abuse. Qualitative research on the topic was identified as a knowledge gap.","Iloson, Carina; Möller, Anna; Sundfeldt, Karin; Bernhardsson, Susanne",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,,232

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, correlates and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 671 critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China between January 1 to February 29, 2020. Data were captured on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, acute physiology, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary exposure was ICU admission for confirmed COVID-19 related critically illness. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with AKI, organ dysfunction, treatment intensity, and health services use. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 671 severe COVID-19 patients (median [IQR] 65 [56-73] years; male sex 65% (n = 434); hypertension 43% (n = 287) and APACHE II score 10 [7-14]), 39% developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, had greater markers of inflammation and coagulation activation, and had greater acuity and organ dysfunction as presentation. Despite similar treatment with antivirals, patients with AKI had lower viral conversion negative rates than those without AKI. The 28-day mortality was much higher in AKI patients than patients without AKI (72% vs. 42%), and there was an increase in 28-day mortality according to the severity of AKI. Non-survivors were less likely to receive antiviral therapy [132 (70%) vs. 65 (88%)] compared with survivors and have lower viral negative conversion rate [17 (9%) vs. 47 (64%)].

522885,"Identification of potential lockdown areas during COVID-19 transmission in Punjab, Pakistan",2021,"The scientific community is focused on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data, we compare within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with analogous dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Our quantitative analyses using a mathematical model revealed that the within-host reproduction number at symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2 was statistically significantly larger than that of MERS-CoV and similar to that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the time from symptom onset to the viral load peak for SARS-CoV-2 infection was shorter than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These findings suggest the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection by antivirals. We further used the viral dynamics model to predict the efficacy of potential antiviral drugs that have different modes of action. The efficacy was measured by the reduction in the viral load area under the curve (AUC). Our results indicate that therapies that block de novo infection or virus production are likely to be effective if and only if initiated before the viral load peak (which appears 2-3 days after symptom onset), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity of infected cells are likely to have effects with less sensitivity to the timing of treatment initiation. Furthermore, combining a therapy that promotes cytotoxicity and one that blocks de novo infection or virus production synergistically reduces the AUC with early treatment. Our unique modeling approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may be useful for development of antiviral therapies.","Kim, Kwang Su; Ejima, Keisuke; Iwanami, Shoya; Fujita, Yasuhisa; Ohashi, Hirofumi; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Asai, Yusuke; Nakaoka, Shinji; Watashi, Koichi; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Thompson, Robin N; Ke, Ruian; Perelson, Alan S; Iwami, Shingo",PLoS Biol,,232

The objective of the present report is to compare mental health outcomes assessed during COVID-19 to outcomes prior to COVID-19 in the general population and other population groups. Design: Living systematic review. Data Sources: MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection: Citation Indexes, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, medRxiv (preprints), and Open Science Framework Preprints (preprint server aggregator). The initial search was conducted on April 13, 2020 with ongoing weekly updates. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: For this report, we included studies that compared general mental health, anxiety symptoms, or depression symptoms, assessed January 1, 2020 or later, to the same outcomes collected between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. We required [≥] 90% of participants pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 to be the same or the use of statistical methods to address missing data. For population groups with continuous outcomes for at least three studies in an outcome domain, we conducted restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects meta-analyses. Results: As of March 22, 2021, we had identified 36 unique eligible studies with data from 33 cohorts. All reported COVID-19 outcomes between March and June 2020, and 3 studies also reported outcomes between September and November 2020. Estimates of changes in general mental health were close to zero in the general population (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16, I2 = 94.6%; 4 studies, N = 19,707) and among older adults (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.16, I2 = 90.4%; 4 studies, N = 5,520) and university students (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.30, I2 = 92.0%; 3 studies, N = 3,372). Changes in anxiety symptoms were close to zero and not statistically significant in university students (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.36, I2 = 95.4%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); women or females (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39, I2 = 92.3%; 3 studies, N = 2,778); and men or males (SMD = 0.07, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.15; I2 = 0.01%; 3 studies, N = 1,250); anxiety symptoms increased, however, among people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, I2 = 91.0%; 3 studies, N = 2,053). Changes in depression symptoms were close to zero or small and not statistically significant among university students (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.45, I2 = 91.8%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.17, I2 = 14.9%; 3 studies, N = 2,006); women or females (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.55, I2 = 91.2%; 3 studies, N = 2,843); and men or males (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.22; I2 = 92.3%; 4 studies, N = 3,661). In 3 studies with data from both March to June 2020 and September to November 2020, symptoms were unchanged from pre-COVID-19 at both time points or there were increases at the first assessment that had largely dissipated by the second assessment.

Unfortunately, no treatments or vaccines are available for infected individuals. We identified the host polyamine pathway as a potential drug target, as inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis significantly reduces enterovirus replication in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that CVB3 is sensitive to polyamine depletion through the polyamine analog diethylnorspermidine (DENSpm), which enhances polyamine catabolism through induction of polyamine acetylation. We demonstrate that CVB3 acquires resistance to DENSpm via mutation of the 2A protease, which enhances proteolytic activity in the presence of DENSpm. Resistance to DENSpm occurred via mutation of a non-catalytic site mutation and results in decreased fitness. These data demonstrate that potential for targeting polyamine catabolism as an antiviral target as well as highlight a potential mechanism of resistance.","Hulsebosch, Bridget M.; Mounce, Bryan C.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669273/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020310,232

One definition describes wellness as having eight dimensions: Intellectual, emotional, physical, social, occupational, financial, environmental, and spiritual. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique challenges for medical students, we aimed to compare medical student wellness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An informal survey was created to assess eight wellness dimensions and was distributed via Survey Monkey to US allopathic and osteopathic medical students via email and social media. The survey was administered from March 29, 2020 to June 23, 2020. Univariable and multivariable linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the change in students’ overall wellness using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (least well) to 10 (most well). Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the change in students’ responses to the eight dimensions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, students reported a decline in their overall wellness during COVID-19 (M(diff) = -1.08; p < .001). Asian respondents reported little change in overall wellness (M = -0.65) when compared to White respondents (M = -1.16) and Black respondents (M = -1.57). Students felt less supported and comfortable with their social (OR = 0.47) and daily (OR = 0.45) environments and expressed decreased satisfaction with their exercise (OR = 0.85), sense of purpose (OR = 0.33), and financial status (OR = 0.75). Students also expressed lower confidence (OR = 0.15) and satisfaction (OR = 0.11) with their medical education and increased anxiety (OR = 3.37) and depression (OR = 2.05). CONCLUSIONS: Medical students reported declines in overall wellness and individual wellness dimensions. These findings can be used to implement changes to improve medical student wellness.

597181,COVID19: Emerging lessons from the pandemic,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world instituted various public-health measures. Our project aimed to highlight the most significant similarities and differences in key mental-health indicators between four Western and Northern European countries, and identify the population subgroups with the poorest mental-health outcomes during the first months of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed time-series survey data of 205,084 individuals from seven studies from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the UK to assess the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns. All analyses focused on the initial lockdown phase (March–July 2020). The main outcomes were loneliness, anxiety, and COVID-19-related worries and precautionary behaviours. FINDINGS: COVID-19-related worries were consistently high in each country but decreased during the gradual reopening phases. While only 7% of the respondents reported high levels of loneliness in the Netherlands, percentages were higher in the rest of the three countries (13–18%). In all four countries, younger individuals and individuals with a history of mental illness expressed the highest levels of loneliness. INTERPRETATION: The pandemic and associated country lockdowns had a major impact on the mental health of populations, and certain subgroups should be closely followed to prevent negative long-term consequences. Younger individuals and individuals with a history of mental illness would benefit from tailored public-health interventions to prevent or counteract the negative effects of the pandemic. Individuals across Western and Northern Europe have thus far responded in psychologically similar ways despite differences in government approaches to the pandemic.

We describe the clinical and viral-phylogenetic characteristics of a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a high attack rate, and explore how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can inform outbreak investigations in this context. In this cluster, the first symptomatic case was a 22-month-old infant who developed rhinorrhoea and sneezing 2 days prior to attending a family gathering. Subsequently, seven family members in attendance at this event were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections, including the infant described. WGS revealed indistinguishable SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from the adults at the gathering, which were closely related genetically to B.1 lineage viruses circulating in the local community. However, a divergent viral sub-lineage was recovered from the infant and another child, each harbouring a distinguishing spike substitution (N30S). This suggested that the infant was unlikely to be the primary case, despite displaying symptoms first, and additional analysis of her nasopharyngeal swab revealed a picornavirus co-infection to account for her early symptoms. Our findings demonstrate how WGS can elucidate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections within household clusters and provide useful information to support outbreak investigations. Additionally, our description of SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages and notable variants circulating in Ireland to date provides an important genomic-epidemiological baseline in the context of vaccine introduction.","Hare, Daniel; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Dean, Jonathan; McDonnell, Kathleen; Carr, Michael J.; De Gascun, Cillian F.",Access Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1099/acmi.0.000252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595399/,232
599651,Aspects of the Health Inspection Authority in the People’s Republic of China,2015-05-20,"BACKGROUND: To minimize the risk of viral transmission, ophthalmology practices limited face-to-face encounters to only patients with urgent and emergent ophthalmic conditions in the weeks after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. The impact of this is unknown. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of the change in the frequency of ICD-10 code use and patient volumes in the 6 weeks before and after the changes in clinical practice associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: The total number of encounters decreased four-fold after the implementation of clinic changes associated with COVID-19. The low vision, pediatric ophthalmology, general ophthalmology, and cornea divisions had the largest total decrease of in-person visits. Conversely, the number of telemedicine visits increased sixty-fold. The number of diagnostic codes associated with ocular malignancies, most ocular inflammatory disorders, and retinal conditions requiring intravitreal injections increased. ICD-10 codes associated with ocular screening exams for systemic disorders decreased during the weeks post COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmology practices need to be prepared to experience changes in practice patterns, implementation of telemedicine, and decreased patient volumes during a pandemic. Knowing the changes specific to each subspecialty clinic is vital to redistribute available resources correctly.

600466,The effect of dispatch of national medical teams to Wuhan on its control and prevention of COVID-19,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Norovirus (NoV) is recognized as a highly contagious enteric pathogen of mammals, and bovine norovirus (BNoV) is associated with calf diarrhoea and has caused great economic losses in the cattle industry. RESULTS: Here, we describe a case of emerging calf diarrhoea on a cattle farm in Henan Province, Central China. BNoV was the only enteric pathogen detected in outbreaks according to tests for enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites. The complete genome of the newly identified strain CH-HNSC-2018 was successfully sequenced and found to be 7342 nucleotides in length. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CH-HNSC-2018 belongs to GIII.2 BNoV. Further analysis of the major capsid protein demonstrated that it is separated by specific genetic distances from previous BNoV strains identified in China and has 4 new amino acid (aa) mutations, 134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A, in the VP1 protein and 11 aa substitutions in the hypervariable P2 subdomain, suggesting that the BNoV strains circulating in China are diverse. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detection of GIII.2 BNoV in the VP1 region in China. This report should form a basis for further molecular studies on NoV and bovine enteric viruses in China.

The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru. METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six general hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution, and discharge conditions. RESULTS: Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60 ± 15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93.2% of patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients, and amputation (primary and secondary) was performed in 30% of the patients. The mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation. We report a younger cohort than those described in other studies and with a high frequency of amputations despite adequate surgical treatment.","Sánchez, Juan Bautista; Cuipal Alcalde, Juan Diego; Ramos Isidro, Rossi; Luna, Carlos Zúñiga; Cubas, W Samir; Coaguila Charres, André; Gutiérrez, José Egoávil; Ochoa, Juan David; Arias, Patricia Fernández",Ann Vasc Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.12.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089050962031102X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388408/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089050962031102X,232

We describe severity and outcomes of SARS-COV-2 in these patients and identify factors associated with severe disease. METHODS: Multi-national, observational study of children (<19y) with cancer or HSCT and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical (≥1 organ support). Exact polytomous regression was used to determine relationship between clinical variables and disease severity. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-thirty-one patients with COVID-19 across 10 countries were identified (median age 8y). Seventy-eight (60%) had leukemia/lymphoma, 48 (37%) solid tumour and 5 primary immunodeficiency and HSCT. Fever (71%), cough (47%) and coryza (29%) were the most frequent symptoms. The median duration of detectable virus was 16 days (range, 1-79d). Forty-nine patients (37%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (11%) required ICU-level care. Chemotherapy was delayed/modified in 35%. COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 32% of patients, mild in 47%, moderate in 8%, severe in 4% and critical in 9%. In 124 patients (95%), a full recovery was documented and four (3%) died due to COVID-19. Any co-morbidity (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.81-5.21), any co-infection (1.74; 95% CI1.03-3.03) and severe baseline neutropenia (1.82; 95% CI1.13-3.09) were independently and significantly associated with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: While most children with cancer had asymptomatic/mild disease, 13% had severe COVID-19 and 3% died. Co-morbidity, co-infection and neutropenia may increase the risk of severe disease.

However, high logistic commitment is demanded for participation. Here we explore the COVID-19 related risk during the pandemic for pts enrolled in clinical trials compared to pts receiving standard treatments. Methods: We retrospectively assessed the incidence of COVID-19 in pts treated in our Department from March 2020 to April 2021. Pts were divided into two groups;those enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials (A) and those being treated with standard therapies (B). Logistical (telemedicine and drug home-delivery), as well as clinical, characteristics of susceptibility to COVID-19 and number of events (SARS-CoV2 infections) were collected. The number of teleconsultations and COVID-19 events among the two groups were compared through Fisher’s exact test. Results: 115 pts were evaluated: 36 pts (31%) in A and 79 pts (69%) in B. Pts in A were younger, with a median age of 55 years (range 39-77) compared to 62 years (range 31-83) in B. Performance status (PS, ECOG) was similarly distributed: 0 (A 78%, B 83%), 1-2 (A 22%, B 17%). The median of previous treatment was 1 in A (range 0-9) and 2 (range 0-14) in B. The majority of the pts had at least one comorbidity in both groups (A: 72% and B: 83%). None of the pts had pulmonary comorbidity in A and 6% in B. Obesity was similarly distributed (A 11%, B 14%). The mean of monthly scheduled accesses was 1,5 in both groups. However, teleconsultation and delivery of oral cancer treatments at home were given, at least on one occasion, to only 6% of pts in A compared to 43% in B (p<0.01). A total of 15 COVID-19 cases were observed (13%): 8 (22%) in A and 7 (8%) in B. No statistically significant difference was observed (p = 0.068). Conclusions: Pts enrolled in early phase clinical trials had a significantly lower chance to perform teleconsultations compared to pts receiving standard therapy. Even if a trend was observed, they did not have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Future pts should then be encouraged to participate, if indicated. Considering the small numbers of pts in our cohorts, the foreseen trend toward a higher infection risk and the subsequent implications should be further explored in larger populations.

This paper aimed to pool the available data to provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review and pooled analysis was performed. Eligible studies were identified from database and hand searches up to March 2, 2020. Data on clinical (including laboratory and radiological) and epidemiological (including demographic) characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted and combined by simple pooling. Results: Of 644 studies identified, 69 studies (involving 48,926 patients) were included in the analysis. The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%). Altered levels of blood and biochemical parameters were observed in a proportion of the patients.

The reason why some people have persistent infection and how the virus survives for so long are still not fully understood. For this reason, we aimed to investigate the intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during persistent infection. Thirty-three patients who remained RT-PCR positive in the nasopharynx for at least 16 days were included in this study. Complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained for each patient at two time points. Phylogenetic, populational, and computational analysis of viral sequences confirmed persistent infection with evidence for a transmission cluster in health care professionals that shared the same workplace. A high number of missense variants targeting crucial structural and non-structural proteins such as Spike and Helicase was found. Interestingly, longitudinal acquisition of substitutions in Spike protein mapped many SARS-CoV-2 predicted T cell epitopes. Furthermore, the mutational profiles observed were suggestive of RNA editing enzyme activities, indicating innate immune mechanisms of the host cell. Viral quasispecies analysis corroborates persistent infection mainly by increasing richness and nucleotide diversity over time. Altogether, our findings highlight a dynamic and complex landscape of host and pathogen interaction during persistent infection suggesting that the host's innate immunity shapes the increase of intra-host diversity with possible implications for therapeutic strategies and public health decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Voloch, C.

604283,The Texas flood registry: a flexible tool for environmental and public health practitioners and researchers,2021-06-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a substantial impact on small-scale broiler production systems in developing countries and put their supply chains at risk of disruption. Drawing on a survey of 205 small-scale commercial broiler farms (SCBFs) in Egypt, this study identifies the primary pathways through which the pandemic has affected these farms and investigates the determinants of their perception of COVID-19 effects. The empirical results revealed that the pandemic affected SCBFs heterogeneously based on their management and production systems and resource endowment. In particular, individually owned farms and those with membership of poultry producer organizations and larger total asset values perceived significantly fewer effects. In addition, SCBFs operating in both local and provincial markets were less likely to perceive negative effects from the pandemic. Despite that the adoption of strict containment measures was essential for protecting public health, our results indicate that policy responses to COVID-19 must consider the likely effects on small businesses such as SCBFs since disruptions to such socioeconomically important supply chains will intensify human suffering from the pandemic. These findings of our study provide important implications for enhancing the preparedness and resilience of small-scale broiler production systems in developing countries to future pandemics and natural hazards. ABSTRACT: As in many other countries, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with subsequent government containment measures, posed significant challenges to small-scale broiler production systems in Egypt. Based on a survey of 205 specialist small-scale commercial broiler farms (SCBFs) consisting of both farm-based and household-based production systems, this study identifies the primary pathways through which COVID-19 has affected SCBFs and investigates the determinants of farm perception of these effects. A polychoric principal component analysis sorted the effects of the pandemic on the SCBFs surveyed into five categories, namely, input availability, production and operational costs, labor and human resources, consumer demand and sales, and farm finances. Next, five ordered logit models were constructed to examine the determinants of the SCBFs’ perception of each category of these effects. Generally, the empirical results revealed that COVID-19 affected SCBFs heterogeneously based on their management and production systems and resource endowment. Female-led and household-based SCBFs perceived significantly greater COVID-19 effects. In contrast, individually owned farms and those with membership of poultry producer organizations and larger total asset values perceived fewer effects. In addition, SCBFs operating in both local and provincial markets were less likely to perceive negative effects from the pandemic on their broiler farming activities. Although the adoption of strict and immediate containment measures was essential for controlling the virus and protecting public health, our results indicate that policy responses to COVID-19 must consider the likely effects on small businesses such as SCBFs since disruptions to such socioeconomically important supply chains will intensify human suffering from the pandemic. Overall, our findings provide important implications for the formulation of effective strategies for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on small-scale broiler production systems in Egypt and enhancing their preparedness and resilience to future pandemics, natural hazard risks, and market shocks.","Abu Hatab, Assem; Liu, Zhen; Nasser, Asmaa; Esmat, Abourehab",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11051354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068757/,232

Previous research has demonstrated that framing could influence perception and behaviors of audience members in the mass media. The question addressed in this paper concerns which information frame is best for reporting negative news (eg, deaths) and positive news (eg, recoveries or cures) related to the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: During the Spring Festival holidays of 2020 in China, we investigated a sample of 8170 participants’ risk perceptions and emotional responses to the pandemic, and their willingness to forward updates when the information is presented in different frames by using a 2 (domain: living [good news] vs dying [bad news]) × 2 (count: absolute vs relative) × 2 (population base: excluding population base vs including population base) × 2 (content: text-only vs text-plus-graphic) mixed factorial design, with the first factor being a within-subjects factor and the last three being between-subjects factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that (1) participants were more willing to forward good news (eg, cures) than bad news (eg, deaths); (2) when reporting bad news, the inclusion of the “population base” was effective in minimizing negative emotions; (3) when reporting good news, excluding the “population base” was more effective than including it in order to maximize positive emotions; (4) a text-plus-graphic frame worked better than a text-only frame in lowering the level of risk perception and negative emotions.

Positive selection has, however, been under-studied in African populations, despite their diversity and importance for understanding human history. RESULTS: Here, we have used 119 available whole-genome sequences from five Ethiopian populations (Amhara, Oromo, Somali, Wolayta and Gumuz) to investigate the modes and targets of positive selection in this part of the world. The site frequency spectrum-based test SFselect was applied to idfentify a wide range of events of selection (old and recent), and the haplotype-based statistic integrated haplotype score to detect more recent events, in each case with evaluation of the significance of candidate signals by extensive simulations. Additional insights were provided by considering admixture proportions and functional categories of genes. We identified both individual loci that are likely targets of classic sweeps and groups of genes that may have experienced polygenic adaptation. We found population-specific as well as shared signals of selection, with folate metabolism and the related ultraviolet response and skin pigmentation standing out as a shared pathway, perhaps as a response to the high levels of ultraviolet irradiation, and in addition strong signals in genes such as IFNA, MRC1, immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors which contribute to defend against pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Signals of positive selection were detected in Ethiopian populations revealing novel adaptations in East Africa, and abundant targets for functional follow-up.","Walsh, Sandra; Pagani, Luca; Xue, Yali; Laayouni, Hafid; Tyler-Smith, Chris; Bertranpetit, Jaume",BMC Genet,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00908-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092534/,232
605565,Report of the WHO independent high-level commission on NCDs: where is the focus on addressing inequalities?,2020-06-21,"Vaccination is the most cost-effective way to control disease caused by encapsulated bacteria; the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is the primary virulence factor and vaccine target. Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) serogroups B, C, Y and W all contain sialic acid, a common surface feature of human pathogens. Two protein-based vaccines against serogroup B infection are available for human use while four tetravalent conjugate vaccines including serogroups C, W and Y have been licensed. The tetravalent Menveo® conjugate vaccine is well-defined: a simple monomeric structure of oligosaccharides terminally conjugated to amino groups of the carrier protein CRM(197). However, not only is there a surprisingly low limit for antigen chain attachment to CRM(197), but different serogroup saccharides have consistently different CRM(197) loading, the reasons for which are unclear. Understanding this phenomenon is important for the long-term goal of controlling conjugation to prepare conjugate vaccines of optimal immunogenicity. Here we use molecular modeling to explore whether antigen flexibility can explain the varying antigen loading of the conjugates. Because flexibility is difficult to separate from other structural factors, we focus on sialic-acid containing CPS present in current glycoconjugate vaccines: serogroups NmC, NmW and NmY. Our simulations reveal a correlation between Nm antigen flexibility (NmW > NmC > NmY) and the number of chains attached to CRM(197), suggesting that increased flexibility enables accommodation of additional chains on the protein surface. Further, in silico models of the glycoconjugates confirm the relatively large hydrodynamic size of the saccharide chains and indicate steric constraints to further conjugation.","Kuttel, Michelle M.; Berti, Francesco; Ravenscroft, Neil",Glycoconj J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721150/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-021-09991-x,232

Underreporting, non-prioritization of data that consider the variable race and color, and social groups in social vulnerability, help the unequal instrumentalization of epidemiological surveillance; many deaths from the black population are not being accounted for. Structural racism and the invisibility of the black population have been intensified with the pandemic. There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 may disproportionately affect black people, who in addition to the vulnerability resulting from socio-spatial conditions, appear to be more susceptible to contamination with a more serious and lethal outcome. Finally, biological differences, such as impaired functioning of the immune response, can be increased by structural racism.

METHODS: Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. RESULTS: 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3–8) vs. 28 (26–29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death. And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (HR 0.10, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients. Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission. Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome. Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.","Wang, Lang; He, Wenbo; Yu, Xiaomei; Hu, Dalong; Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Huafen; Zhou, Jiali; Jiang, Hong",J Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301468; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240670/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,232

Peptides have shown several useful properties for human health, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities. These compounds are produced by almost all species of life. However, they are produced in limited quantities in nature. As a result, researchers have tried to synthesize bioactive peptides to study their properties and applications in various areas. Among their applications in food preservation, peptides have been incorporated into packaging materials. This review begins with a brief description of the methods used for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides. Also, the main bioproperties and mechanisms of action of peptides are discussed. Finally, some applications of peptides are presented, especially their use in active packaging, their effects on the polymeric matrix, and peptide migration.","Perez Espitia, Paula Judith; de Fátima Ferreira Soares, Nilda; dos Reis Coimbra, Jane Sélia; de Andrade, Nélio José; Souza Cruz, Renato; Alves Medeiros, Eber Antonio",Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00179.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368201/,232

METHODS: Between 4 May 2020 and 23 June 2020, 16 000 participants in a survey on COVID-19 from an existing consortium of three general adult population cohorts living in the Ile-de-France (IDF) or Grand Est (GE) (two regions with high rate of COVID-19) or in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine (NA) (with a low rate) were randomly selected to take a dried-blood spot for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment with three different serological methods (ClinicalTrial Identifier #NCT04392388). The primary outcome was a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the spike protein of the virus (ELISA-S). Estimates were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification methods. Multiple imputation was used to infer the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with adjustments for imperfect tests accuracies. RESULTS: The analysis included 14 628 participants, 983 with a positive ELISA-S. The weighted estimates of seropositivity and cumulative incidence were 10.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.1%, 10.9%] and 11.4% (95% CI: 10.1%, 12.8%) in IDF, 9.0% (95% CI: 7.7%, 10.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI: 8.1%, 11.8%) in GE and 3.1% (95% CI: 2.4%, 3.7%) and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1%, 3.8%) in NA, respectively. Seropositivity was higher in younger participants [odds ratio (OR) = 1.84 (95% CI: 1.79, 6.09) in <40 vs 50–60 years old and OR = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.74) in ≥70 vs 50–60 years old)] and when at least one child or adolescent lived in the same household [OR = 1.30 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.53)] and was lower in smokers compared with non-smokers [OR = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.49)].

Thus, there is need for continuous observation of public sentiment and deliberation to inform further adaptation of mandated interventions. In this study, we explore how public response may be reflected in Massachusetts (MA) via social media by specifically exploring temporal patterns in Twitter posts (tweets) regarding sentiment and discussion of topics. We employ interrupted time series centered on (1) Massachusetts State of Emergency declaration (March 10), (2) US State of Emergency declaration (March 13) and (3) Massachusetts public school closure (March 17) to explore changes in tweet sentiment polarity (net negative/positive), expressed anxiety and discussion on risk and health topics on a random subset of all tweets coded within Massachusetts and published from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (n = 2.8 million). We find significant differences between tweets published before and after mandate enforcement for Massachusetts State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, decreased polarity and increased anxiety expression), US State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, and increased anxiety expression) and Massachusetts public school closure (increased discussion of risk and decreased polarity). Our work further validates that Twitter data is a reasonable way to monitor public sentiment and discourse within a crisis, especially in conjunction with other observation data.","Thorpe Huerta, Danyellé; Hawkins, Jared B.; Brownstein, John S.; Hswen, Yulin",SSM Popul Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352827321001269; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321001269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355055/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100851,232
610562,Rapid urban health security assessment tool: a new resource for evaluating local-level public health preparedness,2020-06-15,"Virus replication can cause extensive rearrangement of host cell cytoskeletal and membrane compartments leading to the “cytopathic effect” that has been the hallmark of virus infection in tissue culture for many years. Recent studies are beginning to redefine these signs of viral infection in terms of specific effects of viruses on cellular processes. In this chapter, these concepts have been illustrated by describing the replication sites produced by many different viruses. In many cases, the cellular rearrangements caused during virus infection lead to the construction of sophisticated platforms in the cell that concentrate replicase proteins, virus genomes, and host proteins required for replication, and thereby increase the efficiency of replication. Interestingly, these same structures, called virus factories, virus inclusions, or virosomes, can recruit host components that are associated with cellular defences against infection and cell stress. It is possible that cellular defence pathways can be subverted by viruses to generate sites of replication. The recruitment of cellular membranes and cytoskeleton to generate virus replication sites can also benefit viruses in other ways. Disruption of cellular membranes can, for example, slow the transport of immunomodulatory proteins to the surface of infected cells and protect against innate and acquired immune responses, and rearrangements to cytoskeleton can facilitate virus release.","Netherton, Christopher; Moffat, Katy; Brooks, Elizabeth; Wileman, Thomas",Adv Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352707700040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352707700040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17765705/,232
611221,Scalable modEls of Community rehAbilitation for Individuals Recovering From COVID:19 reLated illnEss: A Longitudinal Service Evaluation Protocol—“SeaCole Cohort Evaluation”,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND. The effective reproductive number Re(t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. Re(t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution---the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating Re(t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution---the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in COVID-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. METHODS. We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of Re(t) for COVID-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. RESULTS. We estimated the generation time of COVID-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of Re(t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of Re(t) due to larger variance. IMPLICATIONS. Approximation of the generation time distribution of COVID-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating Re(t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.","Knight, J.; Mishra, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.24.20109215v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20109215,232
611474,Understanding the determinants of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines: a challenge in a fast-moving situation,2021-02-06,"Objectives: The coronavirus pandemic and need for social distancing has led to a requisite shift in healthcare delivery towards telemedicine, particularly for non-urgent outpatient visits. Little data exists around the efficacy of telemedicine in meeting patient care needs and satisfaction indices. This is particularly true for non-White, predominantly non-English-speaking patients who already experience many barriers to healthcare access and now face the highest risk of severe morbidity and mortality from Covid-19. We thus sought to assess the telehealth access, attitudes and experiences of gynecology and gynecologic oncology patients cared for in a large public safety-net hospital system during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods: Anonymous patient surveys were developed in both English and Spanish using an adaptable previously-published CHCF survey instrument. Surveys were directed at both face-to-face and telehealth visits using a 4-point Likert scale for single and composite scores. These were supplemented by categorical questions addressing telehealth access variables. Surveys were administered to all gynecology and gynecologic oncology patients presenting for care in a public safety-net hospital system from September through October 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic. Questionnaire responses were collected anonymously through SurveyMonkey with virtual or in-person assistance of clinic staff as needed. Survey results were tabulated and exported from SurveyMonkey for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results: Over the 2-month study period, 219 completed questionnaires were received with 117 (53%) in Spanish and 102 (47%) in English. One hundred eighty-four (84%) patients completed the questionnaire following a face-to-face (FTF) visit and 35 (16%) following a telehealth visit. Prior telehealth experience was reported by 65% of FTF patients and 57% of telehealth patients. Of Spanish-speaking patients, 74% reported use of an interpreter or Spanish-speaking provider during FTF visits compared to 100% during telehealth visits. Overall, 80% of patients reported having access to Wi-Fi, and 82% to a smart phone or tablet. Nearly one third of patients reported having to take time off work for their visit, regardless of visit type, and 34% reported requiring county-provided transportation for in-person clinic appointments. Overall, 90% of patients felt they were listened to, their healthcare needs were met, and provider explanations were clear, regardless of visit type. Approximately half of FTF patients, compared to less than 20% of telehealth patients, expressed the belief that telehealth appointments were not of equal quality to FTF visits. However, approximately half of FTF patients also reported they would have felt safer seeing a medical professional by telehealth due to Covid-19. Conclusions: In a representative sample of primarily non-White, non-English-speaking patients receiving care at a public safety-net hospital, telehealth is an acceptable form of healthcare provision. Over 90% of patients in telehealth and FTF cohorts felt their healthcare needs were met. However, lack of reliable smartphone and Wi-Fi access for nearly 20% of patients may present a particular challenge for instituting effective telehealth for these underserved communities. Regular solicitation of patient feedback around telehealth systems will continue to be important.","Manrriquez, Erica; Pineda, Elizabeth; Holschneider, Max; Holschneider, Christine; Zakhour, Mae",Gynecologic Oncology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825821011938; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0090-8258(21)01193-8; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825821011938,232

Vaccine hesitancy is a serious global phenomenon, and therefore the aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the effect of educational background, work field, and social media on attitudes towards vaccination in Jordan. We compared between medical personnel who were in direct contact with patients and non-medical individuals at Jordan University Hospital in terms of demographics, knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, rumors received via social media, their trust in these vaccines, and the encouraging factors for vaccination. 646 individuals were enrolled in this study, of which 287 (44.4%) were from medical field, and 359 (55.6%) from non-medical field. 226 (35%) were planning to take the vaccine once available, with a positive response from 131 (45.6%) medical field workers, compared to 94 (26.2%) non-medical individuals (p < 0.001). The social media rumor that was believed the most was the unsafety of these vaccines (n = 283; 43.8%). Only 163 (56.8%) of medical persons did not believe any of the circulated rumors, compared to 126 (35.1%) of non-medical persons (p < 0.001). The effect of medical personnel advice (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98; p = 0.026) and social media (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.41; p = 0.012) were significantly associated with the willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine once available. In conclusion, medical personnel and social media play a crucial role in increasing the society’s inclination towards vaccination by providing the community with updated evidence-based information about COVID-19 vaccines as an efficient medical countermeasure and by correcting the previously spread misinformation.","Aloweidi, Abdelkarim; Bsisu, Isam; Suleiman, Aiman; Abu-Halaweh, Sami; Almustafa, Mahmoud; Aqel, Mohammad; Amro, Aous; Radwan, Neveen; Assaf, Dima; Abdullah, Malak Ziyad; Albataineh, Malak; Mahasneh, Aya; Badaineh, Ala’a; Obeidat, Hala",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065888/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105111,232

This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a nationwide quality certification programme for IBD units. METHODS: Identification of quality indicators (QI) for IBD Unit certification was based on Delphi methodology that selected 53 QI, which were subjected to a normalisation process. Selected QI were then used in the certification process. Coordinated by GETECCU, this process began with a consulting round and an audit drill followed by a formal audit carried out by an independent certifying agency. This audit involved the scrutiny of the selected QI in medical records. If 80%–90% compliance was achieved, the IBD unit audited received the qualification of “advanced”, and if it exceeded 90% the rating was “excellence”. Afterwards, an anonymous survey was conducted among certified units to assess satisfaction with the programme for IBD units. RESULTS: As of January 2021, 66 IBD units adhere to the nationwide certification programme. Among the 53 units already audited by January 2021, 31 achieved the certification of excellence, 20 the advanced certification, and two did not obtain the certification. The main survey results indicated high satisfaction with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. CONCLUSION: Certification of inflammatory bowel disease units by GETECCU is the largest nationwide certification programme for IBD units reported.

To guide public health policies, we aimed to describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population in Kinshasa. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, household-based serosurvey between October 22, 2020, and November 8, 2020. Participants were interviewed at home and tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a Luminex based assay. A positive serology was defined as a sample that reacted with both SARS-CoV-2 proteins (100% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity). The overall weighted, age-standardized prevalence was estimated and the infection-to-case ratio was calculated to determine the proportion of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. RESULTS: A total of 1233 participants from 292 households were included (mean age, 32.4 years; 764 [61.2%] were women). The overall weighted, age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 14.0-19.5). The estimated infection-to-case ratio was 292:1. Prevalence was higher among participants ≥ 40 years than among those ˂18 years (21.2% vs 14.9%, respectively; p˂0.05). It was also higher in participants who reported hospitalization than among those who did not (29.8% vs 16.0%, respectively; p˂0.05). However, differences were not significant in the multivariate model (p=0.1). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than the number of COVID-19 cases reported. These results justify the organization of a sequential series of serosurveys by public health authorities to adapt response measures to the dynamics of the pandemic.","Nkuba, Antoine N; Makiala, Sheila M; Guichet, Emilande; Tshiminyi, Paul M; Bazitama, Yannick M; Yambayamba, Marc K; Kazenza, Benito M; Kabeya, Trésor M; Matungulu, Elysee B; Baketana, Lionel K; Mitongo, Naomi M; Thaurignac, Guillaume; Leendertz, Fabian H; Vanlerberghe, Veerle; Pelloquin, Raphaël; Etard, Jean-François; Maman, David; Mbala, Placide K; Ayouba, Ahidjo; Peeters, Martine; Muyembe, Jean-Jacques T; Delaporte, Eric; Ahuka, Steve M",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089598/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab515,232

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA plays an important role in immune cell development and regulation of immune activity through yielding diverse transcriptional isoforms to supplement the function of limited genes associated with the immune reaction. In addition, multiple factors have been identified as being involved in the control of alternative splicing at the cis, trans, or co-transcriptional level, and the aberrant splicing of RNA leads to the abnormal modulation of immune activity in infections, immune diseases, and tumors. In this review, we summarize the recent discoveries on the generation of immune-associated alternative splice variants, clinical disorders, and possible regulatory mechanisms. We also discuss the immune responses to the neoantigens produced by alternative splicing, and finally, we issue some alternative splicing and immunity correlated questions based on our knowledge.","Su, Zhongjing; Huang, Dongyang",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12040574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921058/,232

Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, is a worldwide swine disease. To date, little is known concerning the relationship between OTA and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the primary causative agent of PCVAD. The effects of OTA on PCV2 replication and their mechanisms were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results in vitro showed that low doses of OTA significantly increased PCV2 DNA copies and the number of infected cells. Maximum effects were observed at 0.05 μg/ml OTA. The results in vivo showed that PCV2 replication was significantly increased in serum and tissues of pigs fed 75 μg/kg OTA compared with the control group and pigs fed 150 μg/kg OTA. In addition, low doses of OTA significantly depleted reduced glutathione and mRNA expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; increased reactive oxygen species, oxidants, and malondialdehyde; and induced p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PK15 cells. Adding N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed the changes induced by OTA. Knockdown of p38 and ERK1/2 by their respective specific siRNAs or inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by their respective inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126) eliminated the increase in PCV2 replication induced by OTA. These data indicate that low doses of OTA promoted PCV2 replication in vitro and in vivo via the oxidative stress-mediated p38/ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. This suggests that low doses of OTA are potentially harmful to animals, as they enhance virus replication, and partly explains why the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary significantly in different pig farms.","Gan, Fang; Zhang, Zheqian; Hu, Zhihua; Hesketh, John; Xue, Hongxia; Chen, Xingxiang; Hao, Shu; Huang, Yu; Cole Ezea, Patience; Parveen, Fahmida; Huang, Kehe",Free Radic Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584914014245; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.12.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584914014245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542137/,232
619878,"African National Public Health Institutes Responses to COVID-19: Innovations, Systems Changes, and Challenges.",2021-09-08,"Of all the nutrients, vitamin A has been the most extensively evaluated for its impact on immunity. There are three main forms of vitamin A, retinol, retinal and retinoic acid (RA) with the latter being most biologically active and all‐trans‐RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune‐homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon‐based innate immune response to RNA viruses decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.During the Covid‐19 pandemic interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulator drugs have been tried but most of them are difficult to implement in resource‐limited settings. The current review explores the possibility of mega dose vitamin A as an affordable adjunct therapy for Covid‐19 illness with minimal reversible side effects. Insight is provided into the effect of vitamin A on ACE‐2 expression in the respiratory tract and its association with the prognosis of Covid‐19 patients. Vitamin A supplementation may aid the generation of protective immune response to Covid‐19 vaccines. An overview of the dosage and safety profile of vitamin A is presented along with recommended doses for prophylactic/therapeutic use in randomised controlled trials in Covid‐19 patients.","Midha, Ish K.; Kumar, Nilesh; Kumar, Amit; Madan, Taruna",Rev Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382930/,232

The Cognitive Reserve (CR) theory poses that constant brain activity earlier in life later helps to deter pathological changes in the brain, delaying the onset of disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability and validity of the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) in AD patients. METHODS: Primary data collection was done using the CRIq to quantify CR in 90 participants. Correlations and multivariable linear regressions were used to assess reliability and validity. RESULTS: Reliability was tested in 34 participants. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 (p < 0.001) indicated a strong positive correlation. Validity was tested in 33 participants. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.30 (p = 0.10) indicated an insignificant weak positive correlation. CONCLUSION: The CRIq was found reliable. Gaining a better understanding of how CR tools can be used in various cognitive populations will help with the establishment of a research tool that is universally accepted as a true CR measure.","Garba, Asabe E.; Grossberg, George T.; Enard, Kimberly R.; Jano, Fabian J.; Roberts, Emma N.; Marx, Charlotte A.; Buchanan, Paula M.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports,https://doi.org/10.3233/adr-200244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532699/,232

It is a critical and important task to take thorough efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. Compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, COVID-19 spreads more rapidly owing to increased globalization, a longer incubation period, and unobvious symptoms. As the coronavirus has the characteristics of strong transmission and weak lethality, and since the large-scale increase of infected people may overwhelm health care systems, efforts are needed to treat critical patients, track and manage the health status of residents, and isolate suspected patients. The application of emerging health technologies and digital practices in health care, such as artificial intelligence, telemedicine or telehealth, mobile health, big data, 5G, and the Internet of Things, have become powerful “weapons” to fight against the pandemic and provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control. Applications and evaluations of all of these technologies, practices, and health delivery services are highlighted in this study.","Ye, Jiancheng",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568725/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19866,232

COVID-19 and its impact on African populations,2020-12-16,"The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown supposedly provided a ‘window’ of reinstatement to natural resources including the air quality, but the scenario after the phased unlocking is yet to be explored. Consequently, here we evaluated the status of air quality during the 8th phase of unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown (January 2021) at three locations of North India. The first site (S1) was located at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana-PPCB; the second site (S2) at Yamunapuram, Bulandshahr-UPPCB; and the third site (S3) at Okhla Phase-2, Delhi-DPCC. The levels of PM2.5 showed a significant increase of 525.2%, 281.2%, and 185.0% at sites S1, S2 and S3, respectively in the unlock 8 (January 2021), in comparison to its concentration in the lockdown phase. Coherently, the levels of PM10 also showed a prominent increase of 284.5%, 189.1%, and 103.9% at sites S3, S1, and S2, respectively during the unlock 8 as compared to its concentration in the lockdown phase. This rise in the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 could be primarily attributed to the use of biomass fuel, industrial and vehicular emissions, stubble burning considering the agricultural activities at sites S1 and S2. Site S3 is a major industrial hub and has the highest population density among all three sites. Consequently, the maximum increase (295.7%) in the NO(2) levels during the unlock 8 was witnessed at site S3. The strong correlation between PM2.5, PM10, and CO, along with the PM2.5/PM10 ratio confirmed the similar origin of these pollutants at all the three sites. The improvements in the levels of air quality during the COVID-19 lockdown were major overtaken during the various phases of unlocking consequent to the initiation of anthropogenic processes.","Shukla, Saurabh; Khan, Ramsha; Saxena, Abhishek; Sekar, Selvam; Ali, Esmat F.; Shaheen, Sabry M.",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121014080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560058/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112107; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121014080?v=s5,232
622810,Public Health Emergency Response in Taiwan,2017-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCS) face several symptoms and are at higher risk of weight gain following diagnosis. Current literature shows that both exercise and diet play a key role in recovery of BCS. However, there is a gap between current guidelines and the real-world context. The aim of this article is to describe the process behind a free, not-for-profit community-based therapeutic exercise and education programme (TEEP) for BCS in the clinical setting. METHODS: The “Onco-Health Club” (OHC) consists of therapeutic exercise (TE) intervention aimed at ameliorating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and improving QoL and physical function. TE is supplemented with nutritional education, providing information about the Mediterranean diet. To this end, patients are recruited from an oncologist and are referred to a physiotherapist and a nutritionist for baseline assessment. TEEP consists of a 3-month intervention, delivered twice a week in a group format with 1 h of TE and 30 min of nutritional education. BCS then have a final assessment and are advised to continue with a healthy lifestyle. Data about referral, compliance and assessment were collected. RESULTS: From May 2017 to February of 2020, a total of 158 patients were recruited from 8 cohorts and 142 initially started the OHC. From 119 that joined the program, 96 patients were considered to have finished it with good adherence (assistance > 80%). BCS significantly improved their QoL, as well as upper and lower limb’s function, and increased their level of physical activity. CRF tended to decrease (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study obtained data on recruitment, compliance, and possible limitations of these kinds of programmes in a real-world context. Further research is needed in order to optimize patient engagement and compliance, as well as to determine the transferability of these programmes in the clinical setting.

This was a prospective, observational methods comparison study in a single centre ICU in Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A convenience sample of 39 patients admitted to a single room equipped with two ceiling mounted thermal imaging cameras was assessed, comparing measured cutaneous facial temperature via thermal camera to clinical temperature standards. Uncorrected correlation of camera measurement to clinical standard in all cases was poor, with the maximum reported correlation 0.24 (Wide-angle Lens to Bladder temperature). Using the wide-angle lens, mean differences were − 11.1 °C (LoA − 14.68 to − 7.51), − 11.1 °C ( − 14.3 to − 7.9), and − 11.2 °C ( − 15.23 to − 7.19) for axillary, bladder, and oral comparisons respectively (Fig. 1a). With respect to the narrow-angle lens compared to the axillary, bladder and oral temperatures, mean differences were − 7.6 °C ( − 11.2 to − 4.0), − 7.5 °C ( − 12.1 to − 2.9), and − 7.9 °C ( − 11.6 to − 4.2) respectively. AUCs for the wide-angle lens and narrow-angle lens ranged from 0.53 to 0.70 and 0.59 to 0.79 respectively, with axillary temperature demonstrating the greatest values.

RECENT FINDINGS: Early studies reported low incidence of hospital-acquired infections in COVID-19 patients. More recent large studies clearly showed that the incidence of secondary pneumonias was markedly high in patients under mechanical ventilation. Duration of mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, prone position and male sex were identified as risk factors. The adjunctive therapy with steroids and immunomodulators were associated with a higher risk of pneumonia and invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis. Although secondary pneumonias seemed to be associated with poor outcomes, namely mortality, in comparison with influenza, no difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes. Immunosuppressive therapy has been studied in several observational and randomized trials with conflicting results and the true impact on superinfections, namely secondary pneumonias, has not been properly assessed. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of secondary pneumonias. The impact of immunosuppressive therapies on superinfections is yet to be determined.

Here, we identified and analyzed the current evidence of RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of e-health interventions in the eating disorder (ED) field. METHODS: We screened an initial cluster of 581 papers. In the end, 12 RCTs in clinical ED cohorts were included. RESULTS: Some studies were conceived as stand-alone interventions, while others were presented as add-ons to ED-specific treatments. Studies varied in the type of EDs under investigation and in the e-health intervention applied (with vs. without therapist support vs. blended interventions; smartphone- vs. web-based). Only four studies reported explicit acceptability measures. Out of those, two reported high acceptability, one reported low acceptability, and one reported no significant difference in acceptability between groups. Four studies reported higher effectiveness of the e-health intervention compared to the control condition, e.g., reduction in maladaptive eating behaviors. Regarding control groups, three used a wait list design and nine had another kind of intervention (e.g., face-to-face CBT, or treatment as usual) as control. DISCUSSION: So far, the evidence for acceptability and effectiveness of e-health interventions in EDs is very limited. There is also a lack of studies in older patients, adolescents, men, sexual and ethnic minorities. Shame/stigma is discussed in the context of e-health interventions for EDs. It remains unclear how severity of EDs affects the effectiveness of e-health interventions, how patients can channel the knowledge they acquire from e-health interventions into their actual behaviors, and how such interventions can better fit the needs of the individual patient to increase acceptability and effectiveness.","Ahmadiankalati, Mojtaba; Steins-Loeber, Sabine; Paslakis, Georgios",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595546/,232

This communication reports the results of a study based on a parsimonious approach for the identification of the host‐virus interactions, where sequence complementarity between the human and SARS‐Cov‐2 genomes was used to predict several interactions between the host and SARS‐CoV‐2 at different levels of biological organization. In particular, the findings are suggestive of a direct effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 on cardiac health. The existing literature on host responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 and other viruses attest to many of these predicted interactions, supporting the utility of the proposed approach for the identification of host interactions with other novel pathogens.

SOURCES: Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic. CONTENT: The available literature and the authors’ frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, plus a conclusive statement for each answer. IMPLICATIONS: Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19. Physicians must be aware that, being not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled in randomized clinical trials (RCT).

The disease is characterized by diarrhea and dehydration causing mortality and growth retardation. In the last few decades, only classical PEDV was reported sporadically in Europe, but in 2014 outbreaks of PEDV were described in Germany. Phylogenetic analysis showed a very high nucleotide similarity with a variant of PEDV that was isolated in the US in January 2014. The epidemiological situation of PEDV infections in the Netherlands in 2014 was unknown and a seroprevalence study in swine was performed. In total, 838 blood samples from sows from 267 farms and 101 samples from wild boars were collected from May till November 2014 and tested for antibodies against PEDV by ELISA. The apparent herd prevalence of 0.75% suggests that PEDV was not circulating on a large scale in the Netherlands at this time. However, in November 2014 a clinical outbreak of PEDV was diagnosed in a fattener farm by PCR testing. This was the first confirmed PEDV outbreak since the early nineties. Sequence analyses showed that the viruses isolated in 2014 and 2015 in the Netherlands cluster with recently found European G1b strains. This suggests a one event introduction of PEDV G1b strains in Europe in 2014, which made the Netherlands and other European countries endemic for this type of strains since then.","Dortmans, J.C.F.M.; Li, W.; van der Wolf, P.J.; Buter, G.J.; Franssen, P.J.M.; van Schaik, G.; Houben, M.; Bosch, B.J.",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518302311; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518302311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.05.014,232

This study aims to develop a measurement model to identify and measure the degree of over-prevention behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: A survey online was conducted to collect cognition from 1528 Chinese people, including descriptions of various over-prevention behaviors defined by health authorities. Factor analyses were used to develop the measurement model and test its validity. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore demographic characteristics, indicating people who are inclined to exhibit over-prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Four main factors were extracted to develop the model (eigenvalue = 7.337, 3.157, 1.447, and 1.059, respectively). The overall reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.900), the convergent (AVE > 0.5, CR > 0.8 for each factor) and discriminant validity is good. There is also a good internal consistency among these factors (Cronbach’s α = 0.906, 0.852, 0.882, and 0.763, respectively). In Factor 1, gender has a negative effect (Beta = − 0.294, P < 0.05, OR = 0.745), whereas employment has a positive effect. Workers in institutions exhibit the greatest effect (Beta = 0.855, P < 0.001, OR = 2.352). In Factor 2, employment has a negative effect, with workers in institutions exhibit the greatest role (Beta = − 0.963, P < 0.001, OR = 0.382). By contrast, education level has a positive effect (Beta = 0.430, P < 0.001, OR = 1.537). In Factor 3, age plays a negative role (Beta = − 0.128, P < 0.05, OR = 0.880). CONCLUSIONS: People show a discrepancy in the cognition toward various over-prevention behaviors. The findings may have implications for decision-makers to reduce the contradiction between the epidemic and economic revival via managing these behaviors.","Ma, Rongyang; Wu, Hong; Deng, Zhaohua",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11823-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563147/,232
634999,Inferring global-scale temporal latent topics from news reports to predict public health interventions for COVID-19,2021-06-10,"We examined the impact of COVID-19 on bullying prevalence rates in a sample of 6578 Canadian students in Grades 4 to 12. To account for school changes associated with the pandemic, students were randomized at the school level into two conditions: (1) the pre-COVID-19 condition, assessing bullying prevalence rates retrospectively before the pandemic, and (2) the current condition, assessing rates during the pandemic. Results indicated that students reported far higher rates of bullying involvement before the pandemic than during the pandemic across all forms of bullying (general, physical, verbal, and social), except for cyber bullying, where differences in rates were less pronounced. Despite anti-Asian rhetoric during the pandemic, no difference was found between East Asian Canadian and White students on bullying victimization. Finally, our validity checks largely confirmed previous published patterns in both conditions: (1) girls were more likely to report being bullied than boys, (2) boys were more likely to report bullying others than girls, (3) elementary school students reported higher bullying involvement than secondary school students, and (4) gender diverse and LGTBQ + students reported being bullied at higher rates than students who identified as gender binary or heterosexual. These results highlight that the pandemic may have mitigated bullying rates, prompting the need to consider retaining some of the educational reforms used to reduce the spread of the virus that could foster caring interpersonal relationships at school such as reduced class sizes, increased supervision, and blended learning.","Vaillancourt, Tracy; Brittain, Heather; Krygsman, Amanda; Farrell, Ann H; Landon, Sally; Pepler, Debra",Aggressive behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.21986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235773/,232

METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID‐19 who were hospitalised. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID‐19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 μg/mL. Only the conventional COVID‐19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow‐up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P = .713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P = .032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality. Patients receiving ozone therapy appear to have a lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026‐0.863, P = .034). CONCLUSION: In this study, the findings suggested that the administration of ozone therapy along with the conventional medical treatment in patients hospitalised for COVID‐19 could reduce mortality.","Çolak, Şahin; Genç Yavuz, Burcu; Yavuz, Mürsel; Özçelik, Burak; Öner, Metin; Özgültekin, Asu; Şenbayrak, Seniha",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971067/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14321,232

637575,Special thanks to reviewers for 2020: the COVID-19 year of trial by fire,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: The need to determine prognostic factors that can predict a particularly severe or, conversely, the benign course of COVID-19 is particularly perceived in the Emergency Department (ED), considering the scarcity of resources for a conspicuous mass of patients. The aim of our study was to identify some predictors for 30-day mortality among some clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound variables in a COVID-19 patients population. METHODS: Prospective single-center pilot study conducted in an ED of an University Hospital. A consecutive sample of confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure was enrolled from March 8th, to April 15th, 2020. RESULTS: 143 patients were enrolled. Deceased patients (n = 65) were older (81 vs. 61 years, p <0.001), and they had more frequently a history of heart disease, neurological disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p-values = 0.026, 0.025, and 0.034, respectively) than survived patients. Troponin I and presepsin had a significant correlation with a worse outcome. Troponin achieved a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 82% for a cut-off value of 27.6 ng/L. The presepsin achieved a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 92% for a cut-off value of 871 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: In a population of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure in an ED, presepsin and troponin I are accurate predictors of 30-day mortality. Presepsin is highly specific and could permit the early identification of patients who could benefit from more intensive care as soon as they enter the ED. Further validation studies are needed to confirm this result.

The aim of this review article was to identify methodologies applied for SARS-CoV-2 sampling and analyses in environmental samples in different occupational and indoor environments. This study reports the search of available data published between May 29th, 2020 and November 1st, 2020. The search strategy used allowed the identification of 48 papers that comply with selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most described indoor environment consisted of health care facilities. From all the analyzed studies, 34 sampled surfaces, 27 sampled air (impactors and impingers being the most used), and 9 sampled water. All studies were based on molecular detection by qPCR of viral RNA extracted from collected samples. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 44 out of the 48 studies. The results suggest that the sampling approach should include both active and passive sampling methods in order to overcome each method limitations. Concerning the assays used, although most studies were based on qPCR detection, the fact that the digital PCR technique allows SARS-CoV-2 detection at lower concentrations, indicates that this should be the chosen method for future detection studies.","Pena, Pedro; Morais, Joana; Gomes, Anita Quintal; Viegas, Carla",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721009700; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721009700?v=s5,232

Heparins exhibit heterogeneity depending on the sources. Meanwhile, the adverse effect in the clinical uses and the adulteration of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) in heparins develop additional attention to analyze the purity of heparins. This review starts with the description of the classification, anticoagulant mechanism, clinical application of heparins and focuses on the existing methods of heparin analysis and detection including traditional detection methods, as well as new methods using fluorescence or gold nanomaterials as probes.

639079,The coronavirus pandemic should strengthen governments’ will to invest in adolescent health,2020-10-14,"Here, drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to screen approved MPP inhibitors and their derivatives to suggest a specific therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19. The approved MPP inhibitors against HIV and HCV were prioritized, while RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir including Favipiravir, alpha-ketoamide were studied as control groups. The target drug surface hotspot was also investigated through the molecular docking technique. Molecular dynamics was performed to determine the binding stability of docked complexes. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion analysis was conducted to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness of the screened MPP inhibitors. The results of the study revealed that Paritaprevir (-10.9 kcal/mol) and its analog (CID 131982844) (-16.3 kcal/mol) showed better binding affinity than the approved MPP inhibitors compared in this study, including remdesivir, Favipiravir, and alpha-ketoamide. A comparative study among the screened putative MPP inhibitors revealed that the amino acids T25, T26, H41, M49, L141, N142, G143, C145, H164, M165, E166, D187, R188, and Q189 are at potentially critical positions for being surface hotspots in the MPP of SARS-CoV-2. The top 5 predicted drugs (Paritaprevir, Glecaprevir, Nelfinavir, and Lopinavir) and the topmost analog showed conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 MP protein. The study also suggested that Paritaprevir and its analog (CID 131982844) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The current findings are limited to in silico analysis and lack in vivo efficacy testing; thus, we strongly recommend a quick assessment of Paritaprevir and its analog (CID 131982844) in a clinical trial.","Hasan, Mahmudul; Parvez, Md.

639485,Emergency Preparedness and Public Health Systems: Lessons for Developing Countries,2008-05-07,"Background In the search for active drugs against COVID19, the indications of many have been redirected. Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine are drugs that inhibit viral replication in vitro and that have been used in several medical centers. Objectives: This clinical trial analyzes the efficacy of Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine in patients with moderate COVID19 and in need of hospitalization. Methods. This a controlled, clinical, randomized, double blind trial that included patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia and hospitalization criteria, but no severe respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to one of three groups: Group1 hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg every 12 hours on the first day and subsequently, 200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days, Group 2 ivermectin, 12 mg or 18 mg, according to patient weight and, Group 3 placebo. At inclusion, blood samples for arterial blood gases and biochemical markers associated with a poor prognosis were obtained. The primary outcome was established as the duration of hospitalization until discharge due to patient improvement, the total duration of hospitalization, and the safety outcomes were either respiratory deterioration or death. Results. During the month of August, the admission of patients requiring hospitalization mostly encompassed cases with severe respiratory failure, so we ended the recruitment process and analyzed the data that was available at the time. One hundred and six (106) patients with an average age of 53 yrs. (plus-or-minus sign 16.9) were included, with a greater proportion of males (n=66, 62.2 %). Seventy-two percent (72%) (n= 76) had an associated comorbidity. Ninety percent (90 %) of patients were discharged due to improvement (n=96). The average duration of hospitalization was 6 days (IQR, 3 to 10). No difference in hospitalization duration was found between the treatment groups (Group1: 7 vs Group 2: 6 vs Group 3: 5, p =0.43) nor in respiratory deterioration or death (Group 1: 18 % vs Group 2: 22.2 % vs Group 3: 24.3 %, p =0.83). Conclusions. In non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, neither ivermectin nor hydroxychloroquine decreases the number of in-hospital days, respiratory deterioration, or deaths.","Beltran-Gonzalez, J.

640650,"COVID-19 Surveillance for Local Decision Making : An Academic, School District, and Public Health Collaboration",2021,"Historically, the prone position was used almost exclusively in the ICU for patients suffering from refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Amidst the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic, however, this technique has been increasingly utilized in settings outside of the ICU, particularly in the emergency department. With emerging evidence that patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 who are not intubated and mechanically ventilated may benefit from the prone position, this strategy should not be isolated to only those with critical illness. This is a review of the pertinent physiology and evidence supporting prone positioning along with a step‐by‐step guide meant to familiarize those who are not already comfortable with the maneuver. Placing a patient in the prone position helps to improve ventilation‐perfusion matching, dorsal lung recruitment, and ultimately gas exchange. Evidence also suggests there is improved oxygenation in both mechanically ventilated patients and those who are awake and spontaneously breathing, further reinforcing the utility of the prone position in non‐ICU settings. Given present concerns about resource limitations because of the pandemic, prone positioning has especially demonstrable value as a technique to delay or even prevent intubation. Patients who are able to self‐prone should be directed into the ''swimmer's position'' and then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position if further oxygenation is needed. If a mechanically ventilated patient is to be placed in the prone position, specific precautions should be taken to ensure the patient's safety and to prevent any unwanted sequelae of prone positioning.","McGurk, Kevin; Riveros, Toni; Johnson, Nicholas; Dyer, Sean",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838382/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12175,232

Although numerous strategies have been proposed, a definitive solution for recovering ovarian functions and restoring fertility is currently unavailable. One innovative alternative may be represented by the development of an “artificial ovary” that could be transplanted in patients for re-establishing reproductive activities. Here, we describe a novel approach for successful repopulation of decellularized ovarian bioscaffolds in vitro. Porcine whole ovaries were subjected to a decellularization protocol that removed the cell compartment, while maintaining the macrostructure and microstructure of the original tissue. The obtained bioscaffolds were then repopulated with porcine ovarian cells or with epigenetically erased porcine and human dermal fibroblasts. The results obtained demonstrated that the decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM)-based scaffold may constitute a suitable niche for ex vivo culture of ovarian cells. Furthermore, it was able to properly drive epigenetically erased cell differentiation, fate, and viability. Overall, the method described represents a powerful tool for the in vitro creation of a bioengineered ovary that may constitute a promising solution for hormone and fertility restoration. In addition, it allows for the creation of a suitable 3D platform with useful applications both in toxicological and transplantation studies.","Pennarossa, Georgia; De Iorio, Teresina; Gandolfi, Fulvio; Brevini, Tiziana A.

In this pilot single center study, confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled on admission to an intermediate care unit. Measurements with the ReDS system and CT scans were performed on admission and at weeks 1 and 2. Eleven patients were recruited. The average change in ReDS was −3.1 ± 1.7 after one week (p = 0.001) and −4.6 ± 2.9 after two weeks (p = 0.006). A similar trend was seen in total CT score (−3.3 ± 2.1, p = 0.001). The level of agreement between ReDS and CT changes yielded a perfect result. Statistically significant changes were observed in lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and c-reactive protein over 2 weeks.

However, the extent of availability and use of mHealth among healthcare professionals in Ghana is not known. The study’s main objective was to examine the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support by healthcare professionals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 285 healthcare professionals across 100 primary healthcare clinics in the Ashanti Region with an adopted survey tool. We obtained data on the participants’ background, available health infrastructure, healthcare workforce competency, ownership of a mobile wireless device, usefulness of mHealth, ease of use of mHealth, user satisfaction, and behavioural intention to use mHealth. Descriptive statistics were conducted to characterise healthcare professionals’ demographics and clinical features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the influence of the demographic factors on the availability and use of mHealth for disease diagnosis and treatment support. STATA version 15 was used to complete all the statistical analyses. Out of the 285 healthcare professionals, 64.91% indicated that mHealth is available to them, while 35.08% have no access to mHealth. Of the 185 healthcare professionals who have access to mHealth, 98.4% are currently using mHealth to support healthcare delivery. Logistic regression model analysis significantly (p < 0.05) identified that factors such as the availability of mobile wireless devices, phone calls, text messages, and mobile apps are associated with HIV, TB, medication adherence, clinic appointments, and others. There is a significant association between the availability of mobile wireless devices, text messages, phone calls, mobile apps, and their use for disease diagnosis and treatment compliance from the chi-square test analysis. The findings demonstrate a low level of mHealth use for disease diagnosis and treatment support by healthcare professionals at rural clinics.

Telerehabilitation, an offshoot of telemedicine, is a valuable yet underexplored tool in the therapeutic armamentarium of patients with neurological conditions, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although there is evidence in literature reporting the use of telerehabilitation and virtual reality-based services in providing rehabilitation to improve speech, swallowing, gait, and postural instability among persons with PD, the evidence is limited due to small patient numbers. Teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) is an underutilized strategy that may be as effective and perhaps more feasible and affordable among Indian PD patients and also allows sustained rehabilitation. In this article, we encapsulate the evidence on the utility and efficacy of TNR among persons with PD and call upon the neurology community to recognize and utilize the valuable asset that TNR may be for PD patients.","Garg, Divyani; Dhamija, Rajinder K.",Ann Indian Acad Neurol,https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.aian_566_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623256/,232
648509,"Liability Waivers for COVID-19: Law, Policy, and Practice",2021,"Social contact mixing plays a critical role in influencing the transmission routes of infectious diseases. Moreover, quantifying social contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly evolving pandemic intervened by changing public health measures is key for retroactive evaluation and proactive assessment of the effectiveness of different age- and setting-specific interventions. Contact mixing patterns have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic public health decision-making; but a rigorously justified methodology to identify setting-specific contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly developing pandemic, which can be informed by readily available data, is in great demand and has not yet been established. Here we fill in this critical gap by developing and utilizing a novel methodology, integrating social contact patterns derived from empirical data with a disease transmission model, that enables the usage of age-stratified incidence data to infer age-specific susceptibility, daily contact mixing patterns in workplace, household, school and community settings; and transmission acquired in these settings under different physical distancing measures. We demonstrated the utility of this methodology by performing an analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We quantified the age- and setting (household, workplace, community, and school)-specific mixing patterns and their evolution during the escalation of public health interventions in Ontario, Canada. We estimated a reduction in the average individual contact rate from 12.27 to 6.58 contacts per day, with an increase in household contacts, following the implementation of control measures. We also estimated increasing trends by age in both the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of symptomatic individuals diagnosed. Inferring the age- and setting-specific social contact mixing and key age-stratified epidemiological parameters, in the presence of evolving control measures, is critical to inform decision- and policy-making for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","McCarthy, Zachary; Xiao, Yanyu; Scarabel, Francesca; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Nah, Kyeongah; Heffernan, Jane M.; Asgary, Ali; Murty, V.

Research Question Does the rate of VTE among adults hospitalized with Covid-19 differ from matched hospitalized controls without Covid-19? Study Design and Methods We conducted a retrospective study among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalized adults without evidence of Covid-19 matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity, acute illness severity, and month of hospitalization between February-August 2020 from two integrated healthcare delivery systems with 36 hospitals. Outcomes included VTE (deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ascertained using diagnosis codes combined with validated natural language processing algorithms applied to electronic health records) and death from any cause at 30 days. Fine and Gray hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association of Covid-19 with VTE after accounting for competing risk of death and residual differences between groups, as well as identifying predictors of VTE in patients with Covid-19. Results We identified 6,319 adults with Covid-19 and 6,319 matched adults without Covid-19, with mean (SD) age of 60.0 (17.2) years, 46% women, 53.1% Hispanic, 14.6% Asian/Pacific Islander and 10.3% Black. During 30-day follow-up, 313 validated VTE (160 Covid-19, 153 controls) and 1172 deaths (817 Covid-19, 355 controls) occurred. Adults with Covid-19 had a more than threefold adjusted risk of VTE (adjusted hazard ratio 3.48, 95% Confidence Interval 2.03-5.98) compared with matched controls. Predictors of VTE in Covid-19 patients included age ≥55 years, Black race, prior VTE, diagnosed sepsis, prior moderate or severe liver disease, body mass index ≥40 kg/m2, and platelet count >217 k/mcL. Interpretation Among ethnically diverse hospitalized adults, Covid-19 infection increased the risk of VTE, and selected patient characteristics were associated with higher thromboembolic risk in the setting of Covid-19.","Go, Alan S.; Reynolds, Kristi; Tabada, Grace H.; Prasad, Priya A.; Sung, Sue Hee; Garcia, Elisha; Portugal, Cecilia; Fan, Dongjie; Pai, Ashok P.; Fang, Margaret C.",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221013532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293316/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.07.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221013532?v=s5,232
649610,Regional health governance: A suggested agenda for Southern African health diplomacy,2015-12-11,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented, nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response. Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse. Foreword We wish to thank all groups that responded rapidly by producing these invaluable and essential sequence data. Their contributions have enabled an unprecedented, lightning-fast process of scientific discovery---truly an incredible benefit for humanity and for the scientific community. We emphasize that most lab groups with whom we associate specific suspicious alleles are also those who have produced the most sequence data at a time when it was urgently needed. We commend their efforts. We have already contacted each group and many have updated their sequences. Our goal with this work is not to highlight potential errors, but to understand the impacts of these and other kinds of highly recurrent mutations so as to identify commonalities among the suspicious examples that can improve sequence quality and analysis going forward.","Turakhia, Yatish; Thornlow, Bryan; Gozashti, Landen; Hinrichs, Angie S.; Fernandes, Jason D.; Haussler, David; Corbett-Detig, Russell",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.141127,232

We can then question the fundamentals of such restriction of freedom, which is a constitutional right for everybody, including for residents in EHPAD, especially non-compliance with self-determination and consent. The principal objective has been a collective interest, before the individual right and the benefit for the patient itself. Nothing would have been justifying to create a possible risk to other residents, generated by another resident's behavior or one of his relatives. But these safety measures were taken despite the underlying risk of deteriorating individual situations through social and emotional isolation, and thus to further reduce autonomy capacities. “Luckily” the know-how and creative spirit of EHPAD professionals limited the consequences of this restriction of freedom. Hard lessons should be learned from share experiences if such a context were to occur again. But above all arises the question of the place of these dependent people in our society. It is essential to think collectively about these living spaces including protocols that should reflect people's choice and on-location adapted to be more open to the outside/foreigners visits.

Adherence to DOT and the association between treatment method and time to treatment is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a randomized 2% of laboratory-confirmed chlamydia infections reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019. Clinicians and pharmacies were contacted to ascertain treatment methods and timing. We assessed frequency of DOT and pharmacy prescriptions in the treatment of chlamydia infection in Massachusetts. We used log rank test to compare time to treatment initiation for patients receiving DOT versus pharmacy prescriptions. Data were stratified according to whether treatment was empiric or laboratory-driven. KEY RESULTS: We ascertained full outcomes for 199 patients. Eighty patients received DOT and 119 patients received pharmacy prescriptions. DOT was more common among those receiving empiric treatment and pharmacy prescriptions were more common among those receiving laboratory-driven treatment. The median time to treatment was 1.5 days for patients treated with DOT and 3 days for those treated with pharmacy prescriptions. For both groups, the median time to treatment for empiric therapy was 0 days and for laboratory-driven therapy was 4 days. The differences in time to treatment were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy prescriptions are frequently used for the treatment of chlamydia in Massachusetts. We did not observe a significant difference in the time to treatment between DOT and pharmacy prescriptions.","Platt, Laura; Elder, Heather; Bassett, Ingrid V.; Molotnikov, Lauren; Klevens, Monina; O’Connor, Erin; Leach, Dylan; Roosevelt, Kathleen; Hsu, Katherine",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211044060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583572/,232

METHODS: To understand the use, value, benefits and challenges of using VC in care homes across Wales, telephone interviews were conducted between September and November 2020. RESULTS: From 101 interviews, findings suggest that while care homes are responsive to VC, there is a need for further awareness, better training and support for care home staff. CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, issues around connectivity, lack of equipment and technical literacy were highlighted as minimal barriers.

In the UK, antibody testing originally formed the third pillar of the UK Government’s COVID-19 testing programme and was thought to offer hope that those with a negative antibody test result could return to normal life. However, at that time scientists and the public had little understanding of the longevity of COVID-19 antibodies, and whether they provided immunity to reinfection or transmission of the virus. OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the UK public’s understanding of COVID-19 testing, perceived test accuracy, the meaning of a positive test result, willingness to adhere to restrictive measures in response to an antibody test result and how they expect other people to respond. METHODS: On-line synchronous focus groups were conducted in April/May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic and the most stringent period of the COVID-19 restrictive measures. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: There was confusion in responses as to whether those with a positive or negative test should return to work and which restrictive measures would apply to them or their household members. Participants raised concerns about the wider public response to positive antibody test results and the adverse behavioural effects. There were worries that antibody tests could create a divided society particularly if those with a positive test result were given greater freedoms or chose to disregard the restrictive measures. CONCLUSION: Should these tests be offered more widely, information should be developed in consultation with the public to ensure clarity and address uncertainty about test results and subsequent behaviours.","Lecouturier, Jan; Kelly, Michael P.; Graham, Fiona; Meyer, Carly; Tang, Mei Yee; Goffe, Louis; Bonell, Chris; Michie, Susan; Sniehotta, Falko F.",Soc Sci Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621001106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33636445/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113778; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621001106?v=s5,232

Molecular docking results predict that ivermectin shows a large binding affinity for spike protein (− 9.0 kcal/mol) compared to levosalbutamol (− 4.1 kcal/mol). Ivermectin binds with LEU492, GLN493, GLY496, and TRY505 residues in the spike protein through hydrogen bonds and levosalbutamol binds with TYR453 and TYR505 residues. Using density functional theory (DFT) studies, we have calculated the binding energies between ivermectin and levosalbutamol with residues in spike protein which favor their binding are − 22.4 kcal/mol and − 21.08 kcal/mol, respectively. The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis has been performed to estimate the amount of charge transfer that occurred by two drugs during interaction with residues. Molecular dynamics (MD) study confirms the stability of spike protein bound with ivermectin through RMSD and RMSF analyses. Three different computer modeling techniques reveal that ivermectin is more stable than levosalbutamol in the active site of spike protein where hACE2 binds.

We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle–income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock.

655769,"Tourism, shamanism and the pandemic",2021-07-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Dendritic cells have a central role in starting and regulating immune functions in anticancer responses. The crosstalk of dendritic cells with tumors and other immune cell subsets is partly mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by both cell types and is multidirectional. In the case of dendritic cell EVs, the presence of stimulatory molecules and their ability to promote tumor antigen-specific responses, have raised interest in their uses as therapeutics vehicles. In this review, we highlight how dendritic cell- and tumor cell-derived EVs affect antitumor immune responses. In addition, we discuss the different approaches that exploit dendritic cell EVs as a novel platform for immunotherapies and therapeutic and prophylactic anticancer vaccines. ABSTRACT: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in intercellular communication as vehicles for the transport of membrane and cytosolic proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids including different RNAs. Dendritic cells (DCs)-derived EVs (DEVs), albeit variably, express major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes and co-stimulatory molecules on their surface that enable the interaction with other immune cells such as CD8(+) T cells, and other ligands that stimulate natural killer (NK) cells, thereby instructing tumor rejection, and counteracting immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Malignant cells oppose this effect by secreting EVs bearing a variety of molecules that block DCs function. For instance, tumor-derived EVs (TDEVs) can impair myeloid cell differentiation resulting in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) generation. Hence, the unique composition of EVs makes them suitable candidates for the development of new cancer treatment approaches including prophylactic vaccine targeting oncogenic pathogens, cancer vaccines, and cancer immunotherapeutics. We offer a perspective from both cell sides, DCs, and tumor cells, on how EVs regulate the antitumor immune response, and how this translates into promising therapeutic options by reviewing the latest advancement in DEV-based cancer therapeutics.","Fernández-Delgado, Irene; Calzada-Fraile, Diego; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12123558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260499/,232

657981,"Canada, Health System of",2008-08-26,"The immune system defends against invading pathogens through the rapid activation of innate immune signaling pathways. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor activated in response to virus infection and is largely responsible for establishing an antiviral state in the infected host. Studies in Irf3(−/−) mice have demonstrated the absence of IRF3 imparts a high degree of susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Virus infection causes the activation of IRF3 to transcribe type-I interferon (e.g., IFNβ), which is responsible for inducing the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act at specific stages to limit virus replication. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 is also activated to trigger apoptosis of virus-infected cells, as a mechanism to restrict virus spread within the host, in a pathway called RIG-I-like receptor-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA). These dual functions of IRF3 work in concert to mediate protective immunity against virus infection. These two pathways are activated differentially by the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of IRF3. Moreover, PTMs regulate not only IRF3 activation and function, but also protein stability. Consequently, many viruses utilize viral proteins or hijack cellular enzymes to inhibit IRF3 functions. This review will describe the PTMs that regulate IRF3′s RIPA and transcriptional activities and use coronavirus as a model virus capable of antagonizing IRF3-mediated innate immune responses. A thorough understanding of the cellular control of IRF3 and the mechanisms that viruses use to subvert this system is critical for developing novel therapies for virus-induced pathologies.","Glanz, Anna; Chakravarty, Sukanya; Varghese, Merina; Kottapalli, Anita; Fan, Shumin; Chakravarti, Ritu; Chattopadhyay, Saurabh",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805458/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040575,232

This study aimed to describe the clinical implications of preexisting neurological comorbidities and new-onset neurological complications in ICU patients with COVID-19. ICU patients who were isolated and treated for COVID-19 between 19 February 2020 and 3 May 2020, from one tertiary hospital and one government-designated branch hospital were included. Clinical data including previous neurological disorders were extracted from electronic medical records. All neurological complications were evaluated by neurointensivists. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate independent factors in ICU mortality. The median age of 52 ICU patients with COVID-19 was 73 years. Nineteen (36.5%) patients had preexisting neurological comorbidities, and new-onset neurological complications occurred in 23 (44.2%) during ICU admission. Patients with preexisting neurological comorbidities required tracheostomy more frequently and more ventilator and ICU days than those without. Patients with new-onset neurological complications experienced more medical complications and had higher ICU severity score and ICU mortality rates. New-onset neurological complications remained an independent factor for ICU mortality. Many COVID-19 patients in the ICU have preexisting neurological comorbidities, making them at a high risk of new-onset neurological complications.","Park, Jaeseok; Kwon, Yong-Shik; Kim, Hyun-Ah; Kwon, Doo-Hyuk; Hwang, Jihye; Jang, Seong-Hwa; Park, Hyungjong; Sohn, Sung-Il; Choi, Huimahn Alex; Hong, Jeong-Ho",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070236/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112281,232

To address this, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the association between cardiac injury and all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI) and coagulopathy. Further, studies comparing cardiac biomarker levels in survivors versus non-survivors were included. A total of 14 studies (3175 patients) were utilized for the final analysis. Cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of mortality [RR:7.79; 95%CI: 4.69-13.01; I(2)=58%], ICU admission [RR: 4.06; 95%CI: 1.50-10.97; I(2)=61%], mechanical ventilation [RR: 5.53; 95%CI: 3.09-9.91; I(2)=0%], and developing coagulopathy [RR: 3.86; 95%CI:2.81-5.32; I(2)=0%].

There have been a number of private and public efforts to gather sufficient information and confront significant unknowns in the field of environmental public health, yet there is a persistent and largely unmet need for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data. Even when data are readily available, the ability to create, analyze, and draw conclusions from these data using emerging computational tools, such as augmented and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, requires technical skills not currently implemented on a programmatic level across research hubs and academic institutions. We argue that collaborative efforts in data curation and storage, scientific computing, and training are of paramount importance to empower researchers within environmental sciences and the broader public health community to apply AI approaches and fully realize their potential. Leaders in the field were asked to prioritize challenges in incorporating big data in environmental public health research: inconsistent implementation of FAIR principles in data collection and sharing, a lack of skilled data scientists and appropriate cyber-infrastructures, and limited understanding of possibilities and communication of benefits were among those identified.

Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic mAb cocktail against Ebola virus. We systematically analyzed the antibody repertoire in human survivors and identified a pair of potently neutralizing mAbs that cooperatively bound to the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). High-resolution structures revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions. Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520. Remodeling of the glycan cap structures by the cocktail enabled enhanced GP binding and virus neutralization. The cocktail demonstrated resistance to virus escape and protected non-human primates (NHPs) against Ebola virus disease. These data illuminate structural principles of antibody cooperativity with implications for development of antiviral immunotherapeutics.","Gilchuk, Pavlo; Murin, Charles D.; Milligan, Jacob C.; Cross, Robert W.; Mire, Chad E.; Ilinykh, Philipp A.; Huang, Kai; Kuzmina, Natalia; Altman, Pilar X.; Hui, Sean; Gunn, Bronwyn M.; Bryan, Aubrey L.; Davidson, Edgar; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Turner, Hannah L.; Alkutkar, Tanwee; Flinko, Robin; Orlandi, Chiara; Carnahan, Robert; Nargi, Rachel; Bombardi, Robin G.; Vodzak, Megan E.; Li, Sheng; Okoli, Adaora; Ibeawuchi, Morris; Ohiaeri, Benjamin; Lewis, George K.; Alter, Galit; Bukreyev, Alexander; Saphire, Erica Ollmann; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Ward, Andrew B.; Crowe, James E.",Immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32023489/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320300285; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320300285; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.01.001,232

While isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of COVID-19 patients by density gradient centrifugation, we noticed some changes in the floating properties and in the sedimentation of the cells on density medium. Investigating this further, we found that in early phase COVID-19 patients, characterised by reduced circulating lymphocytes and monocytes, the PBMC fraction contained surprisingly high levels of neutrophils. Furthermore, the neutrophil population exhibited alterations in the cell size and in the internal complexity, consistent with the presence of low density neutrophils (LDNs) and immature forms, which may explain the shift seen in the floating abilities and that may be predictive of the severity of the disease. The percentage of this subset of neutrophils found in the PBMC band was rather spread (35.4 ± 27.2%, with a median 28.8% and IQR 11.6–56.1, Welch’s t-test early phase COVID-19 versus blood donor healthy controls P < 0.0001).

We found that there were ten anesthesiologists (5 male and 5 female) who contracted the infection after performing intubation, as well as 4 nurses (1 male and 3 female) who contracted the infection after assisting with the intubation. This is a retrospective investigation and no intervention was applied. The numbers are presented as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD). We used Graphpad Prism (version 8.2.1 Windows version, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Fisher's exact test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 was used to identify potential risk factor (s) for intubation providers. A P value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. A total of 211 anesthesiologists from four provinces were involved in the intubation of 664 patients with confirmed or potential COVID-19. Of these 644 patients, 640 cases were eventually confirmed with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the 211 anesthesiologists who performed intubation, 10 of them had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 afterwards. Coughing is a risk factor for provider infection (P=0.0001). The number of intubation attempts (within three attempts) did not increase the risk of the infection. All of the affected anesthesiologists had symptoms 2-12 days after the intubation encounter (average 6 ± 3 days). All had radiological image evidence of bilateral pneumonia and all reported relatively mild symptoms. The affected doctors were out of clinical service for 20-60 days (average 46 ± 12 days). Seven of the doctors have been discharged from the hospital, but three of them remain hospitalized. Four nurses who assisted with intubations contracted COVID-19. One of these nurses was in critical condition but was eventually discharged with a loss of 50 days of clinical service.

663555,Invasive alien species and disease risk: An open challenge in public and animal health,2020-10-22,"Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19 has drawn much attention. A common strategy has been to screen for established drugs, typically developed for other indications, that are antiviral in cells or organisms. Intriguingly, most of the drugs that have emerged from these campaigns, though diverse in structure, share a common physical property: cationic amphiphilicity. Provoked by the similarity of these repurposed drugs to those inducing phospholipidosis, a well-known drug side effect, we investigated phospholipidosis as a mechanism for antiviral activity. We tested 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs—including those from phenotypic screens and others that we ourselves had found—for induction of phospholipidosis in cell culture. We found that most of the repurposed drugs, which included hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others that have already progressed to clinical trials, induced phospholipidosis in the same concentration range as their antiviral activity; indeed, there was a strong monotonic correlation between antiviral efficacy and the magnitude of the phospholipidosis. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the gross physical properties of drugs, and does not reflect specific target-based activities, rather it may be considered a confound in early drug discovery. Understanding its role in infection, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to better distinguish between drugs and lead compounds that more directly impact COVID-19 from the large proportion of molecules that manifest this confounding effect, saving much time, effort and cost.","Tummino, Tia A.; Rezelj, Veronica V.; Fischer, Benoit; Fischer, Audrey; O’Meara, Matthew J.; Monel, Blandine; Vallet, Thomas; Zhang, Ziyang; Alon, Assaf; O’Donnell, Henry R.; Lyu, Jiankun; Schadt, Heiko; White, Kris M; Krogan, Nevan J.; Urban, Laszlo; Shokat, Kevan M.; Kruse, Andrew C.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Schwartz, Olivier; Moretti, Francesca; Vignuzzi, Marco; Pognan, Francois; Shoichet, Brian K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791693/,232

665044,Challenges and Strategies for Pakistan in the Third Wave of COVID-19: A Mini Review,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The missing asymptomatic COVID‐19 infections have been overlooked because of the imperfect sensitivity of the nucleic acid testing (NAT). Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty‐three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS‐CoV‐2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2. Different from strong and persistent N‐specific antibodies, S1‐specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months.

(2) Methods: We evaluated the host serologic responses, measured with semi-quantitative ELISA tests (IgA, IgG, IgM abs) in sera of 90 individuals in Hospital no. 4 in Bytom, 84 HCWs in the University Hospital in Opole and 25 in a Miasteczko Śląskie local surgery. All volunteers had negative RT-PCR test results or had not had the RT-PCR test performed within 30 days before sampling. The ELISA test was made at two different time points (July/August 2020) with a 2-weeks gap between blood collections to avoid the “serological window” period. (3) Results: The IgG seropositivity of asymptomatic HCWs varied between 1.2% to 10% (Opole vs. Bytom, p < 0.05; all without any symptoms). IgA seropositivity in HCWs was 8.8% in Opole and 7.14% in Bytom. IgM positive levels in HCWs in Opole and Bytom was 1.11% vs. 2.38%, respectively. Individuals with IgA and IgM seropositivity results were observed only in Opole (1.19%). More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic as well as socio-demographic locations. (4) Conclusions: 100% of IgG(+) volunteers were free from any symptoms of infection in the 30 days before first or second blood collection and they had no awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic HCWs could spread SARS-CoV-2 infection to other employees and patients. Only regular HCWs RT-PCR testing can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a hospital environment.

The protocol was rapidly and effectively instituted by teamwork training using high-fidelity simulation. METHODS: Phase 1 was a curriculum design of a SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol in three steps: planning the new protocol, repeated simulations of this protocol in a classroom, and a subsequent simulation of a cardiac arrest on a hospital ward. Phase 2 was the training of 275 healthcare workers (HCWs) using the new protocol. Training involved a seminar, practice in wearing the mandatory personal protection system (PPS), and cardiac arrest simulations with subsequent debriefing. RESULTS: Simulation provided insights that had not been considered in earlier phases of development. For example, a single person can don a PPS worn for the SARS patient in 1 1/2 minutes. However, when multiple members of a cardiac arrest team were dressing simultaneously, the time to don the PPS increased to between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 minutes. Errors in infection control as well as in medical management of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) were corrected. CONCLUSION: During the SARS crisis, real-time use of a high-fidelity simulator allowed the training of 275 HCWs in 2 weeks, with debriefing and error management. HCWs were required to manage the SARS cardiac arrest wearing unfamiliar equipment and following a modified ACLS protocol. The insight gained from this experience will be valuable for future infectious disease challenges in critical care.","Abrahamson, Simon D; Canzian, Sonya; Brunet, Fabrice",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16356209/,232

However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results suggest that the strength of NPIs remain the greatest determinant of future pre-vaccination outbreak size. While we find a small role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a more substantial impact on generating accurate predictions.","Baker, Rachel E.; Yang, Wenchang; Vecchi, Gabriel A.; Metcalf, C.

This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.","Leibowitz, Julian L.; Devries, James R.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2842958/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268228890147X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268228890147X,232

A cross-sectional online survey of 2005 gamblers, including a sub-sample of 1081 online gamblers (age 18 years and older), was administered to assess risky gambling behaviours and motivations, financial impacts from COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 on online gambling, mental health concerns and substance use. A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically.","Price, Alex",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837444/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00366-1,232

Xenophobia and racism can impact health. Research evidence points to early exposure to adverse childhood experiences such as racial discrimination as being detrimental and having significant short-term and long-term impact on physical and mental health. The purpose of this commentary article is to illuminate the need of patients and their families who may seek health care providers (HCPs) to express their concerns and fears when issues of xenophobia and racism arise. Patients and families need space in a healthcare setting to feel heard and understood. Anti-Asian xenophobia and racism among medically underserved Asian Americans persists and has been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe tenets of Critical Race Theory and AsianCrit, and use this lens to understand an example actual scenario, a counter-story, of a Vietnamese mother, and her Vietnamese-Chinese American family’s experience with xenophobia and racism at a community recreation center and the subsequent communication of this experience with a HCP. We describe the impacts of these experiences of seeking healing including discontinuity of a HCP-patient-family relationship. It takes bravery for patients and families to tell their story of xenophobia and racism to a HCP. There are Asian Americans who are afraid to seek healthcare because of anti-Asian xenophobia and concerns about White fragility. Following, we highlight research evidence on implicit bias, also known as unconscious bias, as context about its persistent and widespread existence among healthcare professionals in general and the need to address this in healthcare. Implicit bias can influence care provided to a patient-family and the interactions between a HCP-patient-family.

682120,Disruptive Innovation Can Prevent the Next Pandemic,2015-09-23,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep problems remain problematically prevalent among U.S. service members. In 2015 over 60% of sampled service members reported getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night, 31.4% getting 5 hours or less, and nearly 50% reported subthreshold insomnia symptoms on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Ongoing COVID-19 service delivery restrictions necessitate a rapid shift to virtual health solutions and illuminate barriers to the delivery of sleep interventions. This process improvement pilot was a proof-of-concept during uncertain times. METHODS: From September to January 2020, 10 weekly 1-time, 60-min virtual sleep classes were held over Microsoft Teams. Interventions were consistent with Motivational Interviewing and Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia. Participants completed the STOP BANG and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) before each class, and accomplished the ISI again at a 2-week contact during which they rated progress toward problem resolution and were offered additional clinical services as-needed. RESULTS: Forty-six participants attended the class. 67% responded to the post-class survey. 74% responded to the two-week follow-up. A majority (84%) indicated either agreement or strong agreement with the statement ’I plan to CHANGE a behavior or TRY an intervention I learned to better my sleep’, and many proceeded to establish a more consistent sleep schedule (n=14; 45%), remove electronics from the bedroom (n=13; 42%), and/or go to bed only when sleepy (n=11; 35%). 84% would recommend this class to others with similar concerns. Scaled from 1 (‘no change’) to 10 (‘full resolution’), participants reported having derived modest benefit from the intervention (M = 4.1, SD=1.7). Eleven (35%) denied need for additional sleep-related services, and 84% expressed intent to recommend the class to others with similar concerns. CONCLUSION: Results suggest a military population is receptive to a 1-time, virtual sleep class consistent with social distancing strictures. This service provided patients rapid access to care while contemporaneously reducing demand for time-intensive one-to-one appointments. As hypothesized, receipt of the intervention was associated with intention to modify sleep-relevant behavior, and with meaningful progress toward resolution of sleep difficulty as assessed at 2-week follow-up. Broadly disseminated, this intervention could introduce an internet-based, stepped-care approach to management of sleep insufficiency across the DoD.

683768,Public perceptions of quarantine: community-based telephone survey following an infectious disease outbreak,2009-12-16,"Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been reported with adverse outcomes in the transplantation communities. Mucormycosis even though a rare infection, has been classically being linked to organ transplantation and is associated with exceptionally high morbidity and mortality. The double infection of mucormycosis in COVID-19 is a lethal combination to be encountered in this pandemic era but is sparsely described in organ transplantation. Case presentation Here we report a young diabetic kidney transplant recipient who acquired severe COVID-19, followed by disseminated mucormycosis. The patient was a health care worker who developed severe COVID-19 for which he received remdesivir, anticoagulation and dexamethasone. There was no immunomodulatory therapy used. His maximum oxygen support was bilevel positive pressure ventilation (Bi-PAP). His sugars were frequently deranged during the stay. He developed secondary sepsis with Klebsiella, followed by non-healing lung consolidation. Later on, he developed pleural effusion and splenic abscess which was detected incidentally. He underwent an emergency splenectomy, the culture of which yielded mucormycosis. He was started with liposomal amphotericin B 5mg/kg was started. The patient deteriorated, and a repeat laparotomy yielded gastric perforation, with pus culture showing mucormycosis. The patient succumbed to death after an extensive long course of hospital stay. Conclusion We conclude that the diagnosis and management of this dual infection in this pandemic era is extremely challenging. The unusual location of mucormycosis complicating the COVID-19 course in our report, calls for a meticulous approach to opportunistic fungal infections in COVID-19 positive organ transplant recipients, especially with diabetes.","Meshram, Hari Shankar; Kumar, Deepak; Kute, Vivek B",Transplant Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134521006862?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.09.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134521006862,232

The prevalence of burnout, due to COVID-19 pandemic in India, is unknown. We therefore conducted this survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey using Copenhagen Burnout Inventory was carried out among HCWs looking after COVID-19 patients. Questionnaire was sent to the HCWs, using WhatsApp Messenger, and voluntary participation was sought. We received responses from 2026 HCWs. Burnout was assessed in personal, work, and client-related (COVID-19 pandemic-related) domains. Burnout was defined at a cut-off score of 50 for each domain. RESULTS: The prevalence of personal burnout was 44.6% (903), work-related burn-out was only 26.9% (544), while greater than half of the respondents (1,069, 52.8%) had pandemic-related burnout. Younger respondents (21–30 years) had higher personal and work-related burnout. The prevalence of personal and work-related burnout was significantly (p < 0.01) higher among females. The doctors were 1.64 times, and the support staff were 5 times more likely to experience pandemic-related burnout. CONCLUSION: There is a significant prevalence of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs, in particular, doctors and support staff. Female respondents had higher prevalence. We suggest that the management should be proactive and supportive in improving working conditions and providing assurance to the HCWs. The long-term effects of the current pandemic need to be assessed later. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Khasne RW, Dhakulkar BS, Mahajan HC, Kulkarni AP.

688764,Decolonising global health: where are the Southern voices?,2021-07-08,"At the end of December 2019, an epidemic form of respiratory tract infection now named COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China. It is caused by a newly identified viral pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. On January 30, 2020, due to the rapid spread of infection, COVID-19 was declared as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family of Coronaviridae, which are able to infect birds, humans and other mammals. The majority of human coronavirus infections are mild although already in 2003 and in 2012, the epidemics of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively, were characterized by a high mortality rate. In this regard, many efforts have been made to develop therapeutic strategies against human CoV infections but, unfortunately, drug candidates have shown efficacy only into in vitro studies, limiting their use against COVID-19 infection. Actually, no treatment has been approved in humans against SARS-CoV-2, and therefore there is an urgent need of a suitable vaccine to tackle this health issue. However, the puzzled scenario of biological features of the virus and its interaction with human immune response, represent a challenge for vaccine development. As expected, in hundreds of research laboratories there is a running out of breath to explore different strategies to obtain a safe and quickly spreadable vaccine; and among others, the peptide-based approach represents a turning point as peptides have demonstrated unique features of selectivity and specificity toward specific targets. Peptide-based vaccines imply the identification of different epitopes both on human cells and virus capsid and the design of peptide/peptidomimetics able to counteract the primary host-pathogen interaction, in order to induce a specific host immune response. SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic regions are mainly distributed, as well as for other coronaviruses, across structural areas such as spike, envelope, membrane or nucleocapsid proteins. Herein, we aim to highlight the molecular basis of the infection and recent peptide-based vaccines strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic including their delivery systems.","Di Natale, Concetta; La Manna, Sara; De Benedictis, Ilaria; Brandi, Paola; Marasco, Daniela",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343349/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.578382,232

Houttuynia cordata Thunb. is a semidomesticated medicinal herb consumed widely in traditional diet in North-Eastern India. In the present study, an effort has been made to assess the genetic diversity of H. cordata Thunb. from Brahmaputra valley of North-East India. A total of 545 genotypes from 18 populations of H. cordata Thunb. from four different regions, i.e. North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West, with respect to river Brahmaputra were collected and population genetic diversity and structure were analysed using ISSR molecular markers. Population genetic structure analysis using unweighted pair group method with averages (UPGMA)-based hierarchical cluster analysis, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and model-based clustering in STRUCTURE program revealed that the population of H. cordata Thunb. grouped according to regional distribution and forms four genetically distinct clusters. The analysis of molecular variance showed that differentiation among regions was significant with 60% genetic variation among region, 3% genetic variation among population within region and 37% genetic variation within population. We found wide variation in Nei’s gene diversity (Hj) ranging from 0.07782 in Margherita population to 0.13634 in Barapani population. Furthermore, Nei’s gene diversity within population (Nei’s Hs) and total gene diversity (Ht) were found to be 0.1081 and 0.1769 respectively. The genetic differentiation among 18 population was high (Fst = 0.3894; p < 0.001) with relatively restricted gene flow (Nm = 0.6564). Based on the result of this study, we suggest ex situ conservation could be an appropriate measure to adequately capture the total genetic diversity of H. cordata Thunb. populations of North-East India by selecting few individuals from different populations.
