312,Evaluation of Five Decontamination Methods for Filtering Facepiece Respirators,2009-10-04,"Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic. One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.","Viscusi, Dennis J.; Bergman, Michael S.; Eimer, Benjamin C.; Shaffer, Ronald E.",Ann Occup Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781738/,147
432,Interstitial lung diseases in children,2010-08-20,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in infants and children comprises a large spectrum of rare respiratory disorders that are mostly chronic and associated with high morbidity and mortality. These disorders are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that affect alveolar walls. Typical features of ILD include dyspnea, diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, and abnormal pulmonary function tests with restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children. The present article reviews current concepts of pathophysiological mechanisms, etiology and diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutic strategies. The following diagnostic grouping is used to discuss the various causes of pediatric ILD: 1) exposure-related ILD; 2) systemic disease-associated ILD; 3) alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD; and 4) ILD specific to infancy. Therapeutic options include mainly anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and/or anti-fibrotic drugs. The outcome is highly variable with a mortality rate around 15%. An overall favorable response to corticosteroid therapy is observed in around 50% of cases, often associated with sequelae such as limited exercise tolerance or the need for long-term oxygen therapy.","Clement, Annick; Nathan, Nadia; Epaud, Ralph; Fauroux, Brigitte; Corvol, Harriet",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939531/,147
490,Analysing the eosinophil cationic protein - a clue to the function of the eosinophil granulocyte,2011-01-14,"Eosinophil granulocytes reside in respiratory mucosa including lungs, in the gastro-intestinal tract, and in lymphocyte associated organs, the thymus, lymph nodes and the spleen. In parasitic infections, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, the numbers of the circulating eosinophils are frequently elevated. In conditions such as Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) circulating eosinophil levels are even further raised. Although, eosinophils were identified more than hundred years ago, their roles in homeostasis and in disease still remain unclear. The most prominent feature of the eosinophils are their large secondary granules, each containing four basic proteins, the best known being the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). This protein has been developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. Elevated ECP levels are found in T helper lymphocyte type 2 (atopic) diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases such as bacterial sinusitis. ECP is a ribonuclease which has been attributed with cytotoxic, neurotoxic, fibrosis promoting and immune-regulatory functions. ECP regulates mucosal and immune cells and may directly act against helminth, bacterial and viral infections. The levels of ECP measured in disease in combination with the catalogue of known functions of the protein and its polymorphisms presented here will build a foundation for further speculations of the role of ECP, and ultimately the role of the eosinophil.","Bystrom, Jonas; Amin, Kawa; Bishop-Bailey, David",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3030543/,147
528,Is Generalized Maternal Optimism or Pessimism During Pregnancy Associated with Unplanned Cesarean Section Deliveries in China?,2011-01-05,"This research examines whether maternal optimism/pessimism is associated with unplanned Cesarean section deliveries in China. If so, does the association remain after controlling for clinical factors associated with C-sections? A sample of 227 mostly primiparous women in the third trimester of pregnancy was surveyed in a large tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Post-delivery data were collected from medical records. In bivariate analysis, both optimism and pessimism were related to unplanned c-section. However, when optimism and pessimism were entered into a regression model together, optimism was no longer statistically significant. Pessimism remained significant, even when adjusting for clinical factors such as previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, infant gestational age, infant birthweight, labor duration, birth complications, and self-rated difficulty of the pregnancy. This research suggests that maternal mindset during pregnancy has a role in mode of delivery. However, more research is needed to elucidate potential causal pathways and test potential interventions.","Moyer, Cheryl A.; Elsayed, Yasmin; Zhu, YuChun; Wei, Yumei; Engmann, Cyril M.; Yang, Huixia",J Pregnancy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065811/,147
573,Evaluation of Coseasonality of Influenza and Invasive Pneumococcal Disease: Results from Prospective Surveillance,2011-06-07,"BACKGROUND: The wintertime co-occurrence of peaks in influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is well documented, but how and whether wintertime peaks caused by these two pathogens are causally related is still uncertain. We aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada, using several complementary methodological tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in Central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009, reported through population-based surveillance. We assessed the relationship between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and IPD using fast Fourier transforms in order to examine the relationship between these two pathogens over yearly timescales. We also used three complementary statistical methods (time-series methods, negative binomial regression, and case-crossover methods) to evaluate the short-term effect of influenza dynamics on pneumococcal risk. Annual periodicity with wintertime peaks could be demonstrated for IPD, whereas periodicity for influenza was less regular. As for long-term effects, phase and amplitude terms of pneumococcal and influenza seasonal sine waves were not correlated and meta-analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity of influenza, but not pneumococcal phase terms. In contrast, influenza was shown to Granger-cause pneumococcal disease. A short-term association between IPD and influenza could be demonstrated for 1-week lags in both case-crossover (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.10 [1.02–1.18]) and negative binomial regression analysis (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that influenza influences bacterial disease incidence by enhancing short-term risk of invasion in colonized individuals. The absence of correlation between seasonal waveforms, on the other hand, suggests that bacterial disease transmission is affected to a lesser extent.

745,Protective Role of the ACE2/Ang-(1–9) Axis in Cardiovascular Remodeling,2012-01-19,"Despite reduction in cardiovascular (CV) events and end-organ damage with the current pharmacologic strategies, CV disease remains the primary cause of death in the world. Pharmacological therapies based on the renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade are used extensively for the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and CV remodeling but in spite of their success the prevalence of end-organ damage and residual risk remain still high. Novel approaches must be discovered for a more effective treatment of residual CV remodeling and risk. The ACE2/Ang-(1–9) axis is a new and important target to counterbalance the vasoconstrictive/proliferative RAS axis. Ang-(1–9) is hydrolyzed slower than Ang-(1–7) and is able to bind the Ang II type 2 receptor. We review here the current experimental evidence suggesting that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–9) axis protects the heart and vessels (and possibly the kidney) from adverse cardiovascular remodeling in hypertension as well as in heart failure.","Ocaranza, María Paz; Jalil, Jorge E.",Int J Hypertens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270559/,147
1106,Alginic Acid-Coated Chitosan Nanoparticles Loaded with Legumain DNA Vaccine: Effect against Breast Cancer in Mice,2013-04-05,"Legumain-based DNA vaccines have potential to protect against breast cancer. However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH<2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer’s patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control. Oral vaccination was performed in the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model. Our data indicate that tumor volume was significantly smaller in groups using A.C.NPs or attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as carriers. Furthermore, splenocytes co-cultured them with 4T1 cells pre-stimulated with CoCl(2), which influenced the translocation of legumain from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, showed a 4.7 and 2.3 folds increase in active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3(+)/CD8(+)/CD25(+)) when treated with A.C.NPs carriers compared with PBS C.NPs. Our study suggests that C.NPs coated with alginic acid may be a safe and efficient tool for oral delivery of a DNA vaccine. Moreover, a legumain DNA vaccine delivered orally with A.C.NPs can effectively improve autoimmune response and protect against breast cancer in mice.","Liu, Ze; Lv, Dan; Liu, Shu; Gong, Junbo; Wang, Da; Xiong, Min; Chen, Xiaoniao; Xiang, Rong; Tan, Xiaoyue",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3618226/,147
1310,The Effect of Postoperative Corticosteroid Administration on Free Vascularized Fibular Grafting for Treating Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head,2013-11-12,"Free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) has been reported to be an effective method of treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study evaluated whether postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids had an adverse effect on FVFG outcomes in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 39 patients (67 hips) who had received maintenance doses of corticosteroids following FVFG. This group was matched to a group of patients who had not received corticosteroids treatment after operation. The mean follow-up duration was 5.4 years for the postoperative corticosteroid administration group (PCA group) and 5.0 years for the control group. At the latest follow-up, the average increase in Harris hip score was 11.1 ± 8.7 points for all hips in the PCA group and 12.6 ± 7.4 points for all hips in the control group (P > 0.05). In the PCA group, through radiographic evaluation, 49 hips were improved, 10 hips appeared unchanged, and 8 hips appeared worse. In the control group, 47 hips were improved, 13 hips appeared unchanged, and 7 hips appeared worse. The results suggested that postoperative maintenance doses of corticosteroids do not have an adverse effect on FVFG outcomes in patients with corticosteroid-induced ONFH.","Ding, Hao; Chen, Sheng-Bao; Lin, Sen; Gao, You-Shui; Zhang, Chang-Qing",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845513/,147
1328,Antisense suppression of donor splice site mutations in the dystrophin gene transcript,2013-06-13,"We describe two donor splice site mutations, affecting dystrophin exons 16 and 45 that led to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), through catastrophic inactivation of the mRNA. These gene lesions unexpectedly resulted in the retention of the downstream introns, thereby increasing the length of the dystrophin mRNA by 20.2 and 36 kb, respectively. Splice-switching antisense oligomers targeted to exon 16 excised this in-frame exon and the following intron from the patient dystrophin transcript very efficiently in vitro, thereby restoring the reading frame and allowing synthesis of near-normal levels of a putatively functional dystrophin isoform. In contrast, targeting splice-switching oligomers to exon 45 in patient cells promoted only modest levels of an out-of-frame dystrophin transcript after transfection at high oligomer concentrations, whereas dual targeting of exons 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 resulted in more efficient exon skipping, with concomitant removal of intron 45. The splice site mutations reported here appear highly amenable to antisense oligomer intervention. We suggest that other splice site mutations may need to be evaluated for oligomer interventions on a case-by-case basis.","Fletcher, Sue; Meloni, Penny L; Johnsen, Russell D; Wong, Brenda L; Muntoni, Francesco; Wilton, Stephen D",Mol Genet Genomic Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3865583/,147
1625,Factors Influencing the Measurement of Plasma/Serum Surfactant Protein D Levels by ELISA,2014-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Extensive variations in human surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels in circulation as measured by ELISA exist in the published literature. In order to determine the source of these variations, factors influencing the measurement by ELISA were explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood from healthy individuals was collected into various vacutainers during the same blood draw. Recombinant SP-D was diluted into different matrices and used for a standard curve. Samples were analyzed by capture ELISA using one of two distinct detection antibodies. RESULTS: The type of matrix had some effects on detection of recombinant SP-D. The type of anticoagulant used and dilution factor had very little effect, except for in plasma collected in EDTA vacutainers. The extent of variation in published values seemed to be due to the ELISA configuration employed, and, in agreement with this, we found that by switching the detection antibody, there was a 50% decrease in the extrapolated SP-D value of serum and plasma samples. Storage of samples resulted in slight changes in measured SP-D levels. CONCLUSIONS: The ELISA configuration employed to measure circulating levels of SP-D has a significant effect on the extrapolated values. In both configurations tested, the use of EDTA as a coagulant resulted in inconsistent values, and we, therefore, suggest the avoidance of this anticoagulant when assaying for SP-D by ELISA. While the demonstrated effects of several factors on measurement of SP-D may not account for all the disparities amongst the previous studies, they stress that variations in methodologies for measuring the same protein can result in very inconsistent results.","Bratcher, Preston E.; Gaggar, Amit",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4218753/,147
1797,"BAP31, a promising target for the immunotherapy of malignant melanomas",2015-04-18,"PURPOSE: Malignant melanoma’s (MM) incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer in the US and the overall survival at 5 years is less than 10%. B cell associated protein 31 (BAP31) is overexpressed in most MMs and might be a promising target for immunotherapy of this disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Firstly, we investigated the expression profiles of human BAP31 (hBAP31) and mouse BAP31 (mBAP31) in human and mouse normal tissues, respectively. The expression level of hBAP31 in human MMs and mBAP31 in B16 melanoma cells was also analyzed. Then we constructed novel mBAP31 DNA vaccines and tested there ability to stimulate mBAP31-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. RESULTS: For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MMs when compared with human normal tissues. Predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs. When mice were immunized with mBAP31 DNA vaccines, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed in the vaccinated mice. CTLs isolated from immunized mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro and vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccines had potent anti-tumor activity in therapeutic model using B16 melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that is capable of inducing effective immunity against BAP31-expressing MMs and will be applicable to human MMs and hBAP31 DNA vaccine warrants investigation in human clinical trials.

1985,Anti-cytokine autoantibodies in postherpetic neuralgia,2015-10-20,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation causes postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a debilitating chronic pain condition, have not been fully elucidated. Based on previous studies identifying a causative role for anti-cytokine autoantibodies in patients with opportunistic infections, we explored this possibility in PHN. METHODS: Sera from herpes zoster (HZ) patients without and with PHN (N = 115 and 83, respectively) were examined for the presence of autoantibodies against multiple cytokines, and other known autoantigens. In addition, a cohort of patients with complex regional pain syndrome or neuropathic pain was tested for autoantibodies against selected cytokines. Antibody levels against VZV, Epstein Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus-2 were also measured in the HZ and PHN patients. Patient sera with high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies were functionally tested for in vitro neutralizing activity. RESULTS: Six PHN subjects demonstrated markedly elevated levels of single, autoantibodies against interferon-α, interferon-γ, GM-CSF, or interleukin-6. In contrast, the HZ and the pain control group showed low or no autoantibodies, respectively, against these four cytokines. Further analysis revealed that one PHN patient with high levels of anti-interleukin-6 autoantibodies had a markedly depressed antibody level to VZV, potentially reflecting poor T cell immunity against VZV. In vitro functional testing revealed that three of the five anti-cytokine autoantibody positive PHN subjects had neutralizing autoantibodies against interferon-α, GM-CSF or interleukin-6. In contrast, none of the HZ patients without PHN had neutralizing autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the possibility that sporadic anti-cytokine autoantibodies in some subjects may cause an autoimmune immunodeficiency syndrome leading to uncontrolled VZV reactivation, nerve damage and subsequent PHN.","Bayat, Ahmad; Burbelo, Peter D.; Browne, Sarah K.; Quinlivan, Mark; Martinez, Bianca; Holland, Steven M.; Buvanendran, Asokumar; Kroin, Jeffrey S.; Mannes, Andrew J.; Breuer, Judith; Cohen, Jeffrey I.; Iadarola, Michael J.",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617715/,147

All immunotherapeutic drugs target relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and it still remains a medical challenge in MS to develop a treatment for progressive forms. The most common injectable disease-modifying therapies in RRMS include β-interferons 1a or 1b and glatiramer acetate. However, one of the major challenges of injectable disease-modifying therapies has been poor treatment adherence with approximately 50% of patients discontinuing the therapy within the first year.

We present current disease-modifying therapies (interferons, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, mitoxantrone), humanized monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, daclizumab) and emerging immune modulating approaches (stem cells, DNA vaccines, nanoparticles, altered peptide ligands) for the treatment of MS.","Dargahi, Narges; Katsara, Maria; Tselios, Theodore; Androutsou, Maria-Eleni; de Courten, Maximilian; Matsoukas, John; Apostolopoulos, Vasso",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532591/,147
2838,Prognosis and treatment of FOLFOX therapy related interstitial pneumonia: a plea for multimodal immune modulating therapy in the respiratory insufficient patient,2017-08-29,"BACKGROUND: The FOLFOX regimen, i.e., folinic acid (FOL), fluorouracil (F) and oxaliplatin (OX), is a drug cocktail that is used to treat gastric and colorectal cancers. Despite the concomitant improvements in response rate, duration of response and patient survival, reports of serious toxic pulmonary side effects have progressively emerged. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient who was treated with FOLFOX as an adjuvant to a rectosigmoidal resection of a rectosigmoidal carcinoma and who developed respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and open lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonia (IP). She received multimodal combination treatment (acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide) and survived. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed all 45 reported cases of FOLFOX-related lung toxicity and/or pulmonary fibrosis for their clinical characteristics and their outcomes related to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for the 45 cases with available data, the median age was 70 years, and the male–female ratio was 3.5: 1. In the patients exhibiting only mild respiratory symptoms, discontinuation of the culprit drug (oxaliplatin) resulted in a 100% regression of the symptoms. However the prognosis of the respiratory insufficient patient proved to be grim: death occurred in 76.9% of the cases despite conventional treatment with corticosteroids. We therefore urge oncologists and critical care specialists not to limit their interventions to the discontinuation of chemotherapy, artificial ventilation, corticosteroids and glutathione replenishment and to consider the gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents whenever life-threatening respiratory symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients do not subside; all the more so considering the fact that our analysis showed that every patient who survived intubation and mechanical ventilation experienced a full clinical recovery.","De Weerdt, Annick; Dendooven, Amélie; Snoeckx, Annemie; Pen, Jan; Lammens, Martin; Jorens, Philippe G.",BMC Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576105/,147

We studied the intention of parents to have their child vaccinated against four diseases not currently covered by the NIP in the Netherlands. The results on varicella have been published before; this article adds the results on vaccination against rotavirus gastroenteritis, meningococcal B disease, and seasonal influenza. RESULTS: We invited a random sample from the national immunisation register of 1500 parents for an internet survey which was completed by 491 parents (33% response). The intention to vaccinate was highest for meningococcal B disease (83% positive intention), followed by rotavirus gastroenteritis (38%), and lowest for varicella (28%) and seasonal influenza (15%). Prediction analyses were performed to determine which out of seven questionnaire statements was most informative in predicting the intention to vaccinate. Main drivers of intention were the perceived importance of vaccination against the particular disease and the perception of whether or not the disease is severe enough to justify vaccination. The results of this study can be informative in the decision-making process whether or not to introduce new vaccines into the NIP.

3787,Polymorphisms in CLDN1 are associated with age and differentiation of triple-negative breast cancer patients,2019-04-23,"Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease. It is very important to explore novel biomarkers to better clarify the characteristics of TNBC. It has been reported that polymorphisms in claudin 1 (CLDN1) are associated with risk of several cancers. But till now, there is no report about these polymorphisms and TNBC. Patients and methods: Between January 2004 and December 2013, 267 patients with stage I–III primary TNBC were included in our study. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in CLDN1 gene and clinicopathological characteristics or survival of these patients. We used Haploview 4.2 software to identify Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). MassARRAY MALDI-TOF System was used for genotyping. Results: We found that rs10513846 GA genotype was associated with older age [P=0.013, hazard ratios (HR) = 2.231, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.186–4.195]. Rs10513846 AA genotype carriers were more likely to develop grade 3 tumors (P=0.005, HR = 2.889, 95% CI: 1.389–6.007). And rs9283658 genotypes were also related to grade, more patients with grade 3 tumors were rs9283658 CC genotype carriers (P=0.023, HR = 0.446, 95% CI: 0.222–0.894). There was no association between polymorphisms in CLDN1 and survival of TNBC patients.

3997,Tumor-Treating Fields Induce RAW264.7 Macrophage Activation Via NK-κB/MAPK Signaling Pathways,2019-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor-treating fields are currently used to successfully treat various cancers; however, the specific pathways associated with its efficacy remain unknown in the immune responses. Here, we evaluated tumor-treating fields–mediated initiation of the macrophage-specific immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We subjected RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages to clinically relevant levels of tumor-treating fields (0.9 V/cm, 150 kHz) and evaluated alterations in cytokine expression and release, as well as cell viability. Additionally, we investigated the status of immunomodulatory pathways to determine their roles in tumor-treating fields–mediated immune activation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results indicated that tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels, as well as levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, relative to controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6 were markedly increased in tumor-treating fields–treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells compared with those in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without tumor-treating fields treatment. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the conditioned medium of tumor-treating fields–stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by tumor-treating fields effectively killed the tumor cells. Moreover, tumor-treating fields treatment activated the nuclear factor κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling. CONCLUSION: These results provide critical insights into the mechanisms through which tumor-treating fields affect macrophage-specific immune responses and the efficacy of this method for cancer treatment.","Park, Jeong-In; Song, Kyung-Hee; Jung, Seung-Youn; Ahn, Jiyeon; Hwang, Sang-Gu; Kim, Joon; Kim, Eun Ho; Song, Jie-Young",Technol Cancer Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6691660/,147
4147,A method of processing nasopharyngeal swabs to enable multiple testing,2019-07-09,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to perform multiple tests on single nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. STUDY DESIGN: We collected a NP swab on children aged 2–12 years with acute sinusitis and processed it for bacterial culture, viruses, cytokine expression, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis. During the course of the study, we expand the scope of evaluation to include RNA sequencing, which we accomplished by cutting the tip of the swab. RESULTS: Of the 174 children enrolled, 126 (72.4%) had a positive bacterial culture and 121(69.5%) tested positive for a virus. Cytokine measurement, as judged by the adequate levels of a housekeeping enzyme (GAPDH), appeared successful. From the samples used for 16S ribosomal sequencing we recovered, on average, 16,000 sequences per sample, accounting for a total of 2,646 operational taxonomic units across all samples sequenced. Samples used for RNA sequencing had a mean RNA Integrity number of 6.0. Cutting the tip of the swab did not affect the recovery yield for viruses or bacteria, nor did it affect species richness in microbiome analysis. CONCLUSION: We describe a minimally invasive sample collection protocol that allows for multiple diagnostic and research investigations in young children.","Lopez, Santiago M.C.; Martin, Judith M.; Johnson, Monika; Kurs-Lasky, Marcia; Horne, William T.; Marshall, Christopher W; Cooper, Vaughn S.; Williams, John V.; Shaikh, Nader",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851467/,147
4159,Artificial Blood: A Futuristic Dimension of Modern Day Transfusion Sciences,2019-05-11,"Artificial blood is an innovative concept of transfusion medicine where specifically designed compounds perform the task of transport and delivery of oxygen in the body to replace this function of allogenic human blood transfusion. Several molecules have been developed in the past few decades to achieve this objective and continous refinements are being continuously made in the quest of the ideal blood substitute. Currently, available technology manufactures artificial blood from haemoglobin obtained from outdated human/bovine blood (Haemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers) or utilizing Perfluorocarbons. These synthetic blood substitutes are advantageous in that they do not require compatibility testing, are free from blood borne infections, have prolonged shelf life and do not require refrigeration. Artificial blood is projected to have a significant impact on the development of medical care in the future. It can complement the current blood products for transfusion and create a stable supply of safe and effective products. It is likely to reduce the requirements of blood transfusions drastically especially in settings of trauma and surgery thereby reducing the reliance on banked donated blood.","Haldar, Rudrashish; Gupta, Devendra; Chitranshi, Shweta; Singh, Manish Kumar; Sachan, Sumit",Cardiovasc Hematol Agents Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6864588/,147
4560,The impact of fluid balance on outcomes in premature neonates: a report from the AWAKEN study group,2019-09-19,"BACKGROUND: Identifying immunogens that induce HIV-1-specific immune responses is a lengthy process that can benefit from computational methods, which predict T-cell epitopes for various HLA types. METHODS: We tested the performance of the NetMHCpan4.0 computational neural network in re-identifying 93 T-cell epitopes that had been previously independently mapped using the whole proteome IFN-γ ELISPOT assays in 6 HLA class I typed Ugandan individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D. To provide a benchmark we compared the predictions for NetMHCpan4.0 to MHCflurry1.2.0 and NetCTL1.2. RESULTS: NetMHCpan4.0 performed best correctly predicting 88 of the 93 experimentally mapped epitopes for a set length of 9-mer and matched HLA class I alleles. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.928. Setting NetMHCpan4.0 to predict 11-14mer length did not improve the prediction (37–79 of 93 peptides) with an inverse correlation between the number of predictions and length set. Late time point peptides were significantly stronger binders than early peptides (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.0000005). MHCflurry1.2.0 similarly predicted all but 2 of the peptides that NetMHCpan4.0 predicted and NetCTL1.2 predicted only 14 of the 93 experimental peptides. CONCLUSION: NetMHCpan4.0 class I epitope predictions covered 95% of the epitope responses identified in six HIV-1 infected individuals, and would have reduced the number of experimental confirmatory tests by > 80%. Algorithmic epitope prediction in conjunction with HLA allele frequency information can cost-effectively assist immunogen design through minimizing the experimental effort.","Bugembe, Daniel Lule; Ekii, Andrew Obuku; Ndembi, Nicaise; Serwanga, Jennifer; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Pala, Pietro",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036183/,147
4824,VIRAL INFECTIONS: THE MOST COMMONLY IDENTIFIED CAUSE OF FEVER IN CHILDREN WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUTROPENIA † 1041,1996,"Summary: Alterations in pancreatic function and structure were examined in suckling mice infected intraperitoneally with reovirus type 3. The results were compared to pancreatic zymogen enzyme activities and histology in adult mice infected with the same virus. No effect of the reovirus type 3 on the adult mice could be elicited. In contrast, the suckling mice infected by the reovirus type 3 revealed a definite change in pancreatic zymogen enzymes. However, the zymogen enzymes were affected in a nonparallel fashion and three groups of enzymes with different responses were noted. Amylase and lipase activities were significantly diminished (P < 0.001) at 6 days of viral infection. The endopeptidases, trypsin (P < 0.025) and chymotrypsin (P < 0.001) activities were increased significantly in the infected group. The exopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A and B in the infected animals were not changed significantly compared to the control. It seems reasonable that the reovirus type 3 infection in the suckling mouse causes diminished lipase and amylase activities that might contribute to the pathogenesis of viral enteritis. Speculation: Studies on viral enteritis in infants and young animals have primarily implicated changes in the small intestine as the cause of diarrhea. The viral invasion of the intestinal mucosa causes villous cell destruction and as a consequence, the mucosa generated is immature and incapable of handling normal salt and water absorption. In addition, changes in pancreatic function as a result of an extension of the viral infection to the pancreatic parenchyma might contribute to the pathophysiologic mechanisms operating in viral enteritis. In the infected suckling mice, only amylase and lipase activities are diminished to a large extent, while trypsin and chymotrypsin activities are elevated and carboxypeptidase A and B activities remain unaffected. The nonparallel change in pancreatic enzymes toward a viral insult can be explained by a separate effect of the virus on the biosynthesis of each of the zymogen pancreatic enzymes. It is conceivable that amylase and lipase while in a developing stage, are more affected by the virus than the other pancreatic enzymes which are already developed to a certain extent. Another explanation is that lipase and amylase activities are intrinsically more prone to be decreased in response to different disease states affecting the pancreas. Diminished lipolytic and amylolytic activities due to viral gastroenteritis is a possible contributing factor of the diarrhea in infants and children.","Branski, David; Lebenthal, Emanuel; Faden, Howard S; Hatch, Terry F; Krasner, Joseph",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086520/,147

Implications for health care providers including oral and maxillo-facial surgeons have been published by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA), and other medical societies and public health organizations. While the risk of infection with the Ebola virus seems to be rather small in Europe, maxillo-facial and plastic surgeons often travel to Africa to treat patients with facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, and noma. The likelihood of an encounter with patients infected by Ebola virus in subsaharan and West Africa, therefore, has increased during the last 2 years. The purpose of this short overview was to summarize the virology of the Ebola virus, transmission, epidemiology, clinical features, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible implications for maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV.","Reichart, Peter A.; Gelderblom, Hans R.; Khongkhunthian, Pathawee; Schmidt-Westhausen, Andrea",Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088354/,147

Viral entry/infection is initiated by binding of glycoprotein GP protein on Ebola virion to host cells, followed by fusion of virus-cell membrane also mediated by GP. Using an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based pseudotyping system, the roles of 41 Ebola GP1 residues in the receptor-binding domain in viral entry were studied by alanine scanning substitutions. We identified that four residues appear to be involved in protein folding/structure and four residues are important for viral entry. An improved entry interference assay was developed and used to study the role of these residues that are important for viral entry. It was found that R64 and K95 are involved in receptor binding. In contrast, some residues such as I170 are important for viral entry, but do not play a major role in receptor binding as indicated by entry interference assay and/or protein binding data, suggesting that these residues are involved in post-binding steps of viral entry. Furthermore, our results also suggested that Ebola and Marburg viruses share a common cellular molecule for entry.","Wang, Jizhen; Manicassamy, Balaji; Caffrey, Michael; Rong, Lijun",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091247/,147
5602,Intravascular adenoviral agents in cancer patients: Lessons from clinical trials,2002-11-22,"Lentiviral vectors portend a promising system to deliver antiviral genes for treating viral infections such as HIV-1 as they are capable of stably transducing both dividing and nondividing cells. Recently, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to be quite efficacious in silencing target genes. RNA interference is a natural mechanism, conserved in nature from Yeast to Humans, by which siRNAs operate to specifically and potently downregulate the expression of a target gene either transcriptionally (targeted to DNA) or post-transcriptionally (targeted to mRNA). The specificity and relative simplicity of siRNA design insinuate that siRNAs will prove to be favorable therapeutic agents. Since siRNAs are a small nucleic acid reagents, they are unlikely to elicit an immune response and genes encoding these siRNAs can be easily manipulated and delivered by lentiviral vectors to target cells. As such, lentiviral vectors expressing siRNAs represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of viral infections such as HIV-1. This review will focus on the development, lentiviral based delivery, and the potential therapeutic use of siRNAs in treating viral infections.","Morris, K V; Rossi, J J",Gene Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091755/,147
6037,Endothelium function in sepsis,2000,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of crocin against glycocalyx damage and inflammatory injury in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice and LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into control, LPS, and crocin + LPS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) groups. HUVECs were separated into eight groups: control, crocin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitor (MMP-9 inhib), cathepsin L inhibitor (CTL inhib), LPS, MMP-9 inhib + LPS, CTL inhib + LPS, and crocin + LPS. The potential cytotoxic effect of crocin on HUVECs was mainly evaluated through methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Histological changes were assessed via hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Lung capillary permeability was detected on the basis of wet–dry ratio and through fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: This study showed that crocin can improve the pulmonary vascular permeability in mice with LPS-induced ARDS and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathways of high mobility group box, nuclear factor κB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. Crocin also protected against the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate and syndecan-4 by inhibiting the expressions of CTL, heparanase, and MMP-9 in vivo and in vitro. Overall, this study revealed the protective effects of crocin on LPS-induced ARDS and elaborated their underlying mechanism. CONCLUSION: Crocin alleviated LPS-induced ARDS by protecting against glycocalyx damage and suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways.","Zhang, Dong; Qi, Bo-yang; Zhu, Wei- wei; Huang, Xiao; Wang, Xiao-zhi",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095881/,147

Leukocyte integrins are pivotal in the inflammatory response by mediating adhesion to vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix proteins. We have demonstrated that moderate hypothermia early in the course of meningitis decreases leukocyte sequestration within the brain parenchyma. This study examines whether hypothermia alters neutrophil integrin expression in a rabbit model of bacterial meningitis. Prior to the induction of meningitis, peripheral blood samples were obtained and the neutrophils isolated. Sixteen hours after inducing group B streptococcal meningitis, animals were treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and mechanically ventilated. Animals were randomized to hypothermia (32–33°C) or normothermia conditions. After 10 hours of hypothermia or normothermia, neutrophils were isolated from the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stained for β1 and β2 integrins, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Cerebral spinal fluid neutrophil β1 integrin expression was significantly decreased in hypothermic animals. Beta-1 integrins can assume a higher affinity or ""activated"" state following inflammatory stimulation. Expression of ""activated"" β1 integrins was also significantly decreased in hypothermic animals. Beta2 CSF neutrophil integrin expression was decreased in hypothermic animals, but failed to reach significance. These data suggest hypothermia may attenuate extravasated leukocyte expression of both total and ""activated"" β1 integrins.","Rowin, Mark E.; Xue, Vivian; Irazuzta, Jose",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101612/,147

This opened a new era for the treatment of autoimmune conditions with IVIg. Since then, IVIg has become an important treatment option in a wide spectrum of diseases, including autoimmune and acute inflammatory conditions, most of them off-label (not included in the US Food and Drug Administration recommendation). A panel of immunologists and internists with experience in IVIg therapy reviewed the medical literature for published data concerning treatment with IVIg. The quality of evidence was assessed, and a summary of the available relevant literature in each disease was given.

In particular, infectious agents and mediators shift the coagulation-fibrinolysis equilibrium of these cells towards fibrin formation and accumalation, via enhancement of procoagulant and fibrinolytic capacities.

Recent studies had identified the genes encoding most of the enzymes responsible for the generation of ceramide and ongoing research is aimed at characterizing their individual functions in cellular response to stress. This chapter discusses the seminal and more recent discoveries in regards to the pathways responsible for the accumulation of ceramide during stress and the mechanisms by which ceramide affects cell functions. The former group includes the roles of neutral sphingomyelinase 2, serine palmitoyltransferase, ceramide synthases, as well as the secretory and endosomal/lysosomal forms of acid sphingomyelinase. The latter summarizes the mechanisms by which ceramide activate its direct targets, PKC?, PP2A and cathepsin D. The ability of ceramide to affect membrane organization is discussed in the light of its relevance to cell signaling. Emerging evidence to support the previously assumed notion that ceramide acts in a strictly structure-specific manner are also included. These findings are described in the context of several physiological and pathophysiological conditions, namely septic shock, obesity-induced insulin resistance, aging and apoptosis of tumor cells in response to radiation and chemotherapy.","Nikolova-Karakashian, Mariana N.; Rozenova, Krassimira A.",Sphingolipids as Signaling and Regulatory Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122848/,147

The use of EIA is an extension of previously used serological tests, using enzyme-labeled antibody or antigen to determine antibody content. Direct detection of antigen by EIA represents a more dramatic departure from previous methods based on culture. Also, the method has enabled detection of infectious agents that are difficult to cultivate, such as hepatitis A virus and rotavirus, or agents that cannot be cultivated, such as hepatitis B. The use of EIA tests for detection of microbial antigens provides an alternative to culture as a means for direct identification of a specific microbial agent. It also provides a means to detect microbial agents which have not been successfully propagated. The detection of circulating antigen or detection of antigen in other body fluids by EIA is more difficult than detection of antibody because of the sensitivity required, and because of interfering substances in specimens such as feces and respiratory secretions. For this reason, very few antigen detection assays have the sensitivity and specificity required to be used as a primary diagnostic test. The number of tests that have been developed, however, is impressive and because of the possibilities for rapid, specific diagnosis, the interest in antigen detection by EIA remains high.","Herrmann, John E.",Adv Appl Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131335/,147

Our understanding of the evolution of skin colour is based mainly on the genetics of pigmentation (“background matching”), with little known about the evolution of the neuroendocrine systems that facilitate “background adaptation” through colour phenotypic plasticity. To address the latter, we studied the evolution in vertebrates of three genes, pomc, pmch and pmchl, that code for α‐MSH and two melanin‐concentrating hormones (MCH and MCHL). These hormones induce either dispersion/aggregation or the synthesis of pigments. We find that α‐MSH is highly conserved during evolution, as is its role in dispersing/synthesizing pigments. Also conserved is the three‐exon pmch gene that encodes MCH, which participates in feeding behaviours. In contrast, pmchl (known previously as pmch), is a teleost‐specific intron‐less gene. Our data indicate that in zebrafish, pmchl‐expressing neurons extend axons to the pituitary, supportive of an MCHL hormonal role, whereas zebrafish and Xenopus pmch+ neurons send axons dorsally in the brain. The evolution of these genes and acquisition of hormonal status for MCHL explain different mechanisms used by vertebrates to background‐adapt.","Bertolesi, Gabriel E.; Zhang, John Zhijia; McFarlane, Sarah",Pigment Cell Melanoma Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167667/,147

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the differences in clinical findings between survivors and non‐survivors of humidifier disinfectant‐associated children's interstitial lung disease. To evaluate dynamic changes in serum cytokines related to inflammation and fibrosis in lung injury, and to determine whether these changes are predictive of survival in this disease. METHODS: We evaluated 17 children with humidifier disinfectant‐associated children's interstitial lung disease, from whom serum samples were obtained weekly during hospitalization. The severity of chest tomographic and lung pathologic findings was scored. Levels of several cytokines were measured in the serial serum samples. RESULTS: Seven of the 17 children were survivors. Compared to survivors, non‐survivors had greater ground‐glass attenuation on follow‐up chest tomography, higher admission neutrophil counts, and more macrophages on pathologic findings. Transforming growth factor‐beta 1 persisted at an elevated level (1,000–1,500 pg/ml) in survivors, whereas it decreased abruptly in non‐survivors. At the time of this decrease, non‐survivors had clinical worsening of their respiratory failure. Transforming growth factor‐beta 1 was positively correlated with PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = 0.481, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Non‐survivors exhibited more inflammatory clinical findings than survivors. Transforming growth factor‐beta 1 remained elevated in survivors, suggesting that it affected the clinical course of humidifier disinfectant‐associated children's interstitial lung disease. The prognosis of this lung disease may depend more on controlling excessive inflammation and repairing damaged lung than on fibrosis, and transforming growth factor‐beta 1 may play a key role in this process.

To prepare students for this environment, a newly developed, evidence-based e-learning module was designed and implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether e-learning is a feasible method in preparing PT students for clinical work in complex ICU environments, as perceived by students and experts. METHODS: A mixed methods proof of concept study was undertaken. Participants were final-year students of an international curriculum, and experts from didactic and clinical fields. An e-learning module consisting of 7 separate chapters based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical expertise was developed, piloted and incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum as a compulsory course to be completed prior to clinical ICU rotations. Data were collected through 3 focus group meetings and 5 semi-structured interviews; these meetings and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed. RESULTS: The study sample comprised of 14 students and 5 experts. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: expected competencies of PT students in ICU, feeling prepared for ICU clinical work and dealing with local variety. The e-learning module enabled students to anticipate clinical situations and PT tasks in the ICU. Higher level clinical reasoning skills, handling of lines and wires and dealing with out-of-textbook situations could not be achieved with the e-learning module alone. CONCLUSIONS: An e-learning module can sufficiently prepare PT students for their clinical tasks in the ICU, as long as it is integrated with, or closely connected to, the students’ clinical placement.","Major, Mel E.; Ramaekers, Stephan P.

Animals exposed to 7 cigarettes/day were killed after 1, 1.5, or 2 years of exposure. Parallel lifetime exposures induced pulmonary tumors in 9% of the animals. In serially killed animals, four types of lesions were found: 1) perivascular or peribronchiolar accumulation of lymphoreticular cells, 2) fibrotic and cellular enlargement of peribronchiolar septa, 3) type II cell hyperplasia with septal fibrosis, and 4) air-space enlargement (emphysema). However, emphysema occurred only in animals exposed to a higher (10 cigarettes) dose of tobacco smoke.

11054,Vaccination during pregnancy: current and possible future recommendations,2020-01-07,"PURPOSE: Corynebacterium spp. (C. spp.) is commonly considered as a contaminant in respiratory specimens. No study has ever focused on its clinical relevance in the lower respiratory tract of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation. The aims were to describe the characteristics of ICU patients with a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen, to investigate the impact of C. spp. on the occurrence of pneumonia, and to evaluate the outcomes of these pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively included all adult patients admitted to ICU in a 1000-bed University Hospital (2007–2017) who had a C. spp. positive lower respiratory tract specimen at a significant quantitative level. We used clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria to classify the likelihood of such pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 31 patients included, acute respiratory failure and postoperative care after major surgery were the main reasons of admission. SAPS II was 47 [34–60]. C. spp. pneumonia was considered as probable, possible and unlikely in 10, 14, and 7 patients, respectively. Fifty-two and 94% of C. spp. strains were sensitive to amoxicillin, and vancomycin/linezolid, respectively. Seventeen patients had a complete course of antibiotic against C. spp. The overall ICU mortality was 58%. CONCLUSION: Corynebacterium spp seems to be responsible for authentic pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. It should be considered as clinically relevant when predominantly present in respiratory specimen from patients suspected with pneumonia in ICU, and empirically treated.","Clariot, Simon; Constant, Ophélie; Lepeule, Raphaël; Fihman, Vincent; Razazi, Keyvan; Cook, Fabrice; Attias, Arié; Merle, Jean-Claude; Hemery, François; Levesque, Eric; Decousser, Jean-Winoc; Langeron, Olivier; Mongardon, Nicolas",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222949/,147

RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of perioperative considerations for endoscopic skull base surgery lack strong supporting evidence and frequently have varied use or implementation amongst institutions. A notable exception comes from a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefit of lumbar drainage in high-risk cerebrospinal fluid leaks. SUMMARY: Skull base surgeons must consider a multitude of perioperative factors. While many components of perioperative management are extrapolated from related fields such as endoscopic sinus surgery or open cranial base surgery, additional high-quality studies are needed to delineate best practices specific to endoscopic skull base surgery.","Hussaini, Adnan S.; Clark, Christine M.; DeKlotz, Timothy R.",Curr Otorhinolaryngol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223122/,147
11132,Diabetes-associated infections: development of antimicrobial resistance and possible treatment strategies,2020-02-03,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that produces numerous exoproducts during infection that help it evade the host immune system and procure nutrients from the host environment. Among these products are a family of secreted 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone metabolites (AQs), which exhibit a range of biological activities. Here, we describe the validation of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method for quantifying multiple AQ congeners in complex biological matrices. The assay was validated for selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, recovery, matrix effects, and various aspects of stability (freeze-thaw, bench-top, long-term storage, and autosampler/post-preparative). Using authentic standards for 6 distinct AQ congeners, we report accurate quantitation within a linear range between 25 and 1000 nmol/L for all of the validated AQ standards. This method was successfully applied to quantify AQ concentrations in P. aeruginosa cell culture and in the lungs of mice infected with P. aeruginosa. Further, we confirmed the presence of unsaturated forms of several AQ congeners in cell culture.

The threat of a new influenza pandemic has prompted countries to draft national strategic preparedness plans to prevent, contain and mitigate the next human influenza pandemic. To evaluate preparedness for an influenza pandemic in the African region we analysed African national preparedness plans available in the public domain. A data extraction tool, based on a World Health Organization checklist for influenza epidemic preparedness, was designed in consultation with pandemic influenza planning experts and experts on the region's public health challenges. Thirty-five plans were identified and available from 53 African countries. Most plans are relatively robust in addressing detection and containment of influenza in animals but strategic preparedness to respond to pandemic human influenza is weak. In most plans communication strategies have been developed with the aim to raise awareness of transmission factors and promote hygiene measures. By contrast, the human health care sector is ill-prepared. Case management, triage procedures, identification of health care facilities for patient treatment (including home care and provisions for the distribution and administration of pharmaceuticals) are poorly addressed by most plans. The maintenance of essential services in the event of a pandemic is absent from most plans. Whilst many African countries have strategic pandemic influenza preparedness plans, most are developmental in nature and lack operational clarity, or focus principally on the containment of avian influenza rather than pandemic human influenza. Clear strategies, that are operational, need to be developed that reflect the realities of national context and resource constraints and that meet national objectives. These objectives need also to be coherent with international imperatives such that the global threat of pandemic influenza can be met effectively and efficiently.","Ortu, Giuseppina; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Coker, Richard",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314001/,147

METHODS: A narrative review was performed, with particular emphasis on RCTs, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. The Cochrane Library, Ovid, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and ProQuest were searched for the subject headings music, music therapy, cancer, oncology, palliative care, pain, anxiety, depression, mood, quality of life, prevalence, neuroscience, functional imaging, endogenous opioids, GABA, 5HT, dopamine, and permutations of these same search terms. Data for the review were comprised of articles published between 1970 and 2012. References of all the cited articles were also reviewed. RESULTS: Available evidence suggests that music-based interventions may have a positive impact on pain, anxiety, mood disturbance, and quality of life in cancer patients. Advances in neurobiology may provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which music impacts these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to determine what subpopulation of cancer patients is most likely to respond to music-based interventions, what interventions are most effective for individual outcomes, and what measurement parameters best gauge their effectiveness.","Archie, Patrick; Bruera, Eduardo; Cohen, Lorenzo",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728458/,147

METHODS: We measured left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in a cross-sectional cohort of participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort (CKD-JAC) study in order to identify factors that are associated with increased LVMI in patients with stage 3–5 CKD. LVH was defined as LVMI > 125 g/m(2) in male patients and >110 g/m(2) in female patients. RESULTS: We analyzed baseline characteristics in 1185 participants (male 63.7 %, female 36.3 %). Diabetes mellitus was the underlying disease in 41.3 % of patients, and mean age was 61.8 ± 11.1 years. LVH was detected in 21.7 % of patients at baseline. By multivariate logistic analysis, independent risk factors for LVH were past history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.574; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.360–0.916; P = 0.020), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.179; 95 % CI 1.021–1.360; P = 0.025), body mass index (OR 1.135; 95 % CI 1.074–1.200; P < 0.001), and serum calcium level (OR 0.589; 95 % CI 0.396–0.876; P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional baseline data from the CKD-JAC study shed light on the association between LVH and risk factors in patients with decreased renal function. Further longitudinal analyses of the CKD-JAC cohort are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of LVH in CKD patients.","Nitta, Kosaku; Iimuro, Satoshi; Imai, Enyu; Matsuo, Seiichi; Makino, Hirofumi; Akizawa, Tadao; Watanabe, Tsuyoshi; Ohashi, Yasuo; Hishida, Akira",Clin Exp Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3824297/,147

12469,A natural food sweetener with anti-pancreatic cancer properties,2017-04-10,"INTRODUCTION: Over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are among the most widely used, and having a good understanding of their safety profile is important to public health. Prior observational studies estimating the risks associated with paracetamol use acknowledge the inherent limitations of these studies. One threat to the validity of observational studies is channeling bias, i.e. the notion that patients are systematically exposed to one drug or the other, based on current and past comorbidities, in a manner that affects estimated relative risk. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether evidence of channeling bias exists in observational studies that compare paracetamol with ibuprofen, and, if so, the extent to which confounding adjustment can mitigate this bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a cohort of 140,770 patients, we examined whether those who received any paracetamol (including concomitant users) were more likely to have prior diagnoses of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or renal disease than those who received ibuprofen alone. We compared propensity score distributions between drugs, and examined the degree to which channeling bias could be controlled using a combination of negative control disease outcome models and large-scale propensity score matching. Analyses were conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. RESULTS: The proportions of prior MI, GI bleeding, renal disease, and stroke were significantly higher in those prescribed any paracetamol versus ibuprofen alone, after adjusting for sex and age. We were not able to adequately remove selection bias using a selected set of covariates for propensity score adjustment; however, when we fit the propensity score model using a substantially larger number of covariates, evidence of residual bias was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Although using selected covariates for propensity score adjustment may not sufficiently reduce bias, large-scale propensity score matching offers a novel approach to consider to mitigate the effects of channeling bias.

12476,DNA methylation in ELOVL2 and C1orf132 correctly predicted chronological age of individuals from three disease groups,2017-07-19,"Sexual assault is a serious offense and identification of body fluids originating from sexual activity has been a crucial aspect of forensic investigations for a long time. While reliable tests for the detection of semen and saliva have been successfully implemented into forensic laboratories, the detection of other body fluids, such as vaginal or menstrual fluid, is more challenging. Especially, the discrimination between peripheral and menstrual blood can be highly relevant for police investigations because it provides potential evidence regarding the issue of consent. We report the forensic validation of an immunochromatographic test that allows for such discrimination in forensic stains, the SERATEC PMB test, and its performance on real casework samples. The PMB test is a duplex test combining human hemoglobin and D-dimer detection and was developed for the identification of blood and menstrual fluid, both at the crime scene and in the laboratory. The results of this study showed that the duplex D-dimer/hemoglobin assay reliably detects the presence of human hemoglobin and identifies samples containing menstrual fluid by detecting the presence of D-dimers. The method distinguished between menstrual and peripheral blood in a swab from a historical artifact and in real casework samples of alleged sexual assaults. Results show that the development of the new duplex test is a substantial progress towards analyzing and interpreting evidence from sexual assault cases.

12497,Postmortem proteomics to discover biomarkers for forensic PMI estimation,2019-03-12,"The present investigation was performed with the objective of developing a method to estimate how long a corpse had been immersed in water after death (the time since death). Accurate determination of the time elapsed since death may lead to identification of the place of drowning, and therefore, serves not only as a piece of information useful for determination of the cause of death but also leads to prompt identification of the body. The results showed that diatoms attached to the surface of dental enamel increased with prolongation of immersion time in water. Further, as the immersion time increased, the quantity of O, Si, Mg, K, Al, and S detected on the surface of dental enamel increased, while the quantity of the main dental components (Ca and P) that were detected gradually decreased. Based on these results, we calculated a regression formula to estimate the immersion time. Our method is considered to be a breakthrough technique for evaluating the time since death more objectively, compared to the conventional method of determination based on the degree of decomposition of the corpse.","Ishikawa, Noboru; Miake, Yasuo; Kitamura, Kei; Yamamoto, Hitoshi",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6706365/,147

As the latest generation of genome-editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9 system makes it possible to enhance the expression of PBD-2 in pigs by site-specific knock-in of pbd-2 gene into the pig genome. In this study, we aimed to generate marker-free pbd-2 knock-in pigs using the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/loxP systems. Two copies of pbd-2 gene linked by a T2A sequence were inserted into the porcine Rosa26 locus through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair. The floxed selectable marker gene neoR, used for G418 screening of positive cell clones, was removed by cell-penetrating Cre recombinase with a recombination efficiency of 48.3%. Cloned piglets were produced via somatic cell nuclear transfer and correct insertion of pbd-2 genes was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses indicated that expression levels of PBD-2 in different tissues of transgenic (TG) piglets were significantly higher than those of their wild-type (WT) littermates. Bactericidal assays demonstrated that there was a significant increase in the antimicrobial properties of the cell culture supernatants of porcine ear fibroblasts from the TG pigs in comparison to those from the WT pigs. Altogether, our study improved the protein expression level of PBD-2 in pigs by site-specific integration of pbd-2 into the pig genome, which not only provided an effective pig model to study the anti-infection mechanisms of PBD-2 but also a promising genetic material for the breeding of disease-resistant pigs.","Huang, Jing; Wang, Antian; Huang, Chao; Sun, Yufan; Song, Bingxiao; Zhou, Rui; Li, Lu",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465224/,147

However, by the fourth decade of life, all individuals with DS develop neuropathology identical to that found in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles due to hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, loss of neurons and synapses, reduced neurogenesis, enhanced oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. It has been proposed that DS could be a useful model for studying the etiopathology of AD and to search for therapeutic targets. There is increasing evidence that the neuropathological events associated with AD are interrelated and that many of them not only are implicated in the onset of this pathology but are also a consequence of other alterations. Thus, a feedback mechanism exists between them. In this review, we summarize the signalling pathways implicated in each of the main neuropathological aspects of AD in individuals with and without DS as well as the interrelation of these pathways.","Martínez-Cué, Carmen; Rueda, Noemí",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555886/,147

Although easily diagnosed, its pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing identified distinct cellular states, novel biomarkers, and signaling pathways — including mTOR, associated with extramammary PD. Interestingly, we identified MSI1 ectopic overexpression in basal epithelial cells of human PD skin, and show that Msi1 overexpression in the epidermal basal layer of mice phenocopies human PD at histopathological, single-cell and molecular levels. Using this mouse model, we identified novel biomarkers of Paget-like cells that translated to human Paget cells. Furthermore, single-cell trajectory, RNA velocity and lineage-tracing analyses revealed a putative keratinocyte-to-Paget-like cell conversion, supporting the in situ transformation theory of disease pathogenesis. Mechanistically, the Msi1-mTOR pathway drives keratinocyte-Paget-like cell conversion, and suppression of mTOR signaling with Rapamycin significantly rescued the Paget-like phenotype in Msi1-overexpressing transgenic mice. Topical Rapamycin treatment improved extramammary PD-associated symptoms in humans, suggesting mTOR inhibition as a novel therapeutic treatment in PD.","Song, Yongli; Guerrero-Juarez, Christian F.; Chen, Zhongjian; Tang, Yichen; Ma, Xianghui; Lv, Cong; Bi, Xueyun; Deng, Min; Bu, Lina; Tian, Yuhua; Liu, Ruiqi; Zhao, Ran; Xu, Jiuzhi; Sheng, Xiaole; Du, Sujuan; Liu, Yeqiang; Zhu, Yunlu; Shan, Shi-jun; Chen, Hong-duo; Zhao, Yiqiang; Zhou, Guangbiao; Shuai, Jianwei; Ren, Fazheng; Xue, Lixiang; Ying, Zhaoxia; Dai, Xing; Lengner, Christopher J.; Andersen, Bogi; Plikus, Maksim V.; Nie, Qing; Yu, Zhengquan",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608215/,147

A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Embase for studies published from inception to 01/07/2019. Studies were analysed according to the training modality: virtual reality; wet-lab; dry-lab models; e-learning. The educational impact of studies was evaluated using Messick’s validity framework and McGaghie’s model of translational outcomes for evaluating effectiveness. One hundred and thirty-one studies were included in this review, with 93 different simulators described. Fifty-three studies were based on virtual reality tools; 47 on wet-lab models; 26 on dry-lab models; 5 on e-learning. Only two studies provided evidence for all five sources of validity assessment. Models with the strongest validity evidence were the Eyesi Surgical, Eyesi Direct Ophthalmoscope and Eye Surgical Skills Assessment Test.

A wide range of models have been described but only the Eyesi has undergone comprehensive investigation. The main weakness is in the poor quality of study design, with a predominance of descriptive reports showing limited validity evidence and few studies investigating the effects of simulation training on patient outcomes.

The dynamics of ligand binding to ions of transition metals falls within the realm of Coordination Chemistry, and it provides the basic principles controlling traffic, regulation, and use of metals in cells. Yet, the cellular environment stands out against the conditions prevailing in the test tube when studying metal ions and their interactions with various ligands. Indeed, the complex and often changing cellular environment stimulates fast metal–ligand exchange that mostly escapes presently available probing methods. Reducing the complexity of the problem with purified proteins or in model organisms, although useful, is not free from pitfalls and misleading results. These problems arise mainly from the absence of the biosynthetic machinery and accessory proteins or chaperones dealing with metal / metal groups in cells. Even cells struggle with metal selectivity, as they do not have a metal-directed quality control system for metalloproteins, and serendipitous metal binding is probably not exceptional. The issue of metal exchange in biology is reviewed with particular reference to iron and illustrating examples in patho-physiology, regulation, nutrition, and toxicity.","Moulis, Jean-Marc",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700505/,147

METHODS: We use high-quality population wide Scottish data to calculate directly age-standardized mortality rates for men aged 15–44 between 1980 and 2018 for 15 leading causes of mortality. Absolute and relative inequalities in mortality by cause are calculated using small-area deprivation and the slope and relative indices of inequality (SII and RII(L)) for the years 2001–2018. RESULTS: Since 1980 there have been only small reductions in mortality among men aged 15–44 in Scotland. In that period drug-related deaths have increased from 1.2 (95% CI 0.7–1.4) to 44.9 (95% CI 42.5–47.4) deaths per 100,000 and are now the leading cause of mortality. Between 2001 and 2018 there have been small reductions in absolute but not in relative inequalities in all-cause mortality. However, absolute inequalities in mortality from drugs have doubled from SII = 66.6 (95% CI 61.5–70.9) in 2001–2003 to SII = 120.0 (95% CI 113.3–126.8) in 2016–2018. Drugs are the main contributor to inequalities in mortality, and together with alcohol harm and suicides make up 65% of absolute inequalities in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the substantial reductions in mortality across all ages in the past decades, deaths among young men are increasing from preventable causes. Attempts to reduce external causes of mortality have focused on a single cause of death and not been effective in reducing mortality or inequalities in mortality from external causes in the long-run. To reduce deaths of despair, action should be taken to address social determinants of health and reduce socioeconomic inequalities.

14362,3-Dimensional objective aesthetic evaluation to replace panel assessment after breast-conserving treatment,2020-06-19,"Transient exposures are difficult to measure in epidemiologic studies, especially when both the status of being at risk for an outcome and the exposure change over time and space, as when measuring built-environment risk on transportation injury. Contemporary “big data” generated by mobile sensors can improve measurement of transient exposures. Exposure information generated by these devices typically only samples the experience of the target cohort, so a case-control framework may be useful. However, for anonymity, the data may not be available by individual, precluding a case–crossover approach. We present a method called at-risk-measure sampling. Its goal is to estimate the denominator of an incidence rate ratio (exposed to unexposed measure of the at-risk experience) given an aggregated summary of the at-risk measure from a cohort. Rather than sampling individuals or locations, the method samples the measure of the at-risk experience. Specifically, the method as presented samples person–distance and person–events summarized by location. It is illustrated with data from a mobile app used to record bicycling. The method extends an established case–control sampling principle: sample the at-risk experience of a cohort study such that the sampled exposure distribution approximates that of the cohort. It is distinct from density sampling in that the sample remains in the form of the at-risk measure, which may be continuous, such as person–time or person–distance. This aspect may be both logistically and statistically efficient if such a sample is already available, for example from big-data sources like aggregated mobile-sensor data.","Garber, Michael D.; McCullough, Lauren E.; Mooney, Stephen J.; Kramer, Michael R.; Watkins, Kari E.; Lobelo, R.L.

The many unwanted side effects associated with this treatment have led to increased interest in minimising the accumulated corticosteroid dose necessary to treat exacerbations. Studies have shown that short-term treatment with corticosteroids is preferred, and recent trials have shown that biomarkers can be used to further reduce exposure to corticosteroids. Interestingly, high eosinophil counts in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD are indicative of an eosinophilic phenotype with a distinct response to treatment with corticosteroids. In addition, post-hoc analysis of randomised control trials have shown that higher blood eosinophil counts at the start of the study predict a greater response to inhaled corticosteroids in stable COPD. In this review, we examine the studies on this topic, describe how blood eosinophil cell count may be used as a biomarker to guide treatment with corticosteroids, and identify some relevant challenges.","Sivapalan, Pradeesh; Bikov, András; Jensen, Jens-Ulrik",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913607/,147

Each task replicates activities of daily living performed in a familiar environment. The main goal of the present study was to ascertain whether Smart Aging could differentiate between different types and levels of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29 ± 7.70 years)—healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)—were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients. Finally, the Smart Aging scores significantly correlated with the results of the neuropsychological assessments used. Conclusion: These findings, although preliminary due to the small sample size, suggest the validity of Smart Aging as a screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.","Bottiroli, Sara; Bernini, Sara; Cavallini, Elena; Sinforiani, Elena; Zucchella, Chiara; Pazzi, Stefania; Cristiani, Paolo; Vecchi, Tomaso; Tost, Daniela; Sandrini, Giorgio; Tassorelli, Cristina",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005545/,147

Previous agenda-setting studies share two shortfalls: they only account for direct connections between academic institutions and firms, as well as potential bias based on researchers’ personal beliefs. This paper’s goal is to determine the key actors and contents of the prevailing health and biomedical sciences (HBMS) research agenda, overcoming these shortfalls. METHODS: We performed a bibliometric and lexical analysis of 95,415 scientific articles published between 1999 and 2018 in the highest impact factor journals within HBMS, using the Web of Science database and the CorText platform. HBMS’s prevailing knowledge network of institutions was proxied with network maps where nodes represent affiliations and edges the most frequent co-authorships. The content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda was depicted through network maps of prevalent multi-terms found in titles, keywords, and abstracts. RESULTS: The HBMS research agendas of large private firms and leading academic institutions are intertwined. The prevailing HBMS agenda is mostly based on molecular biology (40% of the most frequent multi-terms), with an inclination towards cancer and cardiovascular research (15 and 8% of the most frequent multi-terms, respectively). Studies on pathogens and biological vectors related to recent epidemics are marginal (1% of the most frequent multi-terms). Content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda prioritizes research on pharmacological intervention over research on socio-environmental factors influencing disease onset or progression and overlooks, among others, the study of infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical corporations contribute to set HBMS’s prevailing research agenda, which is mainly focused on a few diseases and research topics. A more balanced research agenda, together with epistemological approaches that consider socio-environmental factors associated with disease spreading, could contribute to being better prepared to prevent and treat more diverse pathologies and to improve overall health outcomes.","Testoni, Federico E.; García Carrillo, Mercedes; Gagnon, Marc-André; Rikap, Cecilia; Blaustein, Matías",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8026021/,147

Many research investigations documented the usefulness of US in a wide range of applications in food science, nanotechnology, and complementary medicine, where effective extraction of natural products is important. However, as with all novel technologies, US has advantages and limitations that require clarification for full adaptation at an industrial scale. The present review discusses recent applications of US in herbal phytochemistry with the emphasis on US effects on chemical structures of bioactive compounds extracted from herbs and their bioactivities. The impact of different US processing conditions such as frequency, intensity, duration, temperature, and pressure on the effectiveness of the extraction process and the properties of the extracted materials are also discussed. Different frequencies and intensities of US have demonstrated its potential applications in modifying, determining, and predicting the physicochemical properties of herbs and their extracts. US has important applications in nanotechnology where it supports the fabrication of inexpensive and eco-friendly herbal nanostructures, as well as acoustic-based biosensors for chemical imaging of the herbal tissues. The application of US enhances the rates of chemical processes such as hydrolysis of herbal fibers, which reduces the time and energy consumed without affecting the quality of the final products. Overall, the use of US in herbal science has great potential to create novel chemical constructions and to be used as an innovative diagnostic system in various biomedical, food, and analytical applications.","Gouda, Mostafa; El-Din Bekhit, Alaa; Tang, Yu; Huang, Yifeng; Huang, Lingxia; He, Yong; Li, Xiaoli",Ultrason Sonochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048006/,147

Although a potential association between FeMV infection and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been suggested, this has not been proven, and the subject remains controversial. TIN is the most frequent histopathological finding in the context of feline chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is one of the major clinical pathologies in feline medicine. FeMV research has mainly focused on defining the epidemiology, the role of FeMV in the development of CKD, and its in vitro tropism, but the pathogenicity of FeMV is still not clear, partly due to its distinctive biological characteristics, as well as to a lack of a cell culture system for its rapid isolation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of FeMV infection, including genetic diversity of FeMV strains, epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinicopathological findings observed in naturally infected cats.","De Luca, Eliana; Sautto, Giuseppe Andrea; Crisi, Paolo Emidio; Lorusso, Alessio",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071394/,147

17253,Effect of diurnal temperature range on emergency room visits for acute upper respiratory tract infections,2021-05-03,"Viruses, including members of the herpes-, entero-, and morbillivirus families, are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis in mammals worldwide. During most instances of acute viral encephalitis, neurons are typically the initial cell type that is infected. However, as replication and spread ensue, other parenchymal cells can become viral targets, especially in chronic infections. Consequently, to ascertain how neurotropic viruses trigger neuropathology, it is crucial to identify which central nervous system (CNS) cell populations are susceptible and permissive throughout the course of infection, and to define how viruses spread between distinct cell types. Using a measles virus (MV) transgenic mouse model that expresses human CD46 (hCD46), the MV vaccine strain receptor, under the control of a neuron-specific enolase promoter (NSE-hCD46(+) mice), a novel mode of viral spread between neurons and astrocytes was identified. Although hCD46 is required for initial neuronal infection, it is dispensable for heterotypic spread to astrocytes, which instead depends on glutamate transporters and direct neuron-astrocyte contact. Moreover, in the presence of RNase A, astrocyte infection is reduced, suggesting that nonenveloped ribonucleoproteins (RNP) may cross the neuron-astrocyte synaptic cleft. The characterization of this novel mode of intercellular transport offers insights into the unique interaction of neurons and glia and may reveal therapeutic targets to mitigate the life-threatening consequences of measles encephalitis.","Poelaert, Katrien C.

17731,Exploring the Mechanism of Zhibai Dihuang Decoction in the Treatment of Ureaplasma Urealyticum-Induced Orchitis Based on Integrated Pharmacology,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. OBJECTIVES: To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and 2. entomological outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing. Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 751 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 652 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 948 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 948 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1022 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1022 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Gleave, Katherine; Lissenden, Natalie; Chaplin, Marty; Choi, Leslie; Ranson, Hilary",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8142305/,147
17798,HIF-α Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors and Their Implications for Biomedicine: A Comprehensive Review,2021-04-24,"The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of nucleated human cells has crucial functions in protein biogenesis, calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis, and signal transduction. Among the roughly one hundred components, which are involved in protein import and protein folding or assembly, two components stand out: The Sec61 complex and BiP. The Sec61 complex in the ER membrane represents the major entry point for precursor polypeptides into the membrane or lumen of the ER and provides a conduit for Ca(2+) ions from the ER lumen to the cytosol. The second component, the Hsp70-type molecular chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, short BiP, plays central roles in protein folding and assembly (hence its name), protein import, cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and various intracellular signal transduction pathways. For the purpose of this review, we focus on these two components, their relevant allosteric effectors and on the question of how their respective functional cycles are linked in order to reconcile the apparently contradictory features of the ER membrane, selective permeability for precursor polypeptides, and impermeability for Ca(2+). The key issues are that the Sec61 complex exists in two conformations: An open and a closed state that are in a dynamic equilibrium with each other, and that BiP contributes to its gating in both directions in cooperation with different co-chaperones. While the open Sec61 complex forms an aqueous polypeptide-conducting- and transiently Ca(2+)-permeable channel, the closed complex is impermeable even to Ca(2+). Therefore, we discuss the human hereditary and tumor diseases that are linked to Sec61 channel gating, termed Sec61-channelopathies, as disturbances of selective polypeptide-impermeability and/or aberrant Ca(2+)-permeability.","Sicking, Mark; Lang, Sven; Bochen, Florian; Roos, Andreas; Drenth, Joost P.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between quality of sleep and heart rate variability (HRV) among female nurses. A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study design was used in January 2014 to study female nurses (n = 393) employed in a medical center in Taiwan. Data were obtained from several questionnaires. HRV was analyzed with five-minute recordings of heart rate signals obtained using a Heart Rater SA-3000P. Approximately 96% of the participants self-reported a poor quality of sleep. Compared to non-shift nurses, significant decreases were found in total power (TP) and low-frequency HRV among shift-work nurses. However, negative correlations were found between sleep quality and HRV, including total power, low frequency, and the low frequency/high frequency ratio (r = −0.425, p < 0.05; r = −0.269, −0.266, p < 0.05). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, 23.1% of variance in quality of sleep can be explained by TP and heart rate. The sleep quality of female nurses was poor and this affected their autonomic nervous system, which can contribute unfavorable consequences for their health.","Hsu, Hsiu-Chin; Lee, Hsiu-Fang; Lin, Mei-Hsiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196961/,147

However, less is known on the impact of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life (QoL). The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of postoperative complications on long-term QoL and survival after CABG surgery. METHODS: Data of 508 patients, who underwent isolated CABG was prospectively collected. The RAND-36 Health Survey (RAND-36) was used to evaluate patients’ QoL status preoperatively, 1 year and 12 years after the surgery. Predefined postoperative complications were reported during primary and secondary hospital stay. QoL and survival analysis were performed primarily on three patient groups: patients with and without complications and patients with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: In total 205(40%) of 508 patients had at least one postoperative complication and 73 (14%) experienced MACCE. Patients’ thirty-day, 1-year and 10-year survival rates were, 99, 98, 84% without complications, 97, 95, 72% with complications, and 90, 89, 64% with MACCE, respectively (log-rank p < 0.001). Patients without complications showed significant(p < 0.05) improvements in seven and patients with complications in five out of eight RAND-36 QoL dimensions. All patient groups showed significant improvements in RAND-36 summary scores compared with preoperative values. Patients with complications and especially with MACCE had more profound decline in their RAND-36 summary scores while patients without complications maintained their health status best. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the constant deterioration, both patients with and without complications showed improvements even 12 years after CABG compared with preoperative state. Postoperative complications and especially MACCE were associated with impaired long-term QoL.","Hokkanen, Matti; Huhtala, Heini; Laurikka, Jari; Järvinen, Otso",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8200795/,147

Due to the widespread use of modified live vaccines to control canine adenoviral infections and subsequently reduced disease incidence, CAVs are often neglected by clinicians. Although a number of studies are available about CAV-1 prevalence in India, only meagre information is available about CAV-2. This study reports the CAV-2 infection in a vaccinated dog with neurological and respiratory symptoms which was found negative for other canine pathogens like canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. The virus was successfully isolated from rectal swab in MDCK cells and characterized by immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralization test. On phylogenetic analysis of partial E3 region, the Indian CAV-2 grouped in a separate clade different from established subgroups. An insertion of “G” nucleotide was reported at nucleotide (nt.) position 1077 in the E3 gene of Indian CAV-2 isolates which led to a frameshift in the coding region of E3 gene thereby imparting additional eleven amino acids to its C-terminal end in comparison to isolates from other parts of the world. This may have an implication on the functional role of E3 protein inside the cell. This study reinforces the unique signature insertion in the E3 gene of Indian CAV-2 and is the second study in the world to report the association of CAV-2 with neurological disease in dogs.","Chander, Vishal; Sharma, G.

18466,Anti-Cancer and Immunomodulatory Activity of a Polyethylene Glycol-Betulinic Acid Conjugate on Pancreatic Cancer Cells,2021-05-21,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the simplest and most common type of DNA variations in the human genome. This class of attractive genetic markers, along with point mutations, have been associated with the risk of developing a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Several existing methods to detect SNPs and mutations in body fluids have faced limitations. Therefore, there is a need to focus on developing noninvasive future polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–free tools to detect low-abundant SNPs in such specimens. The detection of small concentrations of SNPs in the presence of a large background of wild-type genes is the biggest hurdle. Hence, the screening and detection of SNPs need efficient and straightforward strategies. Suitable amplification methods are being explored to avoid high-throughput settings and laborious efforts. Therefore, currently, DNA sensing methods are being explored for the ultrasensitive detection of SNPs based on the concept of nanotechnology. Owing to their small size and improved surface area, nanomaterials hold the extensive capacity to be used as biosensors in the genotyping and highly sensitive recognition of single-base mismatch in the presence of incomparable wild-type DNA fragments. Different nanomaterials have been combined with imaging and sensing techniques and amplification methods to facilitate the less time-consuming and easy detection of SNPs in different diseases. This review aims to highlight some of the most recent findings on the aspects of nanotechnology-based SNP sensing methods used for the specific and ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration SNPs and rare mutations.","Mukhtar, Mahwash; Sargazi, Saman; Barani, Mahmood; Madry, Henning; Rahdar, Abbas; Cucchiarini, Magali",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225127/,147
18478,"let-7 microRNAs: Their Role in Cerebral and Cardiovascular Diseases, Inflammation, Cancer, and Their Regulation",2021-05-26,"Human enteric viruses such as norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are some of the most important causes of foodborne infections worldwide. Usually, infection via fish consumption is not a concern regarding these viruses, since fish are mainly consumed cooked. However, in the last years, raw fish consumption has become increasingly common, especially involving the use of seabass and gilthead seabream in dishes like sushi, sashimi, poke, and carpaccio. Therefore, the risk for viral infection via the consumption of raw fish has also increased. In this study, a virologic screening was performed in 323 fish specimens captured along the Portuguese coast using a tetraplex qPCR optimised for two templates (plasmid and in vitro transcribed RNA) to detect and quantify NoV GI, NoV GII and HAV genomes. A difference of approximately 1-log was found between the use of plasmid or in vitro transcribed RNA for molecular-based quantifications, showing an underestimation of genome copy-number equivalents using plasmid standard-based curves. Additionally, the presence of NoV genomic RNA in a pool of seabass brains was identified, which was shown to cluster with a major group of human norovirus sequences from genogroup I (GI.1) by phylogenetic analysis. None of the analysed fish revealed the presence of NoV GII or HAV. This result corroborates the hypothesis that enteric viruses circulate in seawater or that fish were contaminated during their transportation/handling, representing a potential risk to humans through raw or undercooked fish consumption.","Filipa-Silva, Andreia; Nunes, Mónica; Parreira, Ricardo; Barreto Crespo, Maria Teresa",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227966/,147

It adopts the basic architecture of a U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net), analyses the actual application scenarios of semantic segmentation of breast ultrasound images, and adds dropout layers to the U-Net architecture to reduce the redundancy in texture details and prevent overfitting. The main innovation of this paper is proposing an expanded training approach to obtain an expanded of U-Net. The output map of the expanded U-Net can retain texture details and edge features of breast tumours. Using the grey-level probability labels to train the U-Net is faster than using ordinary labels. The average Dice coefficient (standard deviation) and the average IOU coefficient (standard deviation) are 90.5% (±0.02) and 82.7% (±0.02), respectively, when using the expanded training approach. The Dice coefficient of the expanded U-Net is 7.6 larger than that of a general U-Net, and the IOU coefficient of the expanded U-Net is 11 larger than that of the general U-Net. The context of breast ultrasound images can be extracted, and texture details and edge features of tumours can be retained by the expanded U-Net. Using an expanded U-Net can quickly and automatically achieve precise segmentation and multi-class recognition of breast ultrasound images.","Guo, Yanjun; Duan, Xingguang; Wang, Chengyi; Guo, Huiqin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205136/,147

VNN causes damage of necrosis and vacuolation to central nervous system (CNS) cells in fish. It is difficult to identify the specific type of cell targeted by NNV, and to decipher the host immune response because of the functional diversity and highly complex anatomical and cellular composition of the CNS. In this study, we found that the red spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV) mainly attacked the midbrain of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). We conducted single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the midbrain of healthy and RGNNV-infected fish and identified 35 transcriptionally distinct cell subtypes, including 28 neuronal and 7 non-neuronal cell types. An evaluation of the subpopulations of immune cells revealed that macrophages were enriched in RGNNV-infected fish, and the transcriptional profiles of macrophages indicated an acute cytokine and inflammatory response. Unsupervised pseudotime analysis of immune cells showed that microglia transformed into M1-type activated macrophages to produce cytokines to reduce the damage to nerve tissue caused by the virus. We also found that RGNNV targeted neuronal cell types was GLU1 and GLU3, and we found that the key genes and pathways by which causes cell cytoplasmic vacuoles and autophagy significant enrichment, this may be the major route viruses cause cell death. These data provided a comprehensive transcriptional perspective of the grouper midbrain and the basis for further research on how viruses infect the teleost CNS.","Wang, Qing; Peng, Cheng; Yang, Min; Huang, Fengqi; Duan, Xuzhuo; Wang, Shaowen; Cheng, Huitao; Yang, Huirong; Zhao, Huihong; Qin, Qiwei",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241073/,147

We conducted the world's first remote catheter surgery experiment using an endovascular treatment-supported robot. We considered the results, examined the issues, and suggested countermeasures for practical use. METHODS: The slave robot in the angiography room is an original machine that enables sensing feedback by using an originally developed insertion force-measuring device, which detects the pressure stress on the vessel wall and alerts the operator using an audible scale. The master side was set in a separate room. They were connected via HTTP communication using local area network system. The surgeon operated by looking at a personal computer monitor that shared an angiography monitor. The slave robot catheterized and inserted a coil for an aneurysm in the silicon blood vessel model in the angiography room. RESULTS: Our robot responded to the surgeon's operations promptly and to the joystick's swift movements quite accurately. The surgeon could control the stress to the model vessels using various actions, because the operator could hear the sound from the insertion force. However, the robot required a time gradient to reach a stable advanced speed at the time of the initial movement, and experienced a slight time lag. CONCLUSION: Our remote operation appeared to be sufficiently feasible to perform the surgery safely. This system seems extremely promising for preventing viral infection and radiation exposure to medical staff. It will also enable medical professionals to operate in remote areas and create a ubiquitous medical environment.","Miyachi, Shigeru; Nagano, Yoshitaka; Kawaguchi, Reo; Ohshima, Tomotaka; Tadauchi, Hiroki",Asian J Neurosurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244710/,147

A semi-parametric approach was applied, suggesting variations in mortality patterns between sexes in the Roman period. Nitrogen isotopic signatures influenced mortality in both periods, showing a quadratic and a linear effect for Roman Imperial and Medieval populations, respectively. No influence of carbon isotopic signatures has been detected for Roman Imperial populations. Conversely, increased mortality risk for rising carbon isotopic values was observed in Medieval samples.","Baldoni, Marica; Nardi, Alessandra; De Angelis, Flavio; Rickards, Olga; Martínez-Labarga, Cristina",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271375/,147

Current treatment does not eradicate disease, and therefore new treatments are urgently needed. In acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) a strong immune response is necessary to clear the virus, but in chronic infection the immune response is weakened and dysfunctional. Therapeutic vaccination describes the process of inoculating individuals with a non‐infective form of viral antigen with the aim of inducing or boosting existing HBV‐specific immune responses, resulting in sustained control of HBV infection. In this review we outline the rationale for therapeutic vaccination in chronic HBV infection, discuss previous and ongoing trials of novel HBV therapeutic vaccine candidates and outline strategies to improve vaccine efficacy going forward.","Cargill, Tamsin; Barnes, Eleanor",Clin Exp Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8274149/,147

The effects of this crisis on people using opioids, maternal prenatal opioid exposure, and neonatal abstinence syndrome are well-documented, but less is known about the impact of caregivers' opioid use on children's health and well-being. One challenge to understanding the effects of parental opioid use disorder (OUD) on child and adolescent outcomes is the numerous interrelated pathways in which a child's health and well-being can be impacted. To better understand these dynamic relationships, we applied a systems mapping approach to visualize complex patterns and interactions between pathways and potential leverage points for interventions. Specifically, we developed a causal loop diagram system map to elucidate the complex and interconnected relationships between parental OUD, social determinants of health at the family and socio-environmental levels, family strengths, social supports, and possible adverse impacts on children's physical and mental health and risks for future substance misuse. The goals of this research are to (1) identify factors and dynamics that contribute to the relationship between parental OUD and children's health and well-being and (2) illustrate how systems mapping as a tool can aid in understanding the complex factors and dynamics of the system(s) that influence the well-being of children and their parents or primary caregivers.","Smith, Jessica C.; Alderman, Leigh; Attell, Brandon K.; Avila Rodriguez, Wendy; Covington, Jana; Manteuffel, Brigitte; DiGirolamo, Ann M.; Snyder, Susan M.; Minyard, Karen",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275850/,147

It is a very challenging disease, representing an important cause of morbidity, hospitalization and death in the elderly population. It is widely recognized that AS is the result of a very complex active process, driven by inflammation and involving multifactorial pathological mechanisms promoting valvular calcification and valvular bone deposition. Several evidence suggest that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of the heart, represents a direct source of cytokines and could mediate the deleterious effects of systemic inflammation on the myocardium. Importantly, obesity and metabolic disorders are associated with chronic systemic inflammation leading to a significant increase of EAT amount and to a pro-inflammatory phenotypic shift of this fat depot. It has been hypothesized that the EAT inflammatory state can influence the structure and function of the heart, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of several cardiac diseases, including calcific AS. The current review will discuss the recently discovered mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AS, with particular attention to the role of inflammation, metabolic risk factors and pro-fibrotic and pro-osteogenic signal pathways promoting the onset and progression of the disease. Moreover, it will be explored the potential role of EAT in the AS pathophysiology.","Conte, Maddalena; Petraglia, Laura; Campana, Pasquale; Gerundo, Gerardo; Caruso, Aurelio; Grimaldi, Maria Gabriella; Russo, Vincenzo; Attena, Emilio; Leosco, Dario; Parisi, Valentina",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249252/,147

We found common increases in myeloid cell-defining gene sets and decreases in genes controlling glucose and lipid metabolism in lupus-affected skin and kidney. Regression models in DLE indicated increased glycolysis was correlated with keratinocyte, endothelial, and inflammatory cell transcripts, and decreased tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle genes were correlated with the keratinocyte signature. In LN, regression models demonstrated decreased glycolysis and TCA cycle genes were correlated with increased endothelial or decreased kidney cell transcripts, respectively. Less severe glomerular LN exhibited similar alterations in metabolism and tissue cell transcripts before monocyte/myeloid cell infiltration in some patients. Additionally, changes to mitochondrial and peroxisomal transcripts were associated with specific cells rather than global signal changes. Examination of murine LN gene expression demonstrated metabolic changes were not driven by acute exposure to type I interferon and could be restored after immunosuppression. Finally, expression of HAVCR1, a tubule damage marker, was negatively correlated with the TCA cycle signature in LN models. These results indicate that altered metabolic dysfunction is a common, reversible change in lupus-affected tissues and appears to reflect damage downstream of immunologic processes.","Kingsmore, Kathryn M.; Bachali, Prathyusha; Catalina, Michelle D.; Daamen, Andrea R.; Heuer, Sarah E.; Robl, Robert D.; Grammer, Amrie C.; Lipsky, Peter E.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8292402/,147

This paper explores the dynamics of rabies cases in humans, pets (dogs and cats), livestock and wildlife (bats in particular) in South America during the period 2009–2018. The data used in this study were derived from the two main databases for rabies in South America: the OIE-WAHIS from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and PANAFTOSA’s Regional Information System for the Epidemiological Surveillance of Rabies (SIRVERA). Being a neglected disease with possible underreporting in some areas, the reported rabies cases may not always represent the real disease burden. The analysis focuses on the evolution of the number of cases in time and their spatial distribution, as well as on the main source of infections in humans, determined by laboratory assays of the antigenic variant or through epidemiological investigations. Additionally, Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to evaluate the risk factors associated with the occurrence of human cases. Our results show that the highest impact of the disease in terms of number of cases was reported on livestock, while the overall number of cases (in animals and humans) progressively decreased along the study period. The spatial distribution of rabies in livestock showed two main clusters in the north-western (mainly Colombia) and in the south-eastern part of the affected area (Brazil), and a third smaller cluster in Peru. A cluster in dogs was observed in Bolivia. Out of the 192 human cases reported during the study period, 70% of them were transmitted by bats. The number of human cases reported during the study period were significantly associated with the number of rabies cases reported in livestock, pets and wildlife. Despite the overall decreasing case report rate, the disease still represents a major animal and public health concern in South America, and new strategies for compiling systematic information, networking and education are needed, as well as the education and training of veterinary staff.","Meske, Mauro; Fanelli, Angela; Rocha, Felipe; Awada, Lina; Soto, Paula Caceres; Mapitse, Neo; Tizzani, Paolo",Trop Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293400/,147

However, their efficiency with protein antigens remains unclear. In the current study, the candidate antigen PA0833 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was fused to the α-hemolysin mutant Hla(H35A) from Staphylococcus aureus to form a Hla(H35A)-PA0833 fusion protein (HPF). Immunization with HPF resulted in increased PA0833-specific antibody titers, higher protective efficacy, and decreased bacterial burden and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion compared with PA0833 immunization alone. Using fluorescently labeled antigens to track antigen uptake and delivery, we found that Hla(H35A) fusion significantly improved antigen uptake in injected muscles and antigen delivery to draining lymph nodes. Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the increased antigen uptake after immunization with HPF was mainly due to monocyte- and macrophage-dependent macropinocytosis, which was probably the result of HPF binding to ADAM10, the Hla host receptor. Furthermore, a transcriptome analysis showed that several immune signaling pathways were activated by HPF, shedding light on the mechanism whereby Hla(H35A) fusion improves immunogenicity. Finally, the improvement in immunogenicity by Hla(H35A) fusion was also confirmed with two other antigens, GlnH from Klebsiella pneumoniae and the model antigen OVA, indicating that Hla(H35A) could serve as a universal carrier protein to improve the immunogenicity of protein antigens.","Zou, Jin-Tao; Jing, Hai-Ming; Yuan, Yue; Lei, Lang-Huan; Chen, Zhi-Fu; Gou, Qiang; Xiong, Qing-Shan; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Zhao, Zhuo; Zhang, Xiao-Kai; Zeng, Hao; Zou, Quan-Ming; Zhang, Jin-Yong",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294524/,147

Leptospirosis is a spectrum with mild form presenting as an acute febrile illness with jaundice, complicating in few as acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The poor prognostic markers are hemorrhagic ARDS, acute renal failure, DIC, severe metabolic acidosis, older age, chronic alcohol abuse, high SOFA score, and septic shock. The confirmatory diagnosis relies on antibody testing, such as microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and IgM ELISA, while the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test being reserved for clinically suspected antibody negative cases. The spectrum of multi-organ involvement necessitates a complete hematological, biochemical workup, including electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and two-dimensional echocardiography.

We aimed to see if responses to therapies using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on day 4 after unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) could be associated with short-term mortality. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, data from 4 ICUs in a University Hospital included SOFA scores on admission and day 4, along with preadmission measurements of frailty, comorbidities, nutritional status and number of medications. Outcome measures included mortality and loss of autonomy on day 90 after admission. RESULTS: Eighty-seven critically ill patients aged 80 years or older with preadmission functional independence and no missing SOFA score data on day 4 were studied (primary analyses). The mortality rate on day 90 was 30%. In a univariate Cox model, the SOFA score on day 4 was significantly associated with mortality rate: hazard ratio = 1.18 per one-point increase, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08 to 1.28 (p<0.001). A SOFA score of 6 or more on day 4 could correctly classify 75% of patients who died on day 90, with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 84%. After adjustment, the SOFA score on day 4, neurological failure on admission and the number of preadmission medications were significantly associated with mortality on day 90, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91). These findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis with 109 patients. Preadmission frailty was the only variable independently associated with loss of autonomy in the 49 surviving patients. CONCLUSION: Measuring SOFA score on day 4 and preadmission frailty could help predict mortality and loss of autonomy on day 90 in octogenarians after their acute admission to the ICU.","Loyrion, Emmanuelle; Agier, Lydiane; Trouve-Buisson, Thibaut; Gavazzi, Gaetan; Schwebel, Carole; Bosson, Jean-Luc; Payen, Jean-François",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328283/,147

One of the aims of this nationwide survey in Germany was therefore to determine how intensive care physicians deal with these problems. METHODS: From October 2019 to May 2020, we conducted a nationwide survey among German medical directors of intensive care units (ICU) addressing anticoagulation and drug-based prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with sepsis and sepsis-induced coagulopathy. One focus was the procedure for patients with a pre-existing anticoagulation treatment or a previously known heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type 2 (acute symptomatic vs. dating back years). RESULTS: In most of the participating ICUs pre-existing anticoagulation is largely continued with low molecular weight heparin preparations or unfractionated heparin. In patients with pre-existing HIT type 2 both acute symptomatic and dating back years, argatroban represents the drug of choice. There is a high degree of variability in the definition of the target values, usually being well above the range for pure VTE prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Data on the continuation of anticoagulation beyond VTE prophylaxis with a subsequently increased risk of bleeding in patients with sepsis and septic shock is limited and treatment decisions are in many cases subject to individual consideration by the practitioner. The results of our survey imply the need for a systematic work-up of this topic in order to support daily practice in many ICUs with the required evidence.","Schmoch, Thomas; Brenner, Thorsten; Becker-Pennrich, Andrea; Hinske, Ludwig Christian; Weigand, Markus A.; Briegel, Josef; Möhnle, Patrick",Anaesthesist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8340811/,147

Modified proteins on the iRBC surface cause severe malaria, which can lead to death throughout the life cycle of a malaria parasite. Previous study suggested that SURFIN(1.1) is an immunogenic membrane-associated protein which was encoded by using the surf(1.1) gene expressed during the trophozoite and schizont stages. This study aimed to identify the regions of SURFIN(1.1) and investigate the genetic diversity of the extracellular region of the surf(1.1) gene. METHODS: A total of 32 blood samples from falciparum malaria cases that were diagnosed in Si Sa Ket Province, Thailand were collected. Plasmodium genomic DNA was extracted, and the extracellular region of surf(1.1) gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A sequence analysis was then performed to obtain the number of haplotypes (H), the haplotype diversity (Hd), and the segregating sites (S), while the average number of nucleotide differences between two sequences (Pi); in addition, neutrality testing, Tajima’s D test, Fu and Li’s D* and F* statistics was also performed. RESULTS: From a total of 32 patient-isolated samples, 31 DNA sequences were obtained and analysed for surf(1.1) gene extracellular region polymorphism.

The remaining haplotype (H4-H6) frequency was 3.2% for each haplotype. Hd was 0.598 ± 0.089 with the Pi of 0.00381, and S was 15. The most common amino acid polymorphic site was E251Q; other sites included N48D, I49V, E228D, E235S, L265F, K267T, E276Q, and S288F. Fu and Li’s D* test value was − 1.24255, Fu and Li’s F* test value was − 1.10175, indicating a tendency toward negative balancing selection acting on the surf(1.1) N-terminal region. The most polymorphic region was variable 2 (Var2) while cysteine-rich domain (CRD) was conserved in both the amino acid and nucleotide extracellular region of surf(1.1) gene. CONCLUSIONS: The Thai surf(1.1) N-terminal region was well-conserved with only a few polymorphic sites remaining. In this study, the data regarding current bearing on the polymorphism of extracellular region of surf(1.1) gene were reported, which might impact the biological roles of P. falciparum. In addition, may possibly serve as a suitable candidate for future development of SURFIN-based vaccines regarding malaria control.

20463,Thyroid Cancer: Toward Surgical Evolution,2021-08-14,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have recently developed beyond the research realm and started to mature into clinical applications. Here, we review the current use of NGS for laboratory diagnosis of fungal infections. Since the first reported case in 2014, >300 cases of fungal infections diagnosed by NGS were described. Pneumocystis jirovecii is the predominant fungus reported, constituting ~25% of the fungi detected. In ~12.5% of the cases, more than one fungus was detected by NGS. For P. jirovecii infections diagnosed by NGS, all 91 patients suffered from pneumonia and only 1 was HIV-positive. This is very different from the general epidemiology of P. jirovecii infections, of which HIV infection is the most important risk factor. The epidemiology of Talaromyces marneffei infection diagnosed by NGS is also different from its general epidemiology, in that only 3/11 patients were HIV-positive. The major advantage of using NGS for laboratory diagnosis is that it can pick up all pathogens, particularly when initial microbiological investigations are unfruitful. When the cost of NGS is further reduced, expertise more widely available and other obstacles overcome, NGS would be a useful tool for laboratory diagnosis of fungal infections, particularly for difficult-to-grow fungi and cases with low fungal loads.","Tsang, Chi-Ching; Teng, Jade L.

20719,Diagnostic Potential of Plasma IgG N-glycans in Discriminating Thyroid Cancer from Benign Thyroid Nodules and Healthy Controls,2021-08-12,"Medicinal plants have been used by mankind since ancient times, and many bioactive plant secondary metabolites are applied nowadays both directly as drugs, and as raw materials for semi-synthetic modifications. However, the structural complexity often thwarts cost-efficient chemical synthesis, and the usually low content in the native plant necessitates the processing of large amounts of field-cultivated raw material. The biotechnological manufacturing of such compounds offers a number of advantages like predictable, stable, and year-round sustainable production, scalability, and easier extraction and purification. Plant cell and tissue culture represents one possible alternative to the extraction of phytochemicals from plant material. Although a broad commercialization of such processes has not yet occurred, ongoing research indicates that plant in vitro systems such as cell suspension cultures, organ cultures, and transgenic hairy roots hold a promising potential as sources for bioactive compounds. Progress in the areas of biosynthetic pathway elucidation and genetic manipulation has expanded the possibilities to utilize plant metabolic engineering and heterologous production in microorganisms. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the in vitro production of high-value plant secondary metabolites of medicinal importance. Key points • Bioactive plant secondary metabolites are important for current and future use in medicine • In vitro production is a sustainable alternative to extraction from plants or costly chemical synthesis • Current research addresses plant cell and tissue culture, metabolic engineering, and heterologous production [Image: see text]","Wawrosch, Christoph; Zotchev, Sergey B.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408309/,147
20799,Neuroplasticity and depression: Rewiring the brain's networks through pharmacological therapy (Review),2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence has an emerging progress in diagnostic pathology. A large number of studies of applying deep learning models to histopathological images have been published in recent years. While many studies claim high accuracies, they may fall into the pitfalls of overfitting and lack of generalization due to the high variability of the histopathological images. AIMS AND OBJECTS: Use the model training of osteosarcoma as an example to illustrate the pitfalls of overfitting and how the addition of model input variability can help improve model performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the publicly available osteosarcoma dataset to retrain a previously published classification model for osteosarcoma. We partition the same set of images into the training and testing datasets differently than the original study: the test dataset consists of images from one patient while the training dataset consists images of all other patients. We also show the influence of training data variability on model performance by collecting a minimal dataset of 10 osteosarcoma subtypes as well as benign tissues and benign bone tumors of differentiation. RESULTS: The performance of the re-trained model on the test set using the new partition schema declines dramatically, indicating a lack of model generalization and overfitting. We show the additions of more and moresubtypes into the training data step by step under the same model schema yield a series of coherent models with increasing performances. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we bring forward data preprocessing and collection tactics for histopathological images of high variability to avoid the pitfalls of overfitting and build deep learning models of higher generalization abilities.","Tang, Haiming; Sun, Nanfei; Shen, Steven",J Pathol Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8404558/,147
20807,Skin Metagenomic Sequence Analysis of Early Candida auris Outbreaks in U.S. Nursing Homes,2021-08-04,"Humans are inextricably linked to each other and our natural world, and microorganisms lie at the nexus of those interactions. Microorganisms form genetically flexible, taxonomically diverse, and biochemically rich communities, i.e., microbiomes that are integral to the health and development of macroorganisms, societies, and ecosystems. Yet engagement with beneficial microbiomes is dictated by access to public resources, such as nutritious food, clean water and air, safe shelter, social interactions, and effective medicine. In this way, microbiomes have sociopolitical contexts that must be considered. The Microbes and Social Equity (MSE) Working Group connects microbiology with social equity research, education, policy, and practice to understand the interplay of microorganisms, individuals, societies, and ecosystems. Here, we outline opportunities for integrating microbiology and social equity work through broadening education and training; diversifying research topics, methods, and perspectives; and advocating for evidence-based public policy that supports sustainable, equitable, and microbial wealth for all.","Ishaq, Suzanne L.; Parada, Francisco J.; Wolf, Patricia G.; Bonilla, Carla Y.; Carney, Megan A.; Benezra, Amber; Wissel, Emily; Friedman, Michael; DeAngelis, Kristen M.; Robinson, Jake M.; Fahimipour, Ashkaan K.; Manus, Melissa B.; Grieneisen, Laura; Dietz, Leslie G.; Pathak, Ashish; Chauhan, Ashvini; Kuthyar, Sahana; Stewart, Justin D.; Dasari, Mauna R.; Nonnamaker, Emily; Choudoir, Mallory; Horve, Patrick F.; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.; Kozik, Ariangela J.; Darling, Katherine Weatherford; Romero-Olivares, Adriana L.; Hariharan, Janani; Farmer, Nicole; Maki, Katherine A.; Collier, Jackie L.; O’Doherty, Kieran C.; Letourneau, Jeffrey; Kline, Jeff; Moses, Peter L.; Morar, Nicolae",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407420/,147
21069,A comparison of methods of discontinuing nasal CPAP in premature infants <30 weeks gestation: a feasibility study,2021-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation have been associated with prognosis in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients. However, the possible value as a prognostic marker of the glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) has not been evaluated in critically ill patients with AP. METHODS: This study included 1,133 critically ill patients with AP from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, who were randomly divided into the training cohort (n=806) and the validation cohort (n=327) at a ratio of 7:3. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal cut-off values for GLR. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to compare the performance between GLR and other blood-based inflammatory biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to select prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality. A nomogram model was developed based on the identified prognostic factors and the validation cohort was used to further validate the nomogram. RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for GLR was 0.9. The ROC analyses showed that the discrimination abilities of GLR were better than other blood-based inflammatory biomarkers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that age, platelet, albumin, bilirubin, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and GLR are independent predictors of poor overall survival in the training cohort and were incorporated into the nomogram for in-hospital mortality as independent factors. The nomogram exhibited better discrimination with C-indexes in the training cohort and the validation cohort of 0.886 (95% CI=0.849–0.922) and 0.841 (95% CI=0.767–0.915), respectively. The calibration plot revealed an adequate fit of the nomogram for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality in both sets. CONCLUSION: As an easily available biomarker, GLR can independently predict the in-hospital mortality of critically ill patients with AP. The nomogram combining GLR with other significant features exerted favorable predictive performance for in-hospital mortality.","Chen, Yongjun; Tang, Shangjun; Wang, Yumei",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436258/,147

21328,Recent Insights into the Management of Inflammation in Asthma [Letter],2021-09-14,"PURPOSE: Older patients (Older) have complex health management needs often requiring additional resources. Mental health disorders are common among trauma patients, yet minimal information on older suicidal related injury and outcomes exists. A review of trauma patients with intentional self-inflicted injury at one trauma center was done to describe and identify unique elements of this cohort of patients. METHODS: Trauma registry data from 2000 to 2019 were reviewed for intentional injury and data abstracted included demographics, injury severity, diagnoses, comorbidities and outcomes. Cohorts by age were compared: Older (65 +) vs Younger (< 65). Values considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: 557 suicide attempts were identified with 9% among Older patients. Most patients were male with median age of 75 years for Older and 35 years for Younger cohort, with similar length of stay (LOS) and injury severity scores (ISS). Penetrating injury was more common among Older patients with firearm used most often, 34% vs 14% for Younger. Differences were evident between male and female Older patients with ISS 16.7 vs 5, p < 0.01 and mortality, p = 0.03. The outcome of discharge to home was significantly different between Older and Younger, 6% vs 20% (p < 0.05). A difference in mortality was evident, Older 38% vs Younger 18% (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: With the growing aging population, it is important to acknowledge the resultant increase in concomitant mental health issues and suicidality among older patients, where depression may be undiagnosed and untreated. Providing care within this cohort may reduce future attempts and lessen the burden on the health care system.","Schaffer, Kathryn B.; Dandan, Tala; Bayat, Dunya; Castelo, Matthew R.; Reames, Summer H.; Hutkin-Slade, Linda; Biffl, Walter L.",Eur Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450697/,147
21726,Metabolomic Response of the Creeping Wood Sorrel Oxalis corniculata to Low-Dose Radiation Exposure from Fukushima’s Contaminated Soil,2021-09-20,"Regular inspection of railway track health is crucial for maintaining safe and reliable train operations. Factors, such as cracks, ballast issues, rail discontinuity, loose nuts and bolts, burnt wheels, superelevation, and misalignment developed on the rails due to non-maintenance, pre-emptive investigations and delayed detection, pose a grave danger and threats to the safe operation of rail transport. The traditional procedure of manually inspecting the rail track using a railway cart is both inefficient and prone to human error and biases. In a country like Pakistan where train accidents have taken many lives, it is not unusual to automate such approaches to avoid such accidents and save countless lives. This study aims at enhancing the traditional railway cart system to address these issues by introducing an automatic railway track fault detection system using acoustic analysis. In this regard, this study makes two important contributions: data collection on Pakistan railway tracks using acoustic signals and the application of various classification techniques to the collected data. Initially, three types of tracks are considered, including normal track, wheel burnt and superelevation, due to their common occurrence. Several well-known machine learning algorithms are applied such as support vector machines, logistic regression, random forest and decision tree classifier, in addition to deep learning models like multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. Results suggest that acoustic data can help determine the track faults successfully. Results indicate that the best results are obtained by RF and DT with an accuracy of 97%.","Shafique, Rahman; Siddiqui, Hafeez-Ur-Rehman; Rustam, Furqan; Ullah, Saleem; Siddique, Muhammad Abubakar; Lee, Ernesto; Ashraf, Imran; Dudley, Sandra",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472961/,147

21853,Interferon beta for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the Campania Region of Italy: Merging the real-life to routinely collected healthcare data,2021-09-29,"The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, highlighting the need for a vaccine. A phase I clinical trial of a human adenovirus type 5 vector-based Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine (HAdV-5-MakGP) showed that a homologous prime-boost regimen with HAdV-5 vaccine elicited a robust humoral response but a weak cellular immune response. Due to pre-existing anti-vector immunity, boosting with the same vaccine did not increase the magnitude of the cellular immune response, which contributes significantly to protection against EBOV infection. Here, we generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV), based on the LaSota vaccine strain, expressing the GP protein of the EBOV variant Makona (rLS/EB-GP) using reverse genetics technology. The humoral and cellular immune responses to this vaccine candidate in mice immunized using a homologous prime-boost regimen or a heterologous prime-boost regimen with the HAdV-5-vectored Ebola vaccine were assessed using ELISA and ELISPOT assays. The ELISA and ELISPOT results showed that mice primed with rLS/EB-GP and boosted with HAdV-5-MakGP (NDV+HAdV-5) or, reversed, primed with HAdV-5-MakGP and boosted with rLS/EB-GP (HAdV-5+NDV) exhibited more-potent EBOV GP-specific antibody and cellular immune responses than those receiving the same vaccine twice. The most robust EBOV GP-specific antibody and T-cell responses were detected in the HAdV-5-MakGP-primed and rLS/EB-GP-boosted (HAdV-5+NDV) mice. These results suggest that the HAdV-5 prime-NDV boost regimen is more effective in stimulating EBOV-specific immunity than homologous regimens alone, indicating the potential boosting ability of the NDV vector in human vaccine use.","Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Peng; Bai, Shuang; Lv, Min; Wang, Jian; Chen, Weixin; Yu, Qingzhong; Wu, Jiang",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482741/,147

An exception is hypo-oncotic albumin in traumatic brain injury. While clear indications of albumin exist for some patients with liver cirrhosis, large studies that demonstrate a clinically relevant advantage beyond hemodynamic effects and would therefore justify wider use in many other areas are still lacking. In large-volume paracentesis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but also in hepatorenal syndrome, use of albumin is recommended and established due to clinical benefit in randomized controlled trials. In septic shock, use of albumin may be considered, with two large studies addressing this issue in Germany and Italy being still in the recruitment phase. For volume therapy, albumin can be used primarily when other measures for hemodynamic stabilization have been exhausted. This applies to volume resuscitation in hypovolemia as well as in conservative fluid management in the so-called “de-resuscitation” phase. The extent to which the correction of severe hypoalbuminemia with exogenous albumin can improve the impaired outcome of these patients is also part of ongoing studies. On the way to a more individualized medicine, hypoalbuminemia may serve as a parameter in future decision making for or against the use of albumin in volume therapy.","Mayerhöfer, Timo; Wiedermann, Christian J.; Joannidis, Michael",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496431/,147

Some recognition models for HA proteins of avian influenza virus (AIV) were developed using support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results obtained from LDA are as follows: the identification accuracy (R (ia)) for training samples is 99.8% and R (ia) by leave one out cross validation is 99.5%. Both R (ia) of 99.8% for training samples and R (ia) of 99.3% by leave one out cross validation are obtained using SVM model, respectively. External 200 HA proteins of influenza virus were used to validate the external predictive power of the resulting model. The external R (ia) for them is 95.5% by LDA and 96.5% by SVM, respectively, which shows that HA proteins of AIVs are preferably recognized by SVM and LDA, and the performances by SVM are superior to those by LDA.","Liang, GuiZhao; Chen, ZeCong; Yang, ShanBin; Mei, Hu; Zhou, Yuan; Yang, Li; Zhou, Peng; Yang, ShengXi; Shu, Mao; Liao, ChunYang; Wu, ShiRong; Li, GenRong; He, Liu; Gao, JianKun; Gan, MengYu; Li, DeJing; Chen, GuoPing; Wang, GuiXue; Long, Sha; Jing, JuHua; Zheng, XiaoLin; Zeng, Hui; Zhang, QiaoXia; Zhang, MengJun; Yang, Qi; Tian, FeiFei; Tong, JianBo; Wang, JiaoNa; Liu, YongHong; Li, Bo; Qiu, LiangJia; Cai, ShaoXi; Zhao, Na; Yang, Yan; Su, XiaLi; Song, Jian; Chen, MeiXia; Zhang, XueJiao; Sun, JiaYing; Li, JingWei; Chen, GuoHua; Chen, Gang; Deng, Jie; Peng, ChuanYou; Zhu, WanPing; Xu, LuoNan; Wu, YuQuan; Liao, LiMin; Li, Zhi; Li, Jun; Lu, DaJun; Su, QinLiang; Huang, ZhengHu; Zhou, Ping; Li, ZhiLiang",Sci China Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089115/,147

24376,Diagnostic Techniques,2017-02-25,"In the drug discovery field, solving the problem of virtual screening is a long term-goal. The scoring functionality which evaluates the fitness of the docking result is one of the major challenges in virtual screening. In general, scoring functionality in docking requires large amount of floating-point calculations and usually takes several weeks or even months to be finished. This time-consuming disadvantage is unacceptable especially when highly fatal and infectious virus arises such as SARS and H1N1. This paper presents how to leverage the computational power of GPU to accelerate Dock6 [1]’s Amber [2] scoring with NVIDIA CUDA [3] platform. We also discuss many factors that will greatly influence the performance after porting the Amber scoring to GPU, including thread management, data transfer and divergence hidden. Our GPU implementation shows a 6.5x speedup with respect to the original version running on AMD dual-core CPU for the same problem size.","Yang, Hailong; Li, Bo; Wang, Yongjian; Luan, Zhongzhi; Qian, Depei; Chu, Tianshu",Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120663/,147

25173,Asthma and COPD,2012-06-26,"Severe acute liver failure is defined as the development of overt liver failure with encephalopathy over eight weeks or less in previously healthy individuals. In hyperacute liver failure, deterioration occurs in less than 14 days. Whilst it is a relatively uncommon reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), acute liver failure is important because it often occurs in previously well young adults and carries a high mortality. Management of these patients presents considerable challenges within the ICU due to the extreme nature of the associated pathophysiological processes, which affect multiple systems. Integrated management strategies have been poorly studied and treatment is often center-specific [1]. Clinical manifestations include a reduced conscious state, jaundice with abnormal liver function tests (especially elevations in amino acid transferase levels more than 25 times the upper limit of normal) and coagulopathy. Further deterioration can involve marked cerebral edema, hypoglycemia and severe shock with lactic acidosis and multiple organ failure. The use of clinical management guidelines may assist in the treatment of these patients by providing an evidence-based framework for care by staff at the bedside, which ensures that all important priorities are adequately addressed. It is possible that a coordinated combination of specific and general therapies may reduce mortality and the need for liver transplantation. Consideration for transfer to a unit with expertise in liver transplantation may be appropriate in order for this option to be available as a life-saving treatment should supportive care fail to arrest deterioration.","Warrillow, S.; Bellomo, R.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121699/,147

Such a constellation of symptoms extend from the remote biblical past, and involve various religious and cultural belief systems up to the recent evolution in Western medicine application of scientific methods for classification of illness. The contemporary application of scientific principles is directed to the etiology of diseases and to derive procedures for the management of such ill-understood illnesses. Historically, this constellation of rheumatic pain and fatigue symptoms have been given ever-changing medical and psychiatric labels that have been devoid of satisfactory medical understanding. In this chapter, the hypothesis that the sleeping/waking brain is integral to the somatic and behavioral symptoms of these disabling rheumatic chronic illness, termed fibromyalgia and various allied disorders, that are being examined and treated by a variety of health care professionals. Contemporary advances in mechanisms of how the sleeping–waking brain connects to these somatic and behavioral symptoms are reviewed. Potential avenues for further scientific understanding are described.

25689,"Phenotypes of Liver Diseases in Infants, Children, and Adolescents",2013-08-23,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. The burden of TB is alarmingly high in developing countries, where diagnosis latent TB infection (LTBI), Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), HIV-associated TB, and paediatric TB is still a challenge. This is mainly due to delayed or misdiagnosis of TB, which continues to fuel its worldwide epidemic. The ideal diagnostic test is still unavailable, and conventional methods remain a necessity for TB diagnosis, though with poor diagnostic ability. The nanoparticles have shown potential for the improvement of drug delivery, reducing treatment frequency and diagnosis of various diseases. The engineering of antigens/antibody nanocarriers represents an exciting front in the field of diagnostics, potentially flagging the way toward development of better diagnostics for TB. This chapter discusses the presently available tests for TB diagnostics and also highlights the recent advancement in the nanotechnology-based detection tests for M. tuberculosis.","Gupta, Anil Kumar; Singh, Amit; Singh, Sarman",NanoBioMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122355/,147
26650,Bacterial Infections,2015-05-19,"The lungs are vulnerable to toxins because of their large surface area and act as a metabolic site for some substances. Drugs may induce specific respiratory reactions, or the lungs may be affected as part of a generalized response. Drug-induced lung injury (DLI) can involve the airways, lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura, pulmonary vasculature, and/or the neuromuscular system. The most common form of DLI is drug-induced interstitial lung disease. There are no disease types specific to DLI, and DLIs are diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, chest CT images, and histopathologic findings. The first principle of management of DLI is early detection and cessation of treatment with the suspected drug. Response to corticosteroid therapy depends on the histopathologic pattern of drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Prognosis depends on the specific drug and underlying clinical, physiologic, and pathologic severity of lung disease. To minimize DLI morbidity and mortality, all health-care providers should be familiar with the possible adverse effects of medications they prescribe. Individual variability in drug response is an important concern in clinical practice and drug development. Such variability is multifactorial and includes extrinsic factors such as environmental features and genetic and intrinsic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs.","Homma, Sakae",Drug-Induced Lung Injury,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123618/,147
26785,Staphylococcal Infections,2012,"Viral infections have been recorded unknowingly from the beginning of recorded history. The ancient Greeks and Romans described plagues of unknown origin. In general, infections were blamed on sins and punishment, balances of “vital humors” or on “miasma,” (rotten smells). In the sixteenth century, Girolamo Fracastoro suggested that infectious agents might spread disease, as did Agostino Bassi, studying diseases of silkworms. The development of the microscope by Hook and Van Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century led to the discovery of a new living world inhabited by very small creatures. Edward Jenner in England demonstrated that smallpox, a dreaded disease, could be prevented by inoculation with an organism that caused pockmarks on cows and dairymaids; this was the beginning of the concept of vaccination. Louis Pasteur proved that fermentation only occurred in the presence of air and was due to microorganisms. Pasteur and Pierre Roux, a colleague, as well as Jacob Henle and Robert Koch, proved that germs caused bacterial diseases such as anthrax and tuberculosis; Pasteur and Roux developed a vaccine against rabies by passaging the infectious material through rabbits. By the end of the nineteenth century it had been established that most infectious diseases were the result of germs. In parallel with this research, plant scientists had isolated material that passed through a low pore filter that was infectious to tobacco plants. This was called a “virus,” from the Latin for poison. Viruses were also found to be associated with leukemia and other cancers of chickens. The twentieth century saw the discovery of bacteriophage, viruses that attack bacteria, and the use of such bacteriophage to launch studies of molecular biology, and DNA and RNA structure.","Taylor, Milton W.",Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123787/,147

However, in order to assist organisations to create and transfer knowledge more effectively through knowledge visualisation, the aim of this study is to provide a conceptual knowledge visualisation framework for the transfer of knowledge for organisations. A conceptual knowledge visualisation framework was designed through a systematic literature review process where 15 organisational knowledge visualisation elements were identified. The 15 elements were grouped and presented in a 4-layered, embedded conceptual framework that organisations may apply to their knowledge visualisation efforts.

Water quality has been the subject of attention for the country and specifically, Mindanao Island, because of the role this natural resource plays in agriculture. Water supply and usage for the island and the nation are identified and discussed in relation to the scarcity of potable water. Potential threats and pollution hotspots bring forth the various health and environmental impact attributed to the water system accessibility, distribution, and quality. Strategies addressing water resources problems are taken into consideration side-by-side the numerous national laws, policies, standards, and guidelines in addressing water quality control and management. Therefore, the legal framework for various agencies to carry out these policies on quality control, usage, and water management are pivotal to recommendations on revision of certain provisions that rely on embedding local community involvement to lessen the environmental impact that is causal to poor population health. The World Bank has been instrumental in prompting local activity with initiatives first established in relation to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals that are being carried forward today in the Sustainable Development Initiatives. This chapter extends the recent UN and World Bank initiatives to demonstrate how further community involvement can continue to improve quality of life for Philippine citizens through education and participation.","Walag, Angelo Mark P.; Canencia, Oliva P.; Fiedler, Beth Ann",Translating National Policy to Improve Environmental Conditions Impacting Public Health Through Community Planning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153040/,147

The chapter also discusses those criteria used by various laboratories for determining the degree of purity achieved in virus preparations. Viruses need to be purified for many studies in which properties or structure of the virus must be distinguished from those of the host cells or culture medium, such as analyses of structure of viral polypeptides and function of membrane glycoproteins. Ultracentrifugation is the usual technique of choice for the purification of particles of defined size from their contaminating materials. Caesium chloride is one of the materials of choice used for the purification of viruses by a technique referred to as buoyant density-gradient sedimentation, isopycnic centrifugation, or equilibrium density gradient centrifugation.","Killington, R.A.; Stokes, A.; Hierholzer, J.C.",Virology Methods Manual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155528/,147

The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fang, Mengjie; He, Bingxi; Li, Li; Dong, Di; Yang, Xin; Li, Cong; Meng, Lingwei; Zhong, Lianzhen; Li, Hailin; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie",Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166002/,147

Drawbacks linked to the use of alum, such as the formation of granuloma at the site of injection, have led to suggestions of novel allergen carriers. An alternative carrier is 2 μm carbohydrate‐based particles (CBPs). In mouse, allergen‐coupled CBPs have been demonstrated to skew the allergen‐specific immune response towards a Th1‐like activity (Grönlund et al. Immunology, 2002). We here coupled the recombinant major cat allergen Fel d 1 to CBPs (CBP‐Fel d 1) by cyanogen‐bromide activation, resulting in covalent binding. The effect of CBP‐Fel d 1 on monocyte‐derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from healthy human blood donors was studied. We found that the majority of the CD1a(+) MDDCs were capable of taking up FITC‐labelled CBP‐Fel d 1, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, incubation with CBP‐Fel d 1 resulted in an upregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on the MDDCs, which was not observed with Fel d 1 or CBPs alone. Finally, CBP‐Fel d 1 induced a fivefold increase in the release of the pro‐inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α and a fourfold increase in the release of the chemokine interleukin‐8 from MDDCs. Taken together, the effects CBPs possess make them interesting as novel allergen carriers for SIT.","Neimert‐Andersson, T.; Ekman, G.

33674,Essentials of Pulmonology,2009-11-11,"Process model extraction (PME) is a recently emerged interdiscipline between natural language processing (NLP) and business process management (BPM), which aims to extract process models from textual descriptions. Previous process extractors heavily depend on manual features and ignore the potential relations between clues of different text granularities. In this paper, we formalize the PME task into the multi-grained text classification problem, and propose a hierarchical neural network to effectively model and extract multi-grained information without manually-defined procedural features. Under this structure, we accordingly propose the coarse-to-fine (grained) learning mechanism, training multi-grained tasks in coarse-to-fine grained order to share the high-level knowledge for the low-level tasks. To evaluate our approach, we construct two multi-grained datasets from two different domains and conduct extensive experiments from different dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance and further investigations demonstrate its effectiveness.","Qian, Chen; Wen, Lijie; Kumar, Akhil; Lin, Leilei; Lin, Li; Zong, Zan; Li, Shu’ang; Wang, Jianmin",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266458/,147
35880,Issue Highlights,2020-07-03,"Process mining techniques can be used to discover process models from event data and project performance and conformance related diagnostics on such models. For example, it is possible to automatically discover Petri nets showing the bottlenecks in production, administration, transport, and financial processes. Also basic statistics (frequencies, average delays, standard deviations, etc.) can be projected on the places and transitions of such nets to reveal performance and compliance problems. However, real-life phenomena such as overtaking, batching, queueing, concept drift, and partial blocking of multiple cases remain invisible when considering basic statistics. This paper presents an approach combining Petri-net-based discovery techniques and so-called performance spectra based on token flows. Token production and consumption are visualized such that the true dynamics of the process are revealed. Our ProM implementation supports a range of visual-analytics features allowing the user to interact with the underlying event data and Petri net.

Accessibility to cultural heritage and artworks for people with visual impairments requires the segmentation of images and paintings to extract and classify their contents into meaningful elements which can then be presented through a tactile medium. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and how to optimize the tactile discovery of an image. First, we study the emergence of image comprehension through tactile discovery, using 3D-printed objects extracted from paintings. Later, we present a dynamic Force Feedback Tablet (F2T) used to convey the 2D shape and texture information of objects through haptic feedback. We then explore several image segmentation methods to automate the extraction of meaningful objects from selected artworks, to be presented to visually impaired people through the F2T. Finally, we evaluate how to best combine the F2T’s haptic effects in order to convey the extracted objects and features to the users, with the aim of facilitating the comprehension of the represented objects and their affordances.","Souradi, Ali; Lecomte, Christele; Romeo, Katerine; Gay, Simon; Riviere, Marc-Aurele; El Moataz, Abderrahim; Pissaloux, Edwige",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340923/,147
39270,Natural therapeutics for urinary tract infections—a review,2020-09-18,"INTRODUCTION: Various types of cancers threaten human life. The role of bacteria in causing cancer is controversial, but it has been determined that the Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the identified risk factors for gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori infection is highly prevalent, and about half of the world(,)s population is infected with it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the role of Helicobacter pylori in the development of gastric cancer. METHOD: We obtained information from previously published articles. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The bacterium has various virulence factors, including cytotoxin- associated gene A, vacuolating cytotoxin A, and the different outer membrane proteins that cause cancer by different mechanisms. These virulence factors activate cell signaling pathways such as PI3-kinase/Akt, JAK/STAT and Ras, Raf, and ERK signaling that control cell proliferation. Uncontrolled proliferation can lead to cancer.","Alipour, Majid",J Gastrointest Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7487264/,147
40580,The Emerging Role of RHOT1/Miro1 in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND: An effective vaccine that prevents disease caused by hantaviruses is a global public health priority, but up to now, no vaccine has been approved for worldwide use. Therefore, novel vaccines with high prophylaxis efficacy are urgently needed. METHODS: Herein, we designed and synthesized Hantaan virus (HTNV) linear multi-epitope peptide consisting of HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitope and pan HLA-DR-binding epitope (PADRE), and evaluated the immunogenicity, as well as effectiveness, of multi-epitope peptides in HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice with interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay, cytotoxic mediator detection, proliferation assay and HTNV-challenge test. RESULTS: The results showed that a much higher frequency of specific IFN-γ-secreting CTLs, high levels of granzyme B production, and a strong proliferation capacity of specific CTLs were observed in splenocytes of mice immunized with multi-epitope peptide than in those of a single CTL epitope. Moreover, pre-immunization of multi-epitope peptide could reduce the levels of HTNV RNA loads in the liver, spleen and kidneys of mice, indicating that specific CTL responses induced by multi-epitope peptide could reduce HTNV RNA loads in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide an important foundation for the development of novel peptide vaccines for HTNV prophylaxis.","Ma, Ying; Tang, Kang; Zhang, Yusi; Zhang, Chunmei; Cheng, Linfeng; Zhang, Fanglin; Zhuang, Ran; Jin, Boquan; Zhang, Yun",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538842/,147

41908,"Effects of Low-Dose X-Ray on Cell Growth, Membrane Permeability, DNA Damage and Gene Transfer Efficiency",2020-10-28,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: By June 2020, 175,000 cases of COVID-19 had been identified in London alone. The most common symptoms include fever, headache, loss of smell, cough, myalgia, and sore throat. The major complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but systemic complications such as cardiomyopathy, acute kidney injury, encephalopathy and coagulopathy are being identified. A delayed multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children has also been recognised and further complications are likely to be identified as our experience increases. Here, we report the case of a patient with large vessel vasculitis who initially presented with symptoms highly likely to be due to COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old black African nurse presented in May 2020, with acute onset 7 days prior of high-grade fevers, rigors, nights sweats, generalised myalgia, sore throat, headache with photophobia, anosmia, dysgeusia and a widespread rash. She was a smoker with no other relevant medical, travel nor sexual history, and no drug use. A COVID-19 swab on day 2 had been negative and she had taken a course of Doxycycline. Examination revealed firm palpable subcutaneous nodules on lower limbs, upper back and forehead and cervical lymphadenopathy. She was photophobic with no meningism. The rest of her physical examination was normal. BP was 116/97 mmHg, heart rate 109 bpm and satO2 100%. Investigations demonstrated C-reactive protein 330mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 140, Ferritin 479, lymphopaenia 0.7x10(9), eGFR 54 with no haematoproteinuria, D-dimer 3.05 mg/L with INR 1.1, aPTT 1.3, fibrinogen 8.8 g/L. Hb, WCC, liver function, CK, serum ACE and triglycerides were normal. Infectious screen revealed negative blood cultures, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, EBV, CMV and Treponema pallidum serology. CT brain and CSF analysis were normal including bacterial culture and viral PCR. ANA, ENA, dsDNA, ANCA and aPL antibodies were negative with normal complement levels. Throat swab grew group A streptococcus and she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 days maintaining fevers up to 39(o)C. Skin biopsy was non-specific with negative direct immunofluorescence but showed microvascular thrombi in the papillary dermis. COVID-19 PCR tests (three naso-pharyngeal swabs and one stool PCR) and IgG test (day 38) were negative. CT showed no pneumonitis but non-specific retroperitoneal stranding with medium/large vessel vasculitis involving both proximal renal arteries and a 6 cm segment of mid abdominal aorta on PET-CT. We started oral prednisolone 40mg with immediate resolution of her fevers, myalgia, and inflammatory markers, remaining well a month later. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Takayasu’s arteritis is the most common autoimmune large vessel vasculitis (LVV) affecting young females and involves inflammation of the arterial wall ultimately resulting in stenosis and obstruction of the vessel. However, it is rare in patients with African heritage and usually presents with a prolonged prodromal phase. Given the atypical presentation and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection we feel that this patients’ LVV may have been a complication of COVID-19 infection. The relationship between infections and vasculitis is complex. TB and syphilis cause aortitis and a relationship between infection and vasculitis has been proven in HBV associated PAN and HCV associated cryoglobulinemia. Experimental data supports a possible association between CMV and herpes virus and Takayasu arteritis. It could, therefore, be hypothesised that COVID-19 infection can trigger LVV. Our patient had a throat swab positive for Streptococcus pyogenes which is an uncommon cause of infective endocarditis and mycotic aneurism, but this patient had no evidence of either endocarditis or aneurism formation and so it was felt the throat swab finding was incidental. Our patient had repeated negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs and a negative antibody test at day 38. Although this argues against a diagnosis of COVID-19 related illness, the relative lack of information we currently have regarding sensitivities of the tests, at what point COVID-19 PCR becomes negative in the illness and when/if patients develop antibodies, means these negative tests in the presence of typical symptoms cannot exclude the diagnosis. We believe this case is extremely important to highlight a possible novel inflammatory complication of COVID-19 infection. We decided to treat this patient in line with guidance for the management of LVV, including the introduction of methotrexate, but it will be interesting to observe her long-term outcome. Case report - Key learning points: Increasing numbers of COVID-19 related systemic inflammatory conditions are likely to be recognised over the coming months. We present the case of patient with large vessel vasculitis who initially presented atypically with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. To identify these complications, COVID-19 symptoms questioning should be part of any routine medical history. More information is required regarding the sensitivity of COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests to aid the diagnosis of these conditions. The long-term management of inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear and a discussion is warranted as to whether DMARDs should be initiated.","Rutter-Locher, Zoe; Mukherjee, Bhashkar; Mason, Thomas; Lopez, Begona",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607355/,147

This study shows that the current IFSA regulations on corporate governance in the Indonesian banking sector encourage the application of the stakeholder model. However, they contain a vague definition of a stakeholder, fail to properly identify the legitimate stakeholders of the Indonesian banking sector, and provide no principles that can be used to align bank stakeholders’ interests. IFSA should revise these regulations so that they are more compatible with the theoretical basis and international best practices. This can be done through providing a concise definition of the concept of a stakeholder and offering normative and practical principles to be used when identifying the Indonesian banking sector legitimate stakeholders and aligning stakeholders’ interests.","Rissy, Yafet Yosafet Wilben",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786863/,147

This study explores the devastating effects of the novel virus pandemic, the resulting lockdown, thus the need to transform the offline classroom into an online classroom. It explores and describes the numerous online teaching platforms, study materials, techniques, and technologies’ being used to ensure that educating the students does not stop. Furthermore, it identifies the platforms, technologies which can be used to conduct online examination in a safe environment devoid of cheating. Additionally, it explores the challenges facing the deployment of online teaching methods. On the basis of literature review, a framework was proposed to deliver superior online class room experience for the students, so that online classroom is as effective as or even better than offline classrooms. The identified variables were empirically tested with the aid of a structured questionnaire; there were 487(according to Craitier and Morgan)150 number of respondents who were purposefully sampled. The results indicate that students prefer the multimedia means of studies. As a result of binary logistic regression, poor internet connection, awareness on COVID-19, enough sources of materials, recommends massive open online course, favourite online methods, and satisfaction with online study are significant in the model or attitudes towards delivering of online classes during lockdown COVID-19 pandemic at 5% level of significance.

The nationwide lockdown though an effective safety measure, has made their condition more pathetic. As per, World Bank 2020 estimates, there are around 50.7 million people in India living in extreme poverty with income of $1.90 per day. The Government of India has announced several remedial measures to tackle economic as well humanitarian crisis but its effective implementation is a major challenge due to enormity of the problem and the large number of affected people. Moreover, the measures announced are based on top-down approach and not on detailed assessment of impact on different sections of the population. The different segments of the poor have suffered from the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, in different proportions. They have suffered from severe financial losses. In this chapter, we have made detailed assessment of impact of the pandemic on individuals, different sectors of economy and on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The measures announced by the Prime Minister are discussed along with their implications for the poor and MSMEs. At the lowest end of the spectrum, are the migrant labors who are worst affected. They are required to travel for their homes due to loss of livelihoods and require immediate relief. At the other end, are the skilled labors working in organized or unorganized sectors, who have not lost their jobs but are facing reduction in wages. In order to make the systematic assessment of the requirements, we have grouped the people in three categories namely high impact, medium impact and low impact and have assessed the requirements for each category. So also, it is deliberated as to what extent, the government measures address their requirements. The gaps are identified and detailed suggestions are made. Major structural changes such as extensive use of information and communication technology, development of on-line platforms for education, strengthening of rural infrastructure, development of health infrastructure, creation of employment opportunities in rural as well as in urban areas and provision of credit and capital have been suggested. Furthermore, suggestions have been made to improve credit flow to MSMEs and for launching temporary social security system for the poor.","Singh, Ardhendu Shekhar; Venkataramani, Bhama; Ambarkhane, Dilip","The Future of Service Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Volume 1",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869947/,147

Bristol: Policy Press, 2008), the problem of its reliable maintenance in economic and political relations has been present for the UK for at least five decades. The division in the working class through subsidisation of low wages meant that the interests of taxpayers and claimants of such support were antagonistic, and this undermined the capacity of governments to sustain policies for the common good (Jordan, The Common Good: Citizenship, Morality and Self-Interest. Oxford: Blackwell, 1986).

This co-existence occurs in an environment that allows for such. While such interactions may not benefit some animals, they have served as vital pathways for some diseases to thrive, like in the case of vector-borne or indirectly transmitted diseases. Changes in the environment, be it man made or natural, have increasingly played a role in allowing some of the disease causing pathogens to thrive and this has significant impact on the health status of our planet. Dying workforce reduce economic potential; diseased plants affect life sustenance in some affected areas, and diseased and dying animals impact the plants ecosystems, which could be good but also can be quite detrimental. When there is a shift in the natural ecosystems of animals, especially if those animals serve as vectors that can transmit diseases, then the resulting outcomes may result in undesirable circumstances. Here, we seek to understand different infectious diseases of animals and plants as well as the mechanisms and factors that allow for these pathogens to succeed, seeking ways to understand areas which can be exploited for control.

52574,AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine recommended in ≥50s in Australia,2021-05-08,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to exploit the cell’s ACE2 receptor for viral entry. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonism with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increases the expression of ACE2 receptors which, coupled with the metabolic changes associated with obesity-related hypertension, can make hypertensive patients with obesity more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Although current evidence suggests that ACEI/ARB use does not increase risk of severe COVID-19 in the general population, potential interactions with obesity-related hypertension are unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between March 1st and July 8th, 2020. We included adults who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) with hypertension treated as outpatients with or without ACEIs/ARBs. Patients without exposure to RAAS antagonists served as controls. We assessed mortality and the severity of COVID-19 reflected by admission to ICU and usage of supplemental O(2), non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and vasopressors. Results: Of the 369 inpatients with COVID-19, we identified 138 exhibiting obesity-related hypertension who were then allocated into the control (n=59) and ACEI/ARB (n=79) groups. The BMIs between groups at baseline were not statistically significant (Control: 33.6 ± 0.96 vs. ACEI/ARB: 34.99 ± 0.97; p=.32). Women were less represented in the ACEI/ARB group (Control: 47% vs. ACEI/ARB: 24%). The controls had a substantially higher mortality rate (Control: 32.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 15.1%). In regard to the severity of COVID-19, the ACEI/ARB cohort showed lower usage of supplemental O(2) (Control: 52.5% vs. ACEI/ARB: 49.3%), mechanical ventilation (Control: 37.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 1.2%), vasopressors (Control: 38.9% vs. ACEI/ARB: 31.6%), and had lower ICU admissions (Control: 57.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 46.8%). However, the ACEI/ARB group had higher rates of: ECMO (Control: 0% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%) and non-invasive ventilation (Control: 18.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%). Of note, the rate of diabetes was higher in the ACEI/ARB cohort (Control: 45.7% vs. ACEI/ARB: 63.2%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that a history of RAAS antagonism is associated with lower mortality and less severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity-related hypertension requiring hospital admission.","Kamalumpundi, Vijayvardhan; Shams, Elham; Cheng, Linhai; Taiwo, Adeyinka; Shibli-Rahhal, Amal A; Dokun, Ayotunde O; Correia, Marcelo",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090405/,147

54558,Immune System and Neuroinflammation in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease: Association Analysis of Genetic Variants and miRNAs Interactions,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: The crucial role of type I interferon (IFN-I, IFN-α/β) is well known to control central nervous system (CNS) neuroinflammation caused by neurotrophic flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus. However, an in-depth analysis of IFN-I signal-dependent cellular factors that govern CNS-restricted tropism in JEV infection in vivo remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Viral dissemination, tissue tropism, and cytokine production were examined in IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice after JEV inoculation in tissues distal from the CNS such as the footpad. Bone marrow (BM) chimeric models were used for defining hematopoietic and tissue-resident cells in viral dissemination and tissue tropism. RESULTS: The paradoxical and interesting finding was that IFN-I signaling was essentially required for CNS neuroinflammation following JEV inoculation in distal footpad tissue. IFN-I signal-competent mice died after a prolonged neurological illness, but IFN-I signal-incompetent mice all succumbed without neurological signs. Rather, IFN-I signal-incompetent mice developed hemorrhage-like disease as evidenced by thrombocytopenia, functional injury of the liver and kidney, increased vascular leakage, and excessive cytokine production. This hemorrhage-like disease was closely associated with quick viral dissemination and impaired IFN-I innate responses before invasion of JEV into the CNS. Using bone marrow (BM) chimeric models, we found that intrinsic IFN-I signaling in tissue-resident cells in peripheral organs played a major role in inducing the hemorrhage-like disease because IFN-I signal-incompetent recipients of BM cells from IFN-I signal-competent mice showed enhanced viral dissemination, uncontrolled cytokine production, and increased vascular leakage. IFN-I signal-deficient hepatocytes and enterocytes were permissive to JEV replication with impaired induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes, and neuron cells derived from both IFN-I signal-competent and -incompetent mice were vulnerable to JEV replication. Finally, circulating CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) monocytes infiltrated into the distal tissues inoculated by JEV participated in quick viral dissemination to peripheral organs of IFN-I signal-incompetent mice at an early stage. CONCLUSION: An IFN-I signal-dependent model is proposed to demonstrate how CD11b(+)Ly-6C(+) monocytes are involved in restricting the tissue tropism of JEV to the CNS.","Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Choi, Jin Young; Park, Seong Ok; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Kim, Bumseok; Kim, Koanhoi; Eo, Seong Kug",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204625/,147

RECENT FINDINGS: A fifth C. auris clade has been described. Diagnostic accuracy has improved with development of selective/differential media for C. auris. Advances in spectral databases of matrix-associated laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) systems have reduced misidentification. Direct detection of C. auris in clinical specimens using real time PCR is increasingly used, as is whole genome sequencing (WGS) to track nosocomial spread and to study phylogenetic relationships and drug resistance. SUMMARY: C. auris is an important transmissible, nosocomial pathogen. The microbiological laboratory diagnostic capacity has extended beyond culture-based methods to include PCR and WGS. Microbiological techniques on the horizon include the use of MALDI-TOF MS for early echinocandin antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) and expansion of the versatile and information-rich WGS methods for outbreak investigation.","Keighley, C.; Garnham, K.; Harch, S.

This virus contains a unique polybasic insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein, resulting in a novel furin cleavage site that has been shown to influence viral infectivity and syncytia formation in cell culture. This insertion also generates novel putative sites of O‐glycosylation, a protein modification that has been shown in other proteins to influence furin cleavage. Here, we define the specific members of the UDP‐GalNAc:polypeptide N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GALNT) family that are capable of glycosylating the novel SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus spike and examine their presence in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Moreover, we show that O‐glycosylation by specific members of the GALNT enzyme family modulates furin cleavage of the spike in vivo. Given the well‐established role of O‐glycosylation in the regulation of proteolysis, our results suggest that O‐glycosylation of SARS‐CoV‐2 may play roles in aspects of spike stability/processing, which may influence viral infectivity and tropism.","Zhang, Liping; Reynolds, Hayley; Mann, Matthew; Syed, Zulfeqhar; Martin, Negin; Tian, E.; Zeldin, Darryl; Tabak, Lawrence; Samara, Nadine; Ten Hagen, Kelly",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239757/,147

Patients were followed over 390 days and received five injections of 800 U aboBoNT/A every three months. Patients assessed the treatment effect at eight visits using a global assessment scale, physicians scored the muscle tone at the ankle joint, measured active and passive ranges of motion (aRoMs, pRoMs) at the knee and ankle joint and determined the distance patients succeeded to walk during a minute. Patients’ assessments significantly (p < 0.006) increased with time and significantly correlated with all parameters measured. The best correlation (r = 0.927; p < 0.0001) was found with the sum of the aRoMs of knee and ankle joint. After one year of treatment outcome measures were better than and significantly correlated with the peak effect of the first injection. This correlation was higher for pRoMs (r = 0.855; p < 0.00001) compared to aRoMs (r = 0.567; p < 0.009). When BoNT/A treatment of the spastic foot in chronic hemispasticity is performed regularly every three months for at least one year, patients will experience a significant increase of benefit beyond the first treatment, but have to learn how to adapt to and use the new degree of freedom induced by the injections.","Hefter, Harald; Nickels, Werner; Rosenthal, Dietmar; Samadzadeh, Sara; Albrecht, Philipp",Toxins (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310361/,147
56819,Editor’s Focus,2021-08-17,"The livestock sector has had an important contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Costa Rica, more than 20% of emissions come from beef and milk production. This paper performs a cost–benefit analysis of a climate policy in the Costa Rican cattle sector, and tries to innovate by including the positive global externality of emissions reduction into the analysis; to assess the extent to which it affects the attractivity of the referred policy. National sectorial policies for climate change mitigation generate global benefits, such as avoided GHG emissions into the atmosphere—a global public good. However, such global positive externalities, which represented 13% to 31% of the policy’s benefits in the widest scenario of our study, are usually not included in national climate planning, which may lead efficient policies to be dismissed. This paper shows that taking externalities into account makes sectorial climate mitigation policies more efficient, i.e., more appealing for investments. Benefit–cost ratios varied between 0.27 and 7.31 and break-even points average around the third and fourth years. Moreover, the results under different economic assumptions varied in terms of net benefits, but viability balance (viable vs. unviable scenarios) remained stable for different settings. The crucial question remains on how to best balance such global positive externalities to be advantageous to both funders and beneficiaries, enabling an efficient global climate mitigation strategy.","Dall’Orsoletta, Felipe; Cechin, Andrei Domingues",Discov Sustain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355268/,147

Identification of some young people as vulnerable can lead to tensions between rights and blame and between support and stigma. This paper draws on scholarship that posits vulnerability as emerging as part of specific social and historical conditions, and as a precondition for resistance and agency. We use publicly available data and information to focus on a community in a regional area in Australia and on a specific initiative for young women in that community. In relation to conditions, we detail salient characteristics of the region: north-west Tasmania. We show how structures of social, economic, and cultural inequalities provide the context for the vulnerability of young women living here. In this community, as elsewhere in Australia and globally, national economic reforms have accentuated social and economic disadvantage. We then move on to examine a participatory arts initiative, Project O, that works with young women in this region. We outline how Project O is an example of a practical way to harness the potential of vulnerability as a starting point for both resistance and agency, through positive connections with place and identity; by enabling young women to act on their aspirations; and by developing capabilities and providing recognition.","te Riele, Kitty; Shelley, Becky",JAYS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375278/,147

So far, it is unclear what differential effects emerge from interindividual differences in technical equipment, and the willingness to use technology for coping with study requirements, and how both resources are related to student satisfaction with the learning media. Using structural equation models with survey data (N = 3332), we show that technical equipment and technology commitment explain interindividual differences in dealing with learning activities (ΔR(2) = 0.11), study organization (ΔR(2) = 0.16), and in satisfaction with digital learning media (ΔR(2) = 0.13). Technical equipment and technology commitment prove to be of comparable relevance for coping with the study requirements investigated. In contrast, satisfaction with digital learning media appears to be linked more strongly to technical equipment.

These are denoted N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain and are joined by a charged linker region rich in serine and arginine residues (SR linker). In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the NTD binds the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA, a conserved hexanucleotide sequence required for subgenomic RNA synthesis. The NTD is also capable of disrupting a short RNA duplex. We show here that three residues on the β3 (Arg-125 and Tyr-127) and β5 (Tyr-190) strands play key roles in TRS RNA binding and helix destabilization with Ala substitutions of these residues lethal to the virus. NMR studies of the MHV NTD·TRS complex revealed that this region defines a major RNA binding interface in MHV with site-directed spin labeling studies consistent with a model in which the adenosine-rich 3'-region of TRS is anchored by Arg-125, Tyr-127, and Tyr-190 in a way that is critical for efficient subgenomic RNA synthesis in MHV. Characterization of CoV N NTDs from infectious bronchitis virus and from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV revealed that, although detailed NTD-TRS determinants are distinct from those of MHV NTD, rapid helix destabilization activity of CoV N NTDs is most strongly correlated with CoV function and virus viability.","Keane, Sarah C; Liu, Pinghua; Leibowitz, Julian L; Giedroc, David P",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m111.287763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22241479/,147

60617,"Results from the blood donor competence, autonomy, and relatedness enhancement (blood donor CARE) randomized trial.",2021-07-05,"In 2016 the US National Institutes of Health introduced a policy mandating consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV) in preclinical research. In this article, I ask what, precisely, is meant by the designation of sex as a 'biological variable', and how has its inclusion come to take the form of a policy mandate? Given the well documented complexity of 'sex' and the degree to which it is politically and scientifically contested, its enactment via policy as a biological variable is not a given. I explore how sex is multiply enacted in efforts to legitimate and realize the SABV policy and consider how the analytical lens of co-production sheds light on how and why this occurs. I show that the policy works to reassert scientific and political order by addressing two institutional concerns: the so-called reproducibility crisis in preclinical research, and pervasive gender inequality across the institution of biomedicine. From here, the entity that underpins this effort - sex as a biological variable - becomes more than one thing, with enactments ranging from an assigned category, to an outcome, to a causal biological force in its own right. Sex emerges as simultaneously entangled with yet distinct from gender, and binary (female/male) yet complex in its variation. I suggest that it is in the very attempt to delineate natural from social order, and in the process create the conditions to privilege a particular kind of science and account of embodied difference, that ontological multiplicity becomes readily visible. That this multiplicity goes unrecognized points to the unifying role of an overarching ideological commitment to sex as a presumed binary and biological scientific object, the institutional dominance of which is never guaranteed.","Pape, Madeleine",Social studies of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312720985939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491581/,147

Phenanthrene is one of the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aquatic environments. In this study, different concentrations of phenanthrene were degraded by single-chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cells. The electrochemical parameter of microbial fuel cells and biofilm changes on the anode were observed. The results showed that the addition of phenanthrene reduced the power output of the microbial fuel cell which affected the process of microbial electricity generation. Meanwhile, microorganisms destroyed the original structure of phenanthrene through anaerobic metabolism, and achieved good average degradation of 94.9-98.4%. Observation of the anodic biofilm found that the microbes had tolerance to phenanthrene and the biofilm exhibited to be well-constructed. Bacterial community distribution showed a decrease in the relative abundance of Acidovorax and Aquamicrobium, whereas the relative content of the main electroactive organism, Geobacter, increased by a factor of three. The results show that it is feasible for microbial fuel cells to biodegrade phenanthrene, and provide some references for the changes of microbial community during degradation process.","Hua, Tao; Wang, Haonan; Li, Shengnan; Chen, Peng; Li, Fengxiang; Wang, Wei",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12226-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423195/,147
61010,Endoscopic Bariatric and Metabolic Therapies: Surgical Analogues and Mechanisms of Action.,2017,"BACKGROUND Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. METHODS Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words 'loneliness' and 'COVID-19'. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. RESULTS 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. CONCLUSIONS The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues. It also provides inspiration for potential interventions to address novel problems-such as loneliness-during COVID-19 pandemic.","Koh, Jing Xuan; Liew, Tau Ming",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.11.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190839/,147

In this study, reverse transcriptase PCR sequencing of the RNA genome of an isolate of the MHV ts virus Alb ts6, referred to as Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A, identified a putative ts mutation in nsp5 (T10651C, Val148Ala), the viral 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The introduction of the T10651C mutation into the infectious MHV clone resulted in the recovery of a mutant virus, the nsp5/V148A virus, that demonstrated reduced growth and nsp5 proteinase activity identical to that of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A at the nonpermissive temperature. Sequence analysis of 40 degrees C revertants of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A identified primary reversion to Ala148Val in nsp5, as well as two independent second-site mutations resulting in Ser133Asn and His134Tyr substitutions in nsp5. The introduction of the Ser133Asn or His134Tyr substitution into the cloned nsp5/V148A mutant virus background resulted in the recovery of viruses with increased growth fitness and the partial restoration of nsp5 activity at the nonpermissive temperature. Modeling of the nsp5 structure of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A predicted that the Val148Ala mutation alters residue 148 interactions with residues of the substrate binding S1 subsite of the nsp5 active-site cavity. This study identifies novel residues in nsp5 that may be important for regulating substrate specificity and nsp5 proteinase activity.","Sparks, Jennifer S; Donaldson, Eric F; Lu, Xiaotao; Baric, Ralph S; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00203-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385240/,147

It is, therefore, provocative to ask whether data can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy.Areas covered: We reviewed published examples in the search for the evidence on how the growing amount of data could change the way we used to assess the value of healthcare technologies, ensuring a more holistic approach in the decision-making process while reducing the waste in the healthcare.Expert Opinion: The growing amount of data will continue to provide a multitude of valuable insights that can save healthcare systems from bankruptcy. Electronic medical records, IoT, wearables, and mobile applications generate constant data streams that can be utilised endlessly thanks to methodological advancements such as SNA, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, and natural language programming. However, interoperability across these multiple data sources still pose a challenge for the future development of data-driven healthcare.

61510,Saline vs contrast infusion during optical coherence tomography imaging of peripheral percutaneous intervention.,2014,"Casein Kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε) is a member of the serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) CK1 family, known to have crucial roles in several biological scenarios and, ever more frequently, in pathological contexts, such as cancer. Recently, the human DEAD-box RNA helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X), involved in cancer proliferation and viral infections, has been identified as one of CK1ε substrates and its positive regulator in the Wnt/β-catenin network. However, the way by which these two proteins influence each other has not been fully clarified. In order to further investigate their interplay, we defined the kinetic parameters of CK1ε towards its substrates: ATP, casein, Dvl2 and DDX3X. CK1ε affinity for ATP depends on the nature of the substrate: increasing of casein concentrations led to an increase of KmATP, while increasing DDX3X reduced it. In literature, DDX3X is described to act as an allosteric activator of CK1ε. However, when we performed kinase reactions combining DDX3X and casein, we did not find a positive effect of DDX3X on casein phosphorylation by CK1ε, while both substrates were phosphorylated in a competitive manner. Moreover, CK1ε positively stimulates DDX3X ATPase activity. Our data provide a more detailed kinetic characterization on the functional interplay of these two proteins.","Bono, Bartolo; Franco, Giulia; Riva, Valentina; Garbelli, Anna; Maga, Giovanni",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899434/,147
61636,Racial Disproportionality in Covid Clinical Trials.,2020-11-06,"The meticulous regulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is required for the co-ordination of gastric motility and emptying, intestinal secretion, absorption, and transit as well as for the overarching management of food intake and energy homeostasis. Disruption of GI functions is associated with the development of severe GI disorders as well as the alteration of food intake and caloric balance. Functional GI disorders as well as the dysregulation of energy balance and food intake are frequently associated with, or result from, alterations in the central regulation of GI control. The faithful and rapid transmission of information from the stomach and upper GI tract to second order neurons of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) relies on the delicate modulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission, as does the relay of integrated signals from the NTS to parasympathetic efferent neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Many studies have focused on understanding the physiological and pathophysiological modulation of these glutamatergic synapses, although their role in the control and regulation of GI functions has lagged behind that of cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The purpose of this review is to examine the current literature exploring the role of glutamatergic transmission in the DVC in the regulation of Gl functions.","Clyburn, Courtney; Browning, Kirsteen N",American journal of physiology.

61866,Advanced esophageal cancer in patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation for barrett esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.,2013,"BACKGROUND Physicians are often dissatisfied with their own medical care. Self-prescribing is common despite established guidelines that discourage this practice. From a pilot study, we know primary care physicians' (PCP) preferences, but we lack information regarding other specialties and work places. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to examine whether physicians are satisfied with their personal primary care and how this could be improved. METHODS We distributed an electronic survey to all physicians registered with the Israeli Medical Association. The questionnaire examined satisfaction with medical care, preferences for using formal care versus informal care, self-prescribing and barriers to using formal care. RESULTS Two thousand three hundred and five out of 24 360 invited physicians responded. Fifty-six per cent of the respondents were satisfied with their personal primary care. Fifty-two per cent reported initiating self-treatment with a medication during the last year. Five and four per cent initiated treatment with a benzodiazepine and an antidepressant, respectively, during the last year. This was despite the fact that most physicians did not feel competent to treat themselves. Having a personal PCP was correlated with both a desire to use formal care and self-referral to formal care in practice. Regression analysis showed that the highest odds ratio (OR) for experiencing a large gap between desired and actual care were for physicians who had no personal PCP (OR = 1.92). CONCLUSIONS Physicians frequently engage in self-treatment and in informal medical care. Whether the root cause is the health care system structure that does not meet their needs or the convenience of self-treatment is not known.","Zacay, Galia; Baron-Epel, Orna; Malatskey, Lilach; Heymann, Anthony",Family practice,https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmaa090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839825/,147

METHODS We evaluated patients from our hospital database who underwent esophagectomy from August 2006 to January 2012 after previously receiving RFA for BE. Information on demographics, time between RFA and surgery, indications for surgery, and final esophageal pathology was collected. RESULTS In our study, we selected 102 patients who underwent esophagectomy. Five patients had a history of RFA for BE with HGD. Three patients were referred because of persistent HGD despite RFA, and all three patients had HGD in the esophagectomy specimen. Two patients presented with a benign diagnosis (esophageal perforation and leiomyoma), and both of these patients had pathologic stage T3N2M0 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in the resected specimen. One of these patients had normal mucosa overlying carcinoma in the muscularis propria and adventitia. The patients with stage T3N2M0 cancer did not have pre-RFA endoscopic ultrasound, first treatment of RFA with HALO, or surveillance endoscopic biopsy every 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation for BE with HGD may mask underlying esophageal cancer. Patients who are counseled to undergo RFA for HGD should be aware that RFA could lead to delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment of invasive esophageal cancer without careful patient selection, appropriate RFA use, and close surveillance.","Kim, Min P; Brown, Kendra N; Schwartz, Mary R; Blackmon, Shanda H",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0b013e31828db550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571789/,147
62087,The impact of gestational age on targeted amniotic cell profiling in experimental neural tube defects.,2015,"BACKGROUND Single-incision pediatric endosurgical (SIPES) appendectomy has been reported in few pediatric surgical centers. We have adopted the technique recently and have offered it to all patients in whom appendectomy was indicated. The purpose of this study was to report our experience with SIPES appendectomy for acute appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and interval appendectomy, and to compare the results with those from patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic appendectomy 1 year previously. METHODS After IRB approval, data on all SIPES appendectomies performed in our hospital were prospectively collected, including operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, conversion rate, blood loss, and hospital length of stay. Cases were stratified into three categories: acute appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and interval appendectomy. They were compared to patients operated on in 2007 using conventional laparoscopic (three-trocar) appendectomy. RESULTS During the study period, 75 SIPES appendectomies were undertaken. Mean age was 11 years (range = 2-19 years) and mean weight was 45 kg (range = 12-132 kg). All SIPES appendectomies were completed laparoscopically, and additional trocars were placed in 20% of cases. SIPES interval appendectomies took the longest and had the highest conversion rate (33%). Follow-up data was available in 63 patients (82%) at a median of 3 weeks. There were three wound infections in the SIPES group (4%) and one in the 151 control patients. Compared to historic controls, operative time was shorter with SIPES compared to conventional laparoscopy for acute appendicitis (37 ± 12.3 vs. 44.1 ± 20.3 min, p = 0.01, 95% CI = 32-42 min). CONCLUSION SIPES appendectomy is a very good alternative to the conventional laparoscopic approach, especially for acute appendicitis. It is technically more challenging for perforated appendicitis and interval appendectomy. Yet, with appropriate consideration and skill, scarless appendectomy is achievable.","Muensterer, Oliver J; Puga Nougues, Cecilia; Adibe, Obinna O; Amin, Sejal R; Georgeson, Keith E; Harmon, Carroll M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1115-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490556/,147

62444,Reflections of a Black woman physician-scientist.,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND The applicable law permits the use of information and communications technology (ICT) media in the process of providing health services, including preventive examinations. The right to perform preventive examinations using ICT should not be identified with an absolute obligation in this respect. An occupational medicine doctor may refuse to perform a preventive examination remotely if the specificity of medical activities and patient safety require personal contact with the doctor. The state of the epidemic prompted the legislator to adopt solutions enabling employees to continue working on the basis of an invalid decision, provided that it expired after March 7, 2020. The obligation to perform preventive examinations has been suspended, as a result of which their conduction during the epidemic is pointless. However, the obligations of the employee and the employer must be fulfilled in this respect immediately, but not later than within 60 days from the date of the epidemic cancellation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study uses the method of analyzing the currently applicable legal provisions allowing the use of ICT in the provision of health services. In addition, regulations governing the possibility of obliging employees to work remotely during the epidemic were also analyzed, together with the non-performance of preventive examinations and admissibility of work under a decision which had expired before March 7, 2020. RESULTS Current legal regulations are ambiguous and cause interpretation difficulties. The possibility of issuing decisions as a result of preventive examinations is a potential risk of liability for doctors who do not have specialist knowledge in the field of occupational medicine. CONCLUSIONS The solutions of the Act on COVID-19 regarding the performance of preventive examinations introduce new rights and obligations for employees and employers as well as doctors. Their implementation is necessary due to the purpose of the newly introduced regulations, whose task is to minimize the risk of the COVID-19 infection. At the same time, it is necessary to adopt a unified position with regard to the rights and obligations of doctors issuing decisions for the purposes specified in the Labor Code.

This creates challenges in the quality and quantity of research conducted. This issue is exacerbated by the potential heterogeneity in the reported outcomes in research examining the management of biliary atresia. A core outcome set is required to standardise reporting on the management of biliary atresia in research, facilitate systematic reviews that include outcomes of greatest importance to patients and clinicians, and to evaluate the quality of the existing evidence base on the management of biliary atresia. METHODS A list of all potential outcomes will be developed through a systematic review of the literature. This list will be refined through a three-stage Delphi approach, involving key stakeholders in the management of biliary atresia. This will include patients and their parents, clinicians, nurses and allied health professionals. In this way, outcomes will be prioritised into a set of consensus core outcomes.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported as a safe and effective approach for the management of liver cancer; however, its outcomes have not been evaluated in a large cohort of HCC patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 152 patients who underwent pure LRH (n = 37) or ORH (n = 115) between June 2008 and July 2015 at the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. We performed 1:1 propensity score matching between the LRH and ORH groups. Subsequently, 33 patients were included in each group. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between the LRH and ORH groups regarding the rate of complications (P = 0.053). However, the mean comprehensive complication index, which accounts for the severity of complications, was significantly lower in the LRH group (0.63 vs 4.42; P = 0.025). There were no significant differences between the LRH and ORH groups regarding 2-year disease-free survival rate or 2-year overall survival rate (P = 0.645 and P = 0.090, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Even in patients with cirrhosis, pure LRH is not less safe than the traditional open approach. The oncological outcomes of HCC were also comparable between the two groups. In selected patients, pure LRH for HCC appears to represent a viable alternative to ORH.","Yoon, Young-In; Kim, Ki-Hun; Kang, Sung-Hwa; Kim, Wan-Joon; Shin, Min-Ho; Lee, Sang-Kyung; Jung, Dong-Hwan; Park, Gil-Chun; Ahn, Chul-Soo; Moon, Deok-Bog; Ha, Tae-Yong; Song, Gi-Won; Hwang, Shin; Lee, Sung-Gyu",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27849661/,147

For lung segmentation in computed tomography, a variety of approaches exists, involving sophisticated pipelines trained and validated on different datasets. However, the clinical applicability of these approaches across diseases remains limited. METHODS We compared four generic deep learning approaches trained on various datasets and two readily available lung segmentation algorithms. We performed evaluation on routine imaging data with more than six different disease patterns and three published data sets. RESULTS Using different deep learning approaches, mean Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) on test datasets varied not over 0.02. When trained on a diverse routine dataset (n = 36), a standard approach (U-net) yields a higher DSC (0.97 ± 0.05) compared to training on public datasets such as the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (0.94 ± 0.13, p = 0.024) or Anatomy 3 (0.92 ± 0.15, p = 0.001). Trained on routine data (n = 231) covering multiple diseases, U-net compared to reference methods yields a DSC of 0.98 ± 0.03 versus 0.94 ± 0.12 (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS The accuracy and reliability of lung segmentation algorithms on demanding cases primarily relies on the diversity of the training data, highlighting the importance of data diversity compared to model choice. Efforts in developing new datasets and providing trained models to the public are critical. By releasing the trained model under General Public License 3.0, we aim to foster research on lung diseases by providing a readily available tool for segmentation of pathological lungs.","Hofmanninger, Johannes; Prayer, Forian; Pan, Jeanny; Röhrich, Sebastian; Prosch, Helmut; Langs, Georg",European radiology experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41747-020-00173-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814998/,147

Expert opinion: Vaccination campaigns should no longer be postponed or delayed; instead, they must be reactivated; governments, scientific societies and physicians must promote vaccination programs to avoid outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. On the eve of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, it is necessary to insist on the availability of sufficient doses to avoid dose shortages in disadvantaged areas of the region.","Ávila-Agüero, María L; Ospina-Henao, Sebastián; Pirez, María C; Gentile, Ángela; Araya, Soraya; Brea, José; Mendoza, Lourdes; Falleiros-Arlant, Luiza H",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1886930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33554682/,147
64166,Pharmacogenomics and analogues of the antitumour agent N6-isopentenyladenosine.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition (RAASi) is a cornerstone in the treatment of children with CKD, it is sometimes discontinued when kidney function declines. We studied the reasons of RAASi discontinuation and associations between RAASi discontinuation and important risk markers of CKD progression and on eGFR decline in the Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with CKD study. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS In this study, 69 children with CKD (67% male, mean age 13.7 years, mean eGFR 27 ml/min per 1.73 m2) who discontinued RAASi during prospective follow-up were included. Initial change in BP, albuminuria, and potassium after discontinuation were assessed (median time 6 months). Rate of eGFR decline (eGFR slope) during a median of 1.9 years before and 1.2 years after discontinuation were estimated using linear mixed effects modeling. RESULTS Physician-reported reasons for RAASi discontinuation were increase in serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, and symptomatic hypotension. After discontinuation of RAASi, BP and albuminuria increased, whereas potassium decreased. eGFR declined more rapidly after discontinuation of RAASi (-3.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval, -5.1 to -2.6) compared with the slope during RAASi treatment (-1.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval, -2.4 to -0.6; P=0.005). In contrast, no change in eGFR slope was observed in a matched control cohort of patients in whom RAASi was continued. CONCLUSIONS Discontinuation of RAASi in children with CKD is associated with an acceleration of kidney function decline, even in advanced CKD.","van den Belt, Sophie M; Heerspink, Hiddo J L; Kirchner, Marietta; Gracchi, Valentina; Thurn-Valsassina, Daniela; Bayazit, Aysun K; Niemirska, Anna; Canpolat, Nur; Kaplan Bulut, Ipek; Azukaitis, Karolis; Duzova, Ali; Bacchetta, Justine; Shroff, Rukshana; Paripovic, Dusan; Özçakar, Zeynep Birsin; Fidan, Kibriya; Erdogan, Hakan; Gellermann, Jutta; Wühl, Elke; de Zeeuw, Dick; Melk, Anette; Querfeld, Uwe; Schaefer, Franz",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.09750819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253275/,147
64254,Impact of statins and ACE inhibitors on mortality after COPD exacerbations.,2009,"Introduction Intravenous thrombolysis is the treatment of choice in patients presenting with high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. The role of percutaneous mechanical pulmonary thrombectomy (PMPT) is not fully established, although selected patients can be managed with this method. Aim This open-label single-centre prospective pilot study was aimed at assessing the feasibility of PMPT for the treatment of severe pulmonary embolism in a Polish hospital. We also evaluated the safety and efficacy of such management. Material and methods We managed 7 patients, aged 52.7 ±16.6 years, presenting with high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (4 patients with class 5 and one patient with class 4 of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index), with occlusion of at least 2 lobar arteries and contraindications for thrombolysis. Percutaneous mechanical pulmonary thrombectomy was performed using the AngioJet system. Results It was possible to introduce the thrombectomy system to the pulmonary arteries in all patients. The procedure was successful in 6 patients (technical success rate: 85.7%). Two (28.6%) patients died during the hospital stay, one patient with unsuccessful thrombectomy and the other due to pneumonia. In all survivors control echocardiography demonstrated normalised function of the right ventricle. Also, dyspnoea disappeared and blood gas parameters normalised. There was no recurrent thromboembolism during 3-14 months of follow-up. Conclusions In the Polish setting, in selected patients, management of high- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism with PMPT is technically feasible. Such treatment is relatively safe and effective. It can be an alternative to standard management, especially in patients with contraindications for fibrinolysis or surgical embolectomy.","Latacz, Paweł; Simka, Marian; Brzegowy, Pawel; Serednicki, Wojciech; Konduracka, Ewa; Mrowiecki, Wojciech; Słowik, Agnieszka; Łasocha, Bartłomiej; Mrowiecki, Tomasz; Popiela, Tadeusz",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2018.75848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002757/,147

The Community Coalition Action Theory (CCAT) is a form of theories for the change across organizations. A community coalition is a structured arrangement where all members can work together on a common goal and objective. The current article focuses on applications of the CCAT to provide a framework for the development of activities and interventions related to confronting Covid-19. Forming a coalition is very significant and can increase the effectiveness of interventional programs.

Over the following months, the virus rapidly spread throughout the world. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can involve the gastrointestinal tract, including symptoms like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 in feces. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which has been proven to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. According to the literature, rates of COVID-19 patients reporting diarrhea were between 7 - 14%. Diarrhea in the course of COVID-19 disease can cause dehydration and hospitalization. Although no antiviral drug was specifically designed for the treatment of diarrhea, several molecules could have beneficial effects by reducing viral replication. In this letter, we discussed the Levamisole, which is an anthelmintic agent with immunomodulatory effects, could be used effectively both for antiviral therapy and especially in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea.","Uyaroğlu, Oğuz Abdullah; Güven, Gülay Sain; Güllü, İbrahim",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32903227/,147

We described for the first time recombinant SeCoV circulating in Spain between 1993 and 2014 and its misidentification as PEDV when diagnostic assays based on the S-protein or S-gene of the PEDV were used. The complete S-gene sequence of 7 Spanish SeCoV and 30 PEDV Spanish isolates was phylogenetically analysed including the S-gene sequences of the three SeCoV and a representative selection of the PEDV strains with complete genome sequences available in the GenBank. The tree showed a common ancestor for the S-gene of the PEDV and SeCoV, but no evolution from any known PEDV clade was shown for the SeCoV strains. Moreover, complete genome sequences were obtained from 23 PEDV strains recovered in Spanish swine farms since 2014. The phylogenetic tree showed the INDEL type genogroup of these Spanish strains, supporting the lower pathogenicity of this genogroup since no significant economic losses were reported in the affected Spanish swine farms. Four subgroups were detected among PEDV strains in Spain, closely related to the recent European strains. Moreover, eight of the most recent Spanish PEDV isolates formed a subclade together with three European strains from 2015, showing a new evolution branch with a recombinant virus.","de Nova, Pedro J G; Cortey, Martí; Díaz, Ivan; Puente, Héctor; Rubio, Pedro; Martín, Marga; Carvajal, Ana",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511876/,147
65224,GPCR-ErbB transactivation pathways and clinical implications.,2021-07-22,"Fatigue is one of the most debilitating symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. When exposed to a physical or cognitive challenge, individuals with MS tend to exhibit greater declines in task performance (performance fatigability) and increased levels of self-reported fatigue (perceived fatigability), but these effects may be attenuated by greater intellectual capacity. The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of intelligence on fatigability in persons with MS. We hypothesized that greater intellectual capacity confers some protection against heightened levels of fatigue and fatigability associated with MS. Twelve adults with relapsing-remitting MS were compared with 12 control (CO) subjects who were matched for age, sex, and premorbid intellectual capacity. Performance fatigability was measured as the decline in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque after 60 isometric contractions (10 s contraction at 25% MVC, 5 s rest) performed with the knee extensor muscles. Perceived fatigability was assessed with the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) questionnaire (trait fatigability) and the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE, state fatigability). Persons with MS reported greater MFIS scores (MS: 43 ± 14; CO: 11 ± 8, P ≤ 0.001). Initial MVC torque for the knee extensors did not differ between the groups (MS: 112 ± 38 N⋅m; CO: 107 ± 44 N⋅m) and the decline (performance fatigability) was similar for both groups (MS: -16 ± 19 N⋅m; CO: -13 ± 16 N⋅m). RPE increased during the fatiguing contraction for both groups (P < 0.001) but was significantly greater in magnitude (main effect for group, P = 0.03) and increased more for the MS group (group × time interaction, P = 0.05). Torque steadiness declined during the fatiguing contractions (main effect for time, P = 0.05) and was less steady for the MS group (main effect for group, P = 0.02). Performance and full-4 IQ was correlated with the decline in torque steadiness for the MS group (r = -0.63, P < 0.05; r = -0.64, P < 0.05). Intellectual capacity was not associated with fatigability in persons with MS but was associated with adjustments in muscle activation during the fatiguing contractions.","Gould, Jeffrey R; Reineberg, Andrew E; Cleland, Brice T; Knoblauch, Kristi E; Clinton, Grace K; Banich, Marie T; Corboy, John R; Enoka, Roger M",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386250/,147

65455,Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase increases myofibril viscosity in cardiac myocytes.,2020-09-04,"The existing knowledge is insufficient to explain some infection events of SARS-CoV-2, and new ideas about the transmission modes may be needed. The present study proposes that the RNAs of this virus might be infectious and that the transmission of these RNAs might be one route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. I speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are infectious based on the following rationale and offer a putative mechanism: RNA is the most important biomolecule of the novel coronavirus for expression and replication, free RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to remain suspended in the air and retain their biological activity, and some exogenous RNAs can enter the host cell after contact. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. It is worthwhile to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 components (e.g., virus particles, positive RNA strands, negative RNA strands, and virus proteins) with symptoms to study the mechanism of asymptomatic infection. If additional detection results show that the proportion of RNA in the environment is higher than the proportion of RNA in the novel coronavirus particles, this would suggest the potential presence of free RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Research on the temporal and spatial distribution of infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA strands is necessary. The nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 should target not only positive RNA strands but also negative RNA strands. For medical purposes, studying environmental RNAs (eRNAs) is important. I believe that further investigation of the infection capabilities of viral RNAs will yield useful information.","Xu, Zhongneng",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031088/,147

We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. METHODS We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. RESULTS We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were ""perspectives"" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement ""in-person"" primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care.

65950,Task shifting: a common-sense approach in children with asthma?,2021-02-04,"Genetic causes for ageing are traditionally investigated within a species. Yet, the lifecycles of many organisms intersect. Additional evolutionary and genetic causes of ageing, external to a focal species/organism, may thus be overlooked. Here, we introduce the phrase and concept of age-distorters and its evidence. Age-distorters carry ageing interfering genes, used to manipulate the biological age of other entities upon which the reproduction of age-distorters relies, e.g. age-distorters bias the reproduction/maintenance trade-offs of cells/organisms for their own evolutionary interests. Candidate age-distorters include viruses, parasites and symbionts, operating through specific, genetically encoded interferences resulting from co-evolution and arms race between manipulative non-kins and manipulable species. This interference results in organismal ageing when age-distorters prompt manipulated organisms to favor their reproduction at the expense of their maintenance, turning these hosts into expanded disposable soma. By relying on reproduction/maintenance trade-offs affecting disposable entities, which are left ageing to the reproductive benefit of other physically connected lineages with conflicting evolutionary interests, the concept of age-distorters expands the logic of the Disposable Soma theory beyond species with fixed germen/soma distinctions. Moreover, acknowledging age-distorters as external sources of mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropic genes expands the scope of the mutation accumulation and of the antagonistic pleiotropy theories.","Teulière, Jérôme; Bernard, Charles; Bapteste, Eric",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2021.101375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082078/,147

Chinese herb medicines can provide valuable materials for discovery and development of new drugs. OBJECTIVE To screen constituents derived from Chinese herb medicines for their antiviral activity against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty constituents derived from Chinese herb medicines and B87 strain of IBDV were used. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC₅₀) and 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) were determined by visualization of cytopathologic effect (CPE) and 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) test on chicken embryo fibroblast. Selectivity index (SI) and inhibition ratio (%I) were calculated from the data obtained from the MTT test. RESULTS Antiviral assays showed dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride among the 20 constituents tested exhibited significant inhibitory activity against IBDV in a dose-dependent manner. EC₅₀ of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride were 663.2 ± 268.4 and 92.52 ± 21.13 µg/mL, and SI were >4.52 and >21.62, respectively. The time-of-addition and virucidal assay indicated that anti-IBDV activity of the two constituents could be due to their inhibiting virus replication and/or inactivating virus directly. The inhibition of virus attachment was not observed in the adsorption inhibition assay. Dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride exhibited more than 70% and 80% inhibition of IBDV, respectively, at the maximum safe concentration. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We believe that dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride can be used to develop a new anti-IBDV compound, and it is worth applying the constituents in clinical practice.","Sun, Yaogui; Song, Meiqin; Niu, Li; Bai, Xiyun; Sun, Na; Zhao, Xin; Jiang, Junbing; He, Junping; Li, Hongquan",Pharmaceutical biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2013.781197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607905/,147
66022,Molecular Landscape and Computational Screening of the Natural inhibitors against HPV16 E6 Oncoprotein.,2021-08-01,"Biological systems have a remarkable capability of synthesizing multifunctional materials that are adapted for specific physiological and ecological needs. When exploring structure-function relationships related to multifunctionality in nature, it can be a challenging task to address performance synergies, trade-offs, and the relative importance of different functions in biological materials, which, in turn, can hinder our ability to successfully develop their synthetic bioinspired counterparts. Here, we investigate such relationships between the mechanical and optical properties in a multifunctional biological material found in the highly protective yet conspicuously colored exoskeleton of the flower beetle, Torynorrhina flammea Combining experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that a micropillar-reinforced photonic multilayer in the beetle's exoskeleton simultaneously enhances mechanical robustness and optical appearance, giving rise to optical damage tolerance. Compared with plain multilayer structures, stiffer vertical micropillars increase stiffness and elastic recovery, restrain the formation of shear bands, and enhance delamination resistance. The micropillars also scatter the reflected light at larger polar angles, enhancing the first optical diffraction order, which makes the reflected color visible from a wider range of viewing angles. The synergistic effect of the improved angular reflectivity and damage localization capability contributes to the optical damage tolerance. Our systematic structural analysis of T. flammea's different color polymorphs and parametric optical and mechanical modeling further suggest that the beetle's microarchitecture is optimized toward maximizing the first-order optical diffraction rather than its mechanical stiffness. These findings shed light on material-level design strategies utilized in biological systems for achieving multifunctionality and could thus inform bioinspired material innovations.","Jia, Zian; Fernandes, Matheus C; Deng, Zhifei; Yang, Ting; Zhang, Qiuting; Lethbridge, Alfie; Yin, Jie; Lee, Jae-Hwang; Han, Lin; Weaver, James C; Bertoldi, Katia; Aizenberg, Joanna; Kolle, Mathias; Vukusic, Pete; Li, Ling",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101017118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140412/,147

Some responded faster than others, with considerable variations in strategy. After securing border control, primary health care approaches (public health and primary care) attempt to mitigate spread through public education to reduce person-to-person contact (hygiene and physical distancing measures, lockdown procedures), triaging of cases by severity, COVID-19 testing, and contact-tracing.

66513,The Role of Tocilizumab in Cytokine Storm and Improving Outcomes in COVID-19.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND The primary challenge of male-to-female reassignment surgery is to create natural-appearing female genitalia with neovaginal dimensions adequate for intercourse, neoclitoris sensitivity, and minimal risk of complications. Surgical positioning is an important component of the procedure that successfully minimizes the risk of morbidity. OBJECTIVE We modified various vaginoplasty techniques to better position the urethral neomeatus in the proper anatomic location to minimize the chance for complications and enhance aesthetic satisfaction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We retrospectively reviewed data stored in a prospective database for 24 consecutive patients who underwent male-to-female gender reassignment at a German university clinic between January 2007 and March 2011. SURGICAL PROCEDURE First, orchiectomy and penile disassembly are performed with the patient in the supine position. Both corpora cavernosa are resected with the patient in the lithotomy position, and neovaginal construction is accomplished with the incorporation of the penile urethra into the penile shaft skin. The glans is preserved and resized to form the neoclitoris. The assembled neovagina is inverted, inserted into the expanded rectoprostatic space, and secured to the sacrospinous ligament. Scrotal skin is tailored to create the labia. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Complications and patient satisfaction with neovaginal depth, appearance, neoclitoral sensation, and capacity for sexual intercourse were evaluated. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean neovaginal depth was 11cm (range: 10-14cm); median follow-up was 39.7 mo (range: 19-69 mo). All patients reported satisfactory vaginal functionality. One patient noted stenosis after 4 yr that was histologically confirmed as lichen sclerosus. Neoclitoral sensation was good or excellent in 97% of patients; 33% reported regular intercourse. No major complications were observed. Because this is a retrospective review to describe a complex reconstructive surgery and illustrate these techniques in the accompanying intraoperative surgery-in-motion video, no control group was undertaken.

METHODS Prospective, randomized, multicenter study conducted between April 2005 and December 2009. The principal endpoint was the recurrence rate of stage 2 or more anterior vaginal wall prolapse 12 months after surgery. Secondary endpoints consisted of functional results and mesh-related morbidity. RESULTS One hundred and forty-seven patients were included, randomized and analyzed: 72 in the anterior colporrhaphy group and 75 in the mesh group. The anatomical success rate was significantly higher in the mesh group (89%) than in the colporrhaphy group (64%) (p = 0.0006). Anatomical and functional recurrence was also less frequent in the mesh group (31.3% vs 52.2%, p = 0.007). Two patients (2.8%) were reoperated on in the colporrhaphy group for anterior vaginal wall prolapse recurrence. No significant difference was noted regarding minor complications. An erosion rate of 9.5% was noted. De novo dyspareunia occurred in 1/14 patients in the colporrhaphy group and in 3/13 patients in the mesh group. An analysis of the quality of life questionnaires showed an overall improvement in both groups, with no statistical difference between them. Satisfaction rates were high in both groups (92% in the colporrhaphy group and 96% in the mesh group). CONCLUSION Trans-obturator Ugytex mesh used to treat anterior vaginal wall prolapse gives better 1-year anatomical results than traditional anterior colporrhaphy, but with small a increase in morbidity in the mesh group.","de Tayrac, R; Cornille, A; Eglin, G; Guilbaud, O; Mansoor, A; Alonso, S; Fernandez, H",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-013-2075-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512113/,147

However, the evidence is inadequate for the general adaptation of robotic colon surgery. This study aimed to show the oncologic and perioperative clinical results of robotically assisted anterior resection (R-AR) compared with those of laparoscopically assisted anterior resection (L-AR) for sigmoid colon cancer. METHODS A total of 180 patients (sigmoid colon cancer stages 1-3) were assigned to receive either R-AR (n = 34) or L-AR (n = 146) between April 2006 and September 2008. Patient characteristics, perioperative clinical results, and long-term oncologic outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean operation time was 217.6 ± 70.7 min for L-AR versus 252.5 ± 94.9 min for R-AR (p = 0.016). The total postoperative complication rate was 10.3 % for R-AR versus 5.9 % for L-AR (p = 0.281). The 3-year overall survival rate for all the patients was 93.4 % for L-AR versus 92.1 % for R-AR (p = 0.723). The 3-year overall survival rate was 100 % for both L-AR and R-AR in stage 1, 95.5 % for L-AR versus 100 % for R-AR (p = 0.386) in stage 2, and 88.4 % for L-AR versus 72.9 % (p = 0.881) for R-AR in stage 3. CONCLUSION In this study, R-AR showed safety and feasibility in terms of perioperative clinical and long-term oncologic outcomes. However, the advanced technologies of R-AR did not translate into better long-term oncologic outcomes compared with L-AR.","Lim, Dae Ro; Min, Byung Soh; Kim, Min Sung; Alasari, Sami; Kim, Gangmi; Hur, Hyuk; Baik, Seung Hyuk; Lee, Kang Young; Kim, Nam Kyu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2619-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23239297/,147

67854,Factors associated with postsurgical wound infections among breast cancer patients: A retrospective case-control record review.,2020-06-12,"Studies on functional molecules starting from syntheses of cysteine-containing peptides and protein are described. Starting from evaluation of a cysteine specific side-reaction, a specific reaction for disulfide-bond formation was developed. The reaction made it possible to independently construct a disulfide bridge without effecting the existing disulfide bonds, which resulted in a unique approach for the synthesis of human insulin by site-specific disulfide bond formation. In a series of studies on sulfur-containing amino acids, another cysteine related un-natural amino acid, α-methyl cysteine, was used for the total syntheses of natural products containing a unique thiazorine/thiazole ring system. Chloroimidazolidium coupling reagent developed by us was effective for the successive couplings of the α-methyl cysteine residues. Based on these synthetic studies, design and evaluation of protease inhibitors were then studied, since a stereo-specific synthesis of the key structure is crucial to make the inhibitor an effective functional molecule in the interactions with its target protease. As the target proteases, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and chymotrypsin-like protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS 3CL protease) were selected: the former is a crucial enzyme for amyloid β production and the latter is an essential enzyme for the re-construction of SARS corona virus in host cells. Structure optimization procedure of the respective inhibitors are described based on X-ray crystal structure analyses of the inhibitor-protease complex.","Akaji, Kenichi",Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,https://doi.org/10.1248/yakushi.20-00209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518643/,147
67918,Percutaneous imaging-guided ablation therapies in the treatment of symptomatic bone metastases: preliminary experience.,2009,"We identified novel linear epitopes on the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike S2 region. The conformational structure of the IBV spike protein was predicted from a homologous protein, human coronavirus NL63 spike. Although the obtained structure was incomplete, most of the IBV spike protein structure was predicted; the N-terminus of the S1 region could not be predicted due to its variability. In the model, the region located in the proximity of the fusion peptide appeared to be well conserved, and we evaluated the antigenicity of these domains, which are involved in the membrane fusion machinery. Western blotting revealed that IBV TM86 spike residues 686-723 were antigenic. Epitope mapping analysis using synthesized peptides revealed that IBV TM86 spike 669-685 (SNFSTGAFNISLLLTPP), 686-697 (SNPRGRSFIEDL), and 692-703 (SFIEDLLFTSVE) residues were major linear epitopes; two identified epitopes (686-697 and 692-703) were covered by the fusion peptide, and the other epitope (669-685) was adjacent to the fusion peptide. Although the identified epitopes are identically located as the neutralizing epitope in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the recombinant protein that includes those epitopes could not elicit neutralizing antibodies against IBV. This is the first report describing IBV spike S2 epitopes located in the proximity of the fusion peptide, and it is suggested that the spike fusion machinery of IBV may differ from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or, alternatively, IBV may have another mechanism to penetrate the cell membrane.","Andoh, Kiyohiko; Ashikaga, Kanako; Suenaga, Kiyotaka; Endo, Shun; Yamazaki, Kenichi",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11796-011518-reg.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944406/,147
67974,Editorial: Targeting Angiogenesis to Treat Autoimmune Diseases and Cancer.,2020,"Multiple pesticides originating from plant protection treatments and the treatment of pests infecting honey bees are frequently detected in beehive matrices. Therefore, winter honey bees, which have a long life span, could be exposed to these pesticides for longer periods than summer honey bees. In this study, winter honey bees were exposed through food to the insecticide imidacloprid, the fungicide difenoconazole and the herbicide glyphosate, alone or in binary and ternary mixtures, at environmental concentrations (0 (controls), 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/L) for 20 days. The survival of the honey bees was significantly reduced after exposure to these 3 pesticides individually and in combination. Overall, the combinations had a higher impact than the pesticides alone with a maximum mortality of 52.9% after 20 days of exposure to the insecticide-fungicide binary mixture at 1 μg/L. The analyses of the surviving bees showed that these different pesticide combinations had a systemic global impact on the physiological state of the honey bees, as revealed by the modulation of head, midgut and abdomen glutathione-S-transferase, head acetylcholinesterase, abdomen glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and midgut alkaline phosphatase, which are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, the nervous system, defenses against oxidative stress, metabolism and immunity, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of studying the effects of chemical cocktails based on low realistic exposure levels and developing long-term tests to reveal possible lethal and adverse sublethal interactions in honey bees and other insect pollinators.","Almasri, Hanine; Tavares, Daiana Antonia; Pioz, Maryline; Sené, Déborah; Tchamitchian, Sylvie; Cousin, Marianne; Brunet, Jean-Luc; Belzunces, Luc P",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888588/,147

SUBJECTS AND METHODS It's a cross-sectional study. The participants were 155 respondents recruited online in the period 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020, who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. RESULTS Mean score of depression resulted 10.94 (SD=9.22). 63% of participants agreed that the situation has worsened their psychological state; 35.6% had a mild to severe form of depression and 18.7% had minimal symptoms. 13.4% of participants saw iCBT as helpful, 16.8% a little while 65.8% wanted to try it. Significantly higher depression resulted for females and age-group 18 to 24 years. No significant differences by levels of education, marital status, employment, socio-economic status and by expectations regarding iCBT. Gender and perception of worsened psychological state showed predictive abilities for depression. CONCLUSION The situation with Covid-19 has increased depression levels especially among females and 18 to 24 years old and thus expectations for e-psychotherapy. Online treatments seem feasible solutions for outbreak times.

People with social care needs experience increased risks of death and deteriorating physical and mental health with COVID-19. Social isolation introduced to reduce COVID-19 transmission may adversely affect well-being. While the need for social care rises, the ability of families and social care staff to provide support is reduced by illness and quarantine, implying reductions in staffing levels. Consequently, COVID-19 could seriously threaten care availability and quality. The government has sought volunteers to work in health and social care to help address the threat posed by staff shortages at a time of rising need, and the call has achieved an excellent response. The government has also removed some barriers to effective coordination between health and social care, while introducing measures to promote the financial viability of care providers.

METHODS Fifty patients (69 years, ± 12.1, 40-90, 50% female) with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions were included. Early infarct volumes were analyzed in monoenergetic images (MonoIm) and wMDIm at 60 keV and compared with the fiV in SECT 4.9 days (± 4) after thrombectomy. Association between infarct volume and functional outcome was tested by linear regression analysis. RESULTS wMDIm shows a prior visible infarct demarcation (60.7 ml, ± 74.9 ml) compared with the MonoIm (37.57 ml, ± 76.7 ml). Linear regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients show a close correlation of infarct volume in wMDIm to the fiV in SECT (r = 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.92), compared with MonoIm and SECT (r = 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.89). The agreement with SECT is substantially higher in patients with infarct volumes < 70 ml (n = 33; 66%). Coefficients were smaller with r = 0.59 (95% CI 0.31; 0.78) for MonoIm and SECT compared with r = 0.77 (95% CI 0.57; 0.88) for wMDIm and SECT. At admission, the mean NIHSS score and mRS were 17.02 (± 4.7) and 4.9 (± 0.2). mRS ≤ 2 was achieved in 56% at 90 days with a mean mRS of 2.5 (± 0.8) at discharge. CONCLUSION Material decomposition allows earlier visibility of the final infarct volume.

METHOD A search on four databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Virtual Health Library and Web of Science, was conducted from 2006 to 2020. The available SRs/MAs of in vitro studies were evaluated. DARE tool was applied to assess the risk of bias of included articles. Our protocol was developed and uploaded to ResearchGate in June 2016. RESULTS Our findings reported an increasing trend in publication of in vitro SRs/MAs from 2007 to 2020. Among the 244 included SRs/MAs, 126 articles (51.6%) had conducted the QA procedure. Overall, 51 QA tools were identified; 26 of them (51%) were developed by the authors specifically, whereas 25 (49%) were pre-constructed tools. SRs/MAs in dentistry frequently had their own QA tool developed by the authors, while SRs/MAs in other topics applied various QA tools. Many pre-structured tools in these in vitro SRs/MAs were modified from QA tools of in vivo or clinical trials, therefore, they had various criteria. CONCLUSION Many different QA tools currently exist in the literature; however, none cover all critical aspects of in vitro SRs/MAs.

Post-insertion complications were observed in 6.5% and 11.1% of patients with PICC and CICC, respectively, and this difference was not significant. The incidence of catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was significantly lower in PICC than CICC patients (0.3 vs. 1.8 / 1,000 catheter-days ; p = 0.029). Catheter-related thrombosis was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6, and occlusion due to blood flow reversal was observed in PICC : 0.5 and CICC : 0.6. Conclusion : PICCs are safer and more effective than CICCs for the treatment of esophageal cancer, and reduce the incidence of CRBSI. We hope to standardize the insertion procedures, conventionalize techniques, and establish training systems. J. Med.

70632,The development of multi-kinase inhibitors as pancreatic cancer therapeutics.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Studies have shown that obesity is associated with venous flow disturbances that lead to changes of the biomechanical forces on the venous wall known as shear stress. We hypothesized that weight loss due to bariatric surgery affects the venous hemodynamics and biomechanical forces on the venous wall. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on the wall shear stress (WSS) and the venous hemodynamics of the femoral vein. METHODS We studied ten morbidly obese patients who underwent LSG. We investigated venous hemodynamics before, 6 and 12 months after LSG. The femoral vein diameter, cross-sectional area, peak (PeakV) and maximum (TAmax) velocities, WSS, and shear rate (SR) were assessed. RESULTS PeakV and TAmax were significantly lower in the obese patients compared with the control group. WSS and SR were significantly lower in the obese patients compared with the control subjects. Venous hemodynamic parameters increased in the postoperative period at baseline compared with 12 months after surgery: PeakV increased from 17.53 (14.25-20.01) cm/s to 25.1 (20.9-30.1) cm/s (P = 0.04) and the TAmax from 12.97 (11.51-14.6) cm/s to 18.46 (13.24-24.13) cm/s (P = 0.057). WSS significantly increased from 0.21 (0.19-0.23) Pa at baseline to 0.31 (0.23-0.52) Pa 12 months after surgery (P = 0.031). SR also significantly increased from 47.92 (43.93-58.55) s(-1) at baseline to 76.81 (54.04-109.5) s(-1) 12 months after surgery (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that weight loss due to LSG significantly changes the biomechanical forces on the femoral vein generated by blood flow.","Wiewiora, Maciej; Piecuch, Jerzy; Glück, Marek; Slowinska-Lozynska, Ludmila; Sosada, Krystyn",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-1175-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24421156/,147

70841,How Can Routine Clinical Laboratories Keep Up with the Opioid Crisis?,2021-01-30,"BACKGROUND Due to intimal hyperplasia instent reobstruction in the femoropopliteal arterial segment is still an unsolved problem. Different techniques have been discussed in case of reintervention to guarantee longlasting patency rate. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled, pilot trial comparing Silverhawk atherectomy with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with a first instent reobstruction in the femoropopliteal arterial segment, to evaluate intima media thickness (IMT) within the treated segment, as a parameter of recurrence of intimal hyperplasia. RESULTS In a total 19 patients were included: 9 patients in the atherectomy device and 10 patients in the PTA arm. IMT within the treated segment was statistically significantly elevated in all patients treated with the Silverhawk device versus the patients treated with PTA. The obvious differentiation in elevation of IMT in nonfavor for patients treated with the Silverhawk device started at month 2 (max IMT SH 0.178 mm vs. IMT PTA 0.1 mm, p = 0.001) with a spike at month 5 (max IMT SH 0.206 mm vs. IMT PTA 0.145 mm, p = 0.003) and a decline once again at month 6 (max IMT SH 0.177 mm vs. IMT PTA 0.121 mm, p = 0.02). The values for mean IMT performed the same way. CONCLUSIONS Although Silverhawk atherectomy provides good results at first sight, in the midterm follow-up of treatment of first instent restenosis it did not perform better than PTA as it showed elevated reoccurrence of intimal media hyperplasia.","Brodmann, Marianne; Rief, Peter; Froehlich, Harald; Dorr, Andreas; Gary, Thomas; Eller, Philipp; Hafner, Franz; Deutschmann, Hannes; Seinost, Gerald; Pilger, Ernst",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0479-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23007223/,147
71038,Pyruvate carboxylase and cancer progression.,2021-04-30,"Patient-provider communication is a hallmark of high-quality care and patient safety; however, the pace and increasingly complex challenges that face overextended teams strain even the most dedicated clinicians. The COVID-19 pandemic has further disrupted communication between clinicians and their patients and families. The dependence on phone communication and the physical barriers of protective gear limit nonverbal communication and diminish clinicians' ability to recognize and respond to emotion. Developing new approaches to teach communication skills to trainees who are often responsible for communicating with patients and their families is challenging, especially during a pandemic or other crisis. ""Just-in-time"" simulation-simulation-based training immediately before an intervention-provides the scaffolding and support trainees need for conducting difficult conversations, and it enhances patients' and families' experiences. Using a realistic scenario, the author illustrates key steps for effectively using just-in-time simulation-based communication training: assessing the learner's understanding of the situation; determining what aspects of the encounter may prove most challenging; providing a script as a cognitive aid; refreshing or teaching a specific skill; preparing learners emotionally through reflection and mental rehearsal; coaching on the approach, pace, and tone for a delivery that conveys empathy and meaning; and providing specific, honest, and curious feedback to close a performance gap. Additionally, the author acknowledges that clinical conditions sometimes require learning by observing rather than doing and has thus provided guidance for making the most of vicarious observational learning: identify potential challenges in the encounter and explicitly connect them to trainee learning goals; explain why a more advanced member of the team is conducting the conversation; ask the trainee to observe and prepare feedback; choose the location carefully; identify everyone's role at the beginning of the conversation; debrief; share reactions; and thank the trainee for their feedback and observations.","Rock, Laura K",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769341/,147
71331,Intraoral Human Herpes Viruses Detectable by PCR in Majority of Patients.,2020-07-01,"The relationship between the inoculum dose and the ability of the pathogen to invade the host is poorly understood. Experimental studies in non-human primates infected with different inoculum doses of hepatitis B virus have shown a non-monotonic relationship between dose magnitude and infection outcome, with high and low doses leading to 100% liver infection and intermediate doses leading to less than 0.1% liver infection, corresponding to CD4 T-cell priming. Since hepatitis B clearance is CD8 T-cell mediated, the question of whether the inoculum dose influences CD8 T-cell dynamics arises. To help answer this question, we developed a mathematical model of virus-host interaction following hepatitis B virus infection. Our model explains the experimental data well, and predicts that the inoculum dose affects both the timing of the CD8 T-cell expansion and the quality of its response, especially the non-cytotoxic function. We find that a low-dose challenge leads to slow CD8 T-cell expansion, weak non-cytotoxic functions, and virus persistence; high- and medium-dose challenges lead to fast CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance; while a super-low-dose challenge leads to delayed CD8 T-cell expansion, strong cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic function, and virus clearance. These results are useful for designing immune cell-based interventions.","Ciupe, Stanca M; Vaidya, Naveen K; Forde, Jonathan E",Proceedings.

We hypothesized that the increase in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) with age is due to increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection and is thus associated with the pathogenesis of the renal small artery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 122 patients with CKD (stages 1-5) who underwent renal biopsy and ABI measurements between 2010 and 2013. Renal small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT) severity was assessed by semiquantitative grading. The median age was 47 years, with a range of 15-86 years (47% women). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared with patients with the lowest 1-3 SA-IT index quartile, those with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index were older in age had higher mean arterial pressure, ABI, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and lower eGFR. ABI was positively associated with SA-IT severity and inversely associated with eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that ABI was significantly associated with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.26) and low eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.03). In conclusion, a high normal ABI was associated with severe renal small artery intimal thickening and low eGFR in patients with CKD.","Zamami, Ryo; Ishida, Akio; Miyagi, Tsuyoshi; Yamazato, Masanobu; Kohagura, Kentaro; Ohya, Yusuke",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41440-020-0443-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346139/,147

An overview of historical events and experiences may be valuable in predicting future developments and potential effects of the crisis on healthcare systems and health in general. An analysis of past crises as well as current health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the healthcare system can facilitate the comprehension of the mechanisms of action and consequences of economic recession. It may also help identify guidelines and changes that might reduce the potential damage caused by future crises. The historical examples presented show that a crisis could trigger changes, which, in theiressence, are not necessarily negative. The response of society as a whole determines the direction of these changes, and it is up to society to transform the negative circumstances brought about by the recession into activities that contribute to general well-being and progress.","Kaštelan, Snježana; Kasun, Boris; Kaštelan, Uršula; Radonjić, Milena; Sopta, Martina",Acta medico-historica adriatica : AMHA,https://doi.org/10.31952/amha.18.2.8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535767/,147

71720,Endoscopic vacuum therapy in the management of anastomotic insufficiency after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,2012,"MOTIVATION Oxford Nanopore sequencing producing long reads at low cost has made many breakthroughs in genomics studies. However, the large number of errors in Nanopore genome assembly affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Polishing is a procedure to correct the errors in genome assembly and can improve the reliability of the downstream analysis. However, the performances of the existing polishing methods are still not satisfactory. RESULTS We developed a novel polishing method, NeuralPolish, to correct the errors in assemblies based on alignment matrix construction and orthogonal Bi-GRU networks. In this method, we designed an alignment feature matrix for representing read-to-assembly alignment. Each row of the matrix represents a read, and each column represents the aligned bases at each position of the contig. In the network architecture, a bi-directional GRU network is used to extract the sequence information inside each read by processing the alignment matrix row by row. After that, the feature matrix is processed by another bi-directional GRU network column by column to calculate the probability distribution. Finally, a CTC decoder generates a polished sequence with a greedy algorithm. We used five real data sets and three assembly tools including Wtdbg2, Flye and Canu for testing, and compared the results of different polishing methods including NeuralPolish, Racon, MarginPolish, HELEN and Medaka. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralPolish achieves more accurate assembly with fewer errors than other polishing methods and can improve the accuracy of assembly obtained by different assemblers.

Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and Drp1-associated mitochondrial fragmentation in mitophagy and cytotoxicity after Cr(VI) exposure has not been clarified so far. We confirmed that Cr(VI) caused mitochondrial fission by up-regulating Drp1 expression and enhancing Drp1 mitochondrial translocation. By applying the intracellular Ca2+ antagonist BAPTA-AM and mitochondrial Ca2+ antagonist Ru360, we demonstrated that Cr(VI)-induced excessive mitochondrial fission was in a Ca2+-Drp1 dependent manner. The administration of Drp1 siRNA significantly suppressed the overactivation of mitophagy in Cr(VI)-induced hepatotoxicity. The specific Drp1 inhibitor mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) blocked the overactive mitophagy and subsequently ameliorated hepatotoxicity caused by Cr(VI) in vivo. We reached the conclusion that Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission contributes to Cr(VI)-induced mitophagy and hepatotoxicity, which may provide experimental basis for the study of chromium-associated toxicity, especially for the prevention of health damage in chromium-exposed population.","Zhang, Yujing; Ma, Yu; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Lu, Chan; Xiao, Fang",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888618/,147

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is responsible for the current global pandemic. Early in the course of the pandemic, New York City became one of the world's ""hot spots"" with more than 250,000 cases and more than 15,000 deaths. Although medical providers in New York were fortunate to have the knowledge gained in China and Italy before it came under siege, the magnitude and severity of the disease were unprecedented and arguably under appreciated. The surge of patients with significant COVID-19 threatened to overwhelm health care systems, as New York City health systems realized that the number of specialized critical care providers would be inadequate. A large academic medical system recognized that rapid redeployment of noncritical providers into such roles would be needed. An educational gap was therefore identified: numerous providers with minimal critical care knowledge or experience would now be required to provide critical-level patient care under supervision of intensivists. Safe provision of such high level of patient care mandated the development of ""educational crash courses."" METHODS The purpose of this special article is to summarize the approach adopted by the Institute for Critical Care Medicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine's Human Emulation, Education, and Evaluation Lab for Patient Safety and Professional Study Simulation Center in developing a training program for noncritical care providers in this novel disease. RESULTS Using this joint approach, we were able to swiftly educate a wide range of nonintensive care unit providers (such as surgical, internal medicine, nursing, and advanced practice providers) by focusing on refreshing critical care knowledge and developing essential skillsets to assist in the care of these patients.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. The index test consisted of temperature measurement with TAT. The reference test consisted of an estimation of core temperature. PARTICIPANTS Clinical patients as well as healthy participants, with or without fever. INTERVENTIONS Literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and Web of Science. Three reviewers selected articles for full-text reading after which a further selection was made. Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2. Pooled difference and limits of agreement (LoA) were estimated with an inverse variance weighted approach. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated using hierarchical models. Quality of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE system. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was measurement accuracy expressed as mean difference ± 95% LoA. A secondary outcome was sensitivity and specificity to detect fever. If tympanic thermometers were assessed in the same population as TAT, these results were recorded as well. RESULTS 37 articles comprising 5026 participants were selected. Pooled difference was -0.19 °C (95% LoA -1.16 to 0.77 °C), with moderate quality of evidence. Pooled sensitivity was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.81) with a specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). The subgroup analysis revealed a trend towards underestimation of the temperature for febrile patients. There was a large heterogeneity among included studies with wide LoA which reduced the quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS TAT is not sufficiently accurate to replace one of the reference methods such as rectal, bladder or more invasive temperature measurement methods. The results are, however, similar to those with tympanic thermometers, both in our meta-analysis and when compared with others. Thus, it seems that TAT could replace tympanic thermometers with the caveat that both methods are inaccurate.

METHODS From January 2013 to October 2014, 96 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal masses at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Computed tomography angiography was carried out 3-4 days after surgery. Early in the series, renal hilum was left unclamped and renorrhaphy was subsequently carried out (conventional unclamping technique). An early unclamping technique has been used since November 2013. RESULTS A total of 61 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with early unclamping, and 35 patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with conventional unclamping. Ischemia time was significantly shorter in the early unclamping group (16.5 vs. 23.1 min; P < 0.01). The early unclamping group showed a significantly lower incidence of asymptomatic renal artery pseudoaneurysm relative to the conventional unclamping group (11.4% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that the early unclamping technique was a significant independent factor in reducing the risk of renal artery pseudoaneurysm (hazard ratio 0.27; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The present findings suggest that an early unclamping technique might reduce ischemic time and risk of renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The absence of arterial bleeding before renorrhaphy is likely to be a key step in preventing renal artery pseudoaneurysm during robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.","Kondo, Tsunenori; Takagi, Toshio; Morita, Satoru; Omae, Kenji; Hashimoto, Yasunobu; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Iizuka, Junpei; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Fukuda, Norihiro; Tanabe, Kazunari",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307333/,147

We devised a simplified but effective laparoscopic procedure that provides a better visual field to perform safe lymph node dissection more quickly. First, a mini-laparotomy is done and a clear visual field is created by pulling a mini-retractor to the right or left. The laparoscopic procedure is made easier and safer by taping the stomach body, and by using the fringe of an abdominal wall sealing device (Lapdisk) placed behind the stomach, and a scope holder for the snake-retractor. The lymph nodes along the common hepatic vessels, left gastric vessels, and celiac artery (extraperigastric lymph nodes) are then dissected laparoscopically. The suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes are dissected through the mini-laparotomy incision and gastroduodenostomy is done using an anastomotic device. We performed laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in 70 patients with gastric carcinomas located in the distal stomach (mean body mass index: 24.3). The mean operating time was 170 min and blood loss was minimal. All patients recovered well with minimal pain and good postoperative quality of life. We conclude that our simple and practical procedure for LADG with extraperigastric lymph node dissection can be performed safely and easily.","Suwa, Tatsushi; Yoshida, Masashi; Kubota, Keisuke; Kuroda, Junko; Sakuma, Masayoshi; Kitajima, Masaki",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-008-3780-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19132477/,147
72602,Update on neuroimaging in disorders of consciousness.,2021-05-28,"OBJECTIVE To systematically review the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for improving obstetric and gynecologic health outcomes. DATA SOURCES We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Qualifying primary studies had a comparison group, were conducted in countries ranked very high on the United Nations Human Development Index, published in English, and evaluated obstetric and gynecologic health outcomes. Cochrane Collaboration's tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, RESULTS Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms. CONCLUSION Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice.","DeNicola, Nathaniel; Grossman, Daniel; Marko, Kathryn; Sonalkar, Sarita; Butler Tobah, Yvonne S; Ganju, Nihar; Witkop, Catherine T; Henderson, Jillian T; Butler, Jessica L; Lowery, Curtis",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31977782/,147
72624,Protective Variants in Alzheimer's Disease.,2019-03-01,"Visual statistical learning describes the encoding of structure in sensory input, and it has important consequences for cognition and behaviour. Higher-order brain regions in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices have been associated with statistical learning behaviours. Yet causal evidence of a cortical contribution remains limited. In a recent study, the modulation of cortical activity by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) disrupted statistical learning in a spatial contextual cueing phenomenon; supporting a cortical role. Here, we examined whether the same tDCS protocol would influence statistical learning assessed by the Visual Statistical Learning phenomenon (i.e., Fiser and Aslin, 2001), which uses identity-based regularities while controlling for spatial location. In Experiment 1, we employed the popular exposure-test design to tap the learning of structure after passive viewing. Using a large sample (N = 150), we found no effect of the tDCS protocol when compared to a sham control nor to an active control region. In Experiment 2 (N = 80), we developed an online task that was sensitive to the timecourse of learning. Under these task conditions, we did observe a stimulation effect on learning, consistent with the previous work. The way tDCS affected learning appeared to be task-specific; expediting statistical learning in this case. Together with the existing evidence, these findings support the hypothesis that cortical areas are involved in the visual statistical learning process, and suggest the mechanisms of cortical involvement may be task-dependent and dynamic across time.","Nydam, Abbey S; Sewell, David K; Dux, Paul E",Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069791/,147

72900,Interventional therapy for hypertension: Back on track again?,2017,"Extreme prolonged drought over south-eastern Australia a decade ago (the Millennium Drought, 1996-2010) triggered extensive acid sulfate soil oxidation and associated acidification. Whilst the significant release of metal-enriched drainage has been documented during this event, the fate of these elements in receiving systems is still largely unknown. Here we investigate the spatial distribution, chemical partitioning, and potential bioavailability of S, Fe, Mn, Al, trace metals (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb) and rare earth elements in the surficial sediments of Lake Albert, South Australia; a system that received prolonged (2007-2011) acidic drainage during the Millennium Drought. The highest concentrations of all metals (Enrichment Factors ranging from 1.06-1.97) were observed in the sediments closest to shorelines where sulfidic material were oxidised, generating metal-enriched acidic drainage. Localised enrichment indicates metals have not been completely redistributed across the system following their initial deposition by physical (wind-driven resuspension) or chemical (diagenetic and redox changes) processes. Based on selective extraction data, these metals are likely partitioned as discrete sulfides (Pb) or are with organic material (V, Cr, Cu, Pb, REEs), Fe monosulfides (V, Co, Ni), or pyrite (Co, Ni, Pb). Lake-wide enrichment of trace metals Cr (mean concentration 57 ppm), Ni (39 ppm), Cu (36 ppm), and Pb (24 ppm) relative to other Lower Murray River sites is also evident, suggesting that metal contamination associated with acidic drainage is not restricted to near-source sites. Importantly, the mobilisation, transport, and accumulation of metals is controlled by sediment transport pathways and system hydrology and will thus function differently under varying states of geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic modification. Our study shows that extreme drought is recorded as a lasting geochemical signature in estuarine sediments, demonstrating that metal and rare earth element geochemistry provides insights into the distribution and behaviour of contaminants mobilised into dynamic, anthropogenically altered estuaries.","Job, Thomas; Penny, Dan; Morgan, Bree",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818858/,147
72945,Cerebral Oximetry as an Auxiliary Diagnostic Tool in the Diagnosis of Brain Death.,2017,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Human grading of digital images from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programmes represents a significant challenge, due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the reference standard. METHODS Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference standard. RESULTS Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with non-referable retinopathy. CONCLUSION The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with specificity that could halve the workload for human graders. AI machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as this can provide clinically equivalent, rapid detection of retinopathy, particularly in settings where a trained workforce is unavailable or where large-scale and rapid results are needed.","Heydon, Peter; Egan, Catherine; Bolter, Louis; Chambers, Ryan; Anderson, John; Aldington, Steve; Stratton, Irene M; Scanlon, Peter Henry; Webster, Laura; Mann, Samantha; du Chemin, Alan; Owen, Christopher G; Tufail, Adnan; Rudnicka, Alicja Regina",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32606081/,147

In this review, rather than consider freeze-drying as a traditional black box we ""break it"" through a detailed process thinking approach. We discuss freeze-drying from process thinking aspects, introduce the chemical, physical, and mechanical environments important in this process, and present advanced biophotonic process analytical technology. In the end, we review the state of the art in the freeze-drying of the biomaterials, extracellular vesicles, and cells. We suggest that the rational design of the experiment and implementation of advanced biophotonic tools are required to successfully preserve the natural biomaterials and cells by freeze-drying.

Cortical inhibitory interneurons (cINs) are born in the ventral forebrain and migrate into cortex, where their numbers are adjusted by programmed cell death. Here we show that loss of clustered gamma protocadherins (Pcdhg), but not of genes in the alpha or beta clusters, increased dramatically cIN BAX-dependent cell death in mice. Surprisingly, electrophysiological and morphological properties of Pcdhg-deficient and wild-type cINs during the period of cIN cell death were indistinguishable. Co-transplantation of wild-type with Pcdhg-deficient interneuron precursors further reduced mutant cIN survival, but the proportion of mutant and wild-type cells undergoing cell death was not affected by their density. Transplantation also allowed us to test for the contribution of Pcdhg isoforms to the regulation of cIN cell death. We conclude that Pcdhg, specifically Pcdhgc3, Pcdhgc4, and Pcdhgc5, play a critical role in regulating cIN survival during the endogenous period of programmed cIN death.","Mancia Leon, Walter R; Spatazza, Julien; Rakela, Benjamin; Chatterjee, Ankita; Pande, Viraj; Maniatis, Tom; Hasenstaub, Andrea R; Stryker, Michael P; Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.55374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633719/,147
73117,Neuropathies and Vitamin D Deficiency.,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Virtual fracture clinics are an alternative to the traditional model of fracture care. Since their introduction in 2011, they have become increasingly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis has driven institutions to examine such innovative solutions to manage patient care. The current controversies include quantifying safety outcomes, such as potential delayed or missed injuries, inadequate treatment, and medicolegal claims. Questions also exist regarding the potential for cost reductions and efficiencies that may be achieved. Physical distancing has limited the number of face-to-face consultations, so this review was conducted to determine if virtual fracture clinics can provide an acceptable alternative in these challenging times. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES The aim of this systematic review was to describe (1) adverse outcomes, (2) cost reductions, and (3) efficiencies associated with the virtual fracture clinic model. METHODS A systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted from database inception to March 2020. The keywords ""virtual"" or ""telemedicine"" or ""telehealth"" or ""remote"" or ""electronic"" AND ""fracture"" or ""trauma"" or ""triage"" AND ""clinic"" or ""consultation"" were entered, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria included adults and children treated for injuries by a virtual clinic model at the initial review. Eligible injuries included injuries deemed to not need surgical intervention, and those able to be treated remotely using defined protocols. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients reviewed by telemedicine using video links or in person at the initial review. Initially, 1065 articles were identified, with 665 excluded as they did not relate to virtual fracture clinics. In all, 400 articles were screened for eligibility, and 27 full-text reviews were conducted on 18 studies (30,512 virtual fracture clinic encounters). Three subdomains focusing on adverse outcomes, cost reductions, and efficiencies were recorded. The term adverse outcomes was used to describe any complications, further surgeries, re-referrals back to the clinic, or deviations from the protocols. Efficiency described the number of patients reviewed and discharged using the model, savings in clinic slots, reduced waiting times, or a reduction in consumption of resources such as radiographs. All studies were observational and the quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool, which demonstrated a median score of 6 ± 1.8, indicating moderate quality. RESULTS Six studies reported adverse outcomes in detail, with events ranging from inappropriate splinting, deviations from protocols, and one patient underwent an osteotomy for a malunion. Efficiency varied from direct discharge proportions of 18% in early studies to 100% once the virtual fracture clinic model was more established. Cost reductions compared with estimates derived from conventional fracture clinics varied from USD 53 to USD 297 and USD 39,125 to USD 305876 compared with traditional fracture clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS Virtual fracture clinics may provide a means to treat patients remotely, using agreed-upon protocols. They have an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to the possibility to provide ongoing care in an otherwise challenging setting. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long-term effects on patients, institutions, and health care systems.

They are involved in physiological processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction. However, there are limited reviews on dietary effects on endogenous SLs metabolism and further on human health. Various dietary conditions, including the SLs-enriched diet, high-fat diet, and vitamins, can change the level of endogenous SLs metabolites and even affect human health. This review systematically summarizes the main known SLs in foods concerning their variety and contents, as well as their isolation and identification approaches. Moreover, the present review discusses the role of dietary (particularly SLs-enriched diet, high-fat diet, and vitamins) in endogenous SLs metabolism, highlighting how exogenous SLs are digested and absorbed. The role of SLs family in the pathogenesis of diseases, including cancers, neurological disorders, infectious and inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, and in recently coronavirus disease-19 outbreak was also discussed. In the post-epidemic era, we believe that the concern for health and the need for plant-based products will increase. Therefore, a need for research on the absorption and metabolism pathway of SLs (especially plant-derived SLs) and their bioavailability is necessary. Moreover, the effects of storage treatment and processing on the content and composition of SLs in food are worth exploring. Further studies should also be conducted on the dose-response of SLs on human health to support the development of SLs supplements. More importantly, new approaches, such as, making SLs based hydrogels can effectively achieve sustained release and targeted therapies.","Li, Wenxuan; Belwal, Tarun; Li, Li; Xu, Yanqun; Liu, Junbo; Zou, Ligen; Luo, Zisheng",Food research international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399542/,147

We aim to better understand lower uptake among racial and ethnic minority staff groups to inform initiatives to enhance uptake. DESIGN Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted (October 2020-January 2021) with UK-based healthcare staff. Data were inductively and thematically analysed. RESULTS Vaccine decision-making processes were underpinned by an overarching theme, 'weighing up risks of harm against potential benefits to self and others'. Sub-themes included 'fear of harm', 'moral/ethical objections', 'potential benefits to self and others', 'information and misinformation', and 'institutional or workplace pressure'. We identified ways in which these were weighted more heavily towards vaccine hesitancy for racial and ethnic minority staff groups influenced by perceptions about institutional and structural discrimination. This included suspicions and fear around institutional pressure to be vaccinated, racial injustices in vaccine development and testing, religious or ethical concerns, and legitimacy and accessibility of vaccine messaging and communication. CONCLUSIONS Drawing on a critical race perspective, we conclude that acknowledging historical and contemporary abuses of power is essential to avoid perpetuating and aggravating mistrust by de-contextualising hesitancy from the social processes affecting hesitancy, undermining efforts to increase vaccine uptake.","Woodhead, Charlotte; Onwumere, Juliana; Rhead, Rebecca; Bora-White, Monalisa; Chui, Zoe; Clifford, Naomi; Connor, Luke; Gunasinghe, Cerisse; Harwood, Hannah; Meriez, Paula; Mir, Ghazala; Jones Nielsen, Jessica; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Stanley, Nathan; Peprah, Dorothy; Hatch, Stephani L",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092149/,147

In this study, we determined the occurrence and molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp. in farmed ostriches in the Czech Republic. METHODS The occurrence and genetic identity of Cryptosporidium spp. were analysed by microscopy and PCR/sequencing of the small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 genes. Cryptosporidium avian genotype II was examined from naturally and experimentally infected hosts and measured using differential interference contrast. The localisation of the life-cycle stages was studied by electron microscopy and histologically. Infectivity of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II for cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus (Kerr)), chickens (Gallus gallus f. domestica (L.)), geese (Anser anser f. domestica (L.)), SCID and BALB/c mice (Mus musculus L.) was verified. RESULTS A total of 204 individual faecal samples were examined for Cryptosporidium spp. using differential staining and PCR/sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 gene sequences showed the presence of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II (n = 7) and C. ubiquitum Fayer, Santín & Macarisin, 2010 IXa (n = 5). Only ostriches infected with Cryptosporidium avian genotype II shed oocysts that were detectable by microscopy. Oocysts were purified from a pooled sample of four birds, characterised morphometrically and used in experimental infections to determine biological characteristics. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II measure on average 6.13 × 5.15 μm, and are indistinguishable by size from C. baileyi Current, Upton & Haynes, 1986 and C. avium Holubová, Sak, Horčičková, Hlásková, Květoňová, Menchaca, McEvoy & Kváč, 2016.

We report the outcomes of a novel technique: double barrel enteroplasty (DBE) for autologous intestinal reconstruction. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all ten patients who underwent DBE at our institution since 2011. All patients have SBS and were dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) at the time of surgery. Etiologies were gastroschisis (n = 4), bowel atresia (n = 3), necrotising enterocolitis (n = 1), volvulus (n = 1), and near-total intestinal aganglionosis (n = 1). Patient survival, complications, and subsequent enteral autonomy were evaluated. RESULTS All patients are alive with normal liver function. Five children achieved enteral autonomy, while the remaining are on weaning PN. There was no bleeding, anastomotic leak, perforation, infective complications, or intestinal necrosis.

However, poor accessibility to the aneurysm through the parent artery and use of local anesthesia in this age group may predispose to intraprocedural complications. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether age-related poor access to the ruptured target aneurysm and use of local anesthesia are associated with increased incidence of procedure-related rupture during endovascular embolization. METHODS A total of 117 patients with 117 ruptured aneurysms underwent endovascular embolization at a single institution. Correlation of increasing age with poor accessibility of the guiding catheter was analyzed. In addition, the distance from the aneurysm to the guiding catheter was investigated to identify an association with incidence of procedure-related rupture. Correlation of local anesthesia with procedure-related rupture was also evaluated in the multivariable analysis. RESULTS Increasing age was significantly associated with poor accessibility of the guiding catheter (P = .001, Mann-Whitney U test). Procedure-related rupture occurred in 9 of 117 aneurysms (7.7%). Longer distance between distal aneurysms and low-positioned guiding catheters carried a higher risk of procedure-related rupture than a shorter distance between proximal aneurysms and high-positioned guiding catheters (odds ratio, 19.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-201; P = .01, multivariable analysis). Use of local anesthesia was also a significant risk factor of procedure-related rupture by multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION Increasing age was correlated with poor accessibility of the guiding catheter in endovascular embolization of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Distally located aneurysms treated through a low-positioned guiding catheter and use of local anesthesia increased the risk of procedure-related rupture.","Fukuda, Hitoshi; Handa, Akira; Koyanagi, Masaomi; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Lo, Benjamin W Y; Yamagata, Sen",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308642/,147

A few principles and methods underlie the current biosafety practice: risk assessment, biological containment, concentration and enclosure, exposure minimization, physical containment, and hazard minimization. Many of the current practices are based on experience and expert judgment. The effectiveness of biosafety measures may be evaluated at the level of single containment equipment items and procedures, at the level of the laboratory as a whole, or at the clinical-epidemiological level. Data on the containment effectiveness of equipment and laboratories are scarce and fragmented. Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are therefore important for evaluating the effectiveness of biosafety. For the majority of LAIs there appears to be no direct cause, suggesting that failures of biosafety were not noticed or that containment may have been insufficient. The number of reported laboratory accidents associated with GMOs is substantially lower than that of those associated with non-GMOs.

In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of social-emotional headline contents on social judgments and brain responses and whether they can be modulated by explicit evaluations of the trustworthiness of the media source. Participants (N=30) evaluated -and clearly discerned- the trustworthiness of news sources before they were exposed to person-related news headlines. Despite this intervention, social judgments and brain responses were dominated largely by emotional headline contents. Results suggest differential effects of source credibility might depend on headline valence. Electrophysiological indexes of fast emotional and arousal-related brain responses, as well as correlates of slow evaluative processing were enhanced for persons associated with positive headline contents from trusted sources, but not when positive headlines stemmed from distrusted sources. In contrast, negative headlines dominated fast and slow brain responses unaffected by explicit source credibility evaluations. These results provide novel insights into the brain mechanisms underlying the ""success"" of emotional news from untrustworthy sources, suggesting a pronounced susceptibility to negative information even from distrusted sources that is reduced for positive contents. The differential pattern of responses to misinformation in mind and brain sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of misinformation and possible strategies to avoid their potentially detrimental effects.","Baum, Julia; Rahman, Rasha Abdel",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508894/,147

Neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) are heterogeneous in clinical presentation and prognosis. Fortunately, recent advances in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic strategies have improved the multidisciplinary management of this challenging condition. When feasible, surgical resection of NELM offers the best long-term outcomes. General indications for hepatic resection include performance status acceptable for major liver surgery, grade 1 or 2 tumors, absence of extrahepatic disease, adequate size and function of future liver remnant, and feasibility of resecting >90% of metastases. Adjunct therapies including concomitant liver ablation are generally safe when used appropriately and may expand the number of patients eligible for surgery. Among patients with synchronous resectable NELM, resection of the primary either in a staged or combined fashion is recommended. For patients who are not surgical candidates, liver-directed therapies such as transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, and radioembolization can provide locoregional control and improve symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Multiple systemic therapy options also exist for patients with advanced or progressive disease.

We can predict that the COVID-19 pandemic would leave the mind lonely and vulnerable to diseases, for, on the one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic and related problems, in particular social isolation, are itself stressor. On the other hand, studies confirm the potential of COVID-19 to involve the central nervous system by affecting the immune system, either directly or indirectly. The COVID-19 condition, thus, calls for a necessary compensation of loneliness to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic. Not only art can fulfill this purpose by meeting social affiliation needs, but also its related creativity is a definite achievement of the performer while acting as a motivation facilitator of creation for the observer. Besides, artworks that illustrate effective hygiene behaviors and physical distancing in an easy-to-understand manner could help health information systems to control the spread of COVID-19. The integration of art with biomedical science applied for simulation of the infected population, lung imaging data, and the viral surface has been useful for prediction of the spread of disease and earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 by imaging techniques and might be a contributor to drug discovery for COVID-19. Also, arts admirably influence the immunoemotional regulatory system so that not only would it enable humanity to tolerate quarantine but also enhance antiviral immunity. More interestingly, the effects of dance have been observed in children, elderly, healthcare workers, and pregnant women, which have been of special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of child protection practice models in improving outcomes for children and families. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Children < 18 years and their families involved in child protection services. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the effectiveness of child protection practice models. Systematic searches across 10 electronic databases and grey literature were conducted to identify quasi-experimental studies minimally. Included studies were critically appraised and the findings summarized narratively. RESULTS Five papers, representing six studies, focusing on three practice models (Solution-Based Casework; Signs of Safety; and Reclaiming Social Work) met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a quasi-experimental design. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as being poor, with studies suffering from a risk of selection bias, small sample sizes and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS Despite the popularity of practice models, the evidence base for their effectiveness is still limited. The results suggest that high-quality studies are urgently needed to evaluate the impact of practice models in improving the outcomes of child-protection-involved families. The findings also illustrate the difficulties of conducting high-quality outcome evaluations in children's social care, and these challenges and future directions for research, are discussed.

BACKGROUND Planning for the future is difficult, even when environments are relatively static. When environments are dynamic, the challenges multiply exponentially. Unfortunately, few environments have been more unpredictable in the 21st century than health care. The healthcare system is in chaos, as is much of the business world. It is critical then that contemporary nursing and healthcare leaders identify skill sets that will be needed by nurse leaders in 2020 and begin now to create the educational models and management development programs necessary to assure these skills are present. RESULTS Essential nurse leader competencies for 2020 include: (i) A global perspective or mindset regarding healthcare and professional nursing issues. (ii) Technology skills which facilitate mobility and portability of relationships, interactions, and operational processes. (iii) Expert decision-making skills rooted in empirical science. (iv) The ability to create organization cultures that permeate quality healthcare and patient/worker safety. (v) Understanding and appropriately intervening in political processes. (vi) Highly developed collaborative and team building skills. (vii) The ability to balance authenticity and performance expectations. (viii) Being able to envision and proactively adapt to a healthcare system characterized by rapid change and chaos. CONCLUSIONS Nursing education programmes and healthcare organizations must be begin now to prepare nurses to be effective leaders in 2020. This will require the formal education and training that are a part of most management development programmes as well as a development of appropriate attitudes through social learning.

However, the configuration of digital content, method of presentation and interaction, dose and frequency needed for optimal results remain unclear. Patient preferences concerning such systems are also unclear. Addressing these knowledge gaps, incorporating evidence from both experimental and observational studies, may be useful to understand the extent of the relevant literature, and to influence the design and outcomes of future messaging systems. We aim to map information that could be influential in the design of future mobile messaging systems for individuals with musculoskeletal pain conditions, and to summarise the findings of efficacy, effectiveness, and economics derived from both experimental and observational studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include studies describing the development and/or use of mobile messaging to support adults (≥18 years) with acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. We will exclude digital health studies that lack a mobile messaging component, or those targeted at other health conditions unrelated to the bones, muscles and connective tissues, or involving surgical or patients with cancer, or studies involving solely healthy individuals.

The pilot study examined physician trainee performance in a simulation where hitting is observed between caregiver and child during a medical visit and to assess physician self-reported experiences, opinions, and comfort when observing CP in a simulation. METHODS We ran 7 simulations where one pediatric resident, emergency medicine resident, or pediatric emergency medicine fellow participated in the simulation while a group of similar trainees observed. All participants were given a postsurvey, followed by a semistructured debriefing led by a child abuse pediatrician. RESULTS Thirty-seven physician trainees participated; 7 engaged in the simulation while 30 observed. The majority (6/7) did not de-escalate the increasingly aggravated parent prior to hitting, 4 of 7 did not recommend that the caregiver refrain from CP, and most (5/7) did not provide education to the parent about more appropriate discipline. The majority (91.4%) believe that a physician should intervene when a parent hits or spanks his/her child in the hospital setting, highlighting the incongruity between this belief and their performance in/knowledge of intervening. All participants stated they would benefit from additional education and training on CP. CONCLUSIONS The educational experience provided physicians in training with the opportunity to participate in or observe a situation in which CP occurs in the medical setting. The simulation and debriefing were an innovative approach to providing an educational opportunity for physicians to learn from difficult situations and discussions surrounding CP with caregivers.","Slingsby, Brett A; Moore, Jessica L; Wing, Robyn; Brown, Linda L",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530835/,147

Some virus infections were found to be highly aggressive, leading to lung inflammation and severe damage in respiratory system with high fatality rate. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic drugs in the clinic. The common clinical symptoms of viral pneumonias include fever, rhinitis, runny nose, nonproductive cough, fatigue, myalgias and headaches after the immune system being tricked by driving cytokines and overactivated immune response induced by cytokine storms. Patients with severe symptoms could get persistent high fever, dysfunctional breathing, consciousness disorders and even respiratory failure, post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, multi-organ damages, shock and so on. Most clinical treatments are used to inhibit virus replication, relieve symptoms, inhibit excessive inflammatory response, regulate immune balance and protect organs. Both applied and basic research demonstrate that Chinese patent medicine has certain anti-viral effects, effectively inhibiting viral pneumonia transiting from mild to severe, rapid relieving of patient symptoms because of their multi-component and multi-target integrated roles. This review has summarized the reports on the treatment of viral pneumonia. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of viral pneumonia, this paper summarizes the diverse roles of the marketed Chinese patent medicine, such as their effects in inhibiting the progress of viral replication and overactivated inflammatory response, regulating immune balance, attenuating pulmonary fibrosis and so forth.

The current study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of nanocurcumin on the frequency and responses of Th17 cells in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. In this study, 40 severe COVID-19 intensive care unit-admitted patients and 40 patients in mild condition were included. The frequency of Th17 cells, the messenger RNA expression of Th17 cell-related factors (RAR-related orphan receptor γt, interleukin [IL]-17, IL-21, IL-23, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), and the serum levels of cytokines were measured in both nanocurcumin and placebo-treated groups before and after treatment. A significant decrease in the number of Th17 cells, downregulation of Th17 cell-related factors, and decreased levels of Th17 cell-related cytokines were found in mild and severe COVID-19 patients treated by nanocurcumin compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the abovementioned parameters were significantly decreased in the nanocurcumin-treated group after treatment versus before treatment. Curcumin could reduce the frequency of Th17 cells and their related inflammatory factors in both mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Hence, it could be considered as a potential modulatory compound in improving the patient's inflammatory condition.","Tahmasebi, Safa; El-Esawi, Mohamed A; Mahmoud, Zaid Hameed; Timoshin, Anton; Valizadeh, Hamed; Roshangar, Leila; Varshoch, Mojtaba; Vaez, Aydin; Aslani, Saeed; Navashenaq, Jamshid G; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Ahmadi, Majid",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372280/,147
78958,Strategic issues currently facing the US blood system.,2020-04-27,"OBJECTIVE To assess serial secretory activation biomarker concentrations (sodium [Na], potassium [K], Na:K ratio, protein, lactose, citrate) in mother's own milk (MOM) from pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants to determine associations with coming to volume (CTV), defined as producing at least 500mL/day MOM by day 14 postpartum. STUDY DESIGN We collected serial MOM samples and pumped MOM volume data for 14 days postpartum in mothers who delivered at <33 weeks of gestation. Regression models and Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS Of 40 mothers, 39 (mean gestational age 28.8 weeks; 67% overweight/obese; 59% non-white) had paired MOM volume and biomarker data; 33% achieved CTV between days 6-14 postpartum. In univariate models, MOM Na on day 5 and Na:K ratios on days 3 and 5 were associated with CTV. Mothers achieving CTV were more likely to have postpartum Na:K ratios ≤1 on day 3 (75% vs. 25%, P = .06) and ≤0.8 on day 5 (69% vs 10%, p<0.01) compared with mothers not achieving CTV. In a multivariable regression model, day 5 Na:K ratio (1 unit decrease in Na:K, OR 18.7 [95% CI 1.13-311.41], p=0.049) and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (1 unit increase in BMI, OR 0.88, [95% CI 0.78-0.99], p=0.04) were associated with CTV between days 6-14. CONCLUSION Secretory activation and CTV were compromised in pump dependent mothers with preterm delivery. CTV was predicted by MOM Na and Na:K ratios. These biomarkers hold potential as objective point-of-care measures to detect potentially modifiable lactation problems in a high-risk population.","Hoban, Rebecca; Poeliniz, Clarisa Medina; Somerset, Emily; Lai, Ching Tat; Janes, Judy; Patel, Aloka L; Geddes, Donna; Meier, Paula P",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916143/,147
79178,Two alternative dural sealing techniques in posterior fossa surgery: (Polylactide-co-glycolide) self-adhesive resorbable membrane versus polyethylene glycol hydrogel.,2014,"AIM Parastomal herniation of end colostomies can be chronically debilitating for patients and a difficult problem to treat. To prevent parastomal hernia (PSH) formation an extraperitoneal colostomy (EPC) approach has been developed in open colorectal surgery and some studies have suggested a potential advantage to this approach. Here we describe our technique of laparoscopic extraperitoneal stoma formation and present our experience to date. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection between March 1999 and March 2011. We performed the EPC technique as follows: under laparoscopic guidance, a smooth tip instrument was used to gently separate the peritoneum from the posterior aponeurotic plane to create an extraperitoneal tunnel running from the skin incision to the left flank of the abdominal cavity to join the previously dissected paracolic gutter. The colon was exteriorized and the position was checked to ensure the absence of torsion or kinking. RESULTS Twenty-two patients underwent a standard laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with total mesorectal excision. Colostomy was constructed extraperitoneally (EPC) or transperitoneally (TPC) in 12 and 10 patients respectively. There were five complications requiring operative intervention: two stomal necrosis and one surgical site infection in the TPC group and two small bowel occlusions in the EPC group. Four patients from the TPC group developed PSH at 24, 36, 48 and 72 months respectively while there were no cases of PSH in the EPC group. CONCLUSION Extraperitoneal laparoscopic colostomy showed a potential reduction of PSH in our series of patients.","Leroy, J; Diana, M; Callari, C; Barry, B; D'Agostino, J; Wu, H-S; Marescaux, J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.03015.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390220/,147

79305,"Polyethylene glycol plus an oral sulfate solution as a bowel cleansing regimen for colon capsule endoscopy: a prospective, single-arm study in healthy volunteers.",2015,"INTRODUCTION An understanding of disaster medicine and the health care system during mass-casualty events is vital to a successful disaster response, and has been recommended as an integral part of the medical curriculum by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). It has been documented that medical students do not believe that they have received adequate training for responding to disasters. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the inclusion of disaster medicine in the required course work of medical students at AAMC schools in the United States, and to identify the content areas addressed. METHODS An electronic on-line survey was developed based upon published core competencies for health care workers, and distributed via e-mail to the education liaison for each medical school in the United States that was accredited by the AAMC. The survey included questions regarding the inclusion of disaster medicine in the medical school curricula, the type of instruction, and the content of instruction. RESULTS Of the 29 (25.2%) medical schools that completed the survey, 31% incorporated disaster medicine into their medical school curricula. Of those schools that included disaster medicine in their curricula, 20.7% offered disaster material as required course work, and 17.2% offered it as elective course work. Disaster medicine topics provided at the highest frequency included pandemic influenza/severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 27.5%), and principles of triage (10.3%). The disaster health competency included most frequently was the ability to recognize a potential critical event and implement actions at eight (27.5%) of the responding schools. CONCLUSIONS Only a small percentage of US medical schools currently include disaster medicine in their core curriculum, and even fewer medical schools have incorporated or adopted competency-based training within their disaster medicine lecture topics and curricula.","Smith, Jared; Levy, Matthew J; Hsu, Edbert B; Lee Levy, J",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x12001215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22985793/,147

However, its excessive existence often leads to the destruction of human physiological mechanisms. In recent years, the developed luminescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO- are not only conducive to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of HClO/ClO- detection, but also play a crucial role in understanding the biological functions of HClO/ClO-. In addition, luminescent probe-based biological imaging for HClO/ClO- at sub-cellular resolution has become a powerful tool for biopathology and medical diagnostic research. This article reviews a variety of luminescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO- in vitro and in vivo with different design principles and mechanisms, including fluorescence, phosphorescence, and chemiluminescence. The photophysical/chemical properties and biological applications of these luminescent probes were outlined. Finally, we summarized the merits and demerits of the developed luminescent probes and discussed their challenges and future development trends. It is hoped that this review can provide some inspiration for the development of luminescent probe-based strategies and to promote the further research of biomedical luminescent probes for HClO/ClO-.","Dong, Shaoqing; Zhang, Lijuan; Lin, Yanjun; Ding, Caifeng; Lu, Chao",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an00645a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32608421/,147

Here we demonstrate the presence of human Hv1 (hHv1) in the placenta/chorion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) using RT-PCR. The voltage- and pH-dependent gating of the current is similar to that of hHv1 expressed in cell lines and that the current is blocked by 5-chloro-2-guanidinobenzimidazole (ClGBI) and activated by arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibition of hHv1 by ClGBI significantly decreases mineral matrix production of cMSCs induced by conditions mimicking physiological or pathological (inorganic phosphate, Pi) induction of osteogenesis. Wound healing assay and single cell motility analysis show that ClGBI significantly inhibits the migration of cMSCs. Thus, seminal functions of cMSCs are modulated by hHv1 which makes this channel as an attractive target for controlling advantages/disadvantages of MSCs therapy.","Mészáros, Beáta; Papp, Ferenc; Mocsár, Gábor; Kókai, Endre; Kovács, Katalin; Tajti, Gabor; Panyi, Gyorgy",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63517-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346069/,147
80161,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Segmentation via Weighted Level Set Model Based on Local Kernel Metric and Spatial Constraint.,2021-09-10,"INTRODUCTION Dyslipidemia affects up to 75% of morbidly obese individuals and is a key driver of cardiovascular disease. Weight loss is an established strategy to improve metabolic risk, including dyslipidemia. We aimed to determine weight loss goals for resolution of serum lipid abnormalities, by measuring improvements during progressive weight loss in obese individuals. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome undergoing adjustable gastric banding. Lipid levels were monitored monthly for 9 months, then three monthly until 24 months. RESULTS There were 101 participants included, age 47.4 ± 10.9 years with body mass index 42.6 ± 5.9 kg/m2. At 24 months, total body weight loss (TBWL) was 18.3 ± 7.9%. This was associated with significant improvements in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (1.18 vs 1.47, p < 0.001), triglyceride (2.0 vs 1.4, p < 0.001), and total cholesterol to HDL ratio (TC:HDL) (4.6 vs 3.6, p < 0.001). Over this time, progressive and linear improvements in HDL, triglycerides, and TC:HDL were seen with incremental weight loss (observed at 2.5% TBWL intervals). Significant improvements occurred after a threshold weight loss of 7.5-12.5% TBWL was achieved, with odds ratio (OR) 1.48-2.50 for normalization. These odds improved significantly with increasing weight loss (OR 18.2-30.4 with > 25% TBWL). Despite significant weight loss, there was no significant change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL). CONCLUSION Significant improvements in triglycerides, HDL, and TC:HDL occur after 7.5-12.5% TBWL, with ongoing benefit after greater weight loss. LDL needs to be addressed independently, as this was not observed to respond to weight loss alone.

METHODS Patients who underwent ILE were identified from a prospective database. Clinicopathological data were retrieved and compared with functional outcome data based on patient self-assessment by a standard questionnaire. Predictive factors for selected functional complaints were identified with logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Three hundred and twenty-two patients (80.4% male, mean age 62 years) were studied. Indications for surgery were adenocarcinoma (62.4%), squamous cell carcinoma (28%), and HG Barrett dysplasia (7%). Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) was administered to 42.5% of patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 5.6% and was associated with higher age and diabetes mellitus. Functional symptoms identified were reflux (39%), delayed gastric emptying (37%), dumping (21.4%), and anastomotic stenosis (16%). In the multivariate models, anastomotic stenosis was associated with smaller stapler diameter and presence of esophagitis. Postoperative reflux was associated with higher BMI, whereas dumping was predicted by female gender and age. The quality of life questionnaires revealed a good general health status in 82% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Functional complaints after ILE consist of reflux, delayed gastric emptying, dumping, and dysphagia, and are affected by age, gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, and stapler diameter.","Deldycke, Annelies; Van Daele, Elke; Ceelen, Wim; Van Nieuwenhove, Yves; Pattyn, Piet",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.24084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525826/,147

This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery. Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach.","Chapron, Charles; Marcellin, Louis; Borghese, Bruno; Santulli, Pietro",Nature reviews.

The goal of this study was to determine the cause of respiratory inhibition by considering perinatal risk factors. METHODS We examined 1497 infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or greater. All infants were monitored using pulse oximetry and examined via cranial sonography. Respiratory inhibition was defined as severe hypoxemia caused by respiratory inhibition immediately after crying or gastroesophageal reflux or as a respiratory pause during feeding. We examined the relationships between respiratory inhibition and perinatal factors and speculated on the cause of respiratory inhibition. RESULTS The median gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score at 1 min, and Apgar score at 5 min of the subjects were 38.9 weeks, 2930 g, 8.0 points, and 9.0 points, respectively. Respiratory inhibition was observed in 422 infants. Lateral ventricle enlargement and increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence were observed in 417 and 516 infants, respectively. Respiratory inhibition was significantly correlated with shorter gestational periods, twin pregnancies, lateral ventricle enlargement, and increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence. CONCLUSIONS We speculate that umbilical cord compression is a major cause of respiratory inhibition.","Minowa, Hideki; Arai, Ikuyo; Yasuhara, Hajime; Ebisu, Reiko; Ohgitani, Ayako","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2017.1346604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28648104/,147

Our study evaluated the technique of combined computed tomography-guided hookwire and methylene blue localization. METHODS Seventy-five patients from November 2007 to August 2013 who underwent combined Hawkins hookwire and methylene blue localization of 76 total pulmonary nodules before video-assisted thoracic surgery-guided wedge resection were retrospectively reviewed. Multiple patient, nodule, and procedural characteristics were analyzed for correlation with successful wire localization and wire dislodgement. Successful wire localization was defined as absence of lesions requiring re-resection, wire dislodgement necessitating re-resection, or conversion to thoracotomy for localization. RESULTS Seventy-four patients were included in the study (75 pulmonary nodules - 1 patient had 2 lesions localized) and mean ± SD patient age was 65.8 ± 12.1 years and 50% were male. The mean ± SD largest nodule diameter was 14.6 ± 7.4 mm and 29.3% of these were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Increased age and history of malignancy were associated with malignant diagnoses (P = 0.037 and 0.009, respectively) Successful wire localization was present in 86.4% of patients. Lesions with lower mean distance to the pleura correlated with successful localization (P = 0.002). Wire dislodgement was present in 9.3% (7 patients) with 4 (5.3%) of these necessitating need for re-resection to establish pathologic diagnosis. Albeit wire dislodgement, 57.4% (4/7) still had successful thoracoscopic localization. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that utilization of Hawkins hookwire in combination with methylene blue injection is an effective method to successfully localize pulmonary nodules for thoracoscopic wedge resection and should prompt further investigation for its utilization.","Brady, John Joseph; Hirsch Reilly, Christie; Guay, Robert; Dasika, Uday",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29912137/,147

METHODS This prospective, randomized study included 87 eyes: 40 eyes in the WFG LASIK group and 47 eyes in the SMILE group. Manual cyclotorsion compensation by marking the horizontal axis before SMILE surgery was used for optimized SMILE. Refractive diopter, aberrations, and contrast sensitivity were assessed 3 months postoperatively. The Alpins vector analysis method was used to analyze the astigmatic changes after surgery. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the corrected distance visual acuity and refraction between the two groups after surgery. The fitted curve of surgically induced astigmatism versus target induced astigmatism was described as y = 0.9905 x + 0.0009 in the WFG LASIK group and y = 0.9672 x + 0.0026 in the SMILE group. The percentage of corneal astigmatism axis change within 5 degrees was statistically significant (chi-square test: 10.632, P = .001). HOAs increased in both the WFG LASIK and SMILE groups after surgery (t = -3.655, P = .001, t = -3.784, P = .001, respectively). However, comparison of the changes of HOAs between both groups was not significant (t = -0.565, P = .575). The improvement in contrast sensitivity in the WFG LASIK group was significantly higher than that in the SMILE group. CONCLUSIONS WFG LASIK and optimized SMILE can achieve similar outcomes for astigmatism correction. Optimized SMILE with marking could achieve good astigmatism correction, even without an eye tracking system.

The magnitude of change was higher for ""decreasers"" than ""increasers"", resulting in a slight reduction in overall consumption. A multiple regression analysis revealed that age, occupational status, number of cohabitants, perceived alcohol accessibility, drinking motivations and previous consumption predicted consumption changes. The lockdown was thus associated with consumption modifications among French-speaking Belgians, without a prevailing direction of change.","Pabst, Arthur; Bollen, Zoé; Creupelandt, Coralie; Fontesse, Sullivan; Orban, Thomas; de Duve, Martin; Pinon, Nicolas; Maurage, Pierre",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910147/,147
81859,Activation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response is associated with Her2-overexpression breast cancer.,2020-06-29,"The erector spinae plane block is a new regional anaesthesia technique that provides truncal anaesthesia for breast surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to determine if the erector spinae plane block is effective at reducing pain scores and opioid consumption after breast surgery. This study also evaluated the outcomes of erector spinae plane blocks compared with other regional blocks. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. We included randomised controlled trials reporting the use of the erector spinae plane block in adult breast surgery. Risk of bias was assessed with the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess trial quality. Thirteen randomised controlled trials (861 patients; 418 erector spinae plane block, 215 no blocks, 228 other blocks) were included. Erector spinae plane block reduced postoperative pain compared with no block: at 0-2 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -1.63 (-2.97 to -0.29), 6 studies, 329 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 98%, p = 0.02); at 6 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.90 (-1.49 to -0.30), 5 studies, 250 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 91%, p = 0.003); at 12 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.46 (-0.67 to -0.25), 5 studies, 250 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 58%, p < 0.0001); and at 24 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.50 (-0.70 to -0.30), 6 studies, 329 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 76%, p < 0.00001). Compared with no block, erector spinae plane block also showed significantly lower postoperative oral morphine equivalent requirements (mean difference (95% CI) -21.55mg (-32.57 to -10.52), 7 studies, 429 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 99%, p = 0.0001). Separate analysis of studies comparing erector spinae plane block with pectoralis nerve block and paravertebral block showed that its analgesic efficacy was inferior to pectoralis nerve block and similar to paravertebral block. The incidence of pneumothorax was 2.6% in the paravertebral block group; there were no reports of complications of the other blocks. This review has shown that the erector spinae plane block is more effective at reducing postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores up to 24 hours compared with general anaesthesia alone. However, it was inferior to the pectoralis nerve block and its efficacy was similar to paravertebral block. Further evidence, preferably from properly blinded trials, is required to confirm these findings.","Leong, R W; Tan, E S J; Wong, S N; Tan, K H; Liu, C W",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609389/,147
82009,Cancer Therapy Doesn't Diminish Vaccine Efficacy.,2021-10-07,"Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with multiple effects on the inflammatory response and on innate and adaptive immunity. Overproduction of IFNγ underlies several, potentially fatal, hyperinflammatory or immune-mediated diseases. Several data from animal models and/or from translational research in patients point to a role of IFNγ in hyperinflammatory diseases, such as primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, various forms of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including macrophage activation syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome, all of which are often managed by rheumatologists or in consultation with rheumatologists. Given the effects of IFNγ on B cells and T follicular helper cells, a role for IFNγ in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis is emerging. To improve our understanding of the role of IFNγ in human disease, IFNγ-related biomarkers that are relevant for the management of hyperinflammatory diseases are progressively being identified and studied, especially because circulating levels of IFNγ do not always reflect its overproduction in tissue. These biomarkers include STAT1 (specifically the phosphorylated form), neopterin and the chemokine CXCL9. IFNγ-neutralizing agents have shown efficacy in the treatment of primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in clinical trials and initial promising results have been obtained in various forms of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including macrophage activation syndrome. In clinical practice, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the usefulness of circulating CXCL9 levels as a biomarker reflecting IFNγ production.","De Benedetti, Fabrizio; Prencipe, Giusi; Bracaglia, Claudia; Marasco, Emiliano; Grom, Alexei A",Nature reviews.

The aim of this investigation is to study the superiority of the locally infiltrated anesthetic bupivacaine just before the skull pin insertion and the scalp incision in craniotomy under general anesthesia. Methods In the study thirty patients of both genders aged 24-72 years were included. They were categorized as ASA 1 and 2 and divided into two group of 15 patients each, group B (bupivacaine) and group S (saline). We recorded the bispectral (BIS) index, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the pulse rate (PR) in five time intervals: t 0-2 min before pin insertion; t 1-2 min after pin insertion; t 2-5 min after; t 3-10 min after and t 4-15 min after. Results Significant difference p<0.05 was achieved in group S for all three followed parameters: blood pressure, heart rate and bispectral index. The difference is present in all four time intervals compared to the initial one before the pin insertion. With further analysis it was demonstrated that the investigated BIS index participates the most in the overall significance in group F. Conclusion The scalp infiltration with local anesthetic bupivacaine results with stable hemodynamic parameters and stable intracranial pressure during the painful procedures as craniotomy.","Durnev, Vesna; Soljakova, Marija; Filipce, Venko; Mijovska, Maja Mojsova; Stevanovska, Marina Temelkovska",Prilozi,https://doi.org/10.1515/prilozi-2017-0029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991762/,147

One such innovation was the recruitment of final year medical students as medical support workers (MSWs) immediately following their final examinations and 4 months before they would have traditionally been employed in their foundation year 1 (FY1) roles. In this article we will describe how a unique programme, with a focus on welfare and pastoral support, was developed and implemented at a hospital in North London and illustrate why the overwhelmingly positive feedback from both the participants and their supervisors has had implications for how medical student training has been shaped for the September 2020 intake at this hospital.","Simpson, Jane; Gafson, Irene; Mooncey, Mumtaz; Swart, Johnny; Fertleman, Caroline",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791470/,147
82420,Decision support system for breast lesions via dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.,2020-07-20,"Prior studies examined association between short-term mortality and certain changes in the admission ECG in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nevertheless, little is known about possible differences between patients with diabetes and without diabetes in this regard. So the aim of the study was to investigate the association between 28-day case fatality according to certain ECG changes comparing AMI cases with and without diabetes from the general population. From 2000 until 2017 a total of 9756 AMI cases was prospectively recorded in the study Area of Augsburg, Germany. Each case was assigned to one of the following groups according to admission ECG: 'ST-elevation', 'ST-depression', 'only T-negativity', 'predominantly bundle branch block', 'unspecific changes' and 'normal ECG' (the last two were put together for regression analyses). Multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were calculated to compare 28-day case-fatality between the ECG groups for the total sample and separately for diabetes and non-diabetes cases. For the non-diabetes group, the parsimonious logistic regression model revealed significantly better 28-day-outcome for the 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' group (OR: 0.47 [0.29-0.76]) compared to the reference group (STEMI). Contrary, in AMI cases with diabetes the category 'normal ECG / unspecific changes' was not significantly associated with lower short-term mortality (OR: 0.87 [0.49-1.54]). Neither of the other ECG groups was significantly associated with 28-day-mortality in the parsimonious logistic regression models. Consequently, the absence of AMI-typical changes in the admission ECG predicts favorable short-term mortality only in non-diabetic cases, but not so in patients with diabetes.","Schmitz, Timo; Thilo, Christian; Linseisen, Jakob; Heier, Margit; Peters, Annette; Kuch, Bernhard; Meisinger, Christa",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85674-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737645/,147

To evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel electric device (DD1) for soft tissue dissection. Three series of measurements were performed in a pig model. First, macro- and microscopic tissue damage was compared between the DD1 and an electric scalpel (ES). Second, the time course of tissue temperature was measured for the DD1 and three other energy devices (ES, Harmonic and LigaSure). Third, the time required for mobilization of a peripheral artery of the intestine was compared between the DD1 and manual, non-energized forceps. First, the tissue damage area caused by ES was significantly larger compared to that in the DD1 at all time points (p < 0.0001). The number of damaged cells due to thermal damage was significantly larger for ES than for DD1, even when the DD1 was applied to a single point at maximum power for 60 sec (p < 0.0001). Second, the maximum temperature of Harmonic was 160°C 3 sec after use and dropped to 68°C after 10 sec. At the same time points after use, we observed: ES (84°C, 45°C), LigaSure (61°C, 49°C), and DD1 (30.5°C, 29°C). Third, the median dissection time for the artery using DD1 was significantly shorter than that for dissecting forceps (DD1: 100 sec, range 70-205 sec vs. forceps: 130 sec, range 90-210 sec, p = 0.0325). DD1 was a safe non-thermal device which causes less tissue damage while also providing shorter dissection times than manual dissection.","Yoshida, Nao; Yamazaki, Shintaro; Sugitani, Masahiko; Takayama, Tadatoshi",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2017.01308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553103/,147

Methods This community-based study recruited men aged ≥ 50 years between January and April 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics, history, and current medical condition information were collected. SDM information with regards to prostate cancer screening was discussed. Results In total, 2034 Saudi men, aged between 50 and 88 years, agreed to participate in the current study. Prostate examination for early detection of cancer was recommended for 35.4% (720) of subjects. Of the subjects, 23.3% (473) reported that the physicians discussed the advantages and benefits of PSA testing, whereas only 5.6% (114) stated that the physicians explained the disadvantages and drawbacks of PSA testing. Conclusion Our findings suggest that less than one fourth discussed the advantages and disadvantages of PSA testing with their physicians; of these, less than one third underwent PSA blood tests. Improvements are needed in SDM for and against PSA screening. SDM does not affect the intensity of PSA testing.

From microbial products to novel drugs that target a multitude of disease indications.,2009,"INTRODUCTION Therapeutic gene silencing is a huge promise for the treatment of a variety of diseases. The translation of this widely used scientific technique toward clinical application has been hindered by insufficient ADME properties of antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides. Despite reasonable therapeutic response after local administration, reaching adequate concentrations at the site of action after systemic application is still a major hurdle and this has resulted in poor efficiency in preclinical and clinical situations. AREAS COVERED This review focuses on the influence on the ADME parameters of chemical modifications already tested in clinical trials, such as phosphorothioates (PSs), 2'-modified agents, including locked nucleic acids (LNA) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). The dominating PS backbone modification, while conferring adequate nuclease resistance and improving biodistribution, has been shown to be involved in unspecific protein binding and off-target effects on apoptosis pathways. PS-free antisense agents such as PMO generally show poorer pharmacokinetic characteristics. EXPERT OPINION In terms of pharmacokinetics and cell membrane permeation, there is currently no efficient alternative to PS, although doubts about long-term toxicity of this class still remain. Consequently, improved structural modifications or galenic formulations are deemed necessary to create entities with higher efficiency and lower toxicity.","Dirin, Mehrdad; Winkler, Johannes",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2013.774366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23451977/,147

The development of a universal influenza vaccine is urgently needed to tackle seasonal epidemics, pandemics, vaccine mismatch, and zoonotic transmissions to humans. AREAS COVERED Despite the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses, designing a universal influenza vaccine that induces such broadly neutralizing antibodies at protective levels in humans has remained challenging. Besides neutralizing antibodies, multiple correlates of protection have recently emerged as crucially important for eliciting broad protection against diverse influenza viruses. This review discusses the immune responses required for broad protection against influenza viruses, and suggests a paradigm shift from an HA stalk-based approach to other approaches that can induce multiple immunological correlates of protection for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. EXPERT OPINION To develop a truly universal influenza vaccine, multiple correlates of protection should be considered, including antibody responses and T cell immunity. Balanced induction of neutralizing antibodies, antibody effector functions, and T cell immunity will contribute to the most effective vaccination strategy. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines provide an attractive platform to improve the breadth and potency of vaccines for broader protection.","Jang, Yo Han; Seong, Baik L",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2020.1801629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783765/,147

Laparoscopic excision of the disease is frequently carried out for the treatment of severe endometriosis. Pelvic adhesions often develop following surgery and they can compromise the success of treatment. Ovarian suspension (elevating both ovaries to the anterior abdominal wall using a Prolene suture) is a simple procedure which has been used to facilitate ovarian retraction during surgery for severe pelvic endometriosis. The study aims to assess the effect of temporary ovarian suspension following laparoscopic surgery for severe pelvic endometriosis on the prevalence of post-operative ovarian adhesions. METHODS A prospective double blind randomised controlled trial for patients with severe pelvic endometriosis requiring extensive laparoscopic dissection with preservation of the uterus and ovaries. Severity of the disease and eligibility for inclusion will be confirmed at surgery. Patients unable to provide written consent, inability to tolerate a transvaginal ultrasound scan, unsuccessful surgeries or suffer complications leading to oophorectomies, bowel injuries or open surgery will be excluded. Both ovaries are routinely suspended to the anterior abdominal wall during surgery. At the end of the operation, each participant will be randomised to having only one ovary suspended post-operatively. A new transabdominal suture will be reinserted to act as a placebo. Both sutures will be cut 36 to 48 hours after surgery before the woman is discharged home. Three months after surgery, all randomised patients will have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess for ovarian mobility. Both the patients and the person performing the scan will be blinded to the randomisation process. The primary outcome is the prevalence of ovarian adhesions on ultrasound examination. Secondary outcomes are the presence, intensity and site of post-operative pain. DISCUSSION This controlled trial will provide evidence as to whether temporary ovarian suspension should be included into the routine surgical treatment of women with severe pelvic endometriosis.

The C3-C5 spinal cord is the location of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) that are responsible for diaphragm activation; PhMNs receive bulbospinal excitatory drive predominately from supraspinal neurons of the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). Cervical SCI results in rVRG axon damage, PhMN denervation, and consequent partial-to-complete paralysis of hemidiaphragm. In a rat model of C2 hemisection SCI, we expressed the axon guidance molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), selectively at the location of PhMNs (ipsilateral to lesion) to promote directed growth of rVRG axons toward PhMN targets by performing intraspinal injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2)-BDNF vector. AAV2-BDNF promoted significant functional diaphragm recovery, as assessed by in vivo electromyography. Within the PhMN pool ipsilateral to injury, AAV2-BDNF robustly increased sprouting of both spared contralateral-originating rVRG axons and serotonergic fibers. Furthermore, AAV2-BDNF significantly increased numbers of putative monosynaptic connections between PhMNs and these sprouting rVRG and serotonergic axons. These findings show that targeting circuit plasticity mechanisms involving the enhancement of synaptic inputs from spared axon populations is a powerful strategy for restoring respiratory function post-SCI.-Charsar, B.

85266,Update on Exhaled Nitric Oxide in Clinical Practice.,2016,"Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO2 during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO2. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO2 was found (P < 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO2 was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (P = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (P < 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO2 was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and oxygen saturation (SaO2) differed among the three types of ventilation (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO2, lower PaO2, and lower SaO2 during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. In a pig model of CPR, ETCO2 was significantly lower during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung ventilation. However, interestingly, ETCO2 during left-lung ventilation was comparable to that during two-lung ventilation.","Ryu, Dong Hyun; Jung, Yong Hun; Jeung, Kyung Woon; Lee, Byung Kook; Jeong, Young Won; Yun, Jong Geun; Lee, Dong Hun; Lee, Sung Min; Heo, Tag; Min, Yong Il",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649316/,147
85404,[Septic shock with multiple organ failure after returning from Southeast Asia].,2016,"Molecular diagnostics is a rapidly growing branch of the clinical laboratory and has accelerated the advance of personalized medicine in the fields of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics, and nutrigenomics. The versatility of molecular biology allows it to be effective in several medical fields that include reproduction, immunogenetics and virology. Implementation of molecular and sequencing technology in reproductive medicine can add another layer of understanding to better define the causes behind infertility and recurrent reproductive loss. In the following we examine current molecular methods for probing factors behind reproductive pregnancy loss including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). We review several current and potential genetic (DNA) and transcriptional (RNA) based parameters in women with infertility that can be significant in diagnosis and treatment. These molecular factors can be inferred either from genomic DNA, or RNA locally within the endometrium. Furthermore, we consider infection-based abnormalities such as Human Herpes Virus-6 (HHV-6), and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). Finally, we present future directions as well as data demonstrating the potential role of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERV) in pregnancy loss. We hope these discussions will assist the clinician in delineating some of the intricate molecular factors that can contribute to infertility and recurrent reproductive failures.","Bilal, Mahmood Y; Katara, Gajendra; Dambaeva, Svetlana; Kwak-Kim, Joanneoanne; Gilman-Sachs, Alice; Beaman, Kenneth D",American journal of reproductive immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710571/,147

The present study was therefore designed to investigate this issue. The interactions of ruxolitinib with SLCs were analyzed using transporter-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Substrate accumulation was detected by spectrofluorimetry, LC-MS/MS spectrometry or scintillation counting. Ruxolitinib was found to potently inhibit the activities of OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K (IC50 < 10 µM). It blocked OAT1, OAT4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and OCT3, but in a weaker manner (IC50 > 10 µM), whereas OCT1 was not impacted. No time-dependent inhibition was highlighted. When applying the US FDA criteria for transporters-related drug-drug interaction risk, OCT2 and MATE2-K, unlike MATE1 andOAT3, were predicted to be in vivo inhibited by ruxolitinib. Cellular uptake studies additionally indicated that ruxolitinib is a substrate for MATE1 and MATE2-K, but not for OAT3 and OCT2. Ruxolitinib in vitro blocked activities of most of SLC transporters. Only OCT2 and MATE-2K may be however clinically inhibited by the JAK inhibitor, with the caution for OCT2 that in vitro inhibition data were generated with a FDA-non recommended fluorescent substrate. Ruxolitinib MATEs-mediated transport may additionally deserve attention for its possible pharmacological consequences in MATE-positive cells.","Bruyère, Arnaud; Le Vée, Marc; Jouan, Elodie; Molez, Stephanie; Nies, Anne T; Fardel, Olivier",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,https://doi.org/10.1080/00498254.2021.1875516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455503/,147
85968,"Cervical Cancer Screening-Past, Present, and Future.",2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE The study compared laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) staple-line leak rates of 4 prevalent surgical options: no reinforcement, oversewing, nonabsorbable bovine pericardial strips (BPS), and absorbable polymer membrane (APM). BACKGROUND LSG is a multipurpose bariatric/metabolic procedure with effectiveness proven through the intermediate term. Staple-line leak is a severe complication of LSG for which no definitive method of prevention has been identified. METHODS The systematic review study design was employed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement screening guidelines. Inclusion criteria centered on variables potentially relevant to LSG leak: leak rate, age, gender, calibrating bougie size, distance between pylorus and gastric transection line, overall complication rate, and mortality. Analysis of variance models were used to explore differences in select demographic and surgical technique variables characterizing each reinforcement group. An omnibus χ(2) test followed by independent Fisher's exact tests were used to compare leak rates. RESULTS There were 659 articles identified; 41 duplicates removed. Of 618 remaining articles, 324 did not meet inclusion criteria. Of the 294 remaining articles, 206 were eliminated (kin studies, those not reporting staple-line or leak incidence, those reporting discontinued products). There were 88 papers included in the analysis. Statistically significant differences were found between groups across demographic and surgical variables studied (p<0.001). There were 191 leaks in 8,920 patients; overall leak rate 2.1%. Leak rates ranged from 1.09% (APM) to 3.3% (BPS); APM leak rate was significantly lower than other groups (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION Systematic review of 88 included studies representing 8,920 patients found that the leak rate in LSG was significantly lower using APM staple-line reinforcement than oversewing, BPS reinforcement, or no reinforcement.","Gagner, Michel; Buchwald, Jane N",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745978/,147

Governments have cancelled elective procedures, ordered new ventilators and built new hospitals to meet this unprecedented challenge. However, intensive care ultimately relies on human resources. To enhance surge capacity, many junior doctors have been redeployed to ICU despite a relative lack of training and experience. The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to new ICU recruits, from the practicalities of using personal protective equipment to higher risks of burnout and moral injury. In this article, we describe lessons for junior doctors responsible for managing patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 based on our experiences at an urban teaching hospital.","Coughlan, Charles; Nafde, Chaitanya; Khodatars, Shaida; Jeanes, Aimi Lara; Habib, Sadia; Donaldson, Elouise; Besi, Christina; Kooner, Gurleen Kaur",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581082/,147

To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett's esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett's esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.","Nowicki-Osuch, Karol; Zhuang, Lizhe; Jammula, Sriganesh; Bleaney, Christopher W; Mahbubani, Krishnaa T; Devonshire, Ginny; Katz-Summercorn, Annalise; Eling, Nils; Wilbrey-Clark, Anna; Madissoon, Elo; Gamble, John; Di Pietro, Massimiliano; O'Donovan, Maria; Meyer, Kerstin B; Saeb-Parsy, Kourosh; Sharrocks, Andrew D; Teichmann, Sarah A; Marioni, John C; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd1449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385390/,147

Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society. We call on psychologists to advocate for social justice in pandemic preparedness, promote disability justice in health care settings, call for transparency and accountability in rationing approaches, and support policy changes for macro- and microallocation strategies to proactively reduce the need for rationing.

Preventive and early intervention strategies in infancy are critical for improving outcomes over the lifespan with significant cost savings. However, the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts is dependent upon our ability to identify infants most appropriate for such interventions. Because there may be significant overlap between prodromal symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders and child psychopathology more broadly which may wax and wane across development, we contend that the impact of prevention and early intervention efforts will be heightened by identifying early indicators that may overlap across ASD and other commonly co-occurring disorders. This paper summarizes the existing literature on infant symptoms and identification of ASD to demonstrate the ways in which a transdiagnostic perspective could expand the impact of early identification and intervention research and clinical efforts, and to outline suggestions for future empirical research programs addressing current gaps in the identification-to-treatment pipeline. We propose four recommendations for future research that are both grounded in developmental and clinical science and that are scalable for early intervention systems: (1) development of fine-grained, norm-referenced measures of ASD-relevant transdiagnostic behavioral domains; (2) identification of shared and distinct mechanisms influencing the transition from risk to disorder; (3) determination of key cross-cutting treatment strategies (both novel and extracted from existing approaches) effective in targeting specific domains across disorders; and (4) integration of identified measures and treatments into existing service systems.","Talbott, Meagan R; Miller, Meghan R","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53",https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2020.1790382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701034/,147

METHODS The clinical records of patients with macular dystrophy and biallelic variants in CDHR1 were reviewed. Data analysed included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus images: autofluorescence (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT); full field electroretinography (ERG) and pattern ERG (PERG). RESULTS Seven patients from six pedigrees were ascertained. One patient was homozygous for a known synonymous variant p.(Pro261=), four were compound heterozygous for the p.(Pro261=) variant and a novel allele of CDHR1: p.(Gly188Ser), p.(Met1?), or p.(Val458Asp); one patient was compound heterozygous for two previously unreported variants: c.297+1G>T in trans with p.(Pro735Thr). The range of BCVA at the last clinic review was (6/5-6/60). Autofluorescence showed macular flecks of increased AF in mild cases and patches of reduced AF in severe cases. The OCT showed attenuation of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in mild cases and loss of the EZ and the outer nuclear layer in severe cases; one patient had subfoveal hyporeflective region between the EZ and the retinal pigment epithelium. The full field ERG was normal or borderline subnormal in all cases, and the PERG was subnormal in mild cases or undetectable in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS This report corroborates previous observations that genotypes distinct from those causing pan-retinal dystrophy can cause a milder phenotype, predominantly affecting the macula, and expands the spectrum of these genotypes. The findings in this cohort suggest a potential macular susceptibility to mild perturbations of the photoreceptor cadherin.","Ba-Abbad, Rola; Robson, Anthony G; Mahroo, Omar A; Wright, Genevieve; Schiff, Elena; Duignan, Emma S; Michaelides, Michel; Arno, Gavin; Webster, Andrew R",Eye,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-1045-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681094/,147

With the advent of robotic surgery, three-dimensional (3D) vision, and articulated instruments, this learning curve has been facilitated. We present a hybrid alternative to robotic surgery, using laparoscopy with 3D vision and articulated shears. OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of children undergoing pyeloplasty using 3D laparoscopy with articulated instruments with those undergoing the same surgery using standard laparoscopy with 2D vision and rigid instruments. STUDY DESIGN Medical charts of 33 consecutive patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction who underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty by a single surgeon from 2006 to 2013 were reviewed in a retrospective manner. The current 3D cohort was compared with the previous 2D cohort. Data on age, weight, gender, side, operative time, dimension (2D = 19 patients, 3D = 8 patients), presence of a crossing vessel, length of hospital stay, and complication rate were compared between the two groups. Articulating shears were used for pelvotomy and spatulation of the ureter in the 3D group. Statistical tests included linear regression models and chi square tests for trends using STATA software. RESULTS Operative time per case was decreased by an average of 48 min in the group undergoing 3D laparoscopic pyeloplasty compared with the group undergoing 2D laparoscopic pyeloplasty (p = 0.02) (Figure). Complication rate and length of hospital stay were not significantly affected by the use of 3D laparoscopy. DISCUSSION These favorable results are in accordance with previous literature emphasizing the importance of 3D vision in faster and more precise execution of complex surgical maneuvers. The use of flexible instruments has also helped overcome the well-described delicate step of a dismembered pyeloplasty, namely the pelvotomy and ureteral spatulation. Limitations of this study are those inherent to the retrospective study design. CONCLUSION The use of 3D vision endoscopy with articulating instruments blurs the distinction between current robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopic technology, and provides a hybrid alternative deserving further attention.","Abou-Haidar, Hiba; Al-Qaoud, Talal; Jednak, Roman; Brzezinski, Alex; El-Sherbiny, Mohamed; Capolicchio, John-Paul",Journal of pediatric urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2016.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889223/,147

The pCONus is a newly emerging device for wide-neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms. To date, a single report on the treatment of intracranial aneurysms including all locations has been published. We report our experience with pCONus in the treatment of wide-neck MCA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS MCA aneurysms treated with pCONus in 4 European centers were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Forty MCA aneurysms (mean dome size, 7.7 mm; mean neck size, 5.6 mm) were treated in 40 patients (mean age, 62 years). Aneurysm coiling was performed after deployment of 1 pCONus in 95% (38/40) of cases and after deployment of 2 pCONus devices in 5% (2/40). No procedural angiographic complications were observed. Reversible neurologic complications were noted in 5% (2/40), and permanent neurologic complication, in 2.5% (1/40) at 1 month. There was no mortality. No aneurysms bled or rebled after treatment. Immediate angiographic results were complete aneurysm occlusion in 25% (10/40), neck remnant in 47.5% (19/40), and aneurysm remnant in 27.5% (11/40). Follow-up (mean, 6.8 months) was available for 33 aneurysms (82.5%). Stable or improved results were observed in all except 3 cases, including 48.5% complete occlusions (16/33), 30.3% neck remnants (10/33), and 21.2% aneurysm remnants (7/33).

88344,Antivirals Against SARS-CoV2: Relevance to the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.,2020-10-13,"SIGNIFICANCE It is estimated that close to 50 million cases of sepsis result in over 11 million annual fatalities worldwide. The pathognomonic feature of sepsis is a dysregulated inflammatory response arising from viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. Immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a hallmark of the host immune defense to combat microbes and to prevent the progression to sepsis. MAVS is a ubiquitous adaptor protein located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is activated by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), RIG-I and MDA5, following binding of viral RNA agonists. Recent Advances: Substantial progress has been made in deciphering the activation of the MAVS pathway with its interacting proteins, down-stream signaling events (IRFs, NFκB) and context dependent type I/III interferon response. CRITICAL ISSUES In the evolutionary race between pathogens and the host, viruses have developed immune evasion strategies for cleavage, degradation, or blockade of proteins in the MAVS pathway. For example, SARS-CoV-2 M protein and ORF9b protein antagonize MAVS signaling and a protective type I interferon response. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The role of MAVS as a sensor for non-viral pathogens, host cell injury and metabolic perturbations awaits better characterization in the future. New technical advances in multi-dimensional single-cell analysis and single-molecule methods will accelerate the rate of new discoveries. The ultimate goal is to manipulate MAVS activities in the form of immune-modulatory therapies to combat infections and sepsis.","Sharma, Arjun; Kontodimas, Konstantinos; Bosmann, Markus",Antioxidants & redox signaling,https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2021.0167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348482/,147

This estimation, together with the number of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) that need to be examined from each chicken in order to assess protection, should be based on the difference in level of protection that one would like to be able to detect (effect size), the expected variability of the results between and within the chickens, the desired confidence level and the power of the study. To obtain data that would facilitate this estimation, a meta-analysis was performed on the data from 18 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccination-challenge experiments performed at the Dutch Animal Health Service Deventer, the Netherlands (GD) in order to determine and quantify the source of variation in the mean level of protection of different groups. For the calculations, 137 groups of chickens were subdivided into 10 clusters based on age (young or adult), vaccination (none, homologous or heterologous), challenge (IBV or mock infected) and location of vaccination (isolator at GD or in the field). The results were used to estimate the required number of chickens per group for the different clusters using 2, 5 or 10 TOCs per chicken to be able to detect effect sizes of 6.25%, 12.5%, 25% and 50% between groups of chickens with 95% confidence (P<0.05) and 80% power. The number of chickens that was required for the mentioned effect sizes varied greatly from 2 to 650. This meta-analysis provided data that allow research workers to estimate the number of chickens that should be included in each group in order to obtain reliable results based on particular combinations of infectious bronchitis vaccination and challenge strains as defined by the presented clusters.","de Wit, J J; Boelm, G J; van Gerwe, T J W M; Swart, W A J M",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2012.751485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23391176/,147

There is no approved vaccine and no proven treatment for this infection. Some potential treatments that have already been associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are under investigation. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a photon-based therapy that uses light to mediate a variety of metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a branch of photodynamic therapy based on the reaction between a photosensitizing agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen, which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the viral structures such as proteins and nucleic acids. This chapter aims to discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of PBMT and aPDT in the context of the novel coronavirus. Studies indicate that PBMT and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS, but we found no direct study on SARS-CoV-2. With a combination of PBMT and aPDT, we may be able to combat COVID-19 with minimal interference with pharmaceutical agents.

89049,Issue highlights.,2020-12-01,"There have been five viral pandemics in the past century, four were due to influenza, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a 99% global reduction in the diagnosis of influenza. Also, from 2020, global mortality rates from influenza fell to record levels during the influenza seasons in the southern and northern hemispheres. However, as social restrictions become lifted and the winter season begins in the northern hemisphere, it is expected that influenza will re-emerge. The World Health Organization (WHO) FluNet surveillance platform provides global surveillance data on influenza, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records national weekly infection rates. Both surveillance programs have identified zoonotic avian and swine influenza variants in humans. The WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework requires WHO Member States to share data on cases of emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potential in a regular and timely way. The WHO PIP Framework organizes the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a global network of public health laboratories developing candidate virus vaccines. This Editorial aims to present the reasons for concern regarding the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses driven by the social and public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the importance of global influenza surveillance at this time.","Parums, Dinah V",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.934949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602605/,147

The two major diseases are associated with several factors such as viruses, bacteria, the health condition of the host, and environmental factors. We aimed to design a new efficient diagnostic method, which rapidly detect causative pathogens, minimizing economic loss due to BRD and BED. METHODS AND RESULTS We designed a multiplex quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) system for the simultaneous diagnosis of 16 pathogens, including 12 viruses and 4 bacteria related to BRD and BED, based on single qRT-PCR assays in previous studies. The designed multiplex qRT-PCR was highly sensitive and has minimal detection levels which be no different from those of single qRT-PCR. Moreover, the multiplex qRT-PCR could more efficiently detect the causative pathogens than conventional RT-PCR in test using a part of BRD and BED clinical samples. Furthermore, our data revealed that the multiplex qRT-PCR had high performance in its specificity and reproducibility tests. CONCLUSIONS Our system can effectively detect multiple BRD or BED related pathogens from each animal while testing several clinical samples via the multiplex qRT-PCR. It is more time-, cos-t, and labor-efficient than other diagnostic methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY Rapid detection of infected animals from the herd using our system will greatly contribute to infection control and prompt treatment in field.","Goto, Yusuke; Yaegashi, Gakuji; Fukunari, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Tohru",Journal of applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.14685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357286/,147

In the presence of other associated injuries which preclude immediate definitive vascular reconstruction, temporary arterial shunting may be useful. Presently available shunts, however, are tubular and allow for distal perfusion to only one vessel. We have utilized a modified bifurcated hemodialysis catheter (Mahurkar MAXID; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) to successfully provide simultaneous perfusion from the proximal common femoral artery to both the superficial and deep femoral vessels. Such catheters are readily available in most institutions, can be quickly modified, and are easy use in urgent trauma situations.","Choudry, Rashad; Schmieder, Frank; Blebea, John; Goldberg, Amy",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2008.11.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19147318/,147

METHODS All patients who underwent RFA of the GSV from 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013 in eight of our vein centers were included. Duplex ultrasound scans (DUSs) were performed prior to treatment on all patients and 2-3 days, and 1 month after procedure. Demographic data, GSV diameters, and other relevant data were recorded. Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathologic (CEAP) classification and Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSSs) were determined prior to ablation and one month later. Patients who developed endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) were followed till resolution. RESULTS A total of 205 patients had one cycle treatment (group A) and 204 had two cycle treatment (group B). The two groups were comparable in their demography, CEAP classification, and VCSS scores. The rate of failure of ablation and incidence of EHIT were also not significantly different. The incidence of complications was low, <5% in both groups and all were minor. CONCLUSION Two cycle treatment of the proximal GSV for vein ablation does not improve the success rate of vein closure in the short term, compared to one cycle treatment. It also does not increase the risks of DVT, EHIT, major bleeding, and other complications. However, we do not know at what diameter two cycles may be superior to one cycle.","Sufian, S; Arnez, A; Labropoulos, N; Nguyen, K; Satwah, V; Marquez, J; Chowla, A; Lakhanpal, S",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355514556142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326216/,147

89648,"Tumor Sidedness, Recurrence, and Survival After Curative Resection of Localized Colon Cancer.",2020-08-31,"Background Burnout is a condition of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who work with people in some capacity. Nursing is a stressful profession that deals with human aspects of health and illness and can ultimately lead to job dissatisfaction and burnout. Although burnout among nurses has been addressed in previous research, the heterogeneous nature of the result findings highlights the need for a detailed meta-analysis in Ethiopia. Thus, this review is aimed at identifying the prevalence of burnout among nurses in Ethiopia. Methods A search strategy was implemented using electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Africa-Wide Information, and African Index Medicus) which were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles using keywords. Studies which were included in this review were written in the English language because writing articles in other languages in Ethiopia is uncommon. The combination of key terms including ""burnout"", ""nurse"" and ""Ethiopia"", ""systematic review"" and protocols was used. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis checklist guideline was followed stepwise. All published articles starting from inception to February 2020 were included, and we did not find unpublished studies. Heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated by the inconsistency index. All statistical analysis was done using R and RStudio software for Windows, and a random-effects model was applied to estimate the overall prevalence of burnout among nurses in Ethiopia. It is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020188092). Results The database searched produced 1060 papers. After adjustment for duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles with 1654 total nurses were found suitable for the review. Except for one cohort study, all studies were cross-sectional. The overall pooled prevalence of burnout among Ethiopian nurses was estimated to be 39% (95% CI: 27%-50%). Conclusions Burnout affects two out of five nurses in Ethiopia. Therefore, effective interventions and strategies are required to reduce burnout among nurses.","Hailay, Abrha; Aberhe, Woldu; Mebrahtom, Guesh; Zereabruk, Kidane; Gebreayezgi, Guesh; Haile, Teklehaimanot",Behavioural neurology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8814557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123299/,147

90274,Natural History of Pure Primary Lateral Sclerosis.,2021-02-26,"Objectives In December 2019, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, and since then, the disease has been increasingly spread throughout the world. Unfortunately, the information about early prediction factors for disease progression is relatively limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. Results The data showed that the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and platelet count were normal on the day of hospital admission in most COVID-19 patients (87.9%, 85.1% and 88.7%, respectively). A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the neutrophil count (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.441, 95% CI = 1.954-10.090, p = 0.000), lymphocyte count (HR = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.097-0.669, p = 0.006) and platelet count (HR = 0.244, 95% CI = 0.111-0.537, p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for disease progression. The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately. In addition, the data involving the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count (NLP score) have something to do with improving risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We designed a clinically predictive tool which is easy to use for assessing the progression risk of COVID-19, and the NLP score could be used to facilitate patient stratification management.","Zheng, Yufen; Zhang, Ying; Chi, Hongbo; Chen, Shiyong; Peng, Minfei; Luo, Lifei; Chen, Linping; Li, Jun; Shen, Bo; Wang, Donglian",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352397/,147

It is unknown if the severity of preexisting coronary artery disease determines susceptibility to the cardiovascular risks of perioperative hypotension. METHODS In this retrospective exploratory analysis of a substudy of an international prospective blinded cohort study, 955 patients 45 yr of age or older with history or risk factors for coronary artery disease underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography before elective inpatient noncardiac surgery. The authors evaluated the potential interaction between angiographic findings and perioperative hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg for a total of 10 min or more during surgery or for any duration after surgery and for which intervention was initiated) on the composite outcome of time to myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death up to 30 days after surgery. Angiography assessors were blinded to study outcomes; patients, treating clinicians, and outcome assessors were blinded to angiography findings. RESULTS Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 30 days after surgery) occurred in 7.7% of patients (74/955), including in 2.7% (8/293) without obstructive coronary disease or hypotension compared to 6.7% (21/314) with obstructive coronary disease but no hypotension (hazard ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 5.66; P = 0.027), 8.8% (14/159) in patients with hypotension but without obstructive coronary disease (hazard ratio, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.62 to 9.19; P = 0.002), and 16.4% (31/189) with obstructive coronary disease and hypotension (hazard ratio, 7.34; 95% CI, 3.37 to 15.96; P < 0.001). Hypotension was independently associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.99 to 5.06; P < 0.001). This association remained in patients without obstructive disease and did not differ significantly across degrees of coronary disease (P value for interaction, 0.599). CONCLUSIONS In patients having noncardiac surgery, perioperative hypotension was associated with cardiovascular events regardless of the degree of coronary artery disease on preoperative coronary computed tomographic angiography.","Roshanov, Pavel S; Sheth, Tej; Duceppe, Emmanuelle; Tandon, Vikas; Bessissow, Amal; Chan, Matthew T V; Butler, Craig; Chow, Benjamin J W; Khan, James S; Devereaux, P J",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000002654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30870165/,147

The fistula was dilated using a 4-mm dilatation balloon catheter, and a Habib EndoHPB Catheter (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) was inserted. Subsequently, the stricture was ablated at a power of 7W for 90 seconds.1 A metallic stent was deployed antegrade across the stricture, and a single-pigtail plastic stent was deployed across the fistula (Fig. 1). The patient's vital signs were stable during the procedure. However, severe bradycardia occurred 2 hours later with the heart rate plummeting below 20-30 bpm and electrocardiogram showing flattened P-waves and prolonged QRS complex. A blood test revealed serum potassium levels of 7.4 mEq/L, which had been 4.6 mEq/L at pre-procedure. Calcium was administered immediately, and glucose-insulin therapy was initiated.

91151,Lymph: (Fe)rrying Melanoma to Safety.,2020-09-02,"PURPOSE Leishmania subgenus Leishmania causes leishmaniosis, which is a chronic systemic disease in humans and animals, in which the skin and visceral organs can be affected. The disease generally consists of three different clinical types in humans: visceral (kala-azar, VL), cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniosis (MCL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leishmaniosis is still one of the world's most neglected diseases. It has been nearly 13-14 years since the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a Leishmania parasite. However, much information about these parasites remains to be elucidated, such as the causes of differences in tissue tropism. The aim of this study is to perform the whole-genome sequencing of Leishmania infantum causing cutaneous leishmaniosis from a Turkish isolate with next-generation sequencing technology. METHODS Genomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The TruSeq Nano DNA Low Throughput Library Prep Kit, compatible with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, was used to generate the library. Synthesis sequencing (SBS) was performed with a HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 to generate single-fragment reads (2 × 150 bp; PE) with two fragment end-to-end assemblies. Bioinformatics analyses were performed on the Geneious 11.0.5. ( www.genius.com ) platform. RESULTS In our study, a high-quality whole-genome sequence (WGS) of L. infantum was successfully generated, and a total of 32,009,137 base pairs of genomic DNA from 36 chromosomes were obtained. The resulting genomic DNA sequence was submitted to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) database and registered under the name Leishmania infantum_TR01 (Lin_TR01). The following accession numbers were assigned by NCBI to the 36 chromosomes of the Lin_TR01 genome: CP027807, CP027810, CP027808, CP027811, CP027809, CP027812, CP027813, CP027814, CP027817, CP027818, CP027819, CP027815, CP027821, CP027816, CP027823, CP027820, CP027822, CP027824, CP027825, CP027826, CP027827, CP027828, CP027829, CP027830, CP027831, CP027832, CP027833, CP027834, CP027835, CP027836, CP027837, CP027838, CP027839, CP027840, CP027841, CP027842. As a result of the annotation of the Lin_TR01 genome, 3153 polymorphisms, 8324 genes, 8199 CDSs, 8109 mRNAs, 67 tRNAs, 11 rRNAs and 58 ncRNA were identified. Among the 8199 CDS obtained, 5278 encode hypothetical proteins. CONCLUSION In this study, a high-quality WGS of Leishmania infantum was successfully obtained for the first time in Turkey. According to a review of WGS studies on this subject, the Lin_TR01 strain is the first strain to be isolated from cutaneous leishmaniosis. The reference genome of L. infantum JPCM5 (Peacock et al., 2007) was obtained from a visceral leishmaniosis case, in accordance with the classical tissue and organ tropism of the species. Lin_TR01 is the second whole-genome-sequenced strain in the world after the JPCM5 strain. The Lin_TR01 genome is the only L. infantum whole-genome sequence that is completed assembly level from 36 chromosomes among the genomes obtained thus far ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/genomes/249 ).","Guldemir, Dilek; Usluca, Selma; Nalbantoglu, Ayse Serpil",Acta parasitologica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00252-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691361/,147

In the current study, we propose a framework that incorporates these three factors into a vicious circle that leads to deconditioning, a condition frequently experienced by this vulnerable population. Viewing aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia, and sarcopenia, along with their interrelationships through the lens of this vicious circle, illuminates the critical role that oral health plays in deconditioning. Moreover, this framework highlights oral care as a key nursing intervention for reducing deconditioning in hospitalized older adults. Supporting this view, several studies have shown that oral care can improve health outcomes for hospitalized older adults. However, despite oral care being an essential nursing intervention that restores oral function and promotes patient wellness, it is one of the most neglected nursing interventions. Missed oral care occurs due to staff's limited awareness of its significance for care-dependent older adults in hospital settings. We hope that this vicious circle paradigm helps raise awareness of the significance of oral care to prevent deconditioning in hospitalized older adults.

However, there is little understanding of learning curves, training requirements, or measures of competency for HRM. We aimed to develop and use a competency assessment system to examine learning curves for interpretation of HRM data. METHODS We conducted a prospective multicenter study of 20 gastroenterology trainees with no experience in HRM, from 8 centers, over an 8-month period (May through December 2015). We designed a web-based HRM training and competency assessment system. After reviewing the training module, participants interpreted 50 HRM studies and received answer keys at the fifth and then at every second interpretation. A cumulative sum procedure produced individual learning curves with preset acceptable failure rates of 10%; we classified competency status as competency not achieved, competency achieved, or competency likely achieved. RESULTS Five (25%) participants achieved competence, 4 (20%) likely achieved competence, and 11 (55%) failed to achieve competence. A minimum case volume to achieve competency was not identified. There was no significant agreement between diagnostic accuracy and accuracy for individual HRM skills. CONCLUSIONS We developed a competency assessment system for HRM interpretation; using this system, we found significant variation in learning curves for HRM diagnosis and individual skills. Our system effectively distinguished trainee competency levels for HRM interpretation and contrary to current recommendations, found that competency for HRM is not case-volume specific.","Yadlapati, Rena; Keswani, Rajesh N; Ciolino, Jody D; Grande, David P; Listernick, Zoe I; Carlson, Dustin A; Castell, Donald O; Dunbar, Kerry B; Gawron, Andrew J; Gyawali, C Prakash; Katz, Philip O; Katzka, David; Lacy, Brian E; Spechler, Stuart J; Tatum, Roger; Vela, Marcelo F; Pandolfino, John E",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2016.07.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473627/,147
92260,Welcome to the 11th volume of Neurodegenerative Disease Management.,2020-12-09,"Syndecan-1, is a transmembrane heparan/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan necessary for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Its decreased level on the cell surface correlates with poor prognosis in several tumor types. Aberrant stromal localization of syndecan-1 is also considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in various human malignancies. In the presented work the question was addressed if changes in syndecan-1 expression are related to the prognosis of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry for syndecan-1 extracellular domain was performed on surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer. To follow the communication between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts, their mono-and co-cultures were studied, detecting the expression of syndecan-1, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens revealed that while cell surface syndecan-1 expression was reduced on cancer cells, it appeared on the surface of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Until year 7, the cohort with high cell surface syndecan-1 expression had significantly longer survival. No difference in the same time-period could be detected when stromal syndecan-1 expression was analyzed. In vitro analysis revealed, that tumor cells can induce syndecan-1 expression on fibroblast, and fibroblasts showed that fibroblast-like cells are built by two cell types: (a) syndecan-1 positive, cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts, and (b) syndecan-1 and cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells.

METHODS The lymphocyte subsets and IgM and IgG antibody levels were retrospectively analyzed in 707 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The amounts of lymphocyte subsets were significantly decreased with the increased severity of illness and the levels of IgM and IgG were lower in critical cases than severe and moderate cases. In deceased patients, the lymphocytes subsets were significantly lower than recovered patients. However, the relationship between the levels of IgM and IgG and the amounts of lymphocyte subsets were not significantly correlated. During different stages of COVID-19, the total T cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell counts were gradually recovered to the normal levels in severe and critical groups but the change trend was relatively stable in moderate group. The production of IgM and IgG antibodies were delayed in critical groups but also could reach the peak levels at one month after illness onset and decreased to background levels. CONCLUSION To detect the kinetics of lymphocytes and antibodies has important clinical value in predicting the illness severity and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

The goal of our study is to compare I-gel and ProSeal laryngeal mask airways (LMA) in infants by analysing different parameters, such as insertion success, ventilation, haemodynamic changes and postoperative complications. Methods For this prospective, randomised study, we selected 123 infants with an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I, who were undergoing minor elective lower abdominal surgery. After obtaining verbal and written informed consent from the parents, the infants were divided into two groups: the I-gel group (n=60) and the ProSeal LMA group (n=63). The times and ease of insertion, percentages of tidal volume leakage, and means and leakage pressures of these two supraglottic airways were noted. The complications and side-effects of each method were also recorded. Results The insertion time of the ProSeal group was statistically shorter than that of the I-gel group. The peak and mean pressures and the leakage percentage of the ProSeal group were statistically lower than those of the I-gel group. The leakage pressure of the ProSeal group was statistically higher than the I-gel group. Conclusion In comparison with I-gel, the use of ProSeal LMA in infants' anaesthesia presents many advantages, such as the ease of its insertion, better oropharyngeal leakage pressure and less mucosal hyperaemia.","Oba, Sibel; Türk, Hacer Şebnem; Kılınç, Leyla; Ekşioğlu Karacı, Birsen; İslamoğlu, Serkan",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,https://doi.org/10.5152/tjar.2019.47936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864646/,147

A T-test was performed to compare between WBA in ears with otosclerosis and in normal hearing ears. The ability of WBA to discriminate between the patients with otosclerosis from the normal hearing participants was tested with a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.Study sample: Thirty-five patients with otosclerosis (age 31-64) and thirty-five normal hearing volunteers (age 32-64).Results: In frequency range 0.432-1.059 kHz, mean WBA in otosclerosis was significantly lower than mean WBA in normal hearing ears and in frequency range 4.238-8 kHz mean WBA in otosclerosis was significantly higher than mean WBA in normal hearing ears. The ROC analysis revealed that ears with otosclerosis and normal hearing ears could be distinguished based on mean WBA in frequency range >0.5 ≤ 1 kHz (AUC = 0.673) and based on mean WBA in frequency range >4 ≤ 8 kHz (AUC = 0.769).Conclusion: Our results suggest that WBA findings in ears with otosclerosis differ from WBA findings in normal hearing ears.","Kelava, Iva; Ries, Mihael; Valent, Anđa; Ajduk, Jakov; Trotić, Robert; Košec, Andro; Bedeković, Vladimir",International journal of audiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2020.1785644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633634/,147
93692,Radiotherapy and immunotherapy combinations in the treatment of patients with metastatic disease: current status and future focus.,2021-06-17,"An increased sensitivity to painful stimuli has been proposed to be related to the development of chronic pain. Therefore, assessment of individual pain sensitivity is useful in clinical practice. However, experimental pain testing may be uncomfortable for patients and requires specific equipment. The Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) has been developed to facilitate assessment of pain sensitivity. In this study, we aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the PSQ from its published German and English versions into the Dutch language and to assess validity of the PSQ in healthy volunteers. After translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the PSQ following international guidelines, we validated the PSQ in 394 healthy volunteers by comparing the PSQ-values with two different experimental pain tests: electrical pain tolerance (EPT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). In addition, ratings of pain intensity during these tests were obtained on the numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10). We found that the reliability of the PSQ based on internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha 0.90). PSQ-scores, adjusted for age and sex, were statistically significant and weakly inversely correlated to EPT (PSQ-moderate: rho = -0.24, p=0.007; PSQ-total: rho = -0.22, p=0.016). No statistically significant correlation between PSQ-scores and PPT was found. Concerning the pain scores, PSQ-scores were weakly to moderately correlated to EPT-NRS (PSQ-minor: rho = 0.21, p=0.021; PSQ-moderate: rho = 0.22, p=0.016; PSQ-total: rho = 0.23, p=0.009) as well as PPT-NRS (PSQ-minor: rho = 0.32, p < 0.001; PSQ-moderate: rho = 0.36, p < 0.001; PSQ-total: rho = 0.37, p < 0.001). Therefore, we concluded that the Dutch version of the PSQ is culturally appropriate for assessing self-reported pain sensitivity in healthy volunteers.","Van Boekel, Regina L M; Timmerman, Hans; Bronkhorst, Ewald M; Ruscheweyh, Ruth; Vissers, Kris C P; Steegers, Monique A H",Pain research & management,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1050935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32774564/,147

Operative duration, number of conversions, time to resumption of oral intake, length of hospital stay, and complications were used as the indicators of the learning curve. RESULTS Demographics were similar between the single-port and three-port groups. A significant decrease in operative duration was noted after a surgical experience of 10 patients. An operative duration equivalent to that of the conventional three-port method could be achieved after 30 cases. CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and feasible procedure. The learning curve could be overcome safely without major complications.

Yet the marine biodiscovery pipeline is characterized by chronic underfunding, bottlenecks and, ultimately, untapped potential. For instance, a lack of taxonomic capacity means that, on average, 20 years pass between the discovery of new organisms and the formal publication of scientific names, a prerequisite to proceed with detecting and isolating promising bioactive metabolites. The need for ""edge"" research that can spur novel lines of discovery and lengthy high-risk drug discovery processes, are poorly matched with research grant cycles. Here we propose five concrete pathways to broaden the biodiscovery pipeline and open the social and economic potential of the ocean genome for global benefit: (1) investing in fundamental research, even when the links to industry are not immediately apparent; (2) cultivating equitable collaborations between academia and industry that share both risks and benefits for these foundational research stages; (3) providing new opportunities for early-career researchers and under-represented groups to engage in high-risk research without risking their careers; (4) sharing data with global networks; and (5) protecting genetic diversity at its source through strong conservation efforts. The treasures of the ocean have provided fundamental breakthroughs in human health and still remain under-utilised for human benefit, yet that potential may be lost if we allow the biodiscovery pipeline to become blocked in a search for quick-fix solutions.","Sigwart, Julia D; Blasiak, Robert; Jaspars, Marcel; Jouffray, Jean-Baptiste; Tasdemir, Deniz",Natural product reports,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0np00067a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287433/,147

Neonates of women not in labor delivered via C-section are at increased risk of respiratory distress; it is unclear whether vigorous neonates without a need of resuscitation would benefit from prone positioning immediately after birth. Objective: To determine whether prone positioning of vigorous term neonates for the first 5 minutes after scheduled cesarean delivery will decrease the incidence of respiratory distress and therapeutic interventions, characterized by the frequency and duration of respiratory support (RS). Design/methods: In a single center, randomized parallel clinical trial, vigorous term neonates delivered via scheduled cesarean delivery were positioned prone or supine and their heart rate, oxygen saturation and signs of respiratory distress were recorded at 1-minute intervals for the first 5 minutes. Infants not reaching target oxygen saturations suggested by the neonatal resuscitation guidelines received RS via Neopuff in supine position; respiratory support was discontinued once oxygen saturation targets were met and infant was free of respiratory symptoms. Primary outcomes measured were frequency and duration of RS, secondary outcomes were admission to the NICU for respiratory distress, length of stay, heart rate and oxygen saturation during the initial 5 minutes of life. Results: Two hundred twenty-five neonates in prone and 231 in supine position completed the study out of 500 randomized subjects. Frequency of RS (31 versus 30%, p = 0.93), mean RS duration (4.08 versus 4.39 minutes; p = 0.71), frequency of admission to the NICU (5% in both groups; p = 0.95) and mean length of stay (0.14 versus 0.28 days; p = 0.42) were similar between the prone and supine groups. The supine cohort had higher initial oxygen saturation (p = 0.02) as well as heart rate (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Prone or supine positioning of term neonates after scheduled cesarean delivery resulted in comparable respiratory outcomes including the need of resuscitation in the first minutes of life.","Havranek, Tomas; Pa, Ellen Shatzkin; Chuang, Meleen; Xianhong, Xie; Kim, Mimi; Rosen, Orna","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1674805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564177/,147

A rapidly progressing epidemic of COVID-19 ensued within China, with multiple exportations to other countries. We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. METHODS Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4505 respondents to measure respondents' knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. RESULTS Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information-seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection. CONCLUSION Population-level anxiety and behavioural responses to an outbreak can be influenced by information provided. This should be used to inform future outbreak preparedness plans, taking into account the importance of increasing population-level self-efficacy and information sufficiency to reduce anxiety and promote positive behavioural changes.","Lim, Jane M; Tun, Zaw Myo; Kumar, Vishakha; Quaye, Sharon Esi Duoduwa; Offeddu, Vittoria; Cook, Alex R; Lwin, May Oo; Jiang, Shaohai; Tam, Clarence C",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889784/,147

We present a debate that focuses on how best to interpret IFT responses. On one side, Pandit argues that there is a range of response types from none through to movement initiated by the patient to alert the researcher. He also presents a de novo numerical scale by which IFT responses could be classed. Each response type reflects the underlying mental state (degree of unconsciousness), and he concludes that the effect of general anaesthesia on patients is not binary but heterogeneous. There can be mental states resulting from anaesthesia that produce adequate levels of conscious impairment sufficient for surgery to proceed, but in which a degree of wakefulness, including a capacity for later recall, is retained (a state previously termed 'dysanaesthesia'). A literature review of IFT (31 trials) is presented to support this assertion. In rebuttal, Russell and Wang argue that IFT response types are not so discrete, and that the IFT technique precludes higher levels of response. They argue that overinterpretation of IFT responses might in fact result in a greater risk of accidental awareness; a binary interpretation of the IFT response is the safest option. All authors agree that the IFT has a role in clinical practice and the study of anaesthetic mechanisms.","Pandit, J J; Russell, I F; Wang, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aev106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174299/,147

MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS This study included 62 patients with a mean age of 32.5 ± 10.5 years. Nine patients had BD on admission with a sustainable BIS value of 0. Fifty-three patients were not initially diagnosed with BD with BIS values of 2-56. Forty-four patients deteriorated to BD, and their respective BIS values progressively decreased to 0. Nine patients with mean BIS of 39.2 ± 9.0 recovered and were transferred to a specialized high dependency unit. BIS values showed positive correlation with the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on admission (r = 0.43, p = 0.001). Survivors had higher BIS values than those who were initially declared BD or those who died during the hospitalization course (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION BIS values have a significant correlation with initial GCS and can assist in the early detection of BD in patients with severe acute TBI.

We randomly allocated 164 children aged 3-13 years undergoing general anaesthesia to one of four groups; tracheal tube cuffs filled with air (n = 41); saline (n = 41); alkalinised lidocaine 0.5% (n = 41); or alkalinised lidocaine 1% (n = 41). Intracuff pressure was monitored and maintained below 20 cmH2 O. The mean (SD) increases in systolic blood pressure after tracheal extubation compared with before extubation were 10.9 (10.8) mmHg, 7.3 (17.7) mmHg, 4.1 (10.5) mmHg and 1.9 (9.5) mmHg in the air, saline, 0.5% and 1% alkalinised lidocaine groups, respectively (p = 0.021). The mean (SD) increases in diastolic blood pressure after tracheal extubation compared with before extubation were 3.9 (9.7) mmHg, 7.9 (14.6) mmHg, 0.7 (10.4) mmHg and 3.6 (6.9) mmHg in the air, saline, 0.5% and 1% alkalinised lidocaine groups, respectively (p = 0.019).

95593,Towards realizing diversity in academic medicine.,2020-09-29,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Nigeria and other sub-Sahara Africa countries like the rest of the world introduced several lockdown measures as part of their public health response to mitigate the spread of the virus. This, however, was not without the likelihood of consequences considering the weak health systems. The access and supply side of vaccination was more likely to have been affected by the lockdown measures. When vaccination services are disrupted even for brief periods during emergencies, the risk of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases increases, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. This highlights the importance of maintaining essential services such as vaccination in times of emergency. There is therefore an urgent need to ensure that children are protected against those diseases for which vaccines already exist.

The purpose of this report is to describe a technique used to secure lung tumors during insertion of a radiofrequency applicator. CONCLUSION As experience with percutaneous imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation increases, technical challenges become increasingly apparent. A technique whereby a mobile pulmonary tumor is anchored prior to placement of the ablation electrode is one method of overcoming such a challenge.","Healey, Terrance T; Beland, Michael D; Bowkley, Charles W; Dupuy, Damian E",AJR.

95811,Covid-19 and transplantation: fatigue and responsibility.,2020-12-22,"Chagas disease remains a neglected tropical disease, causing significant burden in the Americas and countries that receive immigrants from endemic nations. Current pharmaceutical treatments are suboptimal, not only varying drastically in efficacy, depending on the stage of disease, but also presenting significant risk of adverse events. The objective of this review is to provide a timely update on the efficacy and safety of current trypanocidals. Eligible studies published from January 2015 to December 2020 were retrieved by one reviewer from six electronic databases. Ana-lysis was done with review management software and risk of bias was assessed using tools appropriate for the type of study (i.e., experimental or observational). Thirteen studies (10 observational and three RCTs) were included in the analysis. All 13 studies tested Benznidazole (BNZ) or Nifurtimox (NFX), and two studies also tested Posaconazole (POS) or E1224 (Ravucanazole). BNZ was found to be the most efficacious trypanocidal drug compared to Nifurtimox, POS, and E1224; it also resulted in the highest percentage of adverse effects (AEs) and treatment discontinuation due to its toxicity. Adults experienced higher frequency of neurological AEs while taking BNZ or NFX compared to children. Children had a higher frequency of general AEs compared to adults while taking BNZ. Overall, BNZ is still the most efficacious, but development of new, less toxic drugs is paramount for the quality of life of patients. Studies testing combination therapies and shorter regimens are needed, as is the devising of better clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers to evaluate treatment efficacy. Considering the variability in methodology and reporting of the studies included in the present analysis, we offer some recommendations for the improvement and replicability of clinical studies investigating pharmacological treatment of Chagas disease. These include full disclosure of methodology, standardization of outcome measures, and always collecting and reporting data on both the efficacy of trypanocidals and on safety outcomes.","Malone, Cody J; Nevis, Immaculate; Fernández, Eduardo; Sanchez, Ana",Tropical medicine and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed6030128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287382/,147
95821,Case 26-2020: A Woman with Altered Mental Status and Left-Sided Weakness.,2021-01-07,"INTRODUCTION Local and regional policies to guide the allocation of scarce critical care resources have been developed, but the views of prospective users are not understood. We sought to investigate the perspectives of Canadian acute care physicians toward triaging scarce critical care resources in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We rapidly deployed a brief survey to Canadian emergency and critical care physicians in April 2020 to investigate current attitudes toward triaging scarce critical care resources and identify subsequent areas for improvement. Descriptive and between-group analyses along with thematic coding were used. RESULTS The survey was completed by 261 acute care physicians. Feelings of anxiety related to the pandemic were common (65 percent), as well as fears of psychological distress if required to triage scarce resources (77 percent). Only 49 percent of respondents felt confident in making resource allocation decisions. Both critical care and emergency physicians favored multidisciplinary teams over single physicians to allocate scarce critical care resources. Critical care physicians were supportive of decision making by teams not involved in patient care (3.4/5 versus 2.9/5 p = 0.04), whereas emergency physicians preferred to maintain their involvement in such decisions (3.4/5 versus 4.0/5 p = 0.007). Free text responses identified five themes for subsequent action including the need for further guidance on existing triage policies, ethical support in decision making, medicolegal protection, additional tools for therapeutic communications, and healthcare provider psychological support. CONCLUSION There is an urgent need for collaboration between policymakers and frontline physicians to develop critical care resource triage policies that wholly consider the diversity of provider perspectives across practice environments.","Mulla, Ali; Bigham, Blair L; Frolic, Andrea; Christian, Michael D",Journal of emergency management,https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.2020.0484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351183/,147

Given the importance of these components in determining performance, it is of interest to understand the volume of evidence to support implementation in practice by coaches, practitioners, and athletes. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic mapping review to describe the current scale and density of research for testing, training and optimising performance in track cycling. METHODS All publications involving track cyclist participants were reviewed from four databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library) plus additional sources. Search results returned 4019 records, of which 71 met the inclusion criteria for the review. RESULTS The review revealed most published track cycling research investigated athlete testing followed by performance optimisation, with training being the least addressed domain. Research on the physical components of track cycling has been published far more frequently than for tactical or technical components, and only one study was published on the mental components of track cycling. No true experimental research using track cyclists has been published, with 51 non-experimental and 20 quasi-experimental study designs. CONCLUSIONS Research in track cycling has been growing steadily. However, it is evident there is a clear preference toward understanding the physical-rather than mental, tactical, or technical-demands of track cycling. Future research should investigate how this aligns with coach, practitioner, and athlete needs for achieving track cycling success.

96131,FDA approves a second PSMA targeting agent for PET imaging in men with prostate cancer.,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND Several studies have reported a positive correlation between serum drug concentrations and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease. AIM To examine the association between the concentrations of cytokine blockers (infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab) and endoscopic remission of small bowel lesions. METHOD This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a single tertiary referral centre. Patients with Crohn's disease who received maintenance cytokine blocker therapy were recruited from April 2018 to May 2020. We performed balloon-assisted enteroscopy and collected serum samples to measure drug concentrations. The primary endpoint was the relationship between the concentrations of cytokine blockers and endoscopic remission in the small bowel. RESULTS We enrolled 143 patients, 66, 44 and 33 of whom were receiving infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Enteroscopic findings showed that the rate of endoscopic remission of small bowel lesions was significantly lower than that of colonic lesions (P < 0.01). For each agent, the mean drug concentration in patients exhibiting endoscopic remission in the small bowel was higher than that observed in patients with endoscopic remission in the colon (but not in the small bowel) or with any active disease (either in the small bowel, colon or both). Patients with infliximab, adalimumab and ustekinumab concentrations >5, 14 and 4 µg/mL were nearly 5.3-, 9.4- and 14.7-times more likely to exhibit endoscopic remission of the small bowel, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Cytokine blocker treatment was less efficacious for small bowel inflammation than colonic inflammation. Higher serum concentrations were needed to achieve endoscopic remission of small bowel lesions.","Takenaka, Kento; Kawamoto, Ami; Hibiya, Shuji; Suzuki, Kohei; Fujii, Toshimitsu; Motobayashi, Maiko; Shimizu, Hiromichi; Nagahori, Masakazu; Saito, Eiko; Okamoto, Ryuichi; Watanabe, Mamoru; Ohtsuka, Kazuo",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323301/,147

METHODS 54 subjects (BMI: 36 ± 1 kg/m(2) , age: 48 ± 4 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (HbA1c : 9.7 ± 2%) were randomized to IMT, RYGB, or SG and underwent DXA at baseline and at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS At 2 years, the reduction in BMI was similar after RYGB and SG and was greater than IMT (P < 0.001). Lean mass was reduced by ∼10%, total bone mineral content reduced by ∼8%, and hip BMD reduced by ∼9% in both surgical groups and was significantly greater than IMT despite increases in vitamin D intake in all groups. The change in hip BMD correlated with weight loss (r = 0.84, P < 0.0001) and changes in lean mass (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001) and leptin (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001). Peripheral fractures were self-reported in RYGB (4/18 patients), SG (2/19 patients), and IMT (4/16 patients). CONCLUSIONS Surgically induced weight loss is associated with modest reductions in lean mass, bone mineral content, and BMD, despite calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients with T2DM. Awareness for bone loss is indicated for patients undergoing bariatric procedures.","Maghrabi, Adam H; Wolski, Kathy; Abood, Beth; Licata, Angelo; Pothier, Claire; Bhatt, Deepak L; Nissen, Steven; Brethauer, Stacy A; Kirwan, John P; Schauer, Philip R; Kashyap, Sangeeta R",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.21150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193177/,147

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2015 to 2019, 222 HVPG measurements performed during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation were eligible for this study. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) software color-coded each pixel of a two-dimensional DSA series by time-intensity curve to classify IHVS. Different degrees of IHVS were found in 36.5% of patients (81/222). Mild IHVS was found in 10.8% of patients (24/222), moderate IHVS was found in 10.8% of patients (24/222), and severe IVHS was found in 14.9% of patients (33/222). RESULTS Mean wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP) and HVPG were significantly lower in patients with IHVS compared with patients without IHVS (WHVP: 17.78 mm Hg ± 7.00 vs 24.89 mm Hg ± 8.69, P = .001; HVPG: 11.93 mm Hg ± 5.76 vs 18.6 mm Hg ± 6.85, P < .001). Mild IHVS had little effect on WHVP and HVPG. Mean WHVP and HVPG were 11 mm Hg lower in patients with moderate IHVS (WHVP: 20.38 mm Hg ± 8.38 vs 31.5 mm Hg ± 9.39, P = .026; HVPG: 13.88 mm Hg ± 6.33 vs 25.00 mm Hg ± 9.81, P < .001) and 15 mm Hg lower in patients with severe IHVS (WHVP: 13.45 mm Hg ± 5.28 vs 28.64 mm Hg ± 6.38, P = .017; HVPG: 8.27 mm Hg ± 3.85 vs 23.45 mm Hg ± 6.95, P < .001) than mean portal vein pressure and portal vein gradient. CONCLUSIONS For patients with moderate or severe IHVS, HVPG might greatly underestimate the actual value of portal vein pressure, and the portal vein should be catheterized to measure portal pressure.","Ma, Jingqin; Gong, Ximing; Luo, Jianjun; Gu, Junying; Yan, Zhiping; Zhang, Wen; Li, Changyu; Zhang, Zihan; Yang, Minjie",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2020.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261743/,147
97411,Canadian Consensus on TRK-Inhibitor Therapy for NTRK Fusion-positive Sarcoma.,2021-07-02,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the administration of intramuscular antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth to prevent preterm-associated neonatal mortality and morbidity. Poor quality medicines are a major problem for health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), however the quality of antenatal corticosteroids is not well understood. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of available studies describing the quality of recommended injectable antenatal corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) in LMICs. METHODS Structured search strategy was applied to six databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Global Index Medicus, WHO Medicines Quality Database), without year or language restrictions. Any primary study reporting any medicine quality parameter (Active Pharmacological Ingredient, pH and sterility) for injectable dexamethasone or betamethasone was eligible. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data on included studies and applied Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines tool to assess study quality. Results were reported narratively, stratified by country of manufacture, organisation type and level of care. RESULTS In total, 15,547 citations were screened with two eligible studies identified that focussed on dexamethasone quality (no studies of betamethasone were identified). One study included 19 samples from 9 LMICs, and the other included ""less than 100 samples"" from India. The prevalence of failed dexamethasone samples ranged from 3.14% to 32.2% due to inadequate Active Pharmacological Ingredient. A higher prevalence of failed dexamethasone samples were seen at the point of care and the public sector. CONCLUSIONS Poor quality maternal and newborn health medicines can endanger women and newborns. Though available evidence on antenatal corticosteroids quality in LMICs is limited, results suggested poor quality dexamethasone may be prevalent in some countries. More primary studies are required to confirm these findings and guide policymakers on procurement of good-quality maternal and newborn health medicines.","Mosoro, Euodia; Wilson, Alyce N; Homer, Caroline S E; Vogel, Joshua P",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270682/,147

It would be valuable to be able to predict which patients are likely to benefit in terms of exacerbation prevention based on their early response in lung function and symptoms. Methods This was a post-hoc analysis from the 52-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority FLAME trial. Early clinically important improvement (ECII) was defined as achievement of minimal clinically important difference in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; ≥100 mL increase) and one patient-reported outcome (PRO): either St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (≥4-unit reduction; D1), or COPD assessment test (≥2-point reduction; D2) at Week 4 or 12. Results Approximately 18-20% of patients achieved ECII at Week 4 or 12 post-randomization according to any of the two definitions. The rate of subsequent exacerbations was lower in patients who achieved ECII at Week 4 (D1: ratio of rates [95% CI], 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.88 [0.77 to 1.00]) or at Week 12 (D1, 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.86 [0.75 to 1.00]) versus patients not achieving ECII. Patients who achieved ECII experienced longer time-to-first exacerbation between Week 4 or 12 to end of study. More patients achieved ECII with indacaterol/glycopyrronium versus salmeterol/fluticasone according to both definitions at Week 4 (D1, odds ratio [95% CI], 1.69 [1.40 to 2.04]; D2, 1.61 [1.34 to 1.93]), and 12 (D1, 2.01 [1.66 to 2.44]; D2, 1.80 [1.48 to 2.18]). Conclusion ECII is a novel composite endpoint, based on clinically relevant improvement in lung function and PROs in the early phase of treatment intervention that may predict subsequent exacerbation risk and may be used in clinical trials.","Kostikas, Konstantinos; Mackay, Alexander J; Vogelmeier, Claus F; Frent, Stefan-Marian; Gupta, Pritam; Banerji, Donald; Patalano, Francesco; Pfister, Pascal J; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s247966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884253/,147

A three-wave survey was conducted using a time-lagged design of older people who had travel experiences in Hubei, China on the eve of the outbreak. Results reveal positive associations between stigmatization and stress, social avoidance, and fear of disclosure, in addition to positive associations between stress and social avoidance and fear of disclosure. Findings thus suggest that the effects of stigmatization on social avoidance and fear of disclosure is mediated, in part, by stress.

However, the number of patients and comparison of long-term survival rates between the two groups are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function of EGC patients with LC after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical data of EGC patients with LC who had no other malignancy and underwent distal gastrectomy at Asan Medical Center between January 2005 and April 2013 were investigated retrospectively. All patients were divided into two groups: the open group (OG) and laparoscopic group (LG). The clinicopathologic data of the two groups were compared. RESULTS The number of patients in each group was 48 and 27 in the OG and LG, respectively. There were no significant differences in the age, sex ratio, ASA score, cause of liver cirrhosis, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, TNM stage, total postoperative drain amount, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, morbidity and recurrence rate. Shorter hospital stay, longer operative time and more retrieved lymph nodes were observed in LG. The long-term overall survival rate was not different between the two groups (P = 0.356).

The optimum settings for high-frequency jet ventilation in this scenario are unclear. We investigated flow dynamics with BPFs of 2 and 10 mm, at various positions and with different jet ventilator settings in a bench-top model. METHODS A 2 or 10 mm length fistula was created at proximal, middle, or distal sites in standard artificial ventilator 'test' lungs and cadaveric porcine lungs. The effects of alterations in frequency, applied pressure, and on entrained, expired, and leak volumes were determined using gauge and differential pressure sensors. RESULTS Entrained, delivered, and leak volumes were affected markedly by ventilator settings, particularly frequency: leaks were much greater at frequencies <100 min(-1). The leak/expired volume ratio varied between 0% and 92%. Leak and entrained volumes increased progressively with more proximally situated fistulae, whereas the measured expired volume decreased. Leak volumes with a 2 mm fistula were approximately half that of a 10 mm fistula across all ventilator frequencies. All volumes increased with increased driving pressure. The optimum injection time varied depending on BPF position and the accepted compromise between leak and expired volumes. Entrained volume contributed up to 50% of the total tidal volume. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that gas leak will be minimized and ventilator volumes maintained during jet ventilation using frequencies >200 min(-1) and lower driving pressures, but confirmatory clinical studies are required. Values displayed by the jet ventilator are unreliable.","Wood, M J; Lin, E S; Thompson, J P",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24172056/,147

MATERIAL AND METHOD All patient records from the Psychiatric Casualty Clinic in Oslo from and including 13 March 2020 up to and including 1 April 2020 were compared with the patient records from the same period in 2019. Patient visits were registered as COVID-19-related when the patient came to the clinic for an issue linked to the pandemic. RESULTS The Psychiatric Casualty Clinic in Oslo had 105 patient visits in the period 13 March 2019-1 April 2019 and 63 in the same period for 2020 (-40 %). The number of admissions amounted to 16 in 2019 and 7 in 2020 (-56 %). The number of COVID-19-related consultations was 14/63 (22 %). There was a reduction in the number of patient visits for crisis reactions, from 28 in 2019 to 8 in 2020. INTERPRETATION The background for the decline in the flow of patients in the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely a complex one. We believe that patients primarily chose not to visit the clinic due to the risk of infection and the wish to avoid burdening the health services. With the reservation that our data are limited, it does not appear that increased access to psychiatric health services requiring physical attendance is indicated in the acute phase of a pandemic.","Ness, Ewa; Salvador, Erik Myrvang; Gardsjord, Erlend Strand","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815335/,147
99905,Treatment of Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Japan: Position of Curative Therapies.,2020-01-01,"We sequenced and analyzed the full-length genomes of four coronaviruses (CoVs), each from a distinct wild-ruminant species in Ohio: sambar deer (Cervus unicolor), a waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), a sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), and a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The fecal samples from the sambar deer, the waterbuck, and the white-tailed deer were collected during winter dysentery outbreaks and sporadic diarrhea cases in 1993 and 1994 (H. Tsunemitsu, Z. R. el-Kanawati, D. R. Smith, H. H. Reed, and L. J. Saif, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:3264-3269, 1995). A fecal sample from a sable antelope was collected in 2003 from an Ohio wild-animal habitat during the same outbreak when a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (GiCoV) was isolated (M. Hasoksuz, K. Alekseev, A. Vlasova, X. Zhang, D. Spiro, R. Halpin, S. Wang, E. Ghedin, and L. J. Saif, J. Virol. 81:4981-4990, 2007). For two of the CoVs (sambar deer and waterbuck), complete genomes from both the cell culture-adapted and gnotobiotic-calf-passaged strains were also sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetically, wild-ruminant CoVs belong to group 2a CoVs, with the closest relatedness to recent bovine CoV (BCoV) strains. High nucleotide identities (99.4 to 99.6%) among the wild-ruminant strains and recent BCoV strains (BCoV-LUN and BCoV-ENT, isolated in 1998) further confirm the close relatedness. Comparative genetic analysis of CoVs of captive wild ruminants with BCoV strains suggests that no specific genomic markers are present that allow discrimination between the bovine strains and bovine-like CoVs from captive wild ruminants; furthermore, no specific genetic markers were identified that defined cell cultured or calf-passaged strains or the host origin of strains. The results of this study confirm prior reports of biologic and antigenic similarities between bovine and wild-ruminant CoVs and suggest that cattle may be reservoirs for CoVs that infect captive wild ruminants or vice versa and that these CoVs may represent host range variants of an ancestral CoV.","Alekseev, Konstantin P; Vlasova, Anastasia N; Jung, Kwonil; Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Zhang, Xinsheng; Halpin, Rebecca; Wang, Shiliang; Ghedin, Elodie; Spiro, David; Saif, Linda J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01586-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842722/,147

This manifests as persistent chronic inflammation, immune activation or exhaustion that can promote the onset of co-morbidities. As the exact function of regulatory T (Treg) cells in HIV remains unclear, this cross-sectional study investigated three expression markers (Forkhead box protein P3 [FOXP3], glycoprotein A repetitions predominant [GARP], special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 [SATB1]) and compared their expansion between CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25++ T cells. Age-matched study subjects were recruited (Western Cape, South Africa) and sub-divided: HIV-negative subjects (n = 12), HIV-positive naïve treated (n = 22), HIV-positive treated based on CD4 count cells/µL (CD4 > 500 and CD4 < 500) (n = 34) and HIV-treated based on viral load (VL) copies/mL (VL < 1000 and VL > 1000) (n = 34). Markers of immune activation (CD38) and coagulation (CD142) on T cells (CD8) were assessed by flow cytometry together with FOXP3, GARP and SATB1 expression on CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25++ T cells. Plasma levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10; anti-inflammatory marker), IL-6 (inflammatory marker) and D-dimer (coagulation marker) were assessed. This study revealed three major findings in immuno-compromised patients with virological failure (CD4 < 500; VL > 1000): (1) the expansion of the unconventional Treg cell subset (CD4+CD25-FOXP3+) is linked with disease progression markers; (2) increased GARP expression in the CD4+CD25- and CD4+CD25++ subsets; and (3) the identification of a strong link between CD4+CD25-SATB1+ cells and markers of immune activation (CD8+CD38+) and coagulation (CD8+CD142+ and D-dimer).","Teer, Eman; Joseph, Danzil E; Dominick, Leanne; Glashoff, Richard H; Essop, M Faadiel",Virologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-021-00386-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974229/,147
100402,Differential Diagnosis of Cystic Pancreatic Lesions Including the Usefulness of Biomarkers.,2015,"PURPOSE Rectal division and anastomosis are difficult steps in a laparoscopic low anterior resection. This difficulty is due to the limitations of laparoscopic instrumentation within the anatomical confines of the pelvis. Robotic technology overcomes most of these limitations to simplify the procedure. We describe our technique of controlled rectal transection and robotic purse-string placement by use of the da Vinci Robotic system. METHODS Three patients with rectal cancer who were scheduled to undergo a robot-assisted low anterior resection were selected to undergo this procedure. Safety, feasibility, and immediate postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed in all 3 patients with no intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative bilateral femoral neuropathy that resolved spontaneously. The mean operating time was 339.6 minutes, and all 3 patients were sent home by the fifth postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS The advanced surgical dexterity of the da Vinci Robot enables a controlled rectal transection and purse-string suture placement on the rectal stump. This achieves a right-angled rectal division and a secure, single-stapled anastomosis in a low anterior resection. The feasibility of this technique has been demonstrated in 3 patients, in whom this technique has been safely performed with acceptable results. A larger series of patients and a long-term follow-up is required to demonstrate an objective benefit.","Prasad, Leela M; deSouza, Ashwin L; Marecik, Slawomir J; Park, John J; Abcarian, Herand",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181bc9db0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20087100/,147

METHODS An ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging device was installed in the internal medicine department specializing in diabetes to obtain fundus images of patients with diabetes. Remote interpretation was conducted at Nagoya City University using a cloud server. The medical data, severity of retinopathy, and frequency of ophthalmologic visits were analyzed. RESULTS Four hundred ninety-nine patients (mean age, 62.5 ± 13.4 years) were included. The duration of diabetes in 240 (48.1%) patients was less than 10 years and 433 (86.7%) patients had a hemoglobin (Hb) A1c below 8%. Regarding the retinopathy severity, 359 (72.1%) patients had no diabetic retinopathy (NDR), 63 (12.6%) mild nonproliferative retinopathy (NPDR), 37 (7.6%) moderate NPDR, 13 (2.6%) severe NPDR, and 27 (5.0%) PDR. Two hundred forty-one (48.3%) patients had an ophthalmologic consultation within 1 year, 104 (20.8%) had no history of an ophthalmologic consultation. DR was not present in 86 (82.7%) patients who had never had an ophthalmologic examination, 32 (80.0%) patients with severe NPDR or PDR had had an ophthalmologic visit within 1 year. The frequency of ophthalmic visits was correlated negatively with age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, and severity of retinopathy. CONCLUSION Remote interpretation of DR using UWF retinal imaging was useful for retinopathy screening. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a remote screening system that can ensure compulsory social distancing and reduce the number of ophthalmic visits can be a safe system for patients and clinicians.","Kato, Aki; Fujishima, Keiichiro; Takami, Kazuhisa; Inoue, Naomi; Takase, Noriaki; Suzuki, Norihiro; Suzuki, Katsuya; Kuwayama, Soichiro; Yamada, Akiko; Sakai, Katsuo; Hotta, Ryosuke; Nozaki, Miho; Yoshida, Munenori; Hirano, Yoshio; Yasukawa, Tsutomu; Ogura, Yuichiro",Diabetes research and clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2021.108902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102247/,147

High-quality randomized trials to evaluate the effects of practical sodium reduction strategies are needed. METHODS The study is a cluster randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design conducted in 48 senior residential facilities in northern China. These facilities are randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 1 of 4 groups: stepwise salt supply control (SSSC) in which 5%-10% of the study salt supply in the institutional kitchens will be reduced every 3 months, replacing normal salt with salt substitute (SS); SSSC only; SS only; or neither SSSC nor SS. The interventions last for 2 years with follow-up every 6 months. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 24 months. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, cardiovascular events, and death. CURRENT STATUS The study has recruited and randomized 48 senior residential facilities with 1,606 participants. Mean age at baseline was 71 years, and 76% are male. Both types of salt intervention were initiated in the study facilities between January and April 2018. CONCLUSION The study is well placed to define the effects of 2 practical and scalable sodium reduction strategies for blood pressure reduction and will provide important new data about safety of these strategies among older adults in China.","Jin, Aoming; Liu, Kiang; Labarthe, Darwin R; Feng, Xiangxian; Zhang, Ruijuan; Wang, Hongxia; Qiao, Qianku; Li, Huijuan; Li, Jiayu; Gao, Pei; Fang, Hai; Duan, Peifen; Wang, Yuqi; Zhang, Hui; Cao, Lae; Neal, Bruce; Chen, Junshi; Wu, Yangfeng",American heart journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2020.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615357/,147

PRIMARY PRACTICE OF SETTING Acute care inpatient units in an academic medical center. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE A correlational design was utilized, and a prospective medical record review of patients was conducted while implementing face-to-face prehospital discharge meeting interventions. The study sample (N = 176) included adult patients in two neurosurgical wards who were admitted between June 2016 and September 2016. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to explore the balance between the intervention group receiving a face-to-face prehospital discharge meeting and comparison group receiving standard prehospital discharge care. Bivariate statistics were employed to determine associations between variables. RESULTS A total of 15 sociodemographic and medical-surgical variables were used to correlate TFU reach rates, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmission rates. Educational attainment (p = .002), employment status (p = .014), parental status (p = .010), and hospital service (p = .039) had significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups. Results demonstrated an improved reach rate for the intervention group but despite the differences in the groups, phi and Cramer's V coefficients did not correlate any associations with TFU reach rate, ED visits, and readmission rates with sociodemographic and surgical variables. This outcome affirmed that despite the similarities and differences in the sample, a face-to-face meeting prehospital discharge is an effective intervention to improve telephone outreach. IMPLICATIONS TO CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE There is a need to determine the most cost-effective way to increase TFU reach rates to prevent subsequent ED visits and hospital readmissions. There is also a need to develop a tool that can predict the hardest-to-reach patients posthospital discharge, so that case managers can meet those patients before leaving the hospital. In addition, it is important to identify alternative methods of ""face-to-face"" interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic crises. Case managers must explore ways with caution to leverage secured digital technology to bridge the gap of communicating with patients and family members when hospital visitations are limited.","Vergara, Franz H; Budhathoki, Chakra; Sheridan, Daniel J; Davis, Jean E; Sullivan, Nancy J",Professional case management,https://doi.org/10.1097/ncm.0000000000000530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609341/,147

In 2018, recorded infection control advice messages were affixed to 30% of England's automated hospital switchboards during the seasonal influenza and norovirus outbreaks. As the majority of messages were mandatory for all callers, healthcare professionals using the hospital switchboard - including during time-critical emergencies - had their enquiries significantly delayed by these measures. Importantly, published analyses did not demonstrate an association between these messages and patient outcomes. As of May 2020, 85% of NHS trusts made use of infection control messages; on average, these delayed healthcare professionals by 59.4 seconds per call, but had no clear association with patient outcomes from COVID-19.

S protein-specific T cells were present in resident and circulating populations. However, M and N protein-specific T cells were detected only in the resident T cell pool. Using an adoptive transfer strategy, we found that T cells from SARS-CoV-2 immune animals did not protect naive mice.

BACKGROUND Regulatory authorities for accreditation in North America have included nontechnical skills such as communication and teamwork in the competencies to be acquired by surgical residents before graduation. Concrete recommendations regarding the training and assessment of these competencies, however, are lacking. METHODS Nonrandomized, single-blinded study using an interrupted time-series design. Eleven senior surgical residents were observed during routine cases in the operating room (OR) at baseline and post-training. The Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) rating system was used. Observers were trained in NOTSS and blinded to the study purpose. Independent of the blinded observations, a surgeon educator conducted intraoperative observations, which served as the basis for the structured debriefing and feedback intervention. The intervention was administered to participants after a set of (blinded) baseline observations had been completed. Primary outcome was nontechnical performance in the OR as measured by the NOTSS system. Secondary outcome was perceived utility as assessed by a post-training questionnaire. RESULTS Twelve senior trainees were recruited, 11 completed the study. Average NOTSS scores improved significantly from 3.2 (SD 0.37) at baseline to 3.5 (SD 0.43) post-training [t(10) = -2.55, P = 0.29]. All participants felt the intervention was useful, and the majority thought that debriefing and feedback on nontechnical skills should be integrated in surgical training. CONCLUSIONS Debriefing and feedback in the OR may represent an effective strategy to ensure development of nontechnical skills in competency-based education.","Dedy, Nicolas J; Fecso, Andras B; Szasz, Peter; Bonrath, Esther M; Grantcharov, Teodor P",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26079900/,147

It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic stroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage on dabigatran. Aims To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. Methods Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used. Results Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In patients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median improvement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out of 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points and mRS 0-3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group). Conclusion Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is feasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab has the potential to prevent hematoma growth and improve outcome. Idarucizumab represents a new therapeutic option for patients under dabigatran treatment presenting with ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.","Kermer, Pawel; Eschenfelder, Christoph C; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Grond, Martin; Abdalla, Yasser; Althaus, Katharina; Berrouschot, Jörg; Cangür, Hakan; Daffertshofer, Michael; Edelbusch, Sebastian; Gröschel, Klaus; Haase, Claus G; Harloff, Andreas; Held, Valentin; Kauert, Andreas; Kraft, Peter; Lenz, Arne; Müllges, Wolfgang; Obermann, Mark; Partowi, Someieh; Purrucker, Jan; Ringleb, Peter A; Röther, Joachim; Rossi, Raluca; Schäfer, Niklas; Schneider, Andreas; Schuppner, Ramona; Seitz, Rüdiger J; Szabo, Kristina; Wruck, Robert",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493017701944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28494694/,147

Current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms suggests a central role for exaggerated activation of the innate immune system as an important contributor to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. The actions of colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapeutics, target multiple mechanisms associated with COVID-19 excessive inflammation. While many COVID-19 trials have sought to manipulate SARS-CoV-2 or dampen the inflammatory response once patients are hospitalised, few examine therapeutics to prevent the need for hospitalisation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated and inexpensive, and holds particular promise to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Successful outpatient treatment of COVID-19 could greatly reduce morbidity, mortality and the demand for rare or expensive care resources (front-line healthcare workers, hospital beds, ventilators, biological therapies), to the benefit of both resource-replete and resource-poor regions.","Reyes, Aaron Z; Hu, Kelly A; Teperman, Jacob; Wampler Muskardin, Theresa L; Tardif, Jean-Claude; Shah, Binita; Pillinger, Michael H",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-219174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293273/,147
102559,Clinical Significance and Inflammatory Landscape of aNovel Recurrence-Associated Immune Signature in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer.,2021,"BACKGROUND The devastating viral disease of small ruminants namely Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) declared as target for ""Global Eradication"" in 2015 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). For a successful eradication campaign, molecular diagnostic tools are preferred for their specificity, efficacy and robustness to compliment prophylactic measures and surveillance methods. However, molecular tools have a few limitations including, costly equipment, multi-step template preparation protocols, target amplification and analysis that restrict their use to the sophisticated laboratory settings. As reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) has such an intrinsic potential for point of care diagnosis, this study focused on the genetic detection of causative PPR virus (PPRV) in field conditions. It involves the use of a sample buffer that can precipitate out virus envelope and capsid proteins through ammonium sulphate precipitation and exposes viral RNA, present in the clinical sample, to the LAMP reaction mixture. RESULTS The test was evaluated using 11 PPRV cultures, and a total of 46 nasal swabs (n = 32 collected in the field outbreaks, n = 14 collected from experimentally inoculated animals). The RT-LAMP was compared with the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) for its relative specificity, sensitivity and robustness. RT-LAMP detected PPRV in all PPRV cultures in or less than 30 min. Its detection limit was of 0.0001TCID50 (tissue culture infective dose-50) per ml with 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of RT-PCR. In 59.4% of the field samples, RT-LAMP detected PPRV within 35-55 min. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP were equivalent to that of the RT-qPCR. The time of detection of PPRV decreased by at least forty minutes or 3-4 h in case of in the RT-LAMP as compared with the RT-qPCR and the RT-PCR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The sensitive and specific RT-LAMP test developed in this study targeting a small fragment of the N gene of PPRV is a rapid, reliable and applicable molecular diagnostic test of choice under the field conditions. RT-LAMP requiring minimal training offers a very useful tool for PPR diagnosis especially during the ""Global PPR Eradication Campaign"".","Ashraf, Waqas; Unger, Hermann; Haris, Sunaina; Mobeen, Ameena; Farooq, Muhammad; Asif, Muhammad; Khan, Qaiser Mahmood",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0940-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28122564/,147

103027,Health Care as an Ongoing Policy Project.,2020-07-30,"Limited data exist on clot composition and detailed characteristics of arterial thrombi associated with large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke. Advances in endovascular thrombectomy and related imaging modalities have created a unique opportunity to analyze thrombi removed from cerebral arteries. Insights into thrombus composition, etiology, physical properties and neurovascular interactions may lead to future advancements in acute ischemic stroke treatment and improved clinical outcomes. Advances in imaging techniques may enhance clot characterization and inform therapeutic decision-making prior to treatment and reveal stroke etiology to guide secondary prevention. Current imaging techniques can provide some information about thrombi, but there remains much to evaluate about relationships that may exist among thrombus composition, occlusion characteristics and treatment outcomes. Improved pathophysiological characterization of clot types, their properties and how these properties change over time, together with clinical correlates from ongoing studies, may facilitate revascularization with thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Interdisciplinary approaches covering clinical, engineering and scientific aspects of thrombus research will be key to advancing the understanding of thrombi and improving acute ischemic stroke therapy. This consensus statement integrates recent research on clots and thrombi retrieved from cerebral arteries and provides a rationale for further analyses, including current opportunities and limitations.","De Meyer, Simon F; Andersson, Tommy; Baxter, Blaise; Bendszus, Martin; Brouwer, Patrick; Brinjikji, Waleed; Campbell, Bruce Cv; Costalat, Vincent; Dávalos, Antoni; Demchuk, Andrew; Dippel, Diederik; Fiehler, Jens; Fischer, Urs; Gilvarry, Michael; Gounis, Matthew J; Gralla, Jan; Jansen, Olav; Jovin, Tudor; Kallmes, David; Khatri, Pooja; Lees, Kennedy R; López-Cancio, Elena; Majoie, Charles; Marquering, Henk; Narata, Ana Paula; Nogueira, Raul; Ringleb, Peter; Siddiqui, Adnan; Szikora, István; Vale, David; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Yoo, Albert J; Hacke, Werner; Liebeskind, David S",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493017709671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534706/,147

The initial surgical advantage seen in adults was for robotic prostatectomy, and over time this expanded to the pediatric population with robotic pyeloplasty. The introduction of three-dimensional visualization, tremor elimination, a 4th arm, and 7-degree range of motion allowed a significant operator advantage over laparoscopy, especially for anastomotic suturing. After starting with pyeloplasty, the use of robotic technology with pediatric urology has expanded to include ureteral reimplantation and even more complex reconstructive procedures, such as enterocystoplasty, appendicovesicostomy, and bladder neck reconstruction. However, limitations of the Da Vinci Surgical Systems still exist despite its continued technological advances over multiple generations in the past 20 years. Due to the smaller pediatric market, less focus appears to have been placed on the development of the smaller 5 mm instruments. As pediatric urology continues to utilize robotic technology for minimally invasive surgery, there is hope that additional pediatric-friendly instruments and components will be developed, either by Intuitive Surgical or one of the new robotic platforms in development that are working to address many of the shortcomings of current systems. These new robotic platforms include improved haptic feedback systems, flexible scopes, easier maneuverability, and even adaptive machine learning concepts to bring robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery to the next level. In this report, we review the present and upcoming technological advances of the current Da Vinci surgical systems as well as various new robotic platforms, each offering a unique set of technological advantages. As technology progresses, the understanding of and access to these new robotic platforms will help guide pediatric urologists into the next forefront of minimally invasive surgery.","Sheth, Kunj R; Koh, Chester J",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312621/,147

These challenges place migrant and seasonal farmworkers at a disproportionate risk of infection and illness because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report presents a case study of an early COVID-19 outbreak among migrant farmworkers in Iowa and describes the role that a nimble and responsive mobile federally qualified health center played in the successful mitigation and response to this outbreak. Early during the pandemic, the clinic adopted a new model of service delivery utilizing telemedicine primary care visits, followed by in-person visits when necessary. As the pandemic progressed, clinic staff strategized to provide increased pandemic-related support to agricultural employers and migrant farmworkers across the state. Emphasis was placed on on-site testing and education regarding social distancing, mask utilization, and hand washing. Eventually, as migrant workers were infected and became symptomatic, more complex mitigation strategies such as isolation, quarantine, and clinical follow-up were also implemented. This report describes how a mobile primary care clinic developed a pandemic responsive model to provide successful mitigation of an early COVID-19 outbreak among essential and highly vulnerable migrant farmworkers.","Corwin, Claudia; Sinnwell, Emily; Culp, Kennith",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2021.1913272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902394/,147

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advocates the use of prognostic enrichment of clinical trials by preselecting a patient population with increased likelihood of experiencing the trial's primary endpoint. OBJECTIVE This study compares validated clinical scales of risk (COMPERA, the French score, and REVEAL 2.0) to identify patients that are likely to experience a clinical worsening event for trial enrichment. METHODS Baseline data from three pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trials (AMBITION, SERAPHIN, and GRIPHON) were pooled and standardized. Receiver-operating curves were used to measure each algorithm's performance in predicting clinical worsening within the pooled placebo cohort. Power simulations were conducted to determine sample size and treatment time reductions for multiple enrichment strategies. A cost analysis was performed to illustrate potential financial savings by applying enrichment to GRIPHON. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS All risk algorithms were compared using area under the receiver-operating curve and substantially outperformed prediction per New York Heart Association Functional Class. REVEAL 2.0's risk grouping provided the greatest time and sample size savings in AMBITION and GRIPHON for all enrichment strategies but lacked appropriate inputs (i.e., N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) to perform as well in SERAPHIN. Cost analysis applied to GRIPHON demonstrated the greatest financial benefit by enrolling patients with a REVEAL score ≥8. CONCLUSION This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of risk algorithms for pulmonary arterial hypertension trial enrichment and a need for further investigation.","Scott, Jacqueline V; Garnett, Christine E; Kanwar, Manreet K; Stockbridge, Norman L; Benza, Raymond L",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202002-0357oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937078/,147

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Purnell, Phil",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27054305/,147
104022,Advances in the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.,2017,"COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, is one of the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting therapeutic plasma with desired functionalities.","Morgenlander, William R; Henson, Stephanie N; Monaco, Daniel R; Chen, Athena; Littlefield, Kirsten; Bloch, Evan M; Fujimura, Eric; Ruczinski, Ingo; Crowley, Andrew R; Natarajan, Harini; Butler, Savannah E; Weiner, Joshua A; Li, Mamie Z; Bonny, Tania S; Benner, Sarah E; Balagopal, Ashwin; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Eshleman, Susan; Casadevall, Arturo; Redd, Andrew D; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ackerman, Margaret E; Pekosz, Andrew; Elledge, Stephen J; Robinson, Matthew L; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Larman, H Benjamin",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci146927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571169/,147

We aimed to review our experience with simultaneous single-stage ECF takedown and complex abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR). METHODS Using a prospectively collected database, patients requiring surgical management of an ECF and AWR over a 5-year period were reviewed. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients (mean age = 58.6 years) underwent ECF repair/AWR. The mean hernia defect size was 426 ± 192 cm(2). Thirty-five (95%) patients required fascial releases to achieve abdominal wall closure. Thirty-six (97%) patients had sublay biologic mesh placed to reinforce the repair. Twenty-four (65%) patients developed a surgical site infection (8 superficial, 8 deep, and 8 organ space). Four patients developed an early anastomotic leak/refistulization. With a mean follow-up of 20 months, the hernia recurrence rate was 32% (n = 12).

104416,What can be done for cerebral embolic protection in TAVI? Analysis in the light of 10 years' experience with protected carotid artery stenting.,2016,"Mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory epithelium, are directly exposed to the external environment and therefore, are highly susceptible to viral infection. As a result, the respiratory tract has evolved a variety of innate and adaptive immune defenses in order to prevent viral infection or promote the rapid destruction of infected cells and facilitate the clearance of the infecting virus. Successful adaptive immune responses often lead to a functional state of immune memory, in which memory lymphocytes and circulating antibodies entirely prevent or lessen the severity of subsequent infections with the same virus. This is also the goal of vaccination, although it is difficult to vaccinate in a way that mimics respiratory infection. Consequently, some vaccines lead to robust systemic immune responses, but relatively poor mucosal immune responses that protect the respiratory tract. In addition, adaptive immunity is not without its drawbacks, as overly robust inflammatory responses may lead to lung damage and impair gas exchange or exacerbate other conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Thus, immune responses to respiratory viral infections must be strong enough to eliminate infection, but also have mechanisms to limit damage and promote tissue repair in order to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. Here, we will discuss the components of the adaptive immune system that defend the host against respiratory viral infections.","Allie, S Rameeza; Randall, Troy D",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20160259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28667071/,147

METHODS We designed a one-hour virtual networking session featuring three 15-minute small group meetings preceded and followed by general remarks. Each small group session consisted of one senior mentor, a junior/early career faculty moderator, and three to four junior/early career mentees. All participants completed an exit survey to evaluate perceived benefit of this event. RESULTS We recruited 103 mentees, 26 moderators, and 26 mentors for the event. Mentees were primarily at the resident training level or above (17% students). 56% of registered mentees, 100% of moderators and 96% of mentors attended the event for a total of 110 participants. Due to mentee attrition, each room contained 2-3 mentees. 90% of respondents felt the session met their goals very well or extremely well. Further, 99% felt this session was at least comparable to in-person networking at conferences and 60% felt this session was better than in-person networking. INTERPRETATION Virtual networking sessions between junior and senior academic neurologists are feasible and are at least comparable to, if not better than, in-person conference networking. Future events should consider nuanced mechanisms of matching mentors and mentees, inclusion of ad hoc small groups to foster organic networking, and measures to safeguard against mentee attrition. Future studies should evaluate the long-term benefits of this event to determine if virtual networking should be utilized moving forward.","Aravamuthan, Bhooma; Landsness, Eric C; Silbermann, Elizabeth",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352002/,147

Detailed understanding of disease progression and outcome in relation to different respiratory support strategies is important. METHODS Data collected between August 2009 and February 2010 for a national intensive care unit influenza registry were combined with cases identified by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control. RESULTS Clinical data was available for 95% (126/136) of the critically ill cases of influenza. Median age was 44 years, and major co-morbidities were present in 41%. Respiratory support strategies were studied among the 110 adult patients. Supplementary oxygen was sufficient in 15% (16), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) only was used in 20% (22), while transition from NIV to invasive ventilation (IV) was seen in 41% (45). IV was initiated directly in 24% (26). Patients initially treated with NIV had a higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of oxygen in inspired gas ratio compared with those primarily treated with IV. Major baseline characteristics and 28-day mortality were similar, but 90-day mortality was higher in patients initially treated with NIV 17/67 (25%) as compared with patients primarily treated with IV 3/26 (12%), relative risk 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.3-4.0). CONCLUSIONS Critical illness because of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in Sweden was dominated by hypoxic respiratory failure. The majority of patients in need of respiratory support were initially treated with NIV. In spite of less severe initial hypoxemia, initiation of ventilatory support with NIV was not associated with improved outcome.","Brink, M; Hagberg, L; Larsson, A; Gedeborg, R",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.2012.02727.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22724889/,147

This study aimed to demonstrate results of temporary stent placement for coiling wide necked small intracranial aneurysms, which eliminated need for antiplatelet agents, and to discuss its feasibility and safety. METHODS Data of 156 patients who underwent stent-assisted coil embolization between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Thirteen cases of temporary stent-assisted coil embolization were included, and their clinical and radiological results were evaluated. RESULTS The aneurysms treated were all unruptured except one case. All of them had wide neck with mean dome-to-neck ratio of 0.96 and were small-sized aneurysms with mean maximal diameter of 4.2 mm. There was no technical failure in retrieval of stent after completion of embolization of the target aneurysm. Immediate angiography revealed 11 complete and two partial embolization (one residual neck and one residual aneurysm). Two cases encountered thrombosis complication, and they were managed without neurological sequelae. The mean follow-up period was 43 months, angiographic follow-up revealed two cases with minor recurrence, and clinical outcome was good with modified Rankin scale score of 0. CONCLUSION Temporary stent-assisted coil embolization of small wide-necked intracranial aneurysm using fully retrievable stent appears safe and effective.

RESULTS All three groups were similar with respect to age and sex distribution. Around 50% to 60% of the children in both patient groups had a psychiatric diagnosis. Remarkably, 30% of the children had an internalizing disorder. The most commonly used coping style by the mothers was religious coping in all groups. Kid-COPE scores did not significantly differ between groups. The scores on Family and Friend subscales of SSAS in the bronchiectasis group were significantly lower when compared with those of participants in hematology-oncology and control groups. CONCLUSION Chronic medical illnesses may have a similar psychological impact on children regardless of disease-specific clinical presentations and outcomes. Future studies need to focus on identifying protective and risk factors that potentially mediate psychosocial well-being.","Bikmazer, Alperen; Orengul, Abdurrahman Cahid; Buyukdeniz, Ayşe; Okur, Fatma Visal; Gokdemir, Yasemin; Perdahli Fis, Nese",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31816196/,147
106101,The AirView Study: Comparison of Intubation Conditions and Ease between the Airtraq-AirView and the King Vision.,2015,"Background: Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) are significantly affected by age and may represent restrictions on functional independence. Previous studies in young adults have already highlighted that changing postural stability (i.e., seated vs. upright posture) affects the motor planning and APAs. In frail older adults (FOAs), the effect of these different conditions of postural stability have not yet been established, and the present study aimed to disentangle this issue. Methods: Participants executed an arm-pointing task to reach a diode immediately after it turned on, under different conditions of stability (seated with and without foot support and in an upright posture). A kinematic profile of the index finger and postural electromyographic data were registered in their dominant-side leg muscles: tibialis anterior, soleus, rectus femoris, and semitendinosus. Results: The main finding of this study was that the adopted posture and body stabilization in FOAs did not reflect differences in APAs or kinematic features. In addition, they did not present an optimal APA, since postural muscles are recruited simultaneously with the deltoid. Conclusion: Thus, FOAs seem to use a single non-optimal motor plan to assist with task performance and counterbalance perturbation forces in which they present similar APAs and do not modify their kinematics features under different equilibrium constraints.","Callegari, Bianca; Kubicki, Alexandre; Saunier, Ghislain; Duarte, Manuela Brito; Almeida, Gizele Cristina da Silva; Alves, Bruno Mazziotti Oliveira; Amorim, César Ferreira; Garcez, Daniela Rosa; Souza, Givago da Silva; Mourey, France",Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9080921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442058/,147

106488,Reform of Payment for Primary Care - From Evolution to Revolution.,2021-02-17,"INTRODUCTION Damage to the respiratory epithelium, is often a multifactorial phenomenon where environmental and host factors may concur to determine the same effect. The risk for developing a damage in respiratory epithelium and recurrent respiratory infections may vary among individuals both in children and in adults. Preventive measures are based on strengthening the immune function, thus increasing the natural response to pathogens. Immunomodulatory agents are: i. synthetic molecules; ii. Probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics; iii. Lysates, bacterial extracts immunomodulators: OM-85, RU 41740, D53; iv. Trace elements, vitamins. OM-85, an oral medicine of biological origin, is used for the prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections and/or exacerbations both in adults and children, showing a good efficacy and safety profile. Its active principle, an extract of bacterial lysates isolated from 21 known respiratory pathogenic strains, shows protection against airway infections of bacterial and viral origin. AREAS COVERED This non-systematic review focuses on bacterial lysates and in particular on OM-85 and its effects on respiratory epithelium function and activity in asthma respiratory infections. Studies were selected by PubMed search of ""bacterial lysate"" or ""OM-85"" and ""respiratory epithelium"" or ""respiratory infections"", from 1993 to 2019. EXPERT OPINION Results highlight the ability of OM-85 to trigger immunomodulatory and protective immune responses against different pathogens in vivo, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus as well bacterial superinfection following influenza.","Cardinale, Fabio; Lombardi, Enrico; Rossi, Oliviero; Bagnasco, Diego; Bellocchi, Aldo; Menzella, Francesco",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1793673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635771/,147

METHODS A retrospective, single-center study was carried out in an acute-care teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Between January 2008 and June 2015, consecutive patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy were included in the study. Surgical outcomes were operative time, length of skin incision, use of a suction drain, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 2000 patients were included (LigaSure™ Small Jaw, n = 1000; LigaSure Precise™, n = 1000). Demographics and indication for surgery were similar in both groups. A significant and independent shorter operative time (median 40 vs. 65 min, P = 0.002), smaller length of the skin incision (mean [SD] 4 [2] vs. 7 [3] cm, P = 0.031), lower percentages of patients with suction drain (15% vs. 66%, P = 0.012) and intraoperative bleeding (4% vs. 9%, P = 0.045) and reduced length of stay (median 1 vs. 3 days, P = 0.039) were found in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw than in the LigaSure Precise™. Postoperative complications including haematoma, hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury were similar. CONCLUSIONS The LigaSure™ Small Jaw in thyroid surgery results in significant less blood loss and operative time as well as shorter hospital stay compared to LigaSure Precise™.

107445,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous and oral apixaban in horses.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disease that causes motor and cognitive disabilities. This disease is associated with a loss of dopamine content within the putamen, which stems from the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Several approved drugs are available that can effectively treat symptoms of PD. However, long-term medical management is often complicated and does not delay or halt disease progression. Alternatively, cell replacement strategies can address these shortcomings and provide dopamine where it is needed. Although using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for treatment of PD is a promising alternative, no consensus in the literature pertains to efficacy concerns of hPSC-based therapy for PD. This systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy of primate PSC-derived DA progenitor transplantation to treat PD in preclinical studies. METHODS This is a systematic review of preclinical studies in animal models of PD. We intend to use the following databases as article sources: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, and SCOPUS without any restrictions on language or publication status for all related articles published until the end of April 2021. Two independent reviewers will select the titles and abstracts, extract data from qualifying studies, and assess the risk of bias using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool and the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) checklist. Apomorphine-induced rotation test (APO-IR) and amphetamine-induced rotation test (AMP-IR) are defined as the primary outcomes. The standardized mean difference (SMD) by Hedges' g method (r) and odds ratio (OR) and related 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated to determine the size effect of the treatment. The heterogeneity between studies will be calculated by ""I2 inconsistency of values and Cochran's Q statistical test,"" where I2 > 50% and/or p < 0.10 suggests high heterogeneity. Meta-analyses of random effects will be run when appropriate. DISCUSSION This study will present an overview of preclinical research on PSCs and their therapeutic effects in PD animal models. This systematic review will point out the strengths and limitations of studies in the current literature while encouraging the funding of new studies by public health managers and governmental bodies.","Karimi, Aliasghar; Elmi, Mitra; Shiri, Zahra; Baharvand, Hossein",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01736-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172098/,147
107605,"Prevalence of Common Nosocomial Infections and Evaluation of Antibiotic Resistance Patterns in Patients with Secondary Infections in Hamadan, Iran.",2020,"BACKGROUND The authors hypothesized that mouth ventilation by a resuscitator via the nasal route ensures a more patent airway and more effective ventilation than does ventilation via the oral route and therefore would be the optimal manner to ventilate adult patients in emergencies, such as during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They tested the hypothesis by comparing the effectiveness of mouth-to-nose breathing (MNB) and mouth-to-mouth breathing (MMB) in anesthetized, apneic, adult subjects without muscle paralysis. METHODS Twenty subjects under general anesthesia randomly received MMB and MNB with their heads placed first in a neutral position and then an extended position. A single operator performed MNB and MMB at the target breathing rate of 10 breaths/min, inspiratory:expiratory ratio 1:2 and peak inspiratory airway pressure 24 cm H₂O. A plethysmograph was used to measure the amplitude change during MMB and MNB. The inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes during MMB and MNB were calculated retrospectively using the calibration curve. RESULTS All data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges). The rates of effective ventilation (expired volume > estimated anatomic dead space) during MNB and MMB were 91.1% (42.4-100%) and 43.1% (42.5-100%) (P < 0.001), and expired tidal volume with MMB 130.5 ml (44.0-372.8 ml) was significantly lower than with MNB 324.5 ml (140.8-509.0 ml), regardless of the head position (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Direct mouth ventilation delivered exclusively via the nose is significantly more effective than that delivered via the mouth in anesthetized, apneic adult subjects without muscle paralysis. Additional studies are needed to establish whether using this breathing technique during emergency situations will improve patient outcomes.","Jiang, Yandong; Bao, Fang Ping; Liang, Yafen; Kimball, William R; Liu, Yanhong; Zapol, Warren M; Kacmarek, Robert M",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31821d6c69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21572315/,147

METHODS De-identified EMR data from 323 primary care providers contributing to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Alberta were used. Mapping files from each contributing provider were generated from their EMR to facilitate linkage to administrative data within the provincial health data warehouse. Deterministic linkage was conducted using valid personal healthcare number (PHN) with age and/or sex. Characteristics of patients and providers in the linked cohort were compared with population-level sources. Criteria used to define hypertension in both sources were examined. RESULTS Data were successfully linked for 6307 hypertensive patients (96.2% of eligible patients) from 49 contributing providers. Non-linkages from invalid PHN (n=246) occurred more for deceased patients and those with fewer primary care encounters, with differences due to type of EMR and patient EMR status. The linked cohort had more patients who were female, >60 years and residing in rural areas compared to the provincial healthcare registry. Family physicians were more often female and medically trained in Canada compared to all physicians in Alberta. Most patients (>97%) had ≥1 record in the registry, pharmacy, emergency/ambulatory care and claims databases; 44.3% had ≥1 record in the hospital discharge database. CONCLUSION EMR-administrative data linkage has the potential to enhance hypertension surveillance. The current linkage process in Alberta is limited and subject to selection bias. Processes to address these deficiencies are under way.","Garies, Stephanie; Youngson, Erik; Soos, Boglarka; Forst, Brian; Duerksen, Kimberley; Manca, Donna; McBrien, Kerry; Drummond, Neil; Quan, Hude; Williamson, Tyler",BMJ health & care informatics,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2020-100161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830109/,147

We evaluated the change in ETT cuff pressure by changing the position from supine to prone without head movement. METHODS Fifty-five patients were enrolled and scheduled for lumbar spine surgery. Neutral angle, which was the angle on the mandibular angle between the neck midline and mandibular inferior border, was measured. The initial neutral pressure of the ETT cuff was measured, and the cuff pressure was subsequently adjusted to 26 cmH2O. Flexed or extended angles and cuff pressure were measured in both supine and prone positions, when the patient's head was flexed or extended. Initial neutral pressure in prone was compared with adjusted neutral pressure (26 cmH2O) in supine. Flexed and extended pressure were compared with adjusted neutral pressure in supine or prone, respectively. RESULTS There were no differences between supine and prone position for neutral, flexed, and extended angles. The initial neutral pressure increased after changing position from supine to prone (26.0 vs. 31.5 ± 5.9 cmH2O, P < 0.001). Flexed and extended pressure in supine were increased to 38.7 ± 6.7 (P < 0.001) and 26.7 ± 4.7 cmH2O (not statistically significant) than the adjusted neutral pressure. Flexed and extended pressure in prone were increased to 40.5 ± 8.8 (P < 0.001) and 29.9 ± 8.7 cmH2O (P = 0.002) than the adjusted neutral pressure.

RESEARCH QUESTION Does sleep study-derived circulation time (Ct) predict mortality, independent of CV risks and SDB severity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We derived average lung to finger Ct (LFCT) from sleep studies in older men enrolled in the multi-center Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men (MrOS Sleep) study. LFCT was defined as the average time between end of scored respiratory events and nadir oxygen desaturations associated with those events. We calculated the hazards ratio (HR) for the CV and all-cause mortality by LFCT quartiles adjusting for the demographic, body habitus, baseline CV risk and disease (CVD). Additional model included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), time with SpO2 below 90%, and hypoxic burden. We also repeated analyses after excluding those with CVD at baseline. RESULTS A total of 2631 men (mean age 76.4 +- 5.5 years) were included in this study. LFCT median [IQR] was 18 [15-22] s. During average follow up of 9.9 +/- 3.5 years, 427 (16%) and 1205 (46%) men experienced CV death and all-cause death, respectively. In multivariate analysis, men in the 4th quartile of LFCT (22-52 s) had a HR of 1.36 [95% CI =1.02, 1.81] and of 1.35 [1.14, 1.60] for CV and all-cause mortality, respectively, when compared to men in the 1st quartile (4-15 s). The results were similar when additionally adjusting for AHI, time with SpO2 below 90%, or hypoxic burden. Results were stronger among men with no history of CVD at baseline. INTERPRETATION LFCT is associated with both CV and all-cause mortality in older men, independent of baseline CV burden and SDB metrics. LFCT may be a novel physiologic marker for CV vulnerability and adverse outcomes in patients with SDB.","Kwon, Younghoon; Sands, Scott A; Stone, Katie L; Taranto-Montemurro, Luigi; Alex, Raichel M; White, David P; Wellman, Andrew; Redline, Susan; Azarbarzin, Ali",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069723/,147

The study describes 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who developed an acute erythematous rash with nonfollicular pinhead-sized pustules, without mucosal involvement. The clinical differential diagnosis was viral rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), or multiform erythema. computed tomography with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia and a respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients had signs of respiratory distress and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Punch biopsies showed subcorneal pustules typical of AGEP. Dermal microvascular injury and thrombosis as described in skin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed. The direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative in 8 patients investigated. A polymerase chain reaction for RNA SARS-CoV-2 performed on frozen skin was negative in 5 of 6 patients. Most of our patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. After some days (4-10), the diffuse erythema and pustules had improved. AGEP is classified as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, provoked by drugs and acute infections. Characteristically, removal of the offending agent leads to spontaneous resolution typically in less than 15 days. The recognition of AGEP is important, in order to avoid confusion with a systemic infection and consequently to avoid incorrect treatment. Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs are common and are major health problems worldwide causing considerable costs for health care systems. We suggest that in the patients with AGEP during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, viral infection is a risk factor for developing drug reaction.","Pezzarossa, Enrico; Ungari, Marco; Caresana, Gioachino; Sagradi, Fabio; Cimardi, Leonardo; Pan, Angelo; Testa, Sophie; Aguggini, Sergio; Varotti, Elena; Tanzi, Giulia; Manotti, Laura; Ferrero, Giuseppina; Gusolfino, Marino Daniel; Trombatore, Monica",The American Journal of dermatopathology,https://doi.org/10.1097/dad.0000000000001819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33405402/,147

With increasing detection of unruptured aneurysms, clinicians are routinely faced with the dilemma whether to treat IA patients and how to best treat them. Hemodynamic and morphological characteristics are increasingly considered in aneurysm rupture risk assessment and treatment planning, but currently no computational tools allow routine integration of flow visualization and quantitation of these parameters in clinical workflow. In this paper, we introduce AView, a prototype of a clinician-oriented, integrated computation tool for aneurysm hemodynamics, morphology, and risk and data management to aid in treatment decisions and treatment planning in or near the procedure room. Specifically, we describe how we have designed the AView structure from the end-user's point of view, performed a pilot study and gathered clinical feedback.

METHODS A survey was created evaluating (1) overall attitudes toward e-learning, (2) multi-institutional e-learning/e-conferences, (3) national/regional e-conferences, and (4) future directions with e-learning. The survey was distributed to all the orthopaedic surgery residency program directors in the United States, and they were asked to circulate the survey to their program's faculty and trainees. RESULTS A total of 268 responses were collected, including 100 attendings and 168 trainees. Overall satisfaction with e-learning compared with in-person learning was higher among trainees than attending faculty, with 51.4% of trainees favoring e-learning, as opposed to 32.2% of attendings (P = 0.006). Both groups felt they were more likely to pay attention with in-person learning (P = 0.89). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 85.7% of residents have used e-learning platforms to join a conference in their specialty of interest while off-service. Most attendings and trainees felt e-learning should play a supplemental role in standard residency/fellowship education, with a low number of respondents feeling that it should not be used (86.6% versus 84%, and 2.1% versus 0.6%, respectively, P = 0.28). CONCLUSION E-learning has been an important modality to continue academic pursuits during the disruption in usual education and training schedules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most trainees and attendings surveyed felt that e-learning should play a supplementary role in resident and fellow education moving forward. Although e-learning does provide an opportunity to hold multi-institutional conferences and makes participation in meetings logistically easier, it cannot fully replicate the dynamic interactions and benefits of in-person learning.","Essilfie, Anthony A; Hurley, Eoghan T; Strauss, Eric J; Alaia, Michael J",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-00579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732495/,147

Farmworkers face numerous chemical, physical, and biological threats to their health. The adverse effects of these hazards may be amplified among Latino migrant farmworkers, who are concurrently exposed to various psychosocial stressors. Factors such as documentation status, potential lack of authorization to work in the United States, and language and cultural barriers may also prevent Latino migrants from accessing federal aid, legal assistance, and health programs. These environmental, occupational, and social hazards may further exacerbate existing health disparities among US Latinos. This population is also likely to be disproportionately impacted by emerging threats, including climate change and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Latino migrant farmworkers are essential to agriculture in the United States, and actions are needed to protect this vulnerable population.

We used mice lacking functional receptors for both type I and type III IFN (double knockout, dKO) to evaluate the possibility that type III IFN plays a decisive role in SARS-CoV protection. We found that viral peak titres in lungs of dKO and STAT1-deficient mice were similar, but significantly higher than in wild-type mice. The kinetics of viral clearance from the lung were also comparable in dKO and STAT1-deficient mice. Surprisingly, however, infected dKO mice remained healthy, whereas infected STAT1-deficient mice developed liver pathology and eventually succumbed to neurological disease. Our data suggest that the failure of STAT1-deficient mice to control initial SARS-CoV replication efficiently in the lung is due to impaired type I and type III IFN signalling, whereas the failure to control subsequent systemic viral spread is due to unrelated defects in STAT1-deficient mice.","Mahlakõiv, Tanel; Ritz, Daniel; Mordstein, Markus; DeDiego, Marta L; Enjuanes, Luis; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Staeheli, Peter",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.046284-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22956738/,147

110054,Emerging drugs for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer: a focus on phase II immunotherapy trials.,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND Public policy has tremendous impacts on population health. While policy development has been extensively studied, policy implementation research is newer and relies largely on qualitative methods. Quantitative measures are needed to disentangle differential impacts of policy implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators) and outcomes to ensure intended benefits are realized. Implementation outcomes include acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, compliance/fidelity, feasibility, penetration, sustainability, and costs. This systematic review identified quantitative measures that are used to assess health policy implementation determinants and outcomes and evaluated the quality of these measures. METHODS Three frameworks guided the review: Implementation Outcomes Framework (Proctor et al.), Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al.), and Policy Implementation Determinants Framework (Bullock et al.). Six databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, PAIS, ERIC, and Worldwide Political. Searches were limited to English language, peer-reviewed journal articles published January 1995 to April 2019. Search terms addressed four levels: health, public policy, implementation, and measurement. Empirical studies of public policies addressing physical or behavioral health with quantitative self-report or archival measures of policy implementation with at least two items assessing implementation outcomes or determinants were included. Consensus scoring of the Psychometric and Pragmatic Evidence Rating Scale assessed the quality of measures. RESULTS Database searches yielded 8417 non-duplicate studies, with 870 (10.3%) undergoing full-text screening, yielding 66 studies. From the included studies, 70 unique measures were identified to quantitatively assess implementation outcomes and/or determinants. Acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and compliance were the most commonly measured implementation outcomes. Common determinants in the identified measures were organizational culture, implementation climate, and readiness for implementation, each aspects of the internal setting. Pragmatic quality ranged from adequate to good, with most measures freely available, brief, and at high school reading level. Few psychometric properties were reported. CONCLUSIONS Well-tested quantitative measures of implementation internal settings were under-utilized in policy studies. Further development and testing of external context measures are warranted. This review is intended to stimulate measure development and high-quality assessment of health policy implementation outcomes and determinants to help practitioners and researchers spread evidence-informed policies to improve population health.

However, comparative studies of the most widely used Solitaire and Trevo stents have been rarely published.The authors retrospectively reviewed a total of 200 patients who performed mechanical thrombectomy at our center during 4 years and divided patients into 2 groups: mechanical thrombectomy with Solitaire stent (Group 1: Solitaire) and mechanical thrombectomy with Trevo stent (Group 2: Trevo). All patients underwent a clinical assessment with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and underwent modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Radiologic results were evaluated using thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score and number of stent passes. In addition, multiple time intervals were analyzed.There was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcome between the 2 groups. Trevo group revealed the shorter procedure time, less number of stent passage, and more one pass cases than Solitaire group with statistically significance (P = .009, P = .014, P = .030). In addition, Trevo group achieved higher successful recanalization (TICI 2b or 3) rate (89.7%) with statically significant than group1 (82.3%) (P = .018). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of Trevo stent was a predictive for successful recanalization. (odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.250-1.550, P = .028).Our study suggests that the Trevo stent allows higher recanalization rate through the less number of stent passages and shorter procedure time than the Solitaire stent. More randomized control trials are needed to determine which stents are more effective.","Yi, Ho Jun; Lee, Dong Hoon; Kim, Sang Uk",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000010747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768352/,147
110706,Predictors for postoperative esophageal stricture after balloon-based radiofrequency ablation for early esophageal squamous neoplasia: a multicenter validation study.,2016,"OBJECTIVES During proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors, peak respiratory muscle pressure can be estimated from the peak airway pressure and the percentage of assistance (gain). Adjusting the gain can, therefore, target a given level of respiratory effort. This study assessed the clinical feasibility of titrating proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors with the goal of targeting a predefined range of respiratory effort. DESIGN Prospective, multicenter, clinical observational study. SETTINGS Intensive care departments at five university hospitals. PATIENTS Patients were included after meeting simple criteria for assisted mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS Patients were ventilated in proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors. The peak respiratory muscle pressure, estimated in cm H2O as (peak airway pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure)×[(100-gain)/gain], was calculated from a grid at the bedside. The gain adjustment algorithm was defined to target a peak respiratory muscle pressure between 5 and 10 cm H2O. Additional recommendations were available in case of hypoventilation or hyperventilation. RESULTS Fifty-three patients were enrolled. Median time spent under proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-5). Gain was adjusted 1.0 (0.7-1.8) times per day, according to the peak respiratory muscle pressure target range in 91% of cases and because of hypoventilation or hyperventilation in 9%. Thirty-four patients were ventilated with proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors until extubation, which was successful in 32. Eighteen patients required volume assist-controlled reventilation because of clinical worsening and need for continuous sedation. One patient was intolerant to proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors. CONCLUSIONS This first study assessing the clinical feasibility of titrating proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors in an attempt to target a predefined range of effort showed that adjusting the level of assistance to maintain a predefined boundary of respiratory muscle pressure is feasible, simple, and often sufficient to ventilate patients until extubation.","Carteaux, Guillaume; Mancebo, Jordi; Mercat, Alain; Dellamonica, Jean; Richard, Jean-Christophe M; Aguirre-Bermeo, Hernan; Kouatchet, Achille; Beduneau, Gaetan; Thille, Arnaud W; Brochard, Laurent",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31828a42e5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23787397/,147
110732,Echinacea for preventing and treating the common cold.,2015,"STUDY OBJECTIVES By March 2020, COVID-19 forced much of the world to stay at home to reduce the spread of the disease. Some health care workers transitioned to working from home while many continued to report to work in person as essential employees. We sought to explore changes in sleep, health, work, and mood in health care workers during the stay-at-home orders. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey administered to health care workers. The survey assessed changes in sleep, work, screen time, media exposure, diet, exercise, substance use, and mood. The survey data was collected between March 28, 2020, and April 29, 2020. RESULTS A total of 834 of 936 individuals completed the entire survey. Respondents were from 41 US states. Mood after the stay-at-home orders worsened and screen time and substance use increased. Total sleep time (TST) shortened in those continuing to work in-person (p<.001), whereas TST was unchanged in those working from home (p=.73). Those working from home went to bed later, woke up later, and worked fewer hours. Reduced TST and increased screen time before bed were associated with worse mood and screen time. Longer sleep time was associated with better mood. CONCLUSIONS Health care workers' mood worsened regardless of whether work was in person or remote, though TST was shorter for those working in person. Those working from home perhaps shifted sleep time to be more in line with endogenous circadian phase. Peer or other support services may be indicated to address sleep, mood, and health behaviors among health care workers during these unprecedented times.","Conroy, Deirdre A; Hadler, Nicole L; Cho, Echelle; Moreira, Aliya; MacKenzie, Chamisa; Swanson, Leslie M; Burgess, Helen J; Arnedt, J Todd; Goldstein, Cathy A",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975194/,147

Despite ongoing efforts to characterize this population and develop approaches for effective management, individuals with MCCs continue to contribute substantially to health care expenditures. Based on a review of recent literature, several identified barriers limit the effectiveness of care for patients with MCCs. Health care delivery system structural limitations, evidence-based care concerns, patient-clinician relationship constraints, and barriers to inclusion of patient-centered priorities may singly or in combination negatively affect outcomes for individuals with MCCs. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed further light on inequities contributing to suboptimal MCC patient management. Awareness of the prevalence and demographic attributes of patients with MCCs and the identified barriers to care may help improve patient engagement and treatment outcomes for this high-cost population. This paper provides recommendations for enhancing MCC patient care outcomes in the current and post-COVID-19 health care delivery settings.","Sherman, Bruce W",The American journal of managed care,https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2021.88665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156219/,147

OBJECTIVE This review sought to explore the current literature on children's exposure to, and the impact of, ABM. DATA SOURCES PsycInfo, Proquest, Science Direct, and ABI-Inform databases were searched from the earliest available date to May 2015. Additional studies were identified by a manual review of the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacting the corresponding author of each included study. STUDY SELECTION Articles that reported on child or adolescent ownership of ABM and/or the relationship between ABM ownership and drinking were included. DATA EXTRACTION Data on key measures were tabulated; where data of interest were not reported, requests for further information were sent to the articles' authors. RESULTS Nine cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal studies were identified. ABM ownership ranged from 11% to 59% and was higher among older children and males. Seven cross-sectional studies reported associations between ABM ownership and drinking-related behaviors. All 4 longitudinal studies reported a significant relationship between ownership at baseline and drinking initiation at follow-up. LIMITATIONS The small number of available studies, with different measures of ABM ownership and of associations/effects. CONCLUSIONS The few studies exploring ABM ownership are consistent in showing high rates of ownership and associations between ownership and current and future drinking. There is a need for further research into specific aspects of ABM ownership. However, there is also a need for policy interventions to reduce children's access to and ownership of ABM.","Jones, Sandra C",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2015-3970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27244812/,147
111068,Letter to Editor.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Cancer is often associated with a hypercoagulable state and new thrombosis is often the first clinical manifestation of cancer. Surgical treatment of the primary tumor is crucial since it provides the only curative approach in most cases, but management of patients is highly complex, especially in the presence of new antiplatelet drugs and/or anticoagulants. Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) represent a frequent complication of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and include different hematological symptoms in patients, whilst occlusion of arterial blood vessels displays a rare form of PNS accompanying renal tumors. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 62-year old man who was initially hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome. He subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty treatment including multiple stenting and treatment with ticagrelor and aspirin. Post-interventional, acute arterial thrombotic emboli of several limb arteries required thrombectomy. By computer tomography we identified a renal lesion suspicious for an RCC and suspected a PNS as underlying cause of the thrombotic complications. Triple anticoagulant therapy was maintained with therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), aspirin, and clopidogrel, by which we replaced ticagrelor. Surgery was postponed for 4 weeks. We paused LMWH, aspirin and clopidogrel only at the day of surgery and perioperatively restored hemostasis by transfusion of two platelet concentrates. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was uneventful. Pathology confirmed a clear cell RCC. The patient fully recovered whilst slowly reducing anticoagulation dose. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary team approach of experts in urology, cardiology and hemostasis was key in managing this patient since a personalized thrombosis consult was needed to minimize the risk of reinfarction due to in-stent thrombosis. We report a therapeutic protocol that may be helpful for the management of similar cases. Furthermore, the finding of thrombotic arterial occlusions in larger blood vessels represents a novel complication of PNS in RCC and adds to the varied possible manifestations of this clinical chameleon.","Martin, Benedikt; Greinacher, Andreas; Bülow, Robin; Hammer, Fabian; Hoene, Andreas; Burchardt, Martin; Zimmermann, Uwe",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-021-00870-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407783/,147

PATIENTS AND METHODS The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and immunization coverage for other conditions were investigated through a form in 112 persons experiencing homelessness referring to the primary care medical services of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica, Holy See. RESULTS Most subjects, with a male preponderance, were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (64.3%), 3.6% were unsure and 32.1% preferred not to be vaccinated. When answering questions on the immunization coverage for tuberculosis and hepatitis A and B, most subjects reported not to be vaccinated (48.2%, 56.2% and 55.3%, respectively) or did not know (33%, 28.6% and 27.7%).

111242,Review of SMARCA4 (BRG1)-deficient carcinomas following a malignant pleural effusion specimen confounded by reduced claudin-4 expression.,2020-08-07,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to explore the extent of IVIG treatment related fluctuations (TRF) by using home collection of daily grip strength in patients with CIDP, and to use that information to develop evidence-based treatment optimization strategies. METHODS This prospective observational study included 25 patients with well-defined CIDP. Participants recorded grip strength daily for 6 months. Disability and gait metrics were collected weekly. Serum IgG levels were obtained at peak, trough and mid-cycle IVIG intervals. Day-to-day grip strength changes <10% were considered random. To identify patients with TRFs, 3-day averaged grip strength was calculated on each consecutive day following an IVIG infusion. TRFs were defined as ≥10% 3-day averaged grip strength difference compared to the pre-IVIG baseline. RESULTS Participants successfully recorded grip strength on all but 9% of recordable days. Twelve patients (48%) were classified as low/no fluctuaters and 13 (52%) as frequent fluctuaters. In the frequent fluctuating group grip strength improved over one week, and thereafter was relatively stable until the 3rd week post infusion. Grip strength was significantly correlated with measures of disability. CONCLUSIONS Grip strength collection by patients at home is reliable, valid, and feasible. A change in grip strength by ≥ 10% is a useful, practical, and evidence-based approach that may be used to identify clinically meaningful TRFs. Based upon this data, we propose a treatment optimization strategy for patients with CIDP on chronic IVIG that may be applied to routine clinic care during both face-to-face and virtual video or telephone patient encounters.","Allen, Jeffrey A; Pasnoor, Mamatha; Dimachkie, Mazen M; Ajroud-Driss, Senda; Brannagan, Thomas H; Cook, Albert; Walton, Timothy; Fiecas, Mark B; Kissel, John; Merkies, Ingemar; Gorson, Kenneth C; Lewis, Richard A",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000011703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593867/,147

Through May 2014, a total of 1500 HALD procedures have been performed. We have evaluated the outcomes of HALD. The HALD procedure consists of a hand-port incision as well as two 12-mm ports. Mean donor age was 40.8 ± 10.8 yr, BMI was 27.9 ± 5.0, there were 541 males, 1271 Caucasians, and the left kidney was removed in 1236 patients. All procedures were successfully completed. Four donors (0.27%) were converted to an open technique due to bleeding. Four donors required blood transfusions. 53 donors (3.5%) were readmitted in the first month post-donation; almost half were due to gastrointestinal complaints. Six donors required reoperation; three for SBO and three for wound dehiscence. 27 patients (1.8%) developed incisional hernias. Seven donors (0.47%) developed bowel obstruction. All donors recovered well with a mean hospital stay after donation of 2.1 ± 0.3 d. All except one kidney were successfully implanted. Twenty-one recipients (1.4%) experienced DGF.

SETTING Laboratory DESIGN:: In this laboratory-based simulation, phacoemulsification cataract surgery was performed on porcine eyes. At a fixed distance, a DustTrak DRX Aerosol Monitor Model 8534 (DustTrak) was positioned to quantify particle generation during surgery. Experiments were run in triplicate for two wound sizes, 2.4 and 2.75mm. Positive controls were established by measuring particle generation from an aerosolizing spray-bottle. Negative controls were established while the phacoemulsification machine was not running. METHODS The DustTrak was used to measure particulate matter (PM) mass fractions for each of three particle sizes, PM1, PM2.5, and PM4 (in microns), every 2 seconds during surgery and for one minute after. The main outcome measure was an increase in the mass fraction of aerosolized particles of various sizes. RESULTS There was no significant aerosolization of particles during cataract surgery for both the 2.4 and 2.75mm wound sizes. CONCLUSIONS Phacoemulsification cataract surgery was not found to be an AGMP. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, ophthalmologists can continue to use droplet precautions while performing this surgery.","Noureddin, Gelareh S; Iovieno, Alfonso; Eslami, Maryam; Weaver, Travers; Meadows, Howard; Yeung, Sonia N",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229968/,147
111342,Conservative management vs intervention for unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,2014,"A global COVID-19 pandemic, rising asthma and allergies - along with climate change impacting storm intensity and frequency - point to an urgent need to unify U.S. atmospheric biology research. To this end, we briefly define atmospheric biology, summarize its fragmented history and then outline how to unify the field to provide benefits for the U.S. science community and its citizens. Atmospheric biology refers to the study of concentrations, sources, sinks, transformation and impacts of airborne microorganisms inclusive of pollen, fungal spores, algae, lichens, bacteria, viruses, cellulose fibers, and other biomolecules or fragments of cells. Here our focus is biological particles, both respirable (PM10 ) and systemic (PM2.5 ). Due to its interdisciplinary dependencies and broadness of scales from nanometers to kilometers, atmospheric biology research is highly fragmented in the U.S. science community.

111614,St. Jude Cloud-a Pediatric Cancer Genomic Data Sharing Ecosystem.,2021-01-06,"OBJECTIVE Brain Age Index (BAI), calculated from sleep electroencephalography (EEG), has been proposed as a biomarker of brain health. This study quantifies night-to-night variability of BAI and establishes probability thresholds for inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI. METHODS 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as within normal limits. While EEGs with epileptiform activity were excluded, the majority of patients included in the study had a diagnosis of chronic epilepsy. BAI was calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient data using a previously established algorithm, and the night-to-night variability in BAI was measured. RESULTS The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 7.5 years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of BAI by a factor of n, rendering BAI a more suitable biomarker of brain health at the individual level. A brain age risk lookup table of results provides thresholds above which a patient has a high probability of excess BAI. SIGNIFICANCE With increasing ease of EEG acquisition, including wearable technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations from normal physiologic function. The measure of night-to-night variability and how this is reduced by averaging across multiple nights provides a basis for using BAI in patients' homes to identify patients who should undergo further investigation or monitoring.","Hogan, Jacob; Sun, Haoqi; Paixao, Luis; Westmeijer, Mike; Sikka, Pooja; Jin, Jing; Tesh, Ryan; Cardoso, Madalena; Cash, Sydney S; Akeju, Oluwaseun; Thomas, Robert; Westover, M Brandon",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.09.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248430/,147
111714,RIN13-mediated disease resistance depends on SNC1-EDS1/PAD4 signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND In utero diaphragm development is critically important for postnatal respiratory function and any disturbance to fetal development may lead to diaphragm dysfunction and respiratory complications in the postnatal period. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been shown to affect respiratory function in a sex-dependent manner; however, the effect of IUGR on diaphragm function is unknown. AIM This study used a maternal hypoxia-induced mouse model of IUGR to investigate the impact of IUGR on diaphragm function and structure in male and female adult offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pregnant BALB/c mice were housed under hypoxic conditions (10.5% O2 ) from gestational days 11 to 17.5 and then returned to normoxic conditions. Control mice were housed under normoxic conditions throughout pregnancy. At 8 weeks of age, offspring were euthanized and diaphragms isolated for functional assessment in organ bath experiments and for histological analysis. RESULTS IUGR offspring were lighter at birth and remained lighter at 8 weeks of age compared to Controls. While diaphragm force (maximal or twitch) was not affected by treatment or sex, the IUGR group exhibited a longer half-relaxation time after twitch contractions compared to Control. Female offspring had a lower maximum rate of force development and higher fatigue resistance compared to males, independent of IUGR. There was no difference in the diaphragm myofibre cross-sectional area between groups or sexes. CONCLUSION Sex and IUGR independently affect diaphragm contraction in adult mice without changes in structure. This study demonstrates that IUGR affects diaphragm contractile function in later life and could impair respiratory function if exacerbated under conditions of increased respiratory load.","Francis, Maddison R; Pinniger, Gavin J; Noble, Peter B; Wang, Kimberley C W",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535471/,147

Seven cases of BD thought to be triggered by TB have been reported to date. In all cases, Behçet's symptoms improved smoothly after starting TB treatment. We present the first report of uveitis developing two months after starting TB treatment in a 46-year-old woman with tuberculous lymphadenitis presenting with oral and genital ulcers and erythema nodosum-like lesions on diagnosis of TB. The appearance of uveitis was attributed to a paradoxical reaction in TB because of simultaneous relapse of lymphadenopathy and retinal findings on fluorescein angiography. Although rare, physicians should be aware that ocular involvement can occur during anti-TB therapy, most likely with extrapulmonary TB, because ocular involvement may decrease patient quality of life if visual symptoms become irreversible with delayed diagnosis and treatment.","Takahashi, Saeko; Otomo, Kotaro; Kawakami, Yoko; Nakamura, Morio",Respirology case reports,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcr2.617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32670586/,147

We investigated the occurrence of undetectable or subtherapeutic serum levels of oral antipsychotics preceding switch to clozapine as an endpoint of TRS. For patients starting clozapine, 12-month retrospective reviews of antipsychotic serum concentration measurements were performed in a Norwegian therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database from 2005 to 2017. Undetectable levels in high-sensitive analytical assays defined 'no drug use', while levels <50% of the lower reference range defined 'subtherapeutic use'. Similar data were collected for patients switching to long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics, as a reference of 'no or subtherapeutic drug use'. Nineteen of 353 patients initiating clozapine (5.4%) had a recent history of undetectable antipsychotic drug levels compared to 91 of 1048 (8.7%) initiating LAI. Another 19 patients starting clozapine (5.4%) had recent events of subtherapeutic levels. In conclusion, the present retrospective study may indicate that every 10th patient starting clozapine has a recent history of undetectable or subtherapeutic serum levels of oral antipsychotics.

Here, we review the safety and efficiency of our initial experience with uniportal VATS and evaluate our learning curve. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of uniportal VATS using a prospectively maintained departmental database and analyzed patients who had undergone a lung anatomic resection separately from patients who underwent other resections. To assess the learning curve, we compared the first 10 months of the study period with the second 10 months. RESULTS From January 2014 to August 2015, 250 patients underwent intended uniportal VATS, including 180 lung anatomic resections (72%) and 70 other resections (28%). Lung anatomic resection was successfully completed using uniportal VATS in 153 patients (85%), which comprised all the anatomic segmentectomies (29 patients), 80% (4 of 5) of the pneumonectomies and 82% (120 of 146) of the lobectomies attempted. The majority of lung anatomic resections that required conversion to thoracotomy occurred in the first half of our study period. Seventy patients underwent other uniportal VATS resections. Wedge resections were the most common of these procedures (25 patients, 35.7%). Although 24 of the 70 patients (34%) required the placement of additional ports, none required conversion to thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS was safe and feasible for both standard and complex pulmonary resections. However, when used for pulmonary anatomic resections, uniportal VATS entails a steep learning curve.","Drevet, Gabrielle; Ugalde Figueroa, Paula",Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/acs.2016.03.05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27134835/,147

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review investigating the effect of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on SCD and SCA. The review's objective was to determine the risk of SCD and SCA in PLWH. To do this, the electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published before January 31, 2021. Reference lists of the included studies were searched for further identification of relevant studies. The search terms included: ""Sudden Cardiac Death,"" ""Sudden Cardiac Arrest,"" ""Human Immunodeficiency virus,"" ""HIV,"" ""Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,"" and ""AIDS."" Only observational studies that assessed the association between SCD and SCA in PWLH were selected. Data were extracted by two independent authors who screened titles, abstracts, and articles to meet the inclusion criterion. Quality assessment was done by using modified Downs and Black checklist. A total of seven studies were included in this review. Five studies revealed a higher incidence of SCD in PLWH, two of which focused on patients with HIV and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The other two studies were about the association of HIV and SCA. Studies reported that PLWH had a three- to five-fold higher incidence of SCD as compared to non-HIV patients. HIV patients with low LVEF had a higher incidence of SCD than HIV patients with normal LVEF. PLWH had a higher incidence of SCA and less successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to patients without HIV. After adjusting for various confounders in multiple studies, all the studies reported a higher incidence of SCD in PLWH. To conclude, PLWH is at an increased risk of SCD and SCA. Some risk factors for this include LVEF, viral load (VL), and the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count. There is a paucity of data on the mechanisms involved, although a higher prevalence of cardiac fibrosis and interstitial fibrosis in PLWH may play a role. Because of the general suboptimal quality of the heterogeneous nature of the current evidence, further, rigorous studies are needed to determine the association of increased risk of SCD and SCA in PLWH.","Abdelazeem, Basel; Gergis, Kirolos; Baral, Nischit; Rauniyar, Rohit; Adhikari, Govinda",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842140/,147

113127,Highlights.,2017,"The concept of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) derives from more than two decades of research indicating that (1) most older individuals with cognitive impairment have post mortem evidence of multiple contributing pathologies and (2) along with the preeminent role of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, cerebrovascular disease accounts for a substantial proportion of this contribution. Contributing cerebrovascular processes include both overt strokes caused by etiologies such as large vessel occlusion, cardioembolism, and embolic infarcts of unknown source, and frequently asymptomatic brain injuries caused by diseases of the small cerebral vessels. Cerebral small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, when present at moderate or greater pathologic severity, are independently associated with worse cognitive performance and greater likelihood of dementia, particularly in combination with AD and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Based on this evidence, the US National Alzheimer's Project Act explicitly authorized accelerated research in vascular and mixed dementia along with frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia and AD itself. Biomarker development has been consistently identified as a key step toward translating scientific advances in VCID into effective prevention and treatment strategies. Validated biomarkers can serve a range of purposes in trials of candidate interventions, including (1) identifying individuals at increased VCID risk, (2) diagnosing the presence of cerebral small vessel disease or specific small vessel pathologies, (3) stratifying study participants according to their prognosis for VCID progression or treatment response, (4) demonstrating an intervention's target engagement or pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, and (5) monitoring disease progression during treatment. Effective biomarkers allow academic and industry investigators to advance promising interventions at early stages of development and discard interventions with low success likelihood. The MarkVCID consortium was formed in 2016 with the goal of developing and validating fluid- and imaging-based biomarkers for the cerebral small vessel diseases associated with VCID. MarkVCID consists of seven project sites and a central coordinating center, working with the National Institute of Neurologic Diseases and Stroke and National Institute on Aging under cooperative agreements. Through an internal selection process, MarkVCID has identified a panel of 11 candidate biomarker ""kits"" (consisting of the biomarker measure and the clinical and cognitive data used to validate it) and established a range of harmonized procedures and protocols for participant enrollment, clinical and cognitive evaluation, collection and handling of fluid samples, acquisition of neuroimaging studies, and biomarker validation. The overarching goal of these protocols is to generate rigorous validating data that could be used by investigators throughout the research community in selecting and applying biomarkers to multi-site VCID trials. Key features of MarkVCID participant enrollment, clinical/cognitive testing, and fluid biomarker procedures are summarized here, with full details in the following text, tables, and supplemental material, and a description of the MarkVCID imaging biomarker procedures in a companion paper, ""MarkVCID Cerebral small vessel consortium: II. Neuroimaging protocols."" The procedures described here address a range of challenges in MarkVCID's design, notably: (1) acquiring all data under informed consent and enrollment procedures that allow unlimited sharing and open-ended analyses without compromising participant privacy rights; (2) acquiring the data in a sufficiently wide range of study participants to allow assessment of candidate biomarkers across the various patient groups who might ultimately be targeted in VCID clinical trials; (3) defining a common dataset of clinical and cognitive elements that contains all the key outcome markers and covariates for VCID studies and is realistically obtainable during a practical study visit; (4) instituting best fluid-handling practices for minimizing avoidable sources of variability; and (5) establishing rigorous procedures for testing the reliability of candidate fluid-based biomarkers across replicates, assay runs, sites, and time intervals (collectively defined as the biomarker's instrumental validity). Participant Enrollment Project sites enroll diverse study cohorts using site-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria so as to provide generalizable validation data across a range of cognitive statuses, risk factor profiles, small vessel disease severities, and racial/ethnic characteristics representative of the diverse patient groups that might be enrolled in a future VCID trial. MarkVCID project sites include both prospectively enrolling centers and centers providing extant data and samples from preexisting community- and population-based studies. With approval of local institutional review boards, all sites incorporate MarkVCID consensus language into their study documents and informed consent agreements. The consensus language asks prospectively enrolled participants to consent to unrestricted access to their data and samples for research analysis within and outside MarkVCID. The data are transferred and stored as a de-identified dataset as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. Similar human subject protection and informed consent language serve as the basis for MarkVCID Research Agreements that act as contracts and data/biospecimen sharing agreements across the consortium. Clinical and Cognitive Data Clinical and cognitive data are collected across prospectively enrolling project sites using common MarkVCID instruments. The clinical data elements are modified from study protocols already in use such as the Alzheimer's Disease Center program Uniform Data Set Version 3 (UDS3), with additional focus on VCID-related items such as prior stroke and cardiovascular disease, vascular risk factors, focal neurologic findings, and blood testing for vascular risk markers and kidney function including hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol subtypes, triglycerides, and creatinine. Cognitive assessments and rating instruments include the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, and most of the UDS3 neuropsychological battery. The cognitive testing requires ≈60 to 90 minutes. Study staff at the prospectively recruiting sites undergo formalized training in all measures and review of their first three UDS3 administrations by the coordinating center. Collection and Handling of Fluid Samples Fluid sample types collected for MarkVCID biomarker kits are serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-plasma, platelet-poor plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with additional collection of packed cells to allow future DNA extraction and analyses. MarkVCID fluid guidelines to minimize variability include fasting morning fluid collections, rapid processing, standardized handling and storage, and avoidance of CSF contact with polystyrene. Instrumental Validation for Fluid-Based Biomarkers Instrumental validation of MarkVCID fluid-based biomarkers is operationally defined as determination of intra-plate and inter-plate repeatability, inter-site reproducibility, and test-retest repeatability. MarkVCID study participants both with and without advanced small vessel disease are selected for these determinations to assess instrumental validity across the full biomarker assay range. Intra- and inter-plate repeatability is determined by repeat assays of single split fluid samples performed at individual sites. Inter-site reproducibility is determined by assays of split samples distributed to multiple sites. Test-retest repeatability is determined by assay of three samples acquired from the same individual, collected at least 5 days apart over a 30-day period and assayed on a single plate. The MarkVCID protocols are designed to allow direct translation of the biomarker validation results to multicenter trials. They also provide a template for outside groups to perform analyses using identical methods and therefore allow direct comparison of results across studies and centers. All MarkVCID protocols are available to the biomedical community and intended to be shared. In addition to the instrumental validation procedures described here, each of the MarkVCID kits will undergo biological validation to determine whether the candidate biomarker measures important aspects of VCID such as cognitive function. Analytic methods and results of these validation studies for the 11 MarkVCID biomarker kits will be published separately. The results of this rigorous validation process will ultimately determine each kit's potential usefulness for multicenter interventional trials aimed at preventing or treating small vessel disease related VCID.","Wilcock, Donna; Jicha, Gregory; Blacker, Deborah; Albert, Marilyn S; D'Orazio, Lina M; Elahi, Fanny M; Fornage, Myriam; Hinman, Jason D; Knoefel, Janice; Kramer, Joel; Kryscio, Richard J; Lamar, Melissa; Moghekar, Abhay; Prestopnik, Jillian; Ringman, John M; Rosenberg, Gary; Sagare, Abhay; Satizabal, Claudia L; Schneider, Julie; Seshadri, Sudha; Sur, Sandeepa; Tracy, Russell P; Yasar, Sevil; Williams, Victoria; Singh, Herpreet; Mazina, Lidiya; Helmer, Karl G; Corriveau, Roderick A; Schwab, Kristin; Kivisäkk, Pia; Greenberg, Steven M",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480172/,147

However, its role in the regulation of lateral root formation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the apple SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 promotes lateral root formation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the auxin response factor MdARF8 was screened out as a protein-protein interaction partner of the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme MdSCE1, indicating that MdARF8 may be a substrate for MdSIZ1. The interaction between MdARF8 and MdSCE1 was confirmed by pull-down, Y2H, and Co-IP assays. MdSIZ1 enhanced the conjugating enzyme activity of MdSCE1 to form a MdSCE1-MdSIZ1-MdARF8 complex, thereby facilitating SUMO modification. We identified two arginine substitution mutations at K342 and K380 in MdARF8 that blocked MdSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, indicating that K342 and K380 are the principal SUMOylation sites of the MdARF8 protein. Moreover, MdARF8 promoted lateral root formation in transgenic apple plants, and the phenotype of reduced lateral roots in the Arabidopsis siz1-2 mutant was restored in siz1-2/MdARF8 complementary plants. Our findings reveal an important role for sumoylation in the regulation of lateral root formation in plants.","Zhang, Chun-Ling; Wang, Gui-Luan; Zhang, Ya-Li; Hu, Xing; Zhou, Li-Jie; You, Chun-Xiang; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Hao, Yu-Jin",The New phytologist,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006771/,147
113337,Istanbul symposium on neonatal and pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.,2012,"BACKGROUND Self-medication by older adults has been always a public health concern. The present study aimed to modify the psychological constructs of Health Belief Model (HBM) in relation to self-medication behaviors using Freire's Adult Education Model (FAEM) among older adults in Khorramabad, Iran, from 2017 to 2018. METHODS The mean age of the older adults was 66.28 ± 7.18 years. This was a randomized controlled trial study conducted on 132 individuals older than 60 who were referred from different health care centers. The participants were selected using multistage sampling method and randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control. The data collection instruments included a questionnaire which was designed based on both HBM and self-medication behaviors questionnaire. The phase of adult education model (AEM) was used to modify the psychological constructs of HBM and self-medication behaviors. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20 with a significant level of 0.05. Descriptive statistical tests, chi-squared test, paired t-test, independent t-test, and univariate modeling were employed for the purpose of analyzing data. RESULTS There was no significant difference between groups in terms of self-medication. Unawareness of the effects of medicine were the most important reason for self-medication (p = 0.50). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of knowledge, HBM constructs, and self-medication behaviors (p > 0.05). However, they came up to be considerably different for the above variables after the intervention was implemented (p < 0.05). When the findings were adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, there were significant differences between the two groups in almost all constructs of HBM and their behaviors (p < 0.05). However, the perceived barrier modality of HBM did not reach to a significant level of difference between two groups. CONCLUSION The educational intervention, which was based on Freire's AEM, had positive effects on the constructs of HBM and consequently on self-medication behaviors. The psychological constructs of HBM were affected at the phases of listening to problems. Self-medication was tempered at the action-reflection phase with shared creation and evaluation of the action plan geared toward the achievement of the behavioral objectives. The results might be of importance to healthcare professionals involved in care of older patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION Current Controlled Trials IRCT2013091814512N2.

113628,Measurement uncertainty in forensic toxicology.,2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVES The recent lockdown, resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, has had a strong social and psychological impact on the most fragile individuals and family structures. In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that, in the interviewed families, the simultaneous presence of adults and children at home has generally intensified. Families refer, on the whole, a positive and resilient behavior in the lockdown period, even if initial emotional problems are reported in one out of three children-adolescents. The ability to maintain a family organized structure seems to be partially compromised.

113654,"Therapeutic effects of stem cells in different body systems, a novel method that is yet to gain trust: A comprehensive review.",2021-07-13,"Using high-throughput BioPlex assays, we determined that six fractions from the venom of Conus nux inhibit the adhesion of various recombinant PfEMP-1 protein domains (PF08_0106 CIDR1α3.1, PF11_0521 DBL2β3, and PFL0030c DBL3X and DBL5e) to their corresponding receptors (CD36, ICAM-1, and CSA, respectively). The protein domain-receptor interactions permit P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to evade elimination in the spleen by adhering to the microvasculature in various organs including the placenta. The sequences for the main components of the fractions, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, yielded four T-superfamily conotoxins, one (CC-Loop-CC) with I-IV, II-III connectivity and three (CC-Loop-CXaaC) with a I-III, II-IV connectivity. The 3D structure for one of the latter, NuxVA = GCCPAPLTCHCVIY, revealed a novel scaffold defined by double turns forming a hairpin-like structure stabilized by the two disulfide bonds. Two other main fraction components were a miniM conotoxin, and a O2-superfamily conotoxin with cysteine framework VI/VII. This study is the first one of its kind suggesting the use of conotoxins for developing pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Among the 850+ species of cone snail species there are hundreds of thousands of diverse venom exopeptides that have been selected throughout several million years of evolution to capture prey and deter predators. They do so by targeting several surface proteins present in target excitable cells. This immense biomolecular library of conopeptides can be explored for potential use as therapeutic leads against persistent and emerging diseases affecting non-excitable systems. We aim to expand the pharmacological reach of conotoxins/conopeptides by revealing their in vitro capacity to disrupt protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions that directly contribute to pathology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This is significant for severe forms of malaria, which might be deadly even after treated with current parasite-killing drugs because of persistent cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes even when parasites within red blood cells are dead. Anti-adhesion adjunct drugs would de-sequester or prevent additional sequestration of infected erythrocytes and may significantly improve survival of malaria patients. These results provide a lead for further investigations into conotoxins and other venom peptides as potential candidates for anti-adhesion or blockade-therapies. This study is the first of its kind and it suggests that conotoxins can be developed as pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as potential inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment.","Padilla, Alberto; Dovell, Sanaz; Chesnokov, Olga; Hoggard, Mickelene; Oleinikov, Andrew V; Marí, Frank",Journal of proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.104083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373718/,147
113772,Advanced Echocardiography Techniques: The Future Stethoscope of Systemic Diseases.,2021-03-30,"OBJECTIVE To review the immunological aspects of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pregnancy, based on the scientific evidence currently available. METHODS An integrative review was performed by two independent researchers, based on the literature available in the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and LILACS databases, using the descriptors ""pregnancy"" and ""COVID-19"". This search included articles published up until 14th April 2020 published in English, Spanish or Portuguese. After reading the articles available in their entirety, those related specifically to the immunological aspects of the disease in pregnancy were selected. We initially found a total of 62 articles; 52 were accessed in full-text, and 5 were finally selected. RESULTS Pregnant women are more affected by respiratory diseases possibly because of physiological, immune, and anatomical changes. Some studies highlight the important shift to a T-helper lymphocyte type 2 (Th2) immune response in pregnancy, as a potential contributor to the severity in cases of COVID-19. Additionally, the cytokine storm present in severe cases leads to an increased inflammatory state, which may deteriorate the clinical prognosis in this population. Therefore, pregnant women may represent a vulnerable group to COVID-19 infection, primarily due to the immune imbalance in the maternal-fetal interface. CONCLUSION Maternal immune response probably plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this infection, although some details remain unsolved. Although further studies are needed to deeply investigate the immunological aspects of the disease in pregnancy, our findings may provide insights into the possible immune mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Silva, Camila Radelley Azevedo Costa da; Oliveira, Lisiane Vital de; Lopes, Lorenna Peixoto; Santos, Wancler Albert Gomes Dos; Agra, Isabela Karine Rodrigues",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.5.696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32638966/,147

114070,Serum and Synovial Fluid Interleukin-6 for the Diagnosis of Periprosthetic Joint Infection.,2017,"BACKGROUND In a high proportion of patients, operatively lysed adhesions reform. Using a rabbit adhesiogenesis model, this study assessed the efficacy of adhesiolysis and examined how this relates to the tissue composition of adhesions at the time of lysis. METHODS Polypropylene meshes (5 x 3.5 cm) were implanted on the parietal peritoneum of New Zealand white rabbits. Some animals were killed 3, 7, 14, and 90 days postimplantation to obtain adhesion tissue. Adhesion formation/reformation was monitored by sequential laparoscopy in other animals kept for 90 days and in a separate experimental group subjected to adhesiolysis at 3 days postimplantation. Immune and inflammatory response markers were determined by immunohistochemical, Western blotting, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction procedures in adhesion tissue; areas occupied by adhesions were quantified in meshes. RESULTS In animals undergoing adhesiolysis, mesh areas covered by adhesions were significantly decreased at each follow-up time and affected areas became mesothelialized. Increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 expression was detected in adhesions at 3 days. Greatest TGF-beta1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expressions were observed at 7 days, whereas genetic overexpression was noted at 14 days. Active inflammatory cells peaked at the 7-day time point. CONCLUSION Adhesions formed at 3 days; at this critical time, an adhesiolysis was effective in preventing reformation of future adhesions. TGF-beta1 gene and protein expression were increased in 3-day adhesions with respect to the omentum. Levels of active TGF-beta1 and VEGF were increased at 7 days, along with the inflammatory response at this time point related to tissue remodeling, which led to stabilization of adhesions.","Gómez-Gil, Verónica; García-Honduvilla, Natalio; Pascual, Gemma; Rodríguez, Marta; Buján, Julia; Bellón, Juan M",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2009.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004923/,147
114136,Education and imaging. Gastrointestinal: foramen of Morgagni hernia in an adult.,2012,"The surgical toolbox is expanding, and newer products are being developed to improve results. Reducing blood loss so that bloodless surgery can be performed may help minimize morbidity and length of stay. As patients, hospital administrators, and government regulators desire less invasive procedures, the surgical technical challenge is increasing. More operations are being performed through minimally invasive incisions with laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic approaches. In this setting, tools that can reduce bleeding by causing blood to clot, sealing vessels, or gluing tissues are gaining an increasing importance. Thus, hemostats, sealants, and adhesives are becoming a more important element of surgical practice. This review is designed to facilitate the reader's basic knowledge of these tools so that informed choices are made for controlling bleeding in specific clinical situations. Such information is useful for all members of the operative team. The team includes surgeons, anesthesiologists, residents, and nurses as well as hematologists and other medical specialists who may be involved in the perioperative care of surgical patients. An understanding of these therapeutic options may also be helpful to the transfusion service. In some cases, these materials may be stored in the blood bank, and their appropriate use may reduce demand for other transfusion components. The product classification used in this review includes hemostats as represented by product categories that include mechanical agents, active agents, flowables, and fibrin sealants; sealants as represented by fibrin sealants and polyethylene glycol hydrogels; and adhesives as represented by cyanoacrylates and albumin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. Only those agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presently available (February 2008) for sale in the United States are discussed in this review.","Spotnitz, William D; Burks, Sandra",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01703.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18422855/,147
114258,Endoscopic treatment of obesity.,2011,"Purpose Currently available markers for early detection of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end stage renal disease, have some limitations. There is insufficient evidence from previous studies about the role of several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the early development of DN. This study aimed to describe the expression of miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-25, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 in a sample of type 1 diabetic children and adolescents to explore their association with DN and some indices of kidney injury. Patients and Methods Seventy type 1 diabetic patients, with 5 years' duration of diabetes or more, were recruited from Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the above mentioned miRNAs in serum and to assess its association with DN, and the studied risk factors. Results There was a significantly higher percentage of up-regulation of miRNA-377 and miRNA-93 (P=0.03, 0.02, respectively) in addition to significant down-regulation of miRNA-25 (P=0.01) in patients with DN than in patients without DN. In patients with DN, expression of miR-216a was significantly negatively correlated with creatinine (r=-0.4, P=0.04) and positively correlated with eGFR using creatinine (r=0.5, P=0.03). In the same group, expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with urinary cystatin C (r=0.6, P=0.01) and was negatively correlated with e-GFR using cystatin c (r=-0.6, P=0.01). miRNA-93 was associated with increased risk (odds ratio=15, 95% CI=12.03-24.63, P=0.01), while miRNA-25 was associated with decreased risk for albuminuria (odds ratio=0.15, 95% CI=0.08-0.55, P=0.03). Conclusion miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DN, while miRNA-25 may have a reno-protective role. More studies are needed to document the value of these miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets in DN.","Abdelghaffar, Shereen; Shora, Hassan; Abdelatty, Sahar; Elmougy, Fatma; El Sayed, Reham; Abdelrahman, Heba; Soliman, Hend; Algebaly, HebatAllah; Ahmed, Sakinatalfouad; Alfy, Peter; Elshiwy, Yasmine","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s247062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765027/,147
114559,LncRNA PDCD4-AS1 alleviates triple negative breast cancer by increasing expression of IQGAP2 via miR-10b-5p.,2020-11-25,"The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal sequencing of symptom emergence for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and purging disorder (PD), as well as to test whether prodromal symptoms increase risk for future onset of each type of eating disorder and compare the predictive effects to those of established risk factors. Data from four prevention trials that targeted high-risk young women with body image concerns (N = 1,952; Mage = 19.7, SD = 5.7) and collected annual diagnostic interview data over 3-year follow-up were combined to address these aims. Regarding behavioral symptoms, compensatory weight control behaviors typically emerged first for AN, BN, and PD, whereas binge eating typically emerged first for BED. Regarding cognitive symptoms, for AN, weight/shape overvaluation typically emerged first, whereas for BN, BED, and PD, overvaluation typically emerged simultaneously with feeling fat and fear of weight gain. Binge eating, compensatory behaviors, weight/shape overvaluation, fear of weight gain, and feeling fat predicted BN, BED, and PD onset, whereas weight/shape overvaluation, fear of weight gain, and lower than expected body mass index predicted AN onset. Predictive effects of prodromal symptoms were similar in magnitude to those of established risk factors: Collectively, prodromal symptoms and risk factors predicted onset of specific eating disorders with 67-83% accuracy. Results suggest that compensatory weight control behaviors and cognitive symptoms are likely to emerge before binge eating in the various eating disorders and that offering indicated prevention programs to youth with prodromal symptoms may be an effective way to prevent eating disorders.

Intervening in adolescence is critical given juxtaposition of increased judgement/fear of judgement and the onset of serious mental illness. This paper details the efforts of an intervention designed to specifically target the perception of dangerousness, social distancing, and use of stigmatizing language. A total of 124 high school freshman participated in the interactive presentation delivered over the course of a typical 40 min class period. An identical survey with a 5-point Likert scale was administered before and after to measure level of agreement with stigmatizing statements. Most participants reported prior exposure through the media (86.6%) and through conversations with family/friends (67.7%). Post intervention, improvement was seen in the perception of dangerousness (MD = 0.45, t = 4.435, p = <0.001), the need for social distancing (measure 1: MD = 0.148, t = 1.785, p = 0.039; measure 2: MD = 0.142, t = 1.773, p = 0.04), and understanding of the experience of those with serious mental illness (MD = 0.377, t = 3.378, p = <0.001). No significant difference was seen in terms of stigmatizing language use (MD = 0.114, t = 1.192, p = 0.118). This study supports the delivery of anti-stigma education to adolescents that avoids the biogenetic and contact approaches, embraces the continuum model of mental health, normalizes psychotic experiences, addresses dangerousness with data, identifies prominent figures with mental illness, and uses personalized statistics to demonstrate why this topic is of importance.","Dillinger, Rachel L",The Psychiatric quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09787-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32506215/,147
114696,Mitral annulus dynamics early after valve repair: preliminary observations of the effect of resectional versus non-resectional approaches.,2011,"Cellular activities are finely regulated by numerous signaling pathways to support specific functions of complex life processes. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. Each step of viral replication is ultimately governed by the interaction of a virus with its host cells. Because of the demands of viral replication, the nutritional needs of virus-infected cells differ from those of uninfected cells. To improve their chances of survival and replication, viruses have evolved to commandeer cellular processes, including cell metabolism, augmenting these processes to support their needs. This article summarizes recent findings regarding virus-induced alterations to major cellular metabolic pathways focusing on how viruses modulate various signaling cascades to induce these changes. We begin with a general introduction describing the role played by signaling pathways in cellular metabolism. We then discuss how different viruses target these signaling pathways to reprogram host metabolism to favor the viral needs. We highlight the gaps in understanding metabolism-related virus-host interactions and discuss how studying these changes will enhance our understanding of fundamental processes involved in metabolic regulation. Finally, we discuss the potential to harness these processes to combat viral diseases, as well as other diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancers.","Pant, Anil; Dsouza, Lara; Yang, Zhilong",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00635-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517756/,147

Afterward, these formulations were evaluated (in vitro and in vivo) for their potential against CRC.Methods: The SLNs were synthesized by employing the solvent diffusion technique, and then they were entrapped in the MBs. The prepared uncoupled and coupled SLNs (SLN-OP and FA-SLN-OP, respectively) were examined for in vitro cytotoxicity effect against COLO-205. Gamma-scintigraphy study was used for determining biodistribution (in vivo) of drug in different organs through MBs.Results: Outcomes for FA-SLN-OP revealed more cytotoxicity (IC50 = 6.8 µg/ml) against COLO-205 cells (in vitro) than OP solution (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 8.0 µg/ml) and SLN-OP (IC50 = 7.5 µg/ml).

115053,Dickkopf-1 Overexpression in vitro Nominates Candidate Blood Biomarkers Relating to Alzheimer's Disease Pathology.,2020-08-20,"BACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death and disability in Europe, accounting for 4 million deaths per year and costing the European Union economy almost €196 billion annually. There is strong evidence to suggest that exercise-based secondary rehabilitation programs can decrease the mortality risk and improve health among patients with CVD. Theory-informed use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) is important in the design of cardiac rehabilitation programs aimed at changing cardiovascular risk factors. Electronic health (eHealth) is the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for health. This emerging area of health care has the ability to enhance self-management of chronic disease by making health care more accessible, affordable, and available to the public. However, evidence-based information on the use of BCTs in eHealth interventions is limited, and particularly so, for individuals living with CVD. OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review was to assess the application of BCTs in eHealth interventions designed to increase physical activity (PA) in CVD populations. METHODS A total of 7 electronic databases, including EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus with Full Text, and CINAHL Complete), Scopus, and Web of Science (Core Collection) were searched. Two authors independently reviewed references using the software package Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation). The reviewers met to resolve any discrepancies, with a third independent reviewer acting as an arbitrator when required. Following this, data were extracted from the papers that met the inclusion criteria. Bias assessment of the studies was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias within Covidence; this was followed by a narrative synthesis. RESULTS Out of the 987 studies that were identified, 14 were included in the review. An additional 9 studies were added following a hand search of review paper references. The average number of BCTs used across the 23 studies was 7.2 (range 1-19). The top three most frequently used BCTs included information about health consequences (78%, 18/23), goal setting (behavior; 74%, 17/23), and joint third, self-monitoring of behavior and social support (practical) were included in 11 studies (48%, 11/23) each. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review is the first to investigate the use of BCTs in PA eHealth interventions specifically designed for people with CVD. This research will have clear implications for health care policy and research by outlining the BCTs used in eHealth interventions for chronic illnesses, in particular CVD, thereby providing clear foundations for further research and developments in the area.","Duff, Orlaith Mairead; Walsh, Deirdre Mj; Furlong, Bróna A; O'Connor, Noel E; Moran, Kieran A; Woods, Catherine B",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.7782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768610/,147

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted for patients with rectal neoplasia, who underwent TAMIS using single incision laparoscopic surgery-Port from January 2013 till January 2016 by a group of colorectal surgeons from Gastrointestinal Center Unit III, Peking University Cancer Hospital. Patients' demographic data, surgical related information, post-operational pathology, as well as peri-operative follow-up were all collected. RESULTS Twenty-five patients with rectal neoplasia were identified consequently. Complete full-thickness excision was achieved in all cases without conversion. 22 (88%) cases had rectal malignancies [6 were adenocarcinomas and 16 were neuroendocrine tumors (NET)], while 3 patients had adenomas. Mean surgical duration was 61.3 min, and mean post-operative stay were 2.7 d. Post-operational examination demonstrated 5 cases had positive resection margin: 2 adenocarcinoma cases and 1 NET case with positive lateral margin, and the other 2 NET cases with positive basal margin. The curve of operation time for TAMIS cases suggested a minimum of 10 cases for a laparoscopic surgeon proficient with this technique. CONCLUSION TAMIS was demonstrated to be reproducible and safe, with a relatively short learning process for laparoscopic surgeons in selected cases for rectal neoplasia.

115626,Stress Management: COVID-19 - Psychological and Spiritual Context.,2020,"Objective: To explore a modified CT scoring system, its feasibility for disease severity evaluation and its predictive value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: This study was a multi-center retrospective cohort study. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 were recruited in three medical centers located in Beijing, Wuhan and Nanchang from January 27, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Demographics, clinical data, and CT images were collected. CT were analyzed by two emergency physicians of more than ten years' work experience independently through a modified scoring system. Final score was determined by average score from the two reviewers if consensus was not reached. The lung was divided into 6 zones (upper, middle, and lower on both sides) by the level of trachea carina and the level of lower pulmonary veins. The target lesion types included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, overall lung involvement, and crazy-paving pattern. Bronchiectasis, cavity, pleural effusion, etc., were not included in CT reading and analysis because of low incidence. The reviewers evaluated the extent of the targeted patterns (GGO, consolidation) and overall affected lung parenchyma for each zone, using Likert scale, ranging from 0-4 (0=absent; 1=1%-25%; 2=26%-50%; 3=51%-75%; 4=76%-100%). Thus, GGO score, consolidation score, and overall lung involvement score were sum of 6 zones ranging from 0-24. For crazy-paving pattern, it was only coded as absent or present (0 or 1) for each zone and therefore ranging from 0-6. Results: A total of 197 patients from 3 medical centers and 522 CT scans entered final analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years, and 54.8% were male. There were 76(38.8%) patients had hypertension and 30(15.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. There were 75 of the patients classified as moderate cases, as well as 95 severe cases and 27 critical cases. As initial symptom, dry cough occurred in 170 patients, 134 patients had fever, and 125 patients had dyspnea. Reparatory rate, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and CURB 65 score on admission day varied among patients with different disease severity scale. There were 50 of the patients suffered from deterioration during hospital stay. The median time consumed for each CT by clinicians was 86.5 seconds. Cronbach's alpha for GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement between two clinicians were 0.809, 0.712, 0.678, and 0.906, respectively, showing good or excellent inter-rater correlation. There were 193 (98.0%) patients had GGO, 147 (74.6%) had consolidation, and 126(64.0%) had crazy-paving pattern throughout clinical course. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 183(92.9%) patients. Median time of interval for CT scan in our study was 7 days so that the whole clinical course was divided into stages by week for further analysis. From the second week on, the CT scores of various types of lesions in severe or critically patients were higher than those of moderate cases. After the fifth week, the course of disease entered the recovery period. The CT score of the upper lung zones was lower than that of other zones in moderate and severe cases. Similar distribution was not observed in critical patients. For moderate cases, the ground glass opacity score at the second week had predictive value for the escalation of the severity classification during hospitalization. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849, the best cut-off value was 5 points, with sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusions: It is feasible for clinicians to use the modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Severe/critical patients had higher scores for ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement than moderate cases. The ground glass opacity score in the second week had an optimal predictive value for escalation of disease severity during hospitalization in moderate patients on admission. The frequency of CT scan should be reduced after entering the recovery stage.","Li, S; Liu, S Y; Zhao, Y Q; Li, Q Y; Liu, D Y; Liu, Z C; Li, D S; Zeng, L; Ge, Q G; Ma, Q B; Shen, N",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200522-00626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721937/,147
115676,Extracardiac Progenitors: Moving Beyond the First and Second Heart Field.,2021-08-06,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether an association exists between financial links to the indoor tanning industry and conclusions of indoor tanning literature. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, up to 15 February 2019. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA Articles discussing indoor tanning and health were eligible for inclusion, with no article type restrictions (original research, systematic reviews, review articles, case reports, editorials, commentaries, and letters were all eligible). Basic science studies, articles describing only indoor tanning prevalence, non-English articles, and articles without full text available were excluded. RESULTS 691 articles were included in analysis, including empiric articles (eg, original articles or systematic reviews) (357/691; 51.7%) and non-empiric articles letters (eg, commentaries, letters, or editorials) (334/691; 48.3%). Overall, 7.2% (50/691) of articles had financial links to the indoor tanning industry; 10.7% (74/691) articles favored indoor tanning, 3.9% (27/691) were neutral, and 85.4% (590/691) were critical of indoor tanning. Among the articles without industry funding, 4.4% (27/620) favored indoor tanning, 3.5% (22/620) were neutral, and 92.1% (571/620) were critical of indoor tanning. Among the articles with financial links to the indoor tanning industry, 78% (39/50) favored indoor tanning, 10% (5/50) were neutral, and 12% (6/50) were critical of indoor tanning. Support from the indoor tanning industry was significantly associated with favoring indoor tanning (risk ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 10.0 to 20.4). CONCLUSIONS Although most articles in the indoor tanning literature are independent of industry funding, articles with financial links to the indoor tanning industry are more likely to favor indoor tanning. Public health practitioners and researchers need to be aware of and account for industry funding when interpreting the evidence related to indoor tanning.

METHOD Online survey involving active clinical pharmacists in Sweden. RESULT The survey was completed by 118 pharmacists (66%), half of whom had at least 1 year's formal training in clinical pharmacy, and work experience in excess of 5 years. Admission medication reconciliation and medication review are provided in most regions and often on a daily basis. The most important services were: making suggestions to physicians regarding drug changes, medication review, medication reconciliation, and patient communication. On a five-point Likert-scale (where 1 = negative and 5 = positive) very few respondents scored less than 4 on the role, acceptance and skills questions. DISCUSSION Our study confirms the strong position of clinical pharmacy and clinical pharmacists in Sweden. There were some differences regarding the services provided between regions but clinical pharmacists' patient-centred work in the clinical setting as part of the care team is well established, accepted and important. Respondents believed they could take on additional responsibilities for prescription changes without the need for further education.

Patients were allocated to group R (n = 10; with an RM) or C (n = 9; without an RM). An RM involved sustained inflation of 30 cmH2O for 30 s. The lungs were ventilated with volume-controlled ventilation with tidal volume of 7 mL kg-1 of predicted body weight and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5. End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure was maintained at normocapnia. Patients were in the horizontal lithotomy position (pre-op). After pneumoperitoneum, patients underwent RARP in a steep Trendelenburg lithotomy position at a PEEP level of 0 cmH2O (RARP0). An RM was used in the R group but not in the C group. Patients were then ventilated with 5 cmH2O PEEP for 1 h after RARP0 (RARP5.1) and 2 h after RARP0 (RARP5.2). Oesophageal pressure and airway pressure were measured for calculating CLUNG and chest wall compliance. CLUNG significantly decreased from pre-op to RARP0 and did not significantly increase from RARP0 to RARP5.1 and RARP5.2 in either group. CLUNG differed significantly between groups at RARP5.1 and RARP5.2 (103 ± 30 vs. 68 ± 11 mL cm-1 H2O and 106 ± 35 vs. 72 ± 9 mL cm-1 H2O; P < 0.05). In patients undergoing RARP, with the addition of RM, the CLUNG was effectively increased from the horizontal lithotomy position to the steep Trendelenburg lithotomy position under pneumoperitoneum.","Kudoh, Osamu; Satoh, Daizoh; Hori, Naosuke; Kawagoe, Izumi; Inada, Eiichi",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-019-00306-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968327/,147

DESIGN After the killing assay, a peptide pellicle was formed on the bottom of a polystyrene plate at the IC50 of each peptide. Over the peptide pellicle, Candida albicans biofilm (48 h) was grown. The peptides antimicrobial activity after the peptides treatment was evaluated by alamarBlue, total biofilm biomass and colony forming units (CFU) counting. RESULTS The pellicle with statherin and the peptides (DR9-2, DR9, GE-12, IP-18, GQ-19) was able to reduce he viability of Candida albicans compared to the negative control. They also decreased cell proliferation by 20 % and total biomass. IT-32 showed the highest reduction in cell proliferation and biomass, which was similar to the positive control, histatin 5. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the naturally occuring peptides from statherin are able to decrease Candida albicans colonization and biofilm proliferation.","Pellissari, Claudia Viviane Guimarães; Jorge, Janaina Habib; Marin, Lina Maria; Sabino-Silva, Robinson; Siqueira, Walter Luiz",Archives of oral biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2021.105106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740624/,147

METHODS GeneChip® screening is used for elucidating various chemoresistance-related gene expression in the adriamycin-resistant leukaemia cells K562/ADR. We constructed K562/CD44 cells by transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid, and adriamycin-resistant ability was confirmed by detecting migration and apoptosis-related proteins and mRNA expression using Western blotting and Real-time PCR respectively. RESULTS K562/CD44 cells were generated by the transfection of an EGFP-SV40-CD44 plasmid with high CD44 expression. mRNA expression levels of CD44 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), along with the proliferation rate, were increased, while the apoptosis rate of K562/CD44 cells was decreased. Migration-associated proteins such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated, whereas apoptosis-related protein Bax was downregulated and Bcl-2 protein was not significantly altered in the K562/CD44 cells. CONCLUSIONS CD44 might be involved in adriamycin resistance via regulation of P-gp, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2/Bax.","Li, Juan; Zhang, Yanfang; Cui, Yubo; Jin, Honghua; Lin, Zhenhua; Piao, Yingshi; Jin, Jingchun",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411349/,147

118105,Creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt to control variceal bleeding in a child.,2013,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) mainly infects monocyte/macrophage cells and modulates cytokine production to regulate host immune response. IL-12p40 is the basic subunit of IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine, which plays key roles in the cell-mediated immune response. In the present study, we demonstrated that PRRSV infection induced IL-12p40 production in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, we showed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB dramatically reduced PRRSV-induced IL-12p40 expression. To further characterize the molecular mechanism of IL-12p40 production induced by PRRSV infection, we cloned and analyzed the porcine IL-12p40 promoter, in which AP-1 and NF-κB motifs were found. In addition, both JNK-AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways were activated by PRRSV infection. Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV induces IL-12p40 expression through the JNK-AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our findings might facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IL-12 production induced by PRRSV infection.","Yu, Zhibin; Huang, Chen; Zhang, Qiong; Feng, Wen-Hai",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663131/,147

An umbrella review of systematic reviews was conducted to summarise the magnitude and quality of the evidence for each prognostic factor investigated. Searches were limited to the last 10 years (2008-11th April 2018, updated 28th September 2020). A two-stage approach was undertaken: in stage one, data on prognostic factors was extracted from systematic reviews identified from the systematic search that met the inclusion criteria. Where a prognostic factor was investigated in ≥1 systematic review and where 50% or more of those reviews found an association between the prognostic factor and one of the outcomes of interest, it was taken forward to stage two. In stage two, additional information extracted included the strength of association found, consistency of effects, and risk of bias. The GRADE approach was used to grade confidence in the evidence. Stage one identified 41 reviews (90 prognostic factors), with 35 reviews (25 prognostic factors) taken forward to stage two. Seven prognostic factors (disability/activity limitation, mental health; pain intensity; pain severity; coping; expectation of outcome/recovery; and fear-avoidance) were judged as having moderate confidence for robust findings. Although there was conflicting evidence for the strength of association with outcome, these factors may be used for identifying vulnerable subgroups or people able to self-manage. Further research can investigate the impact of using such prognostic information on treatment/referral decisions and patient outcomes.","Mansell, Gemma; Corp, Nadia; Wynne-Jones, Gwenllian; Hill, Jonathan; Stynes, Siobhán; van der Windt, Daniëlle",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864327/,147

DESIGN Randomised control pilot trial over a 6-month study follow-up time period. The study was undertaken from May 2017 to -May 2018. Once monthly follow-up visits occurred over the 6-month study period. SETTING Baltimore City, Maryland, USA. PARTICIPANTS We grouped 135 participants into 45 triads (asthmatic child (2-12 years of age), maternal caregiver and social network member). Triads were assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The maternal caregiver and social network members were active smokers and contributed to paediatric TSE. INTERVENTIONS Triads were randomised to receive either usual care (TSE education and quitline referrals) or usual care plus financial incentives. Cash incentives up to $1000 were earned by caregivers and designated social network participants. Incentives for either caregivers or social network participants were provided contingent on their individual reduction of tobacco usage measured by biomarkers of tobacco usage. Study visits occurred once a month during the 6-month trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measure was mean change in monthly paediatric cotinine levels over 6 months of follow-up interval and was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS The mean change in monthly child cotinine values was not significantly different in the intervention cohort over the 6-month follow-up period, compared with the control group (p=0.098, CI -0.16 to 1.89). Trends in child cotinine could not be ascribed to caregivers or social network members. Despite decreasing mean monthly cotinine values, neither the intervention cohort's caregivers (difference in slope (control-intervention)=3.30 ng/mL/month, CI -7.72 to 1.13, p=0.144) or paired social network members (difference in slope (control-intervention)=-1.59 ng/mL/month, CI -3.57 to 6.74, p=0.546) had significantly different cotinine levels than counterparts in the control group.

118363,Insurance Coverage after Job Loss - The Importance of the ACA during the Covid-Associated Recession.,2020-08-19,"MOTIVATION Finding genes that are preferentially expressed in a particular tissue or condition is a problem that cannot be solved by standard statistical testing procedures. A relatively unknown procedure that can be used is the intersection-union test (IUT). However, two disadvantages of the IUT are that it is conservative and it conveys only the information of the least differing target tissue-other tissue pair. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian procedure that quantifies how much evidence there is in the overall expression profile for selective over-expression. In a small simulation study, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms the IUT when it comes to finding selectively expressed genes. An application to publicly available data consisting of 22 tissues shows that the Bayesian method indeed selects genes with functions that reflect the specific tissue functions. The proposed method can also be used to find genes that are underexpressed in a particular tissue.

Optimised manufacturing processes can increase supply. We evaluated various new process steps for IgG fractionation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A crude, worst-case, IgG intermediate obtained by caprylic acid fractionation of cryoprecipitate-poor plasma was used as starting experimental material. It was processed inline by Fractogel® (Merck) TMAE anion-exchanger to deplete IgA and IgM, Eshmuno® P (Merck) anti-A and anti-B affinity chromatography to remove anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins, 0.3% TnBP-1% Triton X-100 (S/D) treatment, C18 chromatography for removal of S/D agents, and single-pass tangential flow filtration (SPTFF) concentration to 20%. Quality, safety, and recovery were evaluated at small and pilot scales to assess purity, removal of IgA, IgM isoagglutinins, S/D agents, thrombogenic factors, and lack of toxicity in a cell model. RESULTS The starting IgG intermediate contained approximately 90% IgG, IgA, and IgM and 10% albumin. Fractogel® TMAE, equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate-pH 6.0 and loaded with up to 225 mg of IgG/mL, could remove IgA and IgM, with over 94% IgG recovery with preserved sub-class distribution in the flow-through. Sequential Eshmuno®-P anti-A and anti-B columns efficiently removed isoagglutinins. The C18 packing, used at up to 17 mL of S/D-IgG solution per mL, removed TnBP and Triton X-100 to less than 1 and 2 ppm, respectively. The 20% purified IgG was devoid of activated factor XI and thrombin generation activity. DISCUSSION This purification sequence yields a >99% pure, 20% (v/v) IgG product, depleted of IgA, isoagglutinins, and thrombogenic markers, and should be implementable on various IgG intermediates to help improve the supply of immunoglobulins.","Cheng, Josephine H; Wu, Yu-Wen; Wang, Chen-Yun; Wu, Sharon S; Hong, Cheum L; Chan, Karen W; Liao, Leo X; Cao, Xisheng; Wang, Bin; Burnouf, Thierry",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2021.0159-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369872/,147

This review will focus briefly on medications used during the outbreak. We will discuss current therapeutic candidates and their status and will then turn to a related and essential topic: supportive care and the standard of care for filovirus infected patients. Potential benefits and pitfalls of combination therapies for filoviruses will be discussed. Areas covered: Clinical trials of therapeutics targeting EBOV; clinical usage of therapeutics during recent EBOV outbreak; potential need for combination therapy; role of supportive care in treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Expert commentary: In the absence of another large scale EBOV outbreak, the path to therapeutic product licensure in the United States of America (USA) would need to be via the FDA Animal Rule. However, human data may be needed to supplement animal data. The future of filovirus therapeutics may therefore benefit by establishing the ability to implement clinical trials in an outbreak setting in a timely fashion.

With current pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) though the molecular analysis with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, the critical role of chest imaging including CT scan and baseline X-ray became apparent early in the course due to concern for less than optimal sensitivity of PCR testing. Delay in molecular diagnosis due to a shortage of testing kits and laboratory personnel also makes imaging an important modality in early diagnosis for appropriate triage and isolation decisions. CT scan technology is widely available in developed parts of the world but in developing countries, CT scanner is not widely available especially in rural settings. CT imaging usually requires patient movement to the radiology department and the scanner is not easy to disinfect. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been used for many years in the assessment of critically ill patients in emergency departments and intensive care units. It is rapidly gaining popularity across many specialties and part of many general medicine training programs across the United States. It can be learned rapidly and with experienced hands, POCUS can help identify disease patterns in the lung parenchyma, and during the current pandemic has been gaining special attention. In this article, we review the most prominent imaging findings on chest X-ray and CT scan in patients with COVID-19. We also focus on the background and evolution of POCUS with studies showing the promising role of this diagnostic modality in COVID-19 infection. In addition, we describe step by step guidance on the use and disinfection of the portable ultrasound machine.","Gandhi, Darshan; Jain, Nitin; Khanna, Kanika; Li, Shuo; Patel, Love; Gupta, Nishant",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145313/,147

METHODS Information was collected regarding clinical, demographic, and epidemiological features of the definite COVID-19 cases. Through Cox regression and statistical analysis, the risk factors related to mortality were determined. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate survival function and measure the mean length of living time in the patients. RESULTS Among about 3000 patients admitted in the Taleghani hospital as outpatients with suspicious signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in 2 months, 214 people were confirmed positive for this virus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Median time to death was 30 days. In this population, 24.29% of the patients died and 24.76% of them were admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit) during hospitalization. The results of Multivariate Cox regression Analysis showed that factors including age (HR, 1.031; 95% CI, 1.001-1.062; P value=0.04), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.000-1.015; P value=0.04) could independently predict mortality. Furthermore, the results showed that age above 59 years directly increased mortality rate and decreased survival among our study population. CONCLUSION Predictor factors play an important role in decisions on public health policy-making. Our findings suggested that advanced age and CRP were independent mortality rate predictors in the admitted patients.","Sadeghi, Amir; Eslami, Pegah; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Moazzami, Bobak; Pirsalehi, Ali; Ilkhani, Saba; Banar, Sepideh; Feizollahi, Fateme; Vahidi, Mohammad; Abdi, Saeed; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Zali, Mohammad Reza; Nasserinejad, Maryam",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2021.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196195/,147
121017,Recent advances in HIV-associated chronic lung disease clinical research.,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND The worldwide lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemics has often led to physical inactivity and social distancing. When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health, and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown. METHODS An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from 23rd to 29th of March. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices. RESULTS Four hundred participants were included in the final analysis. During the lockdown, the number of steps dropped from 8,284±4,390 to 3,294±3,994 steps (p< 0.001), while mean peak HR decreased from 61.3±18.2% to 55.9±17.3% (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These findings provide objective data about the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity, thus encouraging the use of smart devices to monitor and promote healthy lifestyles while faced with a confinement condition.","Buoite Stella, Alex; Ajčević, Miloš; Furlanis, Giovanni; Cillotto, Tommaso; Menichelli, Alina; Accardo, Agostino; Manganotti, Paolo",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.20.11373-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092330/,147

Closure is associated with morbidity and mortality. This study investigated patterns of complications after loop ileostomy closure and factors associated with morbidity and mortality. METHOD A review was performed of patients who underwent loop ileostomy closure between 1999 and 2005. RESULTS Three hundred and twenty-five patients underwent closure of loop ileostomy. Reasons for primary surgery were: anterior resection for cancer (n = 160, 49%), ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (n = 114, 35%), diverticular disease (n = 25, 8%), Crohn's colitis (n = 4, 1%) and other conditions (n = 22, 7%). Overall mortality was 2.5% (n = 8) and morbidity was 22.8% (n = 74). Thirty-two patients (10%) developed small bowel obstruction, of whom seven required operative intervention. Overall, the re-operation rate in this series was 28 patients (8.6%). Thirteen (4%) patients had an anastomotic leak of whom 12 patients had re-operation. Preoperative anaemia was significantly associated with leakage (Hb < 11 g/dl; n = 65, P = 0.033). The leakage rate was lower after a stapled anastomosis than a hand-sutured anastomosis (4/203 vs 9/122; P = 0.039). Hypo-albuminaemia (albumin < 34 g/l) was significantly associated with mortality (n = 46, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Loop ileostomy closure is associated with morbidity and mortality. Anaemia and hypo-albuminaemia may be associated with poor outcome.","Saha, A K; Tapping, C R; Foley, G T; Baker, R P; Sagar, P M; Burke, D A; Sue-Ling, H M; Finan, P J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2008.01708.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175627/,147

METHODS We established a COVID-19 biobank with the aim of collecting high-quality and well-annotated human biospecimens, in the effort to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and identify therapeutic targets (COVID-BioB, NCT04318366). Here we describe our experience and briefly review the characteristics of the biobanks for COVID-19 that have been so far established. RESULTS A total of 46,677 samples have been collected from 913 participants (63.3% males, median [IQR] age 62.2 [51.2 - 74.0] years) since the beginning of the program. Most patients (66.9%) had been admitted to hospital for COVID-19, with a median length of stay of 15.0 (9.0 - 27.0) days. A minority of patients (13.3% of the total) had been admitted for other reasons and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remainder were managed at home after being seen at the Emergency Department. CONCLUSIONS Having a solid research infrastructure already in place, along with flexibility and adaptability to new requirements, allowed for the quick building of a COVID-19 biobank that will help expand and share the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2.","Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Tresoldi, Cristina; Conte, Caterina; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Ghezzi, Silvia; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Di Filippo, Luigi; Farina, Nicola; Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Ripa, Marco; Mancini, Nicasio; Cantarelli, Elisa; Galli, Laura; Poli, Andrea; De Cobelli, Francesco; Bonini, Chiara; Manfredi, Angelo A; Franchini, Stefano; Spessot, Marzia; Carlucci, Michele; Dagna, Lorenzo; Scarpellini, Paolo; Ambrosio, Alberto; Di Napoli, Davide; Bosi, Emanuele; Tresoldi, Moreno; Lazzarin, Adriano; Landoni, Giovanni; Martino, Gianvito; Zangrillo, Alberto; Poli, Guido; Castagna, Antonella; Vicenzi, Elisa; Clementi, Massimo; Ciceri, Fabio",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.04168-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073557/,147

This is the time during pregnancy when insulin resistance is increasing and hyperglycemia develops among those with insufficient insulin secretory capacity to maintain euglycemia. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study and the two major randomized controlled trials of treating GDM are based upon recruitment of women at this time during pregnancy. Meanwhile, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, with its significant risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, has led to a need to identify undiagnosed diabetes as near to conception as possible. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes early in pregnancy also identifies women with hyperglycemia less than overt diabetes, yet at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Such women are more insulin resistant-with higher blood pressure, triglycerides, perinatal mortality, and neonatal hypoglycemia with a greater need for insulin treatment-than those with GDM diagnosed at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Currently, there is uncertainty over how to diagnose GDM early in pregnancy and the benefits and harms from using the current management regimen. Randomized controlled trials testing the criteria for, and treatment of, GDM early in pregnancy are urgently needed to address this existing equipoise. In the meantime, the importance of early or ""prevalent GDM"" (i.e., mild hyperglycemia present from early [before] pregnancy) warrants interim criteria and thresholds for medication, which may differ from those in use for GDM diagnosed at 24-28 weeks' gestation.","Simmons, David",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dci20-0055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972313/,147

The study utilized data from 805 U.S. young adults (18-30 years) who completed online surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic across two waves (April-August 2020 and September 2020-March 2021). Overall, young adults reported low PTG scores. PTSD symptoms and COVID-19-related worry significantly predicted higher levels of PTG, while their depression symptoms predicted lower levels of PTG. Resilience and family connectedness significantly predicted higher levels of PTG, and distress tolerance significantly predicted lower levels of PTG after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics and negative influential factors. Compared to Whites, Asians were less likely to report PTG. In general, young adults have not perceived personal growth from the pandemic; however, young adults with certain psychosocial factors appear to be predisposed to such PTG. This study highlights the importance of exploring and elucidating the potential positive trajectories following the adversity of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyun, Sunah; Wong, Ga Tin Finneas; Levy-Carrick, Nomi C; Charmaraman, Linda; Cozier, Yvette; Yip, Tiffany; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Liu, Cindy H",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139592/,147

Somatic embryogenesis can be an alternative method for mass propagation of T. amurensis. However, the molecular mechanisms of T. amurensis somatic embryogenesis are yet to be known. Here, we conducted comparative transcriptional analysis during somatic embryogenesis of T. amurensis. RNA-Seq identified 1505 differentially expressed genes, including developmental regulatory genes. Auxin related genes such as YUC, AUX/IAA and ARF and signal transduction pathway related genes including LEA and SERK were differentially regulated during somatic embryogenesis. Also, B3 domain family (LEC2, FUS3), VAL and PKL, the regulatory transcription factors, were differentially expressed by somatic embryo developmental stages. Our results could provide plausible pathway of signaling somatic embryogenesis of T. amurensis, and serve an important resource for further studies in direct somatic embryogenesis in woody plants.","Kang, Hye-In; Lee, Chae-Bin; Kwon, Soon-Ho; Park, Ji-Min; Kang, Kyu-Suk; Shim, Donghwan",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85886-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737673/,147
122720,Simultaneous reduction in noise and cross-contamination artifacts for dual-energy X-ray CT.,2013,"Visual perception depends fundamentally on statistical regularities in the environment to make sense of the world. One such regularity is the orientation anisotropy typical of natural scenes; most natural scenes contain slightly more canonical (horizontal and vertical) information than oblique information. This property is likely a primary cause of the oblique effect in which subjects experience greater perceptual fluency with horizontally and vertically oriented content than oblique. Recent changes in the visual environment, including the ""carpentered"" content in urban scenes and the framed, caricatured content in digital screen media presentations, may have altered the typical (natural) level of orientation anisotropy. The current work evaluated whether digital visual experience, or visual experience with framed digital content, has the potential to alter the magnitude of the oblique effect in visual perception. Experiment 1 successfully established a novel eye-tracking method capable of indexing the visual oblique effect quickly and reliably and demonstrated the oblique effect. Experiment 2 used this method and found that one session of exposure to a specific video game altered visual orientation perception. Taken together, these results indicate that exposure to the realistic, but caricatured scene statistics of digital screen media, can alter visual contour perception in one session.","Hipp, D; Olsen, S; Gerhardstein, P",Perception,https://doi.org/10.1177/0301006620950989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962552/,147

The aim of this study was to determine factors that could possibly affect the acceptance of Indonesian citizens of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: An online survey was conducted between the first and fifth of November, 2020. Participants were asked to respond to questions on acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived religiosity towards, and amount of information about COVID-19. This study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the framework to decide factors that affect vaccine acceptance. Structural Equation Model was employed to assess the correlation between all explanatory variables and vaccine acceptance. Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis rank were employed to assess demographic factors associated with acceptance. Results: In total, 311 responses were included for analysis. Our TAM model suggested that high perceived usefulness significantly increased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and high perceived ease of use significantly increased the perceived usefulness. Perceived religiosity did not substantially affect vaccine acceptance. The amount of information on COVID-19 also did not significantly affect vaccine acceptance. Our data suggested that vaccine acceptance was associated with age, type of occupation, marital status and monthly income to some degree. Conclusion: Since perceived usefulness affects vaccine acceptance, the government should focus on the usefulness of the vaccine when promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to Indonesian citizens. In addition, since perceived ease of use significantly affects users' acceptance to COVID-19 vaccine, the easier to acquire the vaccine in the community, the higher chance that the citizens are willing to be vaccinated.","Faturohman, Taufik; Kengsiswoyo, Giofella Adesta Navaky; Harapan, Harapan; Zailani, Suhaiza; Rahadi, R Aswin; Arief, Neneng Nurlaela",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.53506.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621508/,147

The original OS datasets were downloaded from the the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. Univariate, Lasso, and machine learning algorithm-iterative Lasso Cox regression analyses were used to establish a methylated lncRNA signature that significantly correlated with OS patient survival. The validity of this signature was verified by the Kaplan-Meier curves, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. We established a four-methylated lncRNA signature that can predict OS patient survival (verified in independent cohort [GSE39055]). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the signature can distinguish between the survival of high- and low-risk patients. ROC analysis corroborated this finding and revealed that the signature had higher prediction accuracy than known biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the clinical subgroup showed that the signature's prognostic ability was independent of clinicopathological factors.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective descriptive clinical study. ANIMALS Twelve client-owned mares. METHODS Healthy mares with normal ovarian palpation and ultrasonographic appearance were enrolled. Horses were restrained in standing stocks and administered a variable rate infusion of sedation. A left paralumbar bilateral ovariectomy was performed with 1 laparoscopic and 3 instrument portals. Access to the right ovary was facilitated by retracting the descending colon and associated mesentery with a fan retractor. Ovaries were removed with traumatic forceps, and a blunt tip vessel sealing device. A laparoscopic portal within the 17th intercostal space provided good visualization of the right ovary and reduced interference between instrumentation. Complications were recorded during hospitalization. In addition, an owner follow-up questionnaire was used to determine complications after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS Left paralumbar bilateral ovariectomy was successful in all 12 mares, with a mean surgical time of 76 ± 8 minutes. Postoperative complications occurred in 4/12 (33%) mares and included fever, mild colic, incisional swelling, and azotemia.

However, there is still no effective clinical treatment to date. Our previous studies found that NLRC5 was significantly increased in acute liver injury model induced by LPS to reduce the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α. Nevertheless, there is no report on the role of NLRC5 in regulating the development of acute lung injury. In this study we successfully established a model of acute lung injury induced by tracheal instillation of LPS in mice, and found NLRC5 expression was apparently elevated in mouse lung tissue and primary alveolar macrophages. NLRC5 overexpression negatively regulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines in murine alveolar macrophage cells through NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathway inhibition. There is a positively feedback between NLRC5 and NF-κB or p38 MAPK pathway. This study may provide some new ideas for clinical prevention of lung injury.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Huang, Cheng; Bian, Erbao; Lei, Ting; Lv, Xiongwen; Li, Jun",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2020.115150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710960/,147
124605,Viscoelastic Hemostatic Assays: Update on Technology and Clinical Applications.,2021-07-01,"This report is dedicated to determination of anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) in human urine using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Aluminum oxide loaded with silver nanoparticles (AO-Ag) was proposed as SERS-active sorbent and used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analyte and its SERS-based determination (SPE-SERS protocol). MTX has strong SERS signal only in alkaline media that challenges its determination in urine due to strong background signal caused by creatinine. The application of SPE step enables to purify and concentrate the analyte making MTX determination possible. Also, the application of the same material for SPE pretreatment and SERS analysis enables to simplify and speed-up the protocol. The protocol was developed and tested using artificially spiked samples of human urine collected during different time of day to account deviating composition of the urine matrix. The use of dilution step of the analyte-containing urine was proposed prior SPE-SERS protocol to reduce the difference between morning-time- and daytime-collected urine achieving maximal reliability of the analysis. Additional physicochemical study was performed to estimate an influence of the primary intrinsic urine components (salts, urea, creatinine) and their mixtures on the analytical signal. Final protocol enables MTX determination in human urine within 20-300 μg mL-1 range of concentrations with satisfactory precision (11-19% RSD), accuracy (97-104% apparent recovery), and limit of detection (4.2 μg mL-1). Accounting that the analysis requires less than 15 min and portable Raman spectrometer, the protocol seems to be promising for therapeutic drug monitoring in hospitals to identify poor MTX clearance in a timely manner and minimize adverse effects of therapy.

124755,Renal denervation: intractable hypertension and beyond.,2014,"OBJECTIVE To compare the outcomes of transvaginal mesh (TVM) and native-tissue repair (NTR) for the repair of anterior compartment prolapse. METHODS This retrospective study involved 90 patients with anterior compartment prolapse who underwent pelvic organ prolapse surgery between January 2018 and October 2020. A TVM was used to treat 53 patients and 37 underwent NTR. All patients underwent a standardized interview, clinical examination, and four-dimensional pelvic floor ultrasound (PFUS) before and after the surgery. The primary outcome was anatomic recurrence evaluated by ultrasonic parameters. The secondary outcomes were subjective recurrence and complications. RESULTS Subjective recurrence was 9.43% (5/53) for TVM and 16.22% (6/37) for NTR (P = .522). Significant recurrence of prolapse on ultrasound occurred in five patients (9.43%) after TVM and 12 (32.43%) after NTR; there was a significant difference between the TVM and NTR groups (P = .006). In the TVM group, the mesh was visible on ultrasound in each patient. The mesh exposure rate was 1.89% (1/53). The postoperative hiatal area reduction in the TVM group, compared with the NTR group, was statistically significant (5.55 ± 4.71 cm2 vs 3.09 ± 5.61 cm2 , P = .027). The incidence of de novo stress urinary incontinence was higher in the TVM group (20.75% vs 2.70%, P = .03). After surgery, there were significant differences between the two groups based on bladder descent (12.02 ± 8.64 mm vs 22.41 ± 13.95 mm, P = .000) and urethral rotation angle (25.26 ± 13.92° vs 40.27 ± 23.72°, P = .001). CONCLUSION PFUS is effective for evaluating postoperative outcomes. TVM facilitates a better anatomic cure than NTR for anterior compartment prolapse.","Liu, Lin-Na; Liu, Xiu-Ni; Liu, Chang; Yao, Meng-Yan; Xu, Hui-Xiong",Lower urinary tract symptoms,https://doi.org/10.1111/luts.12392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101374/,147
124843,Requisite Omega-3 HUFA Biomarker Thresholds for Preventing Murine Lupus Flaring.,2020,"Introduction and Aim: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) frequently occurs after acute ischemic stroke and negatively influences the functional outcome. Usually, HT is classified by its radiological appearance. Discriminating between the subtypes can be complicated, and interobserver variation is considerable. Therefore, we aim to quantify rather than classify hemorrhage volumes and determine the association of hemorrhage volume with functional outcome in comparison with the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II classification. Patients and Methods: We included patients from the MR CLEAN trial with follow-up imaging. Hemorrhage volume was estimated by manual delineation of the lesion, and HT was classified according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II classification [petechial hemorrhagic infarction types 1 (HI1) and 2 (HI2) and parenchymal hematoma types 1 (PH1) and 2 (PH2)] on follow-up CT 24 h to 2 weeks after treatment. We assessed functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale 90 days after stroke onset. Ordinal logistic regression with and without adjustment for potential confounders was used to describe the association of hemorrhage volume with functional outcome. We created regression models including and excluding total lesion volume as a confounder. Results: We included 478 patients. Of these patients, 222 had HT. Median hemorrhage volume was 3.37 ml (0.80-12.6) and per HT subgroup; HI1: 0.2 (0.0-1.7), HI2: 3.2 (1.7-6.1), PH1: 6.3 (4.2-13), and PH2: 47 (19-101). Hemorrhage volume was associated with functional outcome [adjusted common odds ratio (acOR): 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.95] but not anymore after adjustment for total lesion volume (acOR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15, per 10 ml). Hemorrhage volume in patients with PH2 was significantly associated with functional outcome after adjusting total lesion volume (acOR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.98). Conclusion: HT volume is associated with functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke but not independent of total lesion volume. The extent of a PH2 was associated with outcome, suggesting that measuring hemorrhage volume only provides an additional benefit in the prediction of the outcome when a PH2 is present.","van Kranendonk, Katinka R; Treurniet, Kilian M; Boers, Anna M M; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Coutinho, Jonathan M; Lingsma, Hester F; van Zwam, Wim H; van der Lugt, Aad; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Dippel, Diederik W J; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.582767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240206/,147

He was a strong candidate for redo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). CT was performed to confirm whether the heart was adherent to the sternum and chest wall. For safety reasons, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was first performed via right femoral cannulation before sternotomy. After the spontaneous right ventricular (RV) rupture, HTK was used to arrest the heart. Heart repair materials were applied to repair the fissure of RV to avoid further tearing and bleeding. A compromise scheme was adopted when it was found to be difficult to identify and expose well the target artery, due to severe adhesion. This was done to avoid possible severe consequences of further dissection of the heart. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to evaluate the cardiac function, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support was applied in time. In consideration of the RV enlargement, which TEE revealed may have been caused by myocardial edema and cardiac insufficiency, modified ultrafiltration was performed, and a timely decision of open chest management (OCM) with delayed sternal closure (DSC) was made to maintain hemodynamic stability. The patient had no further complications and eventually recovered well, according to a 4-month follow up.","Liu, Zihou; Chang, Chao; Liu, Jiapeng; Wang, Qiang",The heart surgery forum,https://doi.org/10.1532/hsf.3161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990566/,147

Here, we report the retrospective observational data of AVF creation by nephrologists in a single center, during a period of 8 months. A total of 376 fistulae were created in 310 patients. Patients were followed up at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Twenty-eight patients required fistula creation twice, 16 patients thrice, and two patients underwent fistula creation four times. Of the total, 259 (68.8%) fistulae were radio-cephalic while 99 (26.3%) and 18 (4.79%) were brachio-cephalic and brachio-basilic, respectively.

125484,Deterioration of Hepatic Oxygenation Precedes an Onset of Intradialytic Hypotension with Little Change in Blood Volume during Hemodialysis.,2018,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 presents unique challenges to the care of hospitalized older adults, including fractured lines of communication and uncertainty surrounding long term trajectories in cognition and function. Geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians bring specialized training in facilitating communication in the face of uncertainty. Insurance expansion of virtual visits enabled inpatient virtual consultation, which can preserve personal protective equipment and minimize exposure to clinicians. We examined changes in goals of care and code status following an inpatient virtual consultation with geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians. METHODS This was an observational case series study performed at a large tertiary Academic Hospital. The study population included 78 patients aged 65 years and older, hospitalized with COVID-19 who had an inpatient consultation completed by geriatric medicine or palliative care clinicians between April 9, 2020 through May 9, 2020. The intervention was targeted, virtual geriatric medicine or palliative care consultation. All patients admitted to a medical floor with COVID-19 were screened four days a week and if a patient was over the age of 65, the medical team was offered a consultation by geriatric medicine (ages 80 and above) or palliative care (ages 65-79). Consultation included medical record review, telephone conversations with clinicians and nurses, telephone or video conversations with patients and/or surrogate decision-makers and collaborative case review on daily virtual huddles with an interprofessional team of geriatric medicine and palliative care clinicians. Descriptive statistics were applied to categorize outcomes after chart abstraction. RESULTS Following consultation, 24 patients (31%) patients changed their code status to less invasive interventions. Of patients who were FULL CODE at the time of consultation (n=42), 2 (4.8%) transitioned to DNR only and 16 (38.1%) transitioned to DNR/DNI after consultation. While 8 patients (10.3%) utilized intensive care unit (ICU) level of care prior to consultation, 6 (7.6%) patients utilized ICU after consultation. After consultation, 11 (14.1%) patients were referred to hospice. CONCLUSIONS Given uncertain trajectories in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and variability in patient preferences, virtual goals of care geriatric medicine and palliative care consultations should be considered as a key component of COVID-19 hospital protocols.","Ouellet, Jennifer A; Prsic, Elizabeth H; Spear, Rebecca A; Blatt, Leslie; Kukulka, Shannon; Cronin-Ozyck, Rosemary; Kapo, Jennifer M; Lai, James M",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154358/,147

Secondarily, we explored the relationship between kinetic measurement system findings and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). METHODS We followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and Arksey and O'Malley's 6-stage framework. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to June 2020. Original research papers reporting parameters measured by kinetic measurement systems in individuals at least 6-months post primary ACLR were included. RESULTS In 158 included studies, 7 kinetic measurement systems (force plates, balance platforms, pressure mats, force-measuring treadmills, Wii balance boards, contact mats connected to jump systems, and single-sensor insoles) were identified 4 main movement categories (landing/jumping, standing balance, gait, and other functional tasks). Substantial heterogeneity was noted in the methods used and outcomes assessed; this review highlighted common methodological reporting gaps for essential items related to movement tasks, kinetic system features, justification and operationalization of selected outcome parameters, participant preparation, and testing protocol details. Accordingly, we suggest considerations for methodological reporting in future research. Only 6 studies included PROMs with inconsistency in the reported parameters and/or PROMs. CONCLUSION Clear and accurate reporting is vital to facilitate cross-study comparisons and improve the clinical application of kinetic measurement systems after ACLR. Based on the current evidence, we suggest methodological considerations to guide reporting in future research. Future studies are needed to examine potential correlations between kinetic parameters and PROMs.","Labban, Wasim; Stadnyk, Meredith; Sommerfeldt, Mark; Nathanail, Stephanie; Dennett, Liz; Westover, Lindsey; Manaseer, Thaer; Beaupre, Lauren",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-021-00397-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568996/,147

This study aims to describe recent experience with surgical treatment of T2DM in Asian centers. METHODS Patients aged 20 to 70 years with not well-controlled T2DM [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) >7.0%] and BMI < 35 kg/m(2) were included at five institutes between 2007 and 2010. The end point is T2DM remission, defined by fasting plasma glucose <110 mg/dl and HbA1C <6.0%. RESULTS Of the 200 patients, 172 (86%) underwent gastric bypass, 24 (12%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy, and the other 4 underwent adjustable banding. Laparoscopic access was used in all the patients. Gender (66.5% female), age (mean 45.0 ± 10.8), and HbA1C (mean 9.3 ± 1.9%) did not differ between the procedure among the groups. Until now, 87 patients had 1-year data. One year after surgery, the mean BMI decreased from 28.5 ± 3.0 to 23.4 ± 2.3 kg/m(2) and HbA1C decreased to 6.3 ± 0.5%. Remission of T2DM was achieved in 72.4% of the patients. Patients with a diabetes duration of <5 years had a better diabetes remission rate than patients with duration of diabetes >5 years (90.3% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.006). Patients with BMI > 30 kg/m(2) had a better diabetes remission rate than those with BMI < 30 kg/m(2) (78.7% vs. 62.5%; p = 0.027). Individuals who underwent gastric bypass loss more weight and had a higher diabetes remission rate than individuals who underwent restrictive-type procedures. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the duration of diabetes and the type of surgery predict the diabetes remission. No mortalities were reported and two (1.0%) patients had major morbidities. CONCLUSION Gastrointestinal metabolic surgery is an effective treatment for not well-controlled T2DM treatment. Diabetes remission is significantly higher in those with duration of diabetes less than 5 years and BMI > 30 kg/m(2).","Lee, Wei-Jei; Hur, Kyung Yul; Lakadawala, Muffazal; Kasama, Kazunori; Wong, Simon K H; Lee, Yi-Chih",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1740-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22042564/,147

However, it is not well-documented whether the causes of burns affect inflammation, hypermetabolism, and morbidity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a difference in degree of inflammation, hypermetabolism, endocrine and acute-phase response, and clinical outcome between pediatric patients with scald and flame burns. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Children with burns requiring surgical intervention were enrolled in this cohort study and divided into two groups, scald or flame burn. In a second assignment, we analyzed the study populations in representative subgroups containing individuals with third-degree burns of 40% to 60% total body surface area. We determined clinical outcomes, resting energy expenditures, cytokine profiles, acute-phase proteins, constitutive proteins, and hormone panels. Statistical analysis was evaluated by analysis of variance, Student's t test corrected with the Bonferroni post hoc test, and the propensity score. Statistical significance was set at p < .05. A total of 912 patients were identified. Six hundred seventy-four had a flame burn and 238 had a scald burn. There was a significant difference (p < .05) in burn size (flame, 48% ± 23%; scald, 40% ± 21%), third-degree burn (flame, 39% ± 27%; scald 22% ± 25%), age (flame, 8 ± 5 yrs; scald, 3 ± 3 yrs), and mortality between groups. Propensity analysis confirmed the type of burn as a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Subanalysis conducted in a representative patient group suffering from 40% to 60% burn total body surface area revealed that flame burns lead to significantly increased hypermetabolic, inflammatory, and acute-phase responses when compared to scald burns (p < .05). The frequency of sepsis was 3% in the scald burn group, while it was 14% in the flame group (p < .001). Multiorgan failure occurred in 14% of the scald patients, while it occurred in 17% of flame patients. The mortality in patients suffering from a scald burn was 3% compared to 6% in the flame-burned group (p < .05). CONCLUSION The type of burn affects hypermetabolism, inflammation, acute-phase responses, and mortality postburn.","Kraft, Robert; Kulp, Gabriela A; Herndon, David N; Emdad, Fatemah; Williams, Felicia N; Hawkins, Hal K; Leonard, Katrina R; Jeschke, Marc G",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e31820ac2c5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21297515/,147

Aims To examine stakeholder perspectives of barriers and facilitators to involving people with serious mental illness in antipsychotic prescribing decisions. METHOD Systematic thematic synthesis. RESULTS Synthesis of 29 studies identified the following key influences on involvement: patient's capability, desire and expectation for involvement, organisational context, and the consultation setting and processes. CONCLUSIONS Optimal patient involvement in antipsychotic decisions demands that individual and contextual barriers are addressed. There was divergence in perceived barriers to involvement identified by patients and prescribers. For example, patients felt that lack of time in consultations was a barrier to involvement, something seldom raised by prescribers, who identified organisational barriers. Patients must understand their rights to involvement and the value of their expertise. Organisational initiatives should mandate prescriber responsibility to overcome barriers to involvement.

In the present study, phytochemicals from spices were assessed for their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Structure based virtual screening was performed with 146 phytochemicals from spices using Autodock Vina. Phytochemicals with binding energy ≥ -8.0 kcal/mol were selected to understand their interaction with MPro. Virtual screening was further validated by performing molecular docking to generate favorable docked poses and the participation of important amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulation for the docked poses was performed to study thermodynamic properties of the protein, ligand and protein-ligand complexes. The finding shows that cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin showed favorable binding affinity values with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The results are comparable in terms of docked poses, important amino acid participation and thermodynamic properties with the standard control drugs remdesivir, benazepril and hydroxychloroquine diphosphate. Prime MM-GBSA was employed for end-point binding energy calculation. Binding to domain I and II of MPro were mediated through the OH, SH, NH2 and non-polar side chain of amino acids. Cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin binds to MPro with many sub sites within the active site with RMSD and RMSF within 4 Å. The results computed using Prime MM-GBSA show that cinnamtannin B2 (-68.54940214 kcal/mol) and cyanin (-62.1902835 kcal/mol) have better binding affinity in comparison to hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (-54.00912412 kcal/mol) and benazepril (-53.70242369 kcal/mol).

Ventilation modes are mainly volume-based or pressure-based. Pressure-based ventilation modes provide better leak compensation than volume-based. The integration of advanced flow generation systems and ventilation modes of the modern operating room ventilators enables clinicians to provide both invasive and noninvasive ventilation in perioperative settings. Ventilator waveforms can be used for intraoperative neuromonitoring during cervical spine surgery. SUMMARY The increase in number of new features of modern operating room ventilators clearly creates the opportunity for clinicians to optimize ventilatory care. However, improving the quality of ventilator care relies on a complete understanding and correct use of these new features.

127176,Long-term clinical outcomes of dual-cycle radiofrequency ablation technique for treatment of osteoid osteoma.,2016,"Sea cucumbers are fished worldwide for export to Asia, but few studies have evaluated metal pollution and risk assessment. This study assessed concentration of trace metals and the potential ecological risk in sea cucumber (Holothuria floridana) and sediments at the Cispatá Bay, in the Caribbean Coast of Colombia. The trace metal concentrations in biota and sediments showed a similar decreasing trend as follows: Cu > Zn > Hg > Pb > Cd. The highest bioconcentration factor was found for Hg, and according to the sediment quality guidelines, Cu levels indicate adverse biological effects in the ecosystem. In this regard, Cu levels were higher than effects range low and the threshold effect levels (TEL) and lowest effect level in all the stations, whereas Hg levels were higher than TEL in most of them. Results for health risk assessment based on the maximum allowable daily consumption rate (CRlim) suggest that there is no risk to adults; however, children should limit or avoid its consumption. Results from multivariate statistical analysis suggest that agricultural activities (i.e., application of fertilizers and agrochemicals) were identified as the main anthropogenic sources of metal pollution. This research suggest that sea cucumber could be used as a bioindicator species in studies of monitoring metal contamination, with special attention to the highly significant correlation between Zn in tissue and sediments. This study also reveals that anthropic activities may have negative effects in the quality of the sediments of the bay and contributing to the knowledge of metal accumulation in sea cucumber.Graphical abstract.","Marrugo-Negrete, José; Pinedo-Hernández, José; Marrugo-Madrid, Siday; Navarro-Frómeta, Enrique; Díez, Sergi",Biological trace element research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02308-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803527/,147

MATERIALS AND METHODS 7 patients with dCCFs were identified and treated with a double lumen balloon Scepter C. 5 patients had post-traumatic dCCFs and two patients had spontaneous dCCFs due to a ruptured cavernous-carotid aneurysm. The double lumen balloon was used in characterizing the angioarchitecture of the fistula in all patients. The best treatment option was then decided based on the characteristics of the carotid wall tear. Embolization of the cavernous sinus was achieved with coils and injection of Onyx liquid embolic material in three patients and with coils alone in four patients. One patient required stent assisted coiling to reconstruct the internal carotid artery. RESULTS 7 patients with dCCFs were treated with transarterial embolization. All patients had immediate angiographic and clinical cure. The Scepter C balloon was used for balloon assisted coiling and injection of Onyx liquid embolic material. On follow-up, all patients had clinical symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS The Scepter C balloon is a useful tool for the transarterial treatment of dCCFs.","Samaniego, Edgar A; Martínez-Galdámez, Mario; Abdo, German",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878067/,147

METHODS At the end of 2013 we implemented a quality assurance registry of outbreak investigations performed by the Deutsches Beratungszentrum für Hygiene (German Consulting Center for Infection Control and prevention) in Freiburg. Now we analyzed the registered outbreaks until January 2015. RESULTS Norovirus was the leading causative organism and gram negative bacteria dominated the group of bacterial outbreaks. Outbreaks lasted between 6 and 185 days. 24 % of outbreaks were related to colonization only. Within 29 outbreaks we had 187 infected patients, 50 colonized patients und 92 infected health care workers (64 x norovirus, 20 x influenza, 8 x scabies). No deaths were recorded. Several risk factors and improvement potentials for future outbreaks could be identified. CONCLUSION Lack of staff compliance with vaccination or prophylactic therapy, misuse of personal protective equipment and lapses in absence from work for the required time can play an important role for prolonged outbreak situations esp. with viral outbreaks and scabies. A structured and goal directed outbreak management especially in the initial phase of an outbreak seems to be important for an efficient and fast termination of an outbreak.","Schulz-Stübner, S; Reska, M; Hauer, T; Schaumann, R",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-102483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983118/,147
127618,Insulin resistance and PCOS: chicken or egg?,2020-07-09,"Eukaryotic RNA viruses are known to utilize host factors; however, the identity of these factors and their role in the virus life cycle remain largely undefined. Here, we report a method to identify proteins bound to the viral RNA during amplification in cell culture: thiouracil cross-linking mass spectrometry (TUX-MS). TUX-MS relies on incorporation of a zero-distance cross-linker into the viral RNA during infection. Proteins bound to viral RNA are cross-linked prior to cell lysis, purified, and identified using mass spectrometry. Using the TUX-MS method, an unbiased screen for poliovirus (PV) host factors was conducted. All host and viral proteins that are known to interact with the poliovirus RNA were identified. In addition, TUX-MS identified an additional 66 host proteins that have not been previously described in poliovirus amplification. From these candidates, eight were selected and validated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of two of these uncharacterized host factors results in either a decrease in copy number of positive-stranded RNA or a decrease in PV translation. These data demonstrate that TUX-MS is a robust, unbiased method to identify previously unknown host cell factors that influence virus growth. This method is broadly applicable to a range of RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, alphaviruses, picornaviruses, bunyaviruses, and coronaviruses.","Lenarcic, Erik M; Landry, Dori M; Greco, Todd M; Cristea, Ileana M; Thompson, Sunnie R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00950-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740976/,147
127644,Drugs of Abuse: How Clinical Pharmacology Brings Clarity to the Shadows.,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND Radiotherapy is often used as an adjuvant therapy in breast cancer following surgical resection of the primary malignant tumor. It has multiple respiratory side effects, but acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rare complication. We describe here the case of a woman with breast cancer who developed ARDS 1 week after her final radiotherapy session. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old female with breast cancer presented 1 week after her final session of radiotherapy. She had developed a sudden onset of hypotension unresponsive to fluids, oxygen desaturation unresponsive to high flow oxygen, and new bilateral infiltrates had appeared on chest x-ray (CXR) predominant in the left upper lobe, which was interestingly the main area affected by the radiotherapy beams. A diagnosis of atypical ARDS secondary to radiotherapy was established. She was intubated and a low tidal volume/high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy was utilized to manage her condition. After 48 hours, the infiltrates diminished remarkably, and she was extubated the following day. On discharge, she had a completely normal CXR; a computed tomography (CT) chest performed 1 month later showed complete resolution of the alveolar opacities. CONCLUSIONS ARDS remains an extremely rare complication of thoracic radiotherapy. However, physicians must be wary of its development in order to diagnose it quickly and treat accordingly.","Alhaddad, Juliano B; Bleibel, Jerar Z; Hoteit, Mayssaa; Bou Harb, Souad; Haddad, Youssef B",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.919477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222723/,147

128021,"Virus and Immune-Mediated Encephalitides: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention.",2015,"OBJECTIVE To outline changes made to a neurology residency program in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States. New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education. Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing. We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents. RESULTS Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum. CONCLUSION It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis. The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork. We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.","Agarwal, Shashank; Sabadia, Sakinah; Abou-Fayssal, Nada; Kurzweil, Arielle; Balcer, Laura J; Galetta, Steven L",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385187/,147

METHODS A systematic review querying four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane) was performed. Meta-analysis of available data was performed to determine the overall prevalence and odds ratio (OR) of HL, and compare mean differences in frequency-specific hearing thresholds between patients with SLE and control. Additionally, meta-analysis of proportions allowed for comparison of disease features present in patients with SLE with and without sensorineural HL. RESULTS This review included 17 studies reporting on 1326 patients (635 with SLE and 691 control). The pooled prevalence of HL in patients with SLE was 27%. In comparison to control, patients with SLE had a significantly higher odds of HL (OR 14.6, 95% CI: 8.5 to 25.0). Mean air-conduction hearing thresholds in patients with SLE were significantly elevated relative to control at 125 and 250 Hz. Mean bone-conduction hearing thresholds were significantly elevated in patients with SLE across all measured frequencies except at 3000 and 6000 Hz compared to control. Disease features did not significantly differ between patients with SLE with and without HL. CONCLUSION Compared to age-matched control, patients with SLE have increased odds of HL, which primarily manifests at low frequencies. Therefore, this patient population requires greater audiologic attention.","Yuen, Erick; Fried, Jacob; Nguyen, Shaun A; Rizk, Habib G; Ward, Celine; Meyer, Ted A",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/0961203321997919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645314/,147

The purpose of this review was to synthesize the results from studies examining the prospective association of ADHD diagnosis in childhood and later education, earnings and employment, compared to children without an ADHD diagnosis. A review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (ID = CRD42019131634). The findings were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. The systematic review is based on a structured and preplanned analysis of original prospective longitudinal studies. A total of 2505 potential records were identified, two through backward search. Six papers met the inclusion criteria. One paper was assessed as good, four as fair and one as poor quality. The studies indicated that ADHD diagnosis affected the nature of the individual's attachment to the labour market across different labour market attachment outcomes. Adults with persisting symptoms, had significantly more problems at work. Even if ADHD symptoms desist in adulthood, the negative impact of earlier ADHD symptoms can still be seen on occupational outcomes. Significantly fewer probands had a Bachelor's degree compared to controls. Based on one good quality study and four fair quality studies, it is indicated that patients with childhood diagnosed ADHD, generally experience employment of lower quality compared with peers, in relation to income, education and occupational attainment. The overall level of evidence is rated as poor.","Christiansen, Marie Sturesson; Labriola, Merete; Kirkeskov, Lilli; Lund, Thomas",Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00386-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162422/,147

129709,Comparison of wavelet and correlation indices of cerebral autoregulation in a pediatric swine model of cardiac arrest.,2020-04-03,"The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) faces substantial challenges with managing outbreaks of serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV2s) in 2021. A full five years after the globally coordinated removal of serotype 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2) from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) for use in national immunization programs, cVDPV2s did not die out. Since OPV2 cessation, responses to outbreaks caused by cVDPV2s mainly used serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) from a stockpile. A novel vaccine developed from a genetically stabilized OPV2 strain (nOPV2) promises to potentially facilitate outbreak response with lower prospective risks, although its availability and properties in the field remain uncertain. Using an established global poliovirus transmission model and building on a related analysis that characterized the impacts of disruptions in GPEI activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore the implications of trade-offs associated with delaying outbreak response to avoid using mOPV2 by waiting for nOPV2 availability (or equivalently, delayed responses waiting for national validation of meeting the criteria for nOPV2 initial use). Consistent with prior modeling, responding as quickly as possible with available mOPV2 promises to reduce the expected burden of disease in the outbreak population and to reduce the chances for the outbreak virus to spread to other areas. Delaying cVDPV2 outbreak response (e.g., modeled as no response January-June 2021) to wait for nOPV2 can considerably increase the total expected cases (e.g., by as many as 1,300 cVDPV2 cases in the African region during 2021-2023) and increases the likelihood of triggering the need to restart widescale preventive use of an OPV2-containing vaccine in national immunization programs that use OPV. Countries should respond to any cVDPV2 outbreaks quickly with rounds that achieve high coverage using any available OPV2, and plan to use nOPV2, if needed, once it becomes widely available based on evidence that it is as effective but safer in populations than mOPV2.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Wassilak, Steven G F; Cochi, Stephen L; Thompson, Kimberly M",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994237/,147

It is imperative for hospitals to be supportive of the Black community and acknowledge themselves as safe spaces, run by clinicians and staff who care about social justice issues that impact the health of the Black community; without the expression of support, Black patients may perceive hospitals as uncaring and unsafe, potentially delaying or avoiding treatment, which can result in serious complications and death for those with COVID-19. Objective To explore how hospitals showed public-facing support for the Black community as measured through tweets about social equity or the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Design, Setting, and Participants Using a retrospective longitudinal cohort study design, tweets from the top 100 ranked hospitals were collected, starting with the most recent over a 10-year span, from May 3, 2009, to June 26, 2020. The date of the George Floyd killing, May 25, 2020, was investigated as a point of interest. Data were analyzed from June 11 to December 4, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Tweets were manually identified based on 4 categories: BLM, associated with the BLM movement; Black support, expressed support for Black population within the hospital's community; Black health, pertained to health concerns specific to and the creation of health care for the Black community; or social justice, associated with general social justice terms that were too general to label as Black. If a tweet did not contain any hashtags from these categories, it remained unlabeled. Results A total of 281 850 tweets from 90 unique social media accounts were collected. Each handle returned at least 1279 tweets, with 85 handles (94.4%) returning at least 3000 tweets. Tweet publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2020. A total of 274 tweets (0.097%) from 67 handles (74.4%) used a hashtag to support the BLM movement. Among the tweets labeled BLM, the first tweet was published in 2018 and only 4 tweets (1.5%) predated the killing of George Floyd. A similar trend of low signal observed was detected for the other categories (Black support: 244 tweets [0.086%] from 42 handles [46.7%] starting in 2013; Black health: 28 tweets [0.0099%] from 15 handles [16.7%] starting in 2018; social justice: 40 tweets [0.014%] from 21 handles [23.3%] starting in 2015). Conclusions and Relevance These findings reflect the low signal of tweets regarding the Black community and social justice in a generalized way across approximately 10 years of tweets for all the hospital handles within the data set. From 2009 to 2020, hospitals rarely engaged in issues pertaining to the Black community and if so, only within the last half of this time period. These later entrances into these discussions indicate that these discussions are relatively recent.","Hswen, Yulin; Thorpe Huerta, Danyellé; Le-Compte, Circe; Hawkins, Jared B; Brownstein, John S",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.26714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652448/,147

Successful control of ventilator-associated pneumonia can save hospitalisation cost, and is possible by using a multidisciplinary clinical and administrative approach. The ventilator-associated pneumonia rate should be expressed as the number of ventilator-associated pneumonia days per 1000 ventilator days to take into account the device-utilisation duration for meaningful comparison. Various strategies address the issue, including general infection control measures, body positioning, intubation and mechanical ventilation, oral and gastro-intestinal tract, endotracheal tube, airway pressure, cuff pressure, selective digestive and/or oropharyngeal decontamination, and probiotic or early antibiotic treatment, as well as overall administration at a policy level. The rationale and controversy of these approaches are discussed in this article. The authors suggest that all units treating mechanically ventilated patients should have a ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention protocol in place, and ventilator-associated pneumonia should be seriously considered as a key performance indicator in local intensive care units.","Lau, Arthur C W; So, H M; Tang, S L; Yeung, Alwin; Lam, S M; Yan, W W",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj144367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25593193/,147
129912,Recent progress in the field of artificial organs.,2019,"Limits on perceptual capacity result in various phenomena of inattentional blindness. Here we propose a neurophysiological account attributing these perceptual capacity limits directly to limits on cerebral cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that overall cerebral energy supply remains constant, irrespective of mental task demand, and therefore an attention mechanism is required to regulate cellular metabolism levels in line with task demands. Increased perceptual load in a task (imposing a greater demand on neural computations) should thus result in increased metabolism underlying attended processing, and reduced metabolism mediating unattended processing. We tested this prediction measuring oxidation states of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO), an intracellular marker of cellular metabolism. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record oxCCO levels from human visual cortex while participants (both sexes) performed a rapid sequential visual search task under either high perceptual load (complex feature-conjunction search) or low load (feature pop-out search). A task-irrelevant, peripheral checkerboard was presented on a random half of trials. Our findings showed that oxCCO levels in visual cortex regions responsive to the attended-task stimuli were increased in high versus low perceptual load, while oxCCO levels related to unattended processing were significantly reduced. A negative temporal correlation of these load effects further supported our metabolism trade-off account. These results demonstrate an attentional compensation mechanism that regulates cellular metabolism levels according to processing demands. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for the widely-held stipulation that overall cerebral metabolism levels remain constant irrespective of mental task demand and establish a neurophysiological account for capacity limits in perception.Significance StatementWe investigated whether capacity limits in perception can be explained by the effects of attention on the allocation of limited cellular metabolic energy for perceptual processing. We measured the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase, an intracellular measure of metabolism, in human visual cortex during task performance. The results showed increased levels of cellular metabolism associated with attended processing and reduced levels of metabolism underlying unattended processing when the task was more demanding. A temporal correlation between these effects supported an attention-directed metabolism trade-off. These findings support an account for inattentional blindness grounded in cellular biochemistry. They also provide novel evidence for the claim that cerebral processing is limited by a constant energy supply, which thus requires attentional regulation.","Bruckmaier, Merit; Tachtsidis, Ilias; Phan, Phong; Lavie, Nilli",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2368-19.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747442/,147
130231,Elaboration of a semi-automated algorithm for brain arteriovenous malformation segmentation: initial results.,2015,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review considers the potential and demonstrated impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the sexually transmissible infection (STI)/HIV transmission. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

DESIGN Prospective, experimental study. SETTING Veterinary teaching hospital. ANIMALS Eight adult cats (3.2-5.5 kg). INTERVENTIONS During isoflurane anesthesia, OBP cuffs were placed on the thoracic limb and on the base of the tail while invasive blood pressure (IBP) was recorded from a dorsal pedal artery. End-tidal isoflurane concentrations, with or without intravenous dopamine (n = 8), norepinephrine (n = 1), or phenylephrine (n = 1) were adjusted to change invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 40 to 100 mm Hg. Data were analyzed by the Bland-Altman method and 4-quadrant plots. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mean biases and limits of agreement (LOA: ± 1.96 SD) (mm Hg) recorded between the petMAPclassic (thoracic limb) and IBP for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and MAP were 4.2 ± 28.5, -6.1 ± 13.2, and -1.9 ± 14.6, respectively; mean biases and LOA (mm Hg) recorded with the tail cuff were 7.2 ± 31.3 (SAP), -6.1 ± 11.6 (DAP), and -1.1 ± 11.7 (MAP). Mean biases and LOA (mm Hg) between petMAPgraphic (thoracic limb) and IBP were 7.7 ± 27.0 (SAP), -4.3 ± 11.5 (DAP), 0.2 ± 13.0 (MAP); values recorded with the tail cuff were 10.9 ± 29.6 (SAP), -4.4 ± 11.7 (DAP), and -0.1 ± 12.1 (MAP). Concordance rates after excluding arterial pressure changes ≤ 5 mm Hg was ≥ 93% for both devices.

130719,Hypomethylating Agent Azacitidine Is Effective in Treating Brain Metastasis Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Through Regulation of DNA Methylation of Keratin 18 Gene.,2020-05-11,"Fish-mint (Houttuynia cordataThunb.), belonging to family Saururaceae, has long been used as food and traditional herbal medicine. The present study was framed to assess the changes occurring in the essential-oil composition of H. cordata during annual growth and to evaluate allelopathic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiacetylcholinesterase activities. The essential-oil content ranged from 0.06 - 0.14% and 0.08 - 0.16% in aerial parts and underground stem, respectively. The essential oils were analysed by GC-FID, GC/MS, and NMR (1 H and 13 C). Major constituents of aerial-parts oil was 2-undecanone (19.4 - 56.3%), myrcene (2.6 - 44.3%), ethyl decanoate (0.0 - 10.6%), ethyl dodecanoate (1.1 - 8.6%), 2-tridecanone (0.5 - 8.3%), and decanal (1.1 - 6.9%). However, major constituents of underground-stem oil were 2-undecanone (29.5 - 42.3%), myrcene (14.4 - 20.8%), sabinene (6.0 - 11.1%), 2-tridecanone (1.8 - 10.5%), β-pinene (5.3 - 10.0%), and ethyl dodecanoate (0.8 - 7.3%). Cluster analysis revealed that essential-oil composition varied substantially due to the plant parts and season of collection. The oils exhibited significant allelopathic (inhibition: 77.8 - 88.8%; LD50 : 2.45 - 3.05 μl/plate), antibacterial (MIC: 0.52 - 2.08 μl/ml; MBC: bacteriostatic) and antifungal (MIC: 2.08 - 33.33 μl/ml; MFC: 4.16 - 33.33 μl/ml) activities. The results indicate that the essential oil from H. cordata has a significant potential to allow future exploration and exploitation as a natural antimicrobial and allelopathic agent.","Verma, Ram S; Joshi, Neeta; Padalia, Rajendra C; Singh, Ved R; Goswami, Prakash; Kumar, Ajay; Iqbal, Hina; Verma, Rajesh K; Chanda, Debabrata; Chauhan, Amit; Saikia, Dharmendra",Chemistry & biodiversity,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.201700189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28636756/,147

Herein, we extend the mHealth approach to patients with recent-onset AF at the emergency department (ED). In the proposed TeleWAS-AF approach, on-demand heart rate and rhythm monitoring are used to support a wait-and-see strategy at the ED. All stable patients who present to the ED with recent-onset symptomatic AF and who are able to use mHealth solutions for heart rate and rhythm monitoring are eligible for this approach. Patients will receive both education on AF and instructions on the use of the mHealth technology before discharge from the ED. A case coordinator will subsequently check whether patients are able to activate the mHealth solution and to perform heart rate and rhythm measurements. Forty hours after AF onset, the first assessment teleconsultation with the physician will take place, determining the need for delayed cardioversion. After maximal 7 days of remote monitoring, a second assessment teleconsultation may occur, in which the rhythm can be reassessed and further treatment strategy can be discussed with the patients. This on-demand mHealth prescription increases patient involvement in the care process and treatment decision-making by encouraging self-management, while avoiding excess data-load requiring work-intensive and expensive data management. Implementation of the TeleWAS-AF approach may facilitate the management of AF in the ED and reduce the burden on the ED system, which enhances the capacity for health care utilization.","Pluymaekers, Nikki A H A; van der Velden, Rachel M J; Hermans, Astrid N L; Gawalko, Monika; Buskes, Saskia; Keijenberg, Joyce J H M W; Vorstermans, Bianca; Crijns, Harry J G M; Hendriks, Jeroen M; Linz, Dominik",Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735889/,147
130943,Speaking of pandemics...,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is associated with reduced patient and graft survival. This study examined the clinical and selected genetic factors associated with NODAT among renal-transplanted Malaysian patients. METHODS This study included 168 non-diabetic patients (58% males, 69% of Chinese ethnicity) who received renal transplantation between 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2014, and were followed up in two major renal transplant centres in Malaysia. Fasting blood glucose levels were used to diagnose NODAT in patients who received renal transplantation within 1 year. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely; rs1494558 (interleukin-7 receptor, IL-7R) and rs2232365 (mannose-binding leptin-2, MBL2) were selected and genotyped using Sequenom MassArray platform. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine the risk of developing NODAT according to the different demographics and clinical covariates, utilizing four time-points (one-month, three-months, six-months, one-year) post-transplant. RESULTS Seventeen per cent of patients (n = 29, 55% males, 69% Chinese) were found to have developed NODAT within one-year of renal transplantation based on their fasting blood glucose levels. NODAT patients had renal transplantation at an older age compared to non-NODAT (39.3 ± 13.4 vs 33.9 ± 11.8 years, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, renal-transplanted patients who received a higher daily dose of cyclosporine (mg) were associated with increased risk of NODAT (Hazard ratio (HR) =1.01 per mg increase in dose, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.01, p = 0.002). Other demographic (gender, ethnicities, age at transplant) and clinical factors (primary kidney disease, type of donor, place of transplant, type of calcineurin inhibitors, duration of dialysis pre-transplant, BMI, creatinine levels, and daily doses of tacrolimus and prednisolone) were not found to be significantly associated with risk of NODAT. GA genotype of rs1494558 (HR = 3.15 95% CI 1.26, 7.86) and AG genotype of rs2232365 (HR = 2.57 95% CI 1.07, 6.18) were associated with increased risk of NODAT as compared to AA genotypes. CONCLUSION The daily dose of cyclosporine and SNPs of IL-7R (rs1494558) and MBL2 (rs2232365) genes are significantly associated with the development of NODAT in the Malaysian renal transplant population.","Guad, Rhanye Mac; Taylor-Robinson, Andrew W; Wu, Yuan Seng; Gan, Siew Hua; Zaharan, Nur Lisa; Basu, Roma Choudhury; Liew, Constance Sat Lin; Wan Md Adnan, Wan Ahmad Hafiz",BMC nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-02052-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894076/,147

Here, we investigated the presence of multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which expressed IFNγ, IL10 and TNF, or its combinations during dengue infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from outpatients with dengue (mild dengue forms) and hospitalized patients (or patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue) were cultured in the presence of envelope (ENV) or NS3 peptide libraries of DENV during critical (hospitalization period) and convalescence phases. The production of IFNγ, IL10 and TNF by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Our data shows that patients with mild dengue, when compared to patients with dengue with warning signs and severe dengue, presented higher frequencies of multifunctional T cells like NS3-specific IFNγ/IL10-producing CD4+ T cells in critical phase and NS3- and ENV-specific CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ/IL10. In addition, NS3-specific CD8+ T cells producing high levels of IFNγ/TNF and IFNγ/TNF/IL10 were also observed in mild dengue group. We observed that multifunctional T cells produced higher levels of cytokines as measured by intracellular content when compared to single producer T cells. Importantly, multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ, TNF and IL10 simultaneously displayed positive correlation with platelet levels suggesting a protective role of this population. The presence of IL10+ Th1 and IL10+ Tc1 multifunctional cells was associated with mild dengue presentation suggesting that these cells play a role in clinical evolution of dengue infection.","Gonçalves Pereira, Marcela Helena; Figueiredo, Maria Marta; Queiroz, Camila Pereira; Magalhães, Télcia Vasconcelos Barros; Mafra, Adriana; Diniz, Lilian Martins Oliveira; da Costa, Último Libânio; Gollob, Kenneth J; do Valle Antonelli, Lis Ribeiro; da Costa Santiago, Helton",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32128816/,147

We also demonstrate various complex pattern geometries, such as wave, square, nut, zigzag, and elliptical nanostructures, on diverse substrates via T-nTP. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to obtain a high-density crossbar metal-insulator-metal memristive array using a combined method of T-nTP and directed self-assembly. We expect that the state-of-the-art T-nTP process presented here combined with other emerging patterning techniques will be especially useful for the large-area nanofabrication of various devices.","Park, Tae Wan; Byun, Myunghwan; Jung, Hyunsung; Lee, Gyu Rac; Park, Jae Hong; Jang, Hyun-Ik; Lee, Jung Woo; Kwon, Se Hun; Hong, Seungbum; Lee, Jong-Heun; Jung, Yeon Sik; Kim, Kwang Ho; Park, Woon Ik",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb6462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832691/,147

COVID-19 transmission is faster than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pneumonia outbreak in 2002. This is mainly attributed to the different pathways of virus-infected host cells, coupled with patients' atypical clinical characteristics.

METHODS The pooled analysis of the Interventional Management of Stroke III (IMS III) and Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) trials included participants with an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of ≥20 before intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment (IMS III) or randomization (MR CLEAN) who were treated with intravenous tPA ≤3 hours of stroke onset. Our hypothesis was that participants with severe stroke randomized to endovascular therapy after intravenous tPA would have improved 90-day outcome (distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores), when compared with those who received intravenous tPA alone. RESULTS Among 342 participants in the pooled analysis (194 from IMS III and 148 from MR CLEAN), an ordinal logistic regression model showed that the endovascular group had superior 90-day outcome compared with the intravenous tPA group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.66). In the logistic regression model of the dichotomous outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2, or functional independence), the endovascular group had superior outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.56). Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, ≤2) at 90 days was 25% in the endovascular group when compared with 14% in the intravenous tPA group.

Elsewhere, the EGJ is defined by the upper end of the gastric folds (GF) and PV are considered difficult to detect. This study evaluated the detection rate of PV in Western patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) using white light imaging (WLI) and narrow band imaging (NBI), and quantified any discordance between Western and Japanese criteria for the EGJ. METHODS In 25 BE patients, the presence and location of PV and GF were determined and biopsies were obtained. High-quality images of the EGJ were collected under different conditions (insufflations-desufflation, WLI-NBI, forward-retroflex approach), resulting in eight different images per patient. The presence of PV on each still image was assessed by a panel of six Western and Japanese endoscopists with expertise in BE. RESULTS PV were observed in ≥ 1 images by a majority of the panel (≥ 4 raters) in 100 % of patients during insufflation versus 60 % during desufflation (p < 0.001). WLI and NBI detected PV in 100 and 92 %, respectively (p = 0.50). Interobserver agreement of the panel was 'moderate' (κ = 0.51). During endoscopy PV were located a median of 1 cm distal of the GF in 15 patients (63 %), with intestinal metaplasia (IM) in this discordant zone, in 27 % of patients. CONCLUSIONS PV are visible in most Western BE patients and are best inspected during insufflation. The location of the GF and PV differed in a substantial group of patients, partially with IM in this discordant zone.","Schölvinck, Dirk W; Goto, Osamu; Seldenrijk, Cornelis A; Bisschops, Raf; Horii, Joichiro; Ochiai, Yasutoshi; Schoon, Erik J; Schenk, Boudewijn E; Uraoka, Toshio; van Oijen, Martijn G H; Bergman, Jacques J G H M; Yahagi, Naohisa; Weusten, Bas L A M",Journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-015-1136-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26538077/,147
132719,Regional cerebral blood flow as predictor of response to occipital nerve block in cluster headache.,2021-08-12,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Pelvic reconstructive surgeons in the fields of urology, gynecology and urogynecology have continually adapted new techniques in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair in order to improve both anatomic and subjective outcomes. In the last 5 years, robotic surgery has gained a strong foothold in urologic oncology, gynecologic oncology, cardiothoracic surgery and now in female pelvic medicine. Robotic surgery has made its way into the armamentarium of POP treatment and has allowed pelvic surgeons to adapt the 'gold standard' technique of abdominal sacrocolpopexy to a minimally invasive approach with improved intraoperative morbidity and decreased convalescence. This review article aims to discuss the techniques of robotic prolapse repair as well as morbidity, cost and clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS The adaptation of minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of POP initially began with laparoscopy, something only those surgeons with extensive and advanced laparoscopic skills are able to accomplish. Access to robotic technology makes conversion from open or laparoscopic to robotic surgery much more feasible for most pelvic floor surgeons. There are currently no published randomized, controlled trials comparing robotic with open or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, however, there are several publications reporting both retrospective and prospective series of women undergoing robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy. SUMMARY Robotic-assisted pelvic floor surgery has become an important component of the pelvic surgeon's armamentarium in the treatment of symptomatic POP. Those pelvic surgeons without significant expertise in laparoscopy required for sacral dissection and intracorporeal suturing can readily learn the necessary techniques required for robotic surgery.","Rosenblum, Nirit",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e328354809c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647648/,147
132862,Uptake of Clinical Prognostic Tools in COPD Exacerbations Requiring Hospitalisation.,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS More secure endoscopic closure techniques for iatrogenic gastric defects are required for safe endoscopic surgery. We developed a novel endoscopic suturing method, endoscopic hand suturing (EHS), of gastric mucosal defects and determined its feasibility and efficacy ex vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS We created 24 mucosal defects (each 2 cm in diameter) by endoscopic submucosal dissection. The following three techniques were tested: EHS with a 3 - 0 barbed suture that was grasped with biopsy forceps (n = 6) or a prototype through-the-scope needle holder (n = 6) by endoscopy, looping with endoloops (n = 6) by endoscopy, and clipping with hemoclips (n = 6) by hand. The mucosal edges were attached to each other at three points. The closure strength was compared among the three groups, and the procedural duration was compared between the EHS and looping groups. RESULTS All 12 lesions were completely closed by EHS. The median strength of the closure, measured with a spring scale, was significantly greater in the EHS group (0.74 kg) than in the looping group (0.33 kg, P = 0.0012) or clipping group (0.07 kg, P = 0.0009). The median procedural duration did not significantly differ between the EHS and looping groups (19.7 vs. 19.8 minutes, P = 1.0000). The use of the needle holder significantly reduced the procedural duration compared with the biopsy forceps. CONCLUSION Mucosal defects can be firmly closed with EHS, which may be helpful for establishing a safer and more secure endoscopic surgery.","Goto, Osamu; Sasaki, Motoki; Ishii, Hiroyuki; Horii, Joichiro; Uraoka, Toshio; Takeuchi, Hiroya; Kitagawa, Yuko; Yahagi, Naohisa",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1377180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26135255/,147
132931,"A 9-Year Experience of Aspergillus Infections from Isfahan, Iran.",2020,"Aim The aim of this study was to measure gender differences among COPD patients' quality of care (QOC) before and after two educational interventions in Southern Italy. Methods In this prospective cohort study, COPD patients were identified from primary care electronic medical records (EMRs). Twelve process indicators concerning diagnosis, preventative measures and therapeutic processes were developed as a measure of QOC. Educational interventions consisted of clinical seminars and audits on COPD QOC at baseline, and at 12 and 24 months. QOC indicators were stratified by gender: odds ratios (ORs) (males as reference group) of having a good QOC indicator were calculated at baseline, 12 and 24 months, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using hierarchical generalised linear models. Results Of 46 326 people registered in the EMRs, 1463 COPD patients (3.1%) were identified, of which 37% were women. QOC indicators reflecting best practice 24 months after the educational programme were generally not different to baseline, often favouring men. On the other hand, the composite global QOC indicator suggested that while a good overall QOC at baseline was significantly higher in men than women (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57-0.96), it became nonsignificant at 24 months (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.72-1.29). Conclusions Specific QOC indicators among COPD patients often favoured men. However, several gender disparities seen at baseline disappeared at 24 months, suggesting that even general educational interventions which do not target gender can improve the gender disparity in QOC.","Isgrò, Valentina; Sultana, Janet; Fontana, Andrea; Ientile, Valentina; Alecci, Umberto; Scoglio, Riccardo; Magliozzo, Francesco; Scondotto, Salvatore; Caramori, Gaetano; Cazzola, Mario; Trifirò, Gianluca",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00279-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832528/,147
132989,Current Status of Needles in the Optimization of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Procedures.,2020-07-08,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted inguinal hernia repair (IHR) can be performed using one port plus two stab wounds. We herein present our experience with laparoscopic IHR conducted using a single conventional port and a single working instrument. METHODS The records patients who underwent single conventional port intracorporeal IHR during November 2013-December 2018 were evaluated. The main outcome measurements were patient's demographic characteristics, hernia side, presence of incarceration, operative time, and complications. RESULTS A total of 132 inguinal hernias (52 right, 40 left, and 20 bilateral) were repaired in 112 patients (76 boys, 36 girls). The mean ages of the patients were 69.8 ± 53.4 months (3 months to 17 years). In six patients, contralateral processus vaginalis was found to be patent during operation. Incarcerated inguinal hernia was present in two patients. Mean operative time was 17.9 ± 3.8 min (9-30 min) in unilateral hernias and 28.9 ± 6.5 min (24-45 min) in bilateral hernias. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were encountered. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 8.8 ± 5.0 h (4-36 h). Postoperative follow-up was 16.5 ± 5.1 months (6-24 months). No recurrent inguinal hernias were detected during follow-up. CONCLUSION Single conventional port intracorporeal IHR obviates additional stab wounds. Additionally, present technique eliminates the risk of skin puckering, subcutaneous granuloma, infection, nerve, and muscle damage development induced by the subcutaneously placed knot in laparoscopy-assisted IHR. Single conventional port intracorporeal IHR in children is a feasible and safe operative technique with low complication rates.","Karakuş, O Z; Ulusoy, O; Ateş, O; Hakgüder, G; Olguner, M; Akgür, F M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02165-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152805/,147

The palliative telehealth program offered real-time access to a palliative care specialist able to provide symptom management, goals-of-care discussions, and Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment completion. The pilot shows promising outcomes including code status change, Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment form completion, and reduced hospitalizations supporting the benefit of comprehensive goals-of-care discussions for frail older adults living in a nursing home. As health care moves into the digital age, telemedicine plays a large role in the delivery of essential patient care. Provision of palliative specialists by telehealth allows the opportunity to address the unmet needs of this frail population.","Baxter, Kelly E; Kochar, Sandeep; Williams, Cheryl; Blackman, Carolyn; Himmelvo, Jane",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225341/,147

133409,Implementation of human papillomavirus circulating tumor DNA to identify recurrence during treatment de-escalation.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND A variety of permanent and absorbable tacks are available for mesh fixation during laparoscopic hernia repairs. Although manufacturers recommend deploying tacks perpendicular to the tissue, achieving this can sometimes be challenging. This study aimed to analyze comparatively the effects of angled deployment among commonly used tacks. METHODS A piece of composite mesh was fixed to the peritoneal surface of a pig with a single tack fired at either a perpendicular (90°) or acute (30°) angle. A lap-shear test was performed to determine fixation strength. Two permanent tacks (a titanium spiral tack: Protack [PT]; and a hollow screw fastener: PermaFix [PF]) and three absorbable tackers (a solid screw: Absorbatack [AT]; a hollow screw fastener: SorbaFix [SF]; and a strap: SecurStrap [SS]) were challenged. A total of 16 samples were performed for each device at each angle. A nonabsorbable transfascial suture was used as a control condition. RESULTS Transabdominal sutures had the maximum acute tensile strength (ATS) (29.9 ± 5.5 N). Protack at both 90° and 30° performed significantly better than absorbable tacks (p < 0.01). No significant difference was found among absorbable tacks at 90°. When the same construct was compared at different angles, SS and SF performance was not affected (p = 0.07 and 0.2, respectively). In contrast, PT and AT had significantly reduced fixation strength (p = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). However, PT fired at an acute angle had fixation equal to that of absorbable tacks fired perpendicularly. CONCLUSION Transabdominal sutures performed better than tacks in the acute setting. No absorbable fixation device demonstrated superior efficacy within its class. Spiral titanium tacks provided better fixation than absorbable tacks at both perpendicular and acute angles. Moreover, titanium spiral tacks deployed at 30° performed equal to or better than absorbable tacks fired perpendicularly to the tissue. It appears that spiral titanium tacks should be strongly considered for cases in which perpendicular tack deployment cannot be achieved.","Sadava, Emmanuel E; Krpata, David M; Gao, Yue; Schomisch, Steve; Rosen, Michael J; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2713-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23299138/,147

In this work, we studied the electrophysiologic maturation of PRPs throughout the differentiation process. Methods Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into PRPs and whole-cell recordings were performed for electrophysiologic characterization at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 along with quantitative PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of various ion channels, which shape the electrophysiologic response. Finally, to characterize the electrically induced calcium currents, we employed calcium imaging (rhod4) to visualize intracellular calcium dynamics in response to electrical activation. Results Our results revealed an early and steady presence (approximately 100% of responsive cells) of the delayed potassium rectifier current. In contrast, the percentage of cells exhibiting voltage-gated sodium currents increased with maturation (from 0% to almost 90% of responsive cells at 90 days). Moreover, calcium imaging revealed the presence of voltage-gated calcium currents, which play a major role in vision formation. These results were further supported by quantitative PCR analysis, which revealed a significant and continuous (3- to 50-fold) increase in the expression of various voltage-gated channels concomitantly with the increase in the expression of the photoreceptor marker CRX. Conclusions These results can shed light on the electrophysiologic maturation of neurons in general and PRP in particular and can form the basis for devising and optimizing cell replacement-based vision restoration strategies.","Schick, Revital; Farah, Nairouz; Markus, Amos; Korngreen, Alon; Mandel, Yossi",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.11.44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991686/,147

This study tested surgery's ability to improve measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and identified clinical, renal, and systemic vascular predictors of such improvement. METHODS Twenty-five nondiabetic subjects with severe obesity were studied before and 1 year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, evaluating mGFR and renal plasma flow, basal renal resistive index (RI) and dynamic renal RI, renal visceral fat, and systemic vascular parameters, including flow-mediated dilation, aortic pulse wave velocity, and carotid intima media thickness and stiffness. RESULTS After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, BMI decreased by 31%. At follow-up, body surface area (BSA)-adjusted mGFR increased (from 86.9 ± 15.2 to 109.0 ± 18.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 , P < 0.001), whereas the absolute mGFR did not change. Renal plasma flow did not vary. RI decreased; flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness, and carotid stiffness improved. mGFR changes after surgery (ΔmGFR/BSA) were associated with younger age and lower fasting glucose. Among vascular variables, an improved ΔmGFR/BSA was associated with smaller brachial artery diameter, lower intima media thickness, and lower RI; this latter association remained after adjusting for covariates. No measure of adiposity was associated with ΔmGFR. CONCLUSIONS In subjects with obesity and normal renal function, bariatric surgery improves mGFR/BSA (although absolute mGFR is unchanged) and renal and systemic vascular function. Lower renal intravascular resistance can predict these improvements, maximizing them in relatively young individuals.","Solini, Anna; Seghieri, Marta; Santini, Eleonora; Giannini, Livia; Biancalana, Edoardo; Taddei, Stefano; Volterrani, Duccio; Bruno, Rosa Maria",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30516353/,147

In this study, a thermophilic strain capable of degrading azo dye was isolated from the soil near a textile dye manufacturing factory. Based on its morphological, physiological and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strain was identified as Anoxybacillus sp. PDR2. The decolorization ratios of 100-600 mg/L Direct Black G (DBG) by strain PDR2 reached 82.12-98.39% within 48 h of dyes. Genome analysis revealed that strain PDR2 contains a circular chromosome of 3791144 bp with a G + C content of 42.48%. The genetic basis of azo dye degradation by strain PDR2 and its capacity to adapt to harsh environments, were further elucidated through bioinformatics analysis. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR technology confirmed that NAD(P)H-flavin reductase, 2Fe-2S ferredoxin and NAD(P)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase genes expressed by strain PDR2, were the key genes involved in DBG degradation. The combination of genome and transcriptome analysis was utilized to explore the key genes of strain PDR2 involved in azo dye biodegradation, with these findings providing a valuable theoretical basis for the practical treatment of azo dye wastewater.","Chen, Guotao; An, Xuejiao; Feng, Linlin; Xia, Xiang; Zhang, Qinghua",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888598/,147

The racial distribution of Oklahoma County closely mirrors that of the United States. OBJECTIVE To evaluate VTE incidence and mortality, including demographic and racial subgroups. DESIGN Population-based prospective study. SETTING We conducted VTE surveillance at all relevant tertiary care facilities and outpatient clinics in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma during 2012 to 2014, using both active and passive methods. Active surveillance involved reviewing all imaging reports used to diagnose VTE. Passive surveillance entailed identifying VTE events from hospital discharge data and death certificate records. MEASUREMENTS We used Poisson regression to calculate crude, age-stratified, and age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates per 1,000 population per year and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS The incidence rate of all VTE was 3.02 (2.92-3.12) for those age ≥18 years and 0.05 (0.04-0.08) for those <18 years. The age-adjusted incidence rates of all VTE, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism were 2.47 (95% CI: 2.39-2.55), 1.47 (1.41-1.54), and 0.99 (0.93-1.04), respectively. The age-adjusted VTE incidence and the 30-day mortality rates, respectively, were 0.63 and 0.121 for Asians/Pacific Islanders, 3.25 and 0.355 for blacks, 0.67 and 0.111 for Hispanics, 1.25 and 0.195 for Native Americans, and 2.71 and 0.396 for whites.

Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of patients who suffer from cerebral infarction after surgery for lung cancer. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent resection of at least a single lobe for lung cancer at our institution between January 2008 and October 2013. We compared the patients who presented with cerebral infarction with those patients who did not within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS A total of 562 patients underwent surgery, with five males and one female subsequently experiencing cerebral infarction. Five patients underwent left upper lobectomy and one underwent left lower lobectomy. Patient age, sex, body mass index, smoking index, and operative time were not significantly different between the six patients with postoperative cerebral infarction and the other 556 patients; only the type of operative procedure was significantly different (p < 0.001). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed thrombosis in the stump of the left superior pulmonary vein in patients with postoperative cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral infarction occurs at a high frequency in patients who undergo left upper lobectomy for lung cancer.

134349,Initial Alpha-Fetoprotein Response Predicts Prognosis in Hepatitis B-related Solitary HCC Patients After Radiofrequency Ablation.,2018,"BACKGROUND Growing environmental concern sparked renewed interest in the sustainable production of (bio)materials that can replace oil-derived goods. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are isotactic polymers that play a critical role in the central metabolism of producer bacteria, as they act as dynamic reservoirs of carbon and reducing equivalents. PHAs continue to attract industrial attention as a starting point towards renewable, biodegradable, biocompatible, and versatile thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. Pseudomonas species have been known for long as efficient biopolymer producers, especially for medium-chain-length PHAs. PURPOSE AND SCOPE The surge of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering approaches in recent years now offers the possibility of exploiting the untapped potential of Pseudomonas-based cell factories for the production of tailored PHAs. In this article, we provide an overview of the metabolic and regulatory circuits that rule PHA accumulation in P. putida, and we discuss approaches leading to the biosynthesis of novel polymers (e.g., PHAs including non-biological chemical elements in their structures). CONCLUSION The potential of novel PHAs to disrupt existing and future market segments is closer to realization than ever before. We conclude the review by pinpointing challenges that currently hinder the wide adoption of bio-based PHAs, and we propose strategies towards programmable polymer biosynthesis from alternative substrates in engineered P. putida strains.

134483,Reply to Letter to Editor from Bansal and Colleagues.,2020-11-03,"Importance Before the widespread implementation of robotic systems to provide patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic occurs, it is important to understand the acceptability of these systems among patients and the economic consequences associated with the adoption of robotics in health care settings. Objective To assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks. Design, Setting, and Participants This study included 2 components: a national survey to examine the acceptability of using robotic systems to perform health care tasks in a hospital setting and a single-site cohort study of patient experiences and satisfaction with the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate triage and telehealth tasks in the emergency department (ED). The national survey comprised individuals living in the US who participated in a sampling-based survey via an online analytic platform. Participants completed the national survey between August 18 and August 21, 2020. The single-site cohort study included patients living in the US who presented to the ED of a large urban academic hospital providing quaternary care in Boston, Massachusetts between April and August 2020. All data were analyzed from August to October 2020. Exposures Participants in the national survey completed an online survey to measure the acceptability of using a mobile robotic system to perform health care tasks (facilitating telehealth interviews, acquiring vital signs, obtaining nasal or oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, performing phlebotomy, and turning a patient in bed) in a hospital setting in the contexts of general interaction and interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in the cohort study were exposed to a mobile robotic system, which was controlled by an ED clinician and used to facilitate a triage interview. After exposure, patients completed an assessment to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main Outcomes and Measures Acceptability of the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks in a hospital setting (national survey) and feasibility and patient satisfaction regarding the use of a mobile robotic system in the ED (cohort study). Results For the national survey, 1154 participants completed all acceptability questions, representing a participation rate of 35%. After sample matching, a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [17.0] years; 535 women [53.5%]) was included in the analysis. With regard to the usefulness of a robotic system to perform specific health care tasks, the response of ""somewhat useful"" was selected by 373 participants (37.3%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 350 participants (35.0%) for acquiring vital signs, 307 participants (30.7%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 228 participants (22.8%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 249 participants (24.9%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. The response of ""extremely useful"" was selected by 287 participants (28.7%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 413 participants (41.3%) for acquiring vital signs, 192 participants (19.2%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 159 participants (15.9%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 167 participants (16.7%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of individuals who perceived the application of robotic systems to be acceptable for completing telehealth interviews, obtaining nasal and oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, and performing phlebotomy increased. For the ED cohort study, 51 individuals were invited to participate, and 41 participants (80.4%) enrolled. One participant was unable to complete the study procedures because of a signaling malfunction in the robotic system. Forty patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [2.7] years; 29 women [72.5%]) completed the mobile robotic system-facilitated triage interview, and 37 patients (92.5%) reported that the interaction was satisfactory. A total of 33 participants (82.5%) reported that their experience of receiving an interview facilitated by a mobile robotic system was as satisfactory as receiving an in-person interview from a clinician. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, a mobile robotic system was perceived to be acceptable for use in a broad set of health care tasks among survey respondents across the US. The use of a mobile robotic system enabled the facilitation of contactless triage interviews of patients in the ED and was considered acceptable among participants. Most patients in the ED rated the quality of mobile robotic system-facilitated interaction to be equivalent to in-person interaction with a clinician.","Chai, Peter R; Dadabhoy, Farah Z; Huang, Hen-Wei; Chu, Jacqueline N; Feng, Annie; Le, Hien M; Collins, Joy; da Silva, Marco; Raibert, Marc; Hur, Chin; Boyer, Edward W; Traverso, Giovanni",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.0667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662134/,147
134584,The State of Melanoma: Emergent Challenges and Opportunities.,2021-01-07,"Complicated intra-abdominal infections such as acute appendicitis and complicated diverticulitis represent both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Both diseases, although different in many ways, are caused by the obstruction of a blind pouch leading to inflammation, abscesses, and perforation of surrounding tissues. For many decades, acute appendicitis was managed through a conventional surgical incision in the right iliac fossa. As for other diseases, there is a significant tendency to propose less invasive treatments. For many teams, laparoscopy, which leads to less postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay, and a quicker recovery, represents the standard of care for appendectomy. For selected cases, a medical approach can be proposed with satisfactory outcomes. Additionally, the management of complicated diverticulitis is also quickly moving towards less invasive procedures than the deleterious '3-phase surgery', which is Hartmann's procedure, followed by reversal protected with a stoma, and finally stoma closure. Benefiting from the evolution of antimicrobial therapy and interventional radiology, many complicated cases classified as Hinchey stage I and Hinchey stage II complicated diverticulitis are now treated medically. CT images allow the identification of patients requiring radiological drainage of localized abscesses or collections over 5 cm in size. Patients with Hinchey stage III sigmoiditis may benefit from an initial laparoscopic exploration allowing, in some cases, a conservative nonresective approach that will prevent laparotomy and stoma. Major resection leading to temporary or definitive stoma is usually indicated for stage IV complications and is required only in exceptional cases. Although a surgical intervention can be the definitive treatment for complicated intra-abdominal infections, multidisciplinary management including radiology, medical treatment, and laparoscopic surgery may limit the severe consequences of an acute surgical approach in patients suffering from complicated appendicitis and diverticulitis. Today, the ultimate goal of acutely infected abdomen management is to reduce hospital stay, disability, and numerous operations for these patients.","Mutter, D; Marescaux, J",Digestive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000347189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23797127/,147
134679,In situ expression of tumor antigens by messenger RNA-electroporated dendritic cells in lymph nodes of melanoma patients.,2009,"Morus nigra Linn. (black mulberry) is used in gastrointestinal ailments. This study demonstrates gut modulatory properties of M. nigra. The prokinetic, laxative, and antidiarrheal activities of M. nigra were assessed in mice, while isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum were used to explore insight into mechanism(s). At 30 and 70 mg/kg, the crude extract of M. nigra (Mn.Cr) exhibited atropine-sensitive prokinetic and laxative effects, similar to carbachol (CCh). While at higher doses (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg), Mn.Cr offered protection against castor oil-induced diarrhea. In rabbit jejunum, Mn.Cr and its chloroform fraction inhibited CCh-induced contractions more potently compared with high K(+) (80 mm). Conversely, petroleum fraction was more potent against high-K(+) -induced contractions. At 0.01 mg/mL, Mn.Cr caused a parallel shift in acetylcholine concentration-response curves (CRCs) followed by a non-parallel shift at 0.03 mg/mL, similar to dicyclomine. At further tested concentrations, Mn.Cr (0.1 and 0.3 mg/mL) and petroleum fraction suppressed Ca(2+) CRCs, similar to verapamil. In guinea-pig ileum, Mn.Cr, its aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions exhibited atropine-sensitive gut stimulant activity along with additional uncharacterized excitatory response in the aqueous fraction only. These results suggest that black mulberry possesses prokinetic, laxative, and antidiarrheal effects, putatively mediated through cholinomimetic, antimuscarinic, and Ca(2+) antagonist mechanisms, respectively.

134766,"Maternal serum nitrotyrosine, 8-isoprostane and total antioxidant capacity levels in pre-gestational or gestational diabetes mellitus.",2020,"OBJECTIVE The study aims to determine whether ED presentation volume or hospital occupancy had a greater impact on ED performance before and during the COVID-19 health response at a tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. METHODS Single centre time series analysis using routinely collected hospital and ED data from January 2019 to September 2020. The primary outcome was ED access block measured by Emergency Treatment Performance (ETP; i.e. percentage of patients who were discharged or transferred to a ward from ED within four hours of ED arrival time). Secondary outcomes were hospital occupancy, elective theatre cases and ambulance ramping. Multivariate time series analysis was performed using Vector Autoregression, to model effects of changes in various endogenous and correlated variables on ETP. RESULTS There was an increase in ETP, drop in ED presentations and decrease in hospital occupancy between April and June 2020. Elective surgery and hospital occupancy had significant effects up to 2 days prior on ETP, while there were no significant effects of either ED or ambulance presentations on ETP. Hospital occupancy itself increased with ED presentations after 2-4 days and decreased with elective surgery after 1 day. Shocks (a 1 standard deviation increase) in hospital occupancy had a peak impact nearly two times greater compared to ED presentations (-1.43 95%CI -1.92, -0.93 vs. -0.73 95%CI -1.21, -0.25). CONCLUSION The main determinants of the reduction of ED overcrowding and access block during the pandemic were associated with reductions in hospital occupancy and elective surgery levels, and more research is required to assess more complex associations beyond the scope of this manuscript.

135016,Identification of compound causing yellow bone discoloration following alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats.,2020-05-09,"The coronavirus spike protein (S) plays a key role in the early steps of viral infection, with the S1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S2 domain (S2', R797). Mutation of R797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell-cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2' cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2'), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2' position allowed trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2'), acting in concert with the S1-S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.","Belouzard, Sandrine; Chu, Victor C; Whittaker, Gary R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809524106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19321428/,147

135373,"Clinical Pharmacology, Toxicity, and Abuse Potential of Opioids.",2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare systems worldwide. The effect of the pandemic on emergency general surgery patients remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To reveal the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity among emergency general surgery cases. DESIGN AND SETTING Data on patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Samsun, Turkey, and had consultations at the general surgery clinic were analyzed retrospectively. METHODS Our study included comparative analysis on two groups of patients who received emergency general surgery consultations in our hospital: during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Group 2); and on the same dates one year previously (Group 1). RESULTS There were 195 patients in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). While 113 (58%) of the patients in Group 1 were women, only 58 (44%) were women in Group 2 (P = 0.013). Considering all types of diagnosis, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.261). The rates of abscess and delayed abdominal emergency diseases were higher in Group 2: one case (0.5%) versus ten cases (8%); P < 0.001. The morbidity rate was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1: three cases (1.5%) versus nine cases (7%); P = 0.016. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the number of unnecessary nonemergency admissions to the emergency department, but has not delayed patients' urgent consultations. The pandemic has led surgeons to deal with more complicated cases and greater numbers of complications.","Tarim, Ismail Alper; Derebey, Murat; Özbalci, Gökhan Selçuk; Özşay, Oğuzhan; Yüksek, Mahmut Arif; Büyükakıncak, Sercan; Bircan, Recep; Güngör, Bahadir Bülent; Başoğlu, Mahmut",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2020.0554.r1.30102020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533872/,147

PATIENTS AND METHODS COVID-19 inpatients (Athens, Greece) were included. The ""Enhanced dose THRomboprophylaxis in Admissions (ETHRA)"" protocol was applied in certain Departments, suggesting the use of intermediate anticoagulation dosage. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation/venous thromboembolism/death. Inflammation/coagulation parameters were assessed. RESULTS Among 127 admissions, 95 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one events (4 deaths, 17 intubations) were observed. Regression analysis demonstrated significant reduction of events with intermediate or therapeutic dosage [HR=0.16 (95%CI=0.05-0.52) p=0.002; HR=0.17 (0.04-0.71) p=0.015, respectively]. D-Dimer values were higher in those who met the composite endpoint. Intermediate dosage treatment was associated with decreased values of ferritin. Three patients (3%) had minor hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION Anticoagulation treatment (particularly intermediate dosage) appears to have positive impact on COVID-19 inpatients' prognosis by inhibiting both coagulation and inflammatory cascades.","Poulakou, Garyphallia; Dimakakos, Evangelos; Kollias, Anastasios; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Rapti, Vasiliki; Trontzas, Ioannis; Thanos, Charalampos; Abdelrasoul, Mahmoud; Vantana, Theodora; Leontis, Konstantinos; Kakalou, Eleni; Argyraki, Katerina; Baraboutis, Ioannis; Michelakis, Evangelos; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos; Dimakou, Katerina; Tsoukalas, Georgios; Rapti, Angeliki; Michelakis, Evangelos D; Syrigos, Konstantinos N",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402523/,147

AIMS This study is aimed to summarize the existing data regarding anxiety, depression, and psychological distress during the covid-19 pandemic among the wider population so that effective intervention strategies will be initiated. METHODS Pieces of literature that assessed anxiety, depression, and psychological distress among the general population during the COVID pandemic period were systematically gathered. Data extraction in Microsoft excel was done by two independent reviewers using predefined criteria. The analysis was done using a stata-11 and random effect model. A sub-group and sensitivity analysis was done. Besides, the funnel plot and eggers publication bias test was tested. RESULTS Sixteen studies that assessed 78,225 participants were included. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis for anxiety prevalence. The average prevalence of anxiety was found to be 38.12%. A sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was 33.33% in China and 47.70% in other countries (Italy, Turkey, and India). Anxiety prevalence in studies measured with the DASS-21 scale, GAD-7 scale, and other tools (SAS, HADS, and 5-point Likert scale) was 23.4%, 40.73%, and 44.47% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety in studies that assessed a sample size above 2,000 participants was 40.33%. The average prevalence of depression among included studies was 34.31% and a sub-group analysis showed that depression was higher in China (36.32%) than in other countries (28.3%). Moreover, six studies reported psychological distress and the average prevalence was 37.54%. CONCLUSION This study revealed that anxiety, depression, and psychological distress are potential public mental health problems of the global community that suggests the need for early recognition and initiation of interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Necho, Mogesie; Tsehay, Mekonnen; Birkie, Mengesha; Biset, Gebyaw; Tadesse, Erkihun",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211003121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794717/,147
135626,Antitumor immune effects of preoperative sitravatinib and nivolumab in oral cavity cancer: SNOW window-of-opportunity study.,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND Continuous long-term electrocardiography monitoring has been increasingly recognized for early diagnosis and management of different types of cardiovascular diseases. To find an alternative to Ag/AgCl gel electrodes that are improper for this application scenario, many efforts have been undertaken to develop novel flexible dry textile electrodes integrated into the everyday garments. With significant progresses made to address the potential issues (e.g., low signal-to-noise ratio, high skin-electrode impedance, motion artifact, and low durability), the lack of standard evaluation procedure hinders the further development of dry electrodes (mainly the design and optimization). RESULTS A standard testing procedure and framework for skin-electrode impedance measurement is demonstrated for the development of novel dry textile electrodes. Different representative electrode materials have been screen-printed on textile substrates. To verify the performance of dry textile electrodes, impedance measurements are conducted on an agar skin model using a universal setup with consistent frequency and pressure. In addition, they are demonstrated for ECG signals acquisition, in comparison to those obtained using conventional gel electrodes. CONCLUSIONS Dry textile electrodes demonstrated similar impedance when in raised or flat structures. The tested pressure variations had an insignificant impact on electrode impedance. Looking at the effect of impedance on ECG signals, a noticeable effect on ECG signal performance metrics was not observed. Therefore, it is suggested that impedance alone is possibly not the primary indicator of signal quality. As well, the developed methods can also serve as useful guidelines for future textile dry-electrode design and testing for practical ECG monitoring applications.","Alizadeh-Meghrazi, Milad; Ying, Binbin; Schlums, Alessandra; Lam, Emily; Eskandarian, Ladan; Abbas, Farhana; Sidhu, Gurjant; Mahnam, Amin; Moineau, Bastien; Popovic, Milos R",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-021-00905-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247646/,147
135768,The bench-top accuracy of the VerteTrack spinal stiffness assessment device.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), in December 2019 in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, has developed into an unprecedented pandemic with enormous pressure on health-care providers around the world. A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were ≥65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers. CONCLUSIONS There is a higher mortality rate in patients with a hip fracture and an associated positive test for COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level IV.

Pilgrims come from across Senegal and the surrounding countries, as well as from countries outside Africa. It is the largest mass gathering (MG) of the Mouride community and the largest Muslim religious MG in West Africa. METHOD A cross-sectional study was conducted on all patients who attended a public healthcare structure during the November 2015 Grand Magal. RESULT Data were collected on a total of 32,229 healthcare contacts. The most frequent reasons for consultation were trauma, followed by fatigue and heatstroke. Infectious diseases were also prevalent with, notably, a high rate of febrile systemic illnesses and malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory tract infections. Such results are likely to be linked to overcrowding and climatic conditions, the relative lack of sanitary facilities, and limited medical resources available during the event. CONCLUSION The context of the Grand Magal MG is unique, given its location in a tropical developing country and its international component which may favor the globalization of locally endemic diseases. As such, it warrants investment in modern methods for public health surveillance and planning of the event.","Sokhna, Cheikh; Mboup, Balla Mbacké; Sow, Papa Gallo; Camara, Gaoussou; Dieng, Mamadou; Sylla, Mbaké; Gueye, Lamine; Sow, Doudou; Diallo, Aldiouma; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Gautret, Philippe",Travel medicine and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28847495/,147

The panel was used to assess the proficiency of the three laboratories that would be responsible for examining the 6,000 samples to be collected in the GRACE Network of Excellence (www.grace-lrti.org). The main objective was to decide on the best-performing testing approach for the detection of influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs). Two approaches were chosen: (i) laboratories testing samples using their in-house procedures for extraction and amplification and (ii) laboratories using their in-house amplification procedures on centrally extracted samples. Furthermore, three commercially available multiplex NAAT tests-the ResPlex (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), RespiFinder plus (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands), and RespiFinder Smart 21 (PathoFinder) tests-were evaluated by examination of the same EQA panel by the manufacturer. No large differences among the 3 laboratories were noticed when the performances of the assays developed in-house in combination with the in-house extraction procedures were compared. Also, the extraction procedure (central versus local) had little effect on performance. However, large differences in amplification efficacy were found between the commercially available tests; acceptable results were obtained by using the PathoFinder assays.","Loens, K; van Loon, A M; Coenjaerts, F; van Aarle, Y; Goossens, H; Wallace, P; Claas, E J C; Ieven, M",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00200-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22170925/,147

METHOD In this retrospective case-control study, the study group consisted of 141 patients who were imaged with low dose chest CT acquisition protocol. The control group consisted of 92 patients who were imaged with the standard protocol. Anteroposterior and lateral diameters of chest, effective diameter and scan length, qualitative and quantitative noise levels, volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), and size-specific dose estimations were compared between groups. RESULTS Radiation dose reduction by nearly 90% (CTDIvol and DLP values 1.06 mGy and 40.3 mGy.cm vs. 8.07 mGy and 330 mGy.cm, p < 0.001, respectively) was achieved with the use of low dose acquisition chest CT protocol. Despite higher image noise with low dose acquisition protocol, no significant effect on diagnostic confidence was encountered. Cardiac and diaphragm movement-related artifacts were similar in both groups (p = 0.275). Interobserver agreement was very good in terms of diagnostic confidence assessment. CONCLUSION For the imaging of either the confirmed case of COVID-19 related pneumonia or the suspected case of this disease in adults, low dose chest CT acquisition protocol provides remarkable radiation dose reduction without adversely affecting image quality and diagnostic confidence.","Atlı, Eray; Uyanık, Sadık Ahmet; Öğüşlü, Umut; Cenkeri, Halime Çevik; Yılmaz, Birnur; Gümüş, Burçak",Current medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210623124108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165410/,147

Although much has been learned about the clinical course, prognostic inflammatory markers, and disease complications of COVID-19, the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the thyroid is poorly understood. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, limited available evidence indicates there is no pathological evidence of thyroid injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, subacute thyroiditis (SAT) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for the first time. Thyroid dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. By contrast, certain thyroid diseases may have a negative impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition, some anti-COVID-19 agents may cause thyroid injury or affect its metabolism. COVID-19 and thyroid disease may mutually aggravate the disease burden. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should not ignore the effect in thyroid function, especially when there are obvious related symptoms. In addition, patients with thyroid diseases should follow specific management principles during the epidemic period.","Chen, Wenjie; Tian, Yuang; Li, Zhihui; Zhu, Jingqiang; Wei, Tao; Lei, Jianyong",Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1210/endocr/bqab004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428724/,147
136901,Filling of small oval root canals: influence of sealer placement and filling technique.,2020-09-08,"INTRODUCTION New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is frequently observed in critically ill patients and may be associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Considerable variation exists in the reported frequencies of NOAF due to the lack of a standardised definition and detection method. Importantly, there are limited data on NOAF in the intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, we aim to provide contemporary epidemiological data on NOAF in the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We have designed an international inception cohort study including at least 1,000 consecutive adult patients acutely admitted to the ICU without prior history of persistent or permanent AF. We will present data on the incidence, risk factors, used management strategies and outcomes of NOAF. We will register data daily during stay in the ICU for a maximum of 90 days after admission. The incidence of NOAF and management strategies used will be presented descriptively, and we will use Cox regression analyses including competing risk analyses to assess risk factors for NOAF and any association with 90-day mortality. CONCLUSION The outlined international AFIB-ICU inception cohort study will provide contemporary data on the incidence, risk factors, used management strategies and outcomes of NOAF in adult ICU patients.","Wetterslev, Mik; Møller, Morten Hylander; Granholm, Anders; Haase, Nicolai; Hassager, Christian; Lange, Theis; Hästbacka, Johanna; Wilkman, Erika; Myatra, Sheila Nainan; Shen, Jiawei; An, Youzhong; Siegemund, Martin; Young, Paul J; Aslam, Tayyba Naz; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Aneman, Anders; Arabi, Yaseen M; Cronhjort, Maria; Keus, Frederik; Perner, Anders",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864378/,147

METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials databases between 1949 and May 2015 to identify randomized trials of NIV for ARF. We excluded the ARF caused by extubation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and COPD. RESULTS The meta-analysis included 21 studies and 1691 patients, of whom 846 were assigned to NIV and 845 to control (InMV or standard O2 therapy). One hundred ninety-one patients (22.6%) in the NIV group and 261 patients (30.9%) in the control group died before discharge from hospital. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for short-term mortality (in-hospital mortality) was 0.56 (95% CI 0.40-0.78). When comparing NIV with standard O2 therapy, the short-term mortality was 155 (27.4%) versus 204 (36.0%), respectively. For this comparison, the pooled OR of short-term mortality was 0.56 (95% CI 0.36-0.85). When comparing NIV with InMV, the short-term mortality was 36 (12.9%) versus 57 (20.5%) patients, respectively. For this comparison, the pooled OR of short-term mortality was 0.56 (95% CI 0.34-0.90). Tracheal intubation was performed in 106 patients (22.7%) in the NIV and in 183 patients (39.4%) in the standard O2 group, representing a pooled OR of 0.37 (95% CI 0.25-0.55). There were publication biases and the quality of the evidence was graded as low. CONCLUSION Compared with standard O2 therapy or InMV, NIV lowered both the short-term mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation in patients presenting with ARF.","Kondo, Yutaka; Kumasawa, Junji; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Seo, Ryutaro; Nango, Eishu; Hashimoto, Satoru",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-017-2389-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741217/,147
136941,Epidemiological profile and clinical implications of oral squamous cell carcinoma adjacent to dental implants.,2020-11-03,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is predominantly recognized as a pediatric pathogen although sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques have led to its more frequent detection in some adult settings. In some studies RSV has been detected just as frequently in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients as in those suffering disease exacerbations, leading to the suggestion that RSV may persist in COPD. Although some studies have found negligible RSV in stable COPD, others have detected RSV in one-quarter to one-third of stable COPD samples. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are explored within the article. A relationship between RSV detection and increased disease severity, including rate of decline in lung function and systemic/airway inflammation, has been found on both occasions it has been sought. Susceptibility to persistent RSV infection could involve both host and viral factors. Cigarette smoking and COPD are likely to result in impaired antiviral immunity, and RSV is capable of evading immune responses by inducing skewed type 2 T-helper cell responses, antagonizing antiviral cytokines, mimicking chemokines, inhibiting apoptosis, and entering immune-privileged cells such as pulmonary neurons. It can also escape an established immune response through antigenic drift. This article examines current evidence regarding persistence of RSV in COPD and its possible mechanisms. We also discuss various roles for RSV persistence in COPD pathogenesis. Further elucidation of the contribution of persistent RSV to the pathogenesis of COPD requires interventional studies. Persistence of RSV in COPD may have direct relevance to the pathogenesis of childhood diseases such as postbronchiolitic wheeze and asthma.","Sikkel, Markus B; Quint, Jennifer K; Mallia, Patrick; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Johnston, Sebastian L",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181684d67; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820581/,147
136957,Successful radiofrequency ablation strategies for benign thyroid nodules.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To explore the therapeutic effect of Bushen Yiqi Huoxue Decoction ( BYHD) in patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). METHODS A total of 180 patients with DOR diagnosed from December 2013 to December 2014 were equally assigned into progynova and duphaston (E+D) group, Zuogui Pill () group and BYHD group with 60 cases in each by computerized randomization. Patients received E+D, Zuogui Pill or BYHD for 12 months, respectively. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian volume, endometrial thickness, and the resistance indices (RIs) of ovarian arteries and uterine arteries were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS Nine women (4 from the E+D group, 3 from the Zuogui Pill group, and 2 from the BYHD group) withdrew from the study. After 6 months, Zuogui Pill and BYHD significantly decreased FSH and LH and increased endometrial thickness and AMH (all P<0.01). BYHD also resulted in E2 elevation (P<0.05), ovary enlargement (P<0.05), AFC increase (P<0.01), and RI of ovarian arteries decrease (P<0.05). After 12 months, further improvements were observed in the Zuogui Pill and BYHD groups (all P<0.01), but BYHD showed better outcomes, with lower FSH, larger ovaries and a thicker endometrium compared with the Zuogui Pill group (all P<0.01). However, E+D only significantly increased endometrial thickness (P<0.01) and no significant improvements were observed in the RI of uterine arteries in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS BYHD had a favorable therapeutic effect in patients with DOR by rebalancing hormone levels, promoting ovulation, and repairing the thin endometrium. The combination of tonifying Shen (Kidney), benefiting qi and activating blood circulation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for DOR.","Zhou, Jing; Pan, Xin-Yao; Lin, Jin; Zhou, Qi; Lan, Li-Kun; Zhu, Jun; Duan, Ru; Wang, Lan; Sun, Yan; Wang, Ling",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3484-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423188/,147

When alveolar air leak was confirmed after lung resection, we applied LVC system to the pleural defect followed by layers of PGA sheets and fibrin glue (n = 40). We then analyzed postoperative air leaks (rate of occurrence and duration time). RESULTS 73% of patients (29/40 cases) experienced no postoperative air leaks. Although 11 patients experienced air leaks after surgery, there were no prolonged air leaks (>7 days) (resolution time, 3.5 ± 1.4 days; range, 2-6 days). Two patients required drainage for late-onset air leaks, but their conditions improved without further treatment. There were no further adverse events. CONCLUSIONS The use of LVC with PGA sheets and fibrin glue following pulmonary resection efficiently prevented both intraoperative air leaks and prolonged air leaks after lung surgery.","Kawai, Norikazu; Kawaguchi, Takeshi; Suzuki, Shuko; Yasukawa, Motoaki; Tojo, Takashi; Taniguchi, Shigeki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-017-0829-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965258/,147

Different studies have shown the importance of sports service and human resources for greater customer loyalty. However, few works have studied how the physical environment or servicescape influences the behavior of consumers in fitness centers based on gender and age. Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between servicescape and the loyalty of fitness center consumers, analyzing through the Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) what the aspects to improve according to gender and age are. The sample was 10,368 fitness center customers (5864 women and 4504 men). After the IPMA, it was concluded that the main improvement margins in general in fitness centers were the equipment and the facility condition, and the facility layout. In turn, in relation to gender and age, the aspects with room for improvement were to a greater extent for equipment and facility condition in women over 21 years of age, and in facility layout for women between 21 and 40 years old and 51-60 years old. Regarding men, the aspects with the highest performance margins were the equipment and facility condition in all the age groups, the facility layout in men up to 50 years old, and the signage in men up to 40 years old and from 51 to 60 years old.","García-Fernández, Jerónimo; Fernández-Gavira, Jesús; Sánchez-Oliver, Antonio Jesús; Gálvez-Ruíz, Pablo; Grimaldi-Puyana, Moisés; Cepeda-Carrión, Gabriel",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916936/,147
137733,Inhibition of LEF1-Mediated DCLK1 by Niclosamide Attenuates Colorectal Cancer Stemness.,2019,"BACKGROUND Condylar hyperplasia is a rare bone disease characterised by excessive development of mandibular condyle, which can lead to the development of asymmetric facial deformity together with malocclusion, mandibular deviation, TMJ and masticatory musculoskeletal system dysfunction. There is not a treatment protocol universally accepted. In order to determine the correct management, treatment and intervention timing of these patients, morphological examinations should be coupled with functional assessments. CASE REPORT In the present case report, morphological (bone scintigraphy; orthopantomography; posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms; 3D facial photographs) and functional (surface electromyography of masseter and temporalis muscles) quantitative data of a 20-year-old male patient affected by unilateral condylar hyperplasia are presented. The patient underwent a surgical treatment with high unilateral condylectomy associated to a maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy; as well as orthodontic treatment before and after surgery. Facial morphology and masticatory muscles activity were assessed before surgery and followed-up 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Twenty-four months after surgery, all electromyographic values were normal, and soft-tissue facial asymmetry was negligible at 3D assessment. CONCLUSION Surface electromyography joins a set of clinical and morphological diagnostic tests that help the surgeon in planning the operation and managing the post-surgical patient.","Cullati, F; Mapelli, A; Beltramini, G; Codari, M; Pimenta Ferreira, C L; Baj, A; Giannì, A B; Sforza, C",European journal of paediatric dentistry,https://doi.org/10.23804/ejpd.2017.18.02.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598184/,147

INTRODUCTION The increase of chronic diseases and the associated multimorbidity create challenges for health care resources and services. Considering their role and skill set, nurses are in a position to lead the transformation of health care for patients with chronic illness. Several nurse-led care management models in the community have been identified in the literature, but little is known about these models in hospital settings. It is necessary to map the existing nurse-led care management models and describe their characteristics, differences, and similarities, and the implications for patients with multimorbidity in a hospital environment. INCLUSION CRITERIA This scoping review will consider studies focusing on nurse-led care management models for adult patients with multimorbidity in hospital settings, including readmissions, discharges, and visits to emergency services. METHODS The search will include Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Nursing and Allied Health Collection, and gray literature through OpenGrey. This review will be restricted to studies published in English. A three-step search strategy will be used, and the articles identified in the databases will be organized and the duplicates removed. The titles and abstracts will be analyzed by two independent reviewers. Full texts will be imported into a bibliographic reference management system. The findings will be presented in tables and descriptive summary.","Gonçalves, Isabel; Mendes, Diana Arvelos; Caldeira, Sílvia; Nunes, Elisabete Maria Garcia Teles",JBI evidence synthesis,https://doi.org/10.11124/jbies-20-00222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400595/,147
138532,Automatic vertebra segmentation on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.,2017,"During the spring 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, faculty and staff within Ohio State University's College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences came together from multiple disciplines to support essential agricultural workers. Concerted leadership from administration provided a framework for this interaction to occur while faculty worked off-campus to address the many issues identified by the agricultural community, the industry sector, and other state agencies. During the onset period, much of our work was reactive; our efforts to address worker safety and health involved three primary areas within: 1) production agricultural workers, 2) produce growers and direct marketing enterprises, and 3) meat supply chain workers. Communication to target audiences relied upon our ability to convert face-to-face programming into virtual webinars, social media, and digital publications. A Food System Task Force mobilized specialists to address emerging issues, with one specific topic related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As we continue to face new seasons in agriculture production, and pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks within our state, we will continue to address the dynamic needs of our food supply systems. There are implications for how we will teach the agricultural workforce within a virtual platform, including the evaluation of the effectiveness of those training programs. There are renewed opportunities to integrate health and safety content into other Extension teams who conventionally focused on production practices and farm management topics. Several research themes emerged during subgroup dialog to pursue new knowledge in workers' cultural attitude and barriers, PPE design, PPE access, and overall attitude toward COVID-19 health practices.","Jepsen, S Dee; Pfeifer, Lisa; Garcia, Lyda G; Plakias, Zoë; Inwood, Shoshanah; Rumble, Joy N; Rodriguez, Mary T; Puskas, Judit E; Custer, Samuel G",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1815623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048658/,147
138831,Development of Snake Fungal Disease after Experimental Challenge with Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola in Cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorous).,2015,"The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) broadly inhibit virus infections, particularly at the viral entry level. However, despite this shared ability to inhibit fusion, IFITMs differ in the potency and breadth of viruses restricted, an anomaly that is not fully understood. Here, we show that differences in the range of viruses restricted by IFITM1 are regulated by a C-terminal non-canonical dibasic sorting signal KRXX that suppresses restriction of some viruses by governing its intracellular distribution. Replacing the two basic residues with alanine (KR/AA) increased restriction of jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus and 10A1 amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Deconvolution microscopy revealed an altered subcellular distribution for KR/AA, with fewer molecules in LAMP1-positive lysosomes balanced by increased levels in CD63-positive multivesicular bodies, where jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus pseudovirions are colocalized. IFITM1 binds to cellular adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), an association that is lost when the dibasic motif is altered. Although knockdown of AP-3 itself decreases some virus entry, expression of parental IFITM1, but not its KR/AA mutant, potentiates inhibition of viral infections in AP-3 knockdown cells. By using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we provide evidence that IFITM1 adopts more than one membrane topology co-existing in cellular membranes. Because the C-terminal dibasic sorting signal is unique to human IFITM1, our results provide novel insight into understanding the species- and virus-specific antiviral effect of IFITMs.","Li, Kun; Jia, Rui; Li, Minghua; Zheng, Yi-Min; Miao, Chunhui; Yao, Yunfang; Ji, Hong-Long; Geng, Yunqi; Qiao, Wentao; Albritton, Lorraine M; Liang, Chen; Liu, Shan-Lu",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m114.630780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527505/,147
138934,Audio Interview: Delivering Covid-19 Vaccines to Minority Communities.,2021-04-01,"An increase in both human population and economic growth has been accompanied by rising per capita demand for animal products. The livestock industry is under pressure to meet this demand, but its current patterns of production are not environmentally sustainable, causing negative health impacts on humans and raising welfare concerns for animals. With little regulation of the intensive livestock sector in most countries, animal products are available at cheaper prices on consumer markets, undercutting more sustainable production systems, such as those used by pastoralists and organic farmers. Other beneficial aspects of sustainable intensification and sustainable pastoralism should also be taken into account. However, it is unclear whether moving towards sustainable animal husbandry (both intensive and extensive) will meet the projected demand from nine billion people in 2030, unless attention is also paid to fairer and more responsible consumption. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to transform the livestock sector, using principles of sustainable consumption and production, environmental stewardship, inclusive prosperity, and healthy lifestyles. It also highlights several areas where additional research and modelling are required.","Niamir-Fuller, M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.35.2.2531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27917985/,147

139004,A WHO resolution on epilepsy and other neurological disorders.,2021-03-01,"Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in the control of infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3). Among >10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities. Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission. In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities. In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities. This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment. During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported. During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases. Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing. CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.","Wallace, Megan; Marlow, Mariel; Simonson, Sean; Walker, Marceia; Christophe, Natalie; Dominguez, Olivia; Kleamenakis, Lauren; Orellana, Angie; Pagan-Pena, Doriselys; Singh, Calandre; Pogue, Michele; Saucier, Leslie; Lo, Terrence; Benson, Kelsey; Sokol, Theresa",MMWR.

METHODS Patients diagnosed with spinal implant-associated infections between 2015 and 2019 were prospectively included and treated according to a standardized algorithm. Infections were classified as early-onset (≤6 weeks) and late-onset (>6 weeks). RESULTS Among 250 patients, 152 (61%) had an early-onset and 98 (39%) late-onset infection. Local inflammatory signs was the most common manifestation in early-onset infections (84%), whereas late-onset infections presented mainly with persisting or increasing local pain (71%). Sonication fluid were more often positive than peri-implant tissue samples (90% vs. 79%, p=0.016), particularly in late-onset infections (92% vs. 75%, p=0.005). Predominant pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium spp. Debridement and implant retention was the most common surgical approach in early-onset infection (85%), whereas partial or complete implant exchange was mainly performed in late-onset infections (61%). 218 patients (87%) received biofilm-active antibiotics, the median treatment duration was 11.7 weeks. 49 patients (20%) needed more than one revision for infection, six patients (2.4%) died during their hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Most spinal implant-associated infections were acquired during surgery and presented within 6 weeks of surgery. Infections presented mainly with local inflammatory signs in early-onset and with persisting or increasing pain in late-onset infections. Sonication was the most sensitive microbiological method, particularly in late-onset infections. Debridement and implant retention was used in well-integrated implants without loosening implant parts, independent of the time of infection onset.","Margaryan, Donara; Renz, Nora; Bervar, Maja; Zahn, Robert; Onken, Julia; Putzier, Michael; Vajkoczy, Peter; Trampuz, Andrej",International journal of antimicrobial agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726675/,147
139297,Treatment of osteoid osteoma with CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation.,2013,"Vitamin D has been identified as an essential biomarker for various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was 0.001 ng/mL, which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%). Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.","Kim, Woochang; Park, Joohyung; Kim, Woong; Jo, Seongjae; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Chihyun; Park, Hyunjun; Bang, Doyeon; Lee, Wonseok; Park, Jinsung",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044348/,147

139627,India's crusade against COVID-19.,2021-03-01,"In its commitment towards Sustainable Development Goals, India envisages comprehensive primary health services as a key pillar in achieving universal health coverage. Embedded in siloed vertical programmes, their lack of interoperability and standardisation limits sustainability and hence their benefits have not been realised yet. We propose an enterprise architecture framework that overcomes these challenges and outline a robust futuristic digital health infrastructure for delivery of efficient and effective comprehensive primary healthcare. Core principles of an enterprise platform architecture covering four platform levers to facilitate seamless service delivery, monitor programmatic performance and facilitate research in the context of primary healthcare are listed. A federated architecture supports the custom needs of states and health programmes through standardisation and decentralisation techniques. Interoperability design principles enable integration between disparate information technology systems to ensure continuum of care across referral pathways. A responsive data architecture meets high volume and quality requirements of data accessibility in compliance with regulatory requirements. Security and privacy by design underscore the importance of building trust through role-based access, strong user authentication mechanisms, robust data management practices and consent. The proposed framework will empower programme managers with a ready reference toolkit for designing, implementing and evaluating primary care platforms for large-scale deployment. In the context of health and wellness centres, building a responsive, resilient and reliable enterprise architecture would be a fundamental path towards strengthening health systems leveraging digital health interventions. An enterprise architecture for primary care is the foundational building block for an efficient national digital health ecosystem. As citizens take ownership of their health, futuristic digital infrastructure at the primary care level will determine the health-seeking behaviour and utilisation trajectory of the nation.","Nadhamuni, Sunita; John, Oommen; Kulkarni, Mallari; Nanda, Eshan; Venkatraman, Sethuraman; Varma, Devesh; Balsari, Satchit; Gudi, Nachiket; Samantaray, Shantidev; Reddy, Haritha; Sheel, Vikas",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312149/,147
139888,Colorectal cancer.,2013,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in the United States. Individuals born between 1945-1965, the baby boomers, account for approximately 75% of all chronic HCV infections in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine if a 6-week intervention, including outreach, education, and incentive, by a community-based health insurance company could improve uptake of HCV antibody screening among the 1945-1965 birth cohort. Individuals were eligible to participate in this campaign if they were born on or after January 1, 1945 and on or before December 31, 1965, had health insurance with Sendero Health Plans during the intervention period, and had no evidence of having received an HCV antibody test prior to the campaign start date. The 6-week campaign period was from November 14, 2018 through December 31, 2018. A gift card incentive was provided if HCV screening was completed on or before December 31, 2018. A total of 5287 individuals were eligible to participate in the campaign. Members who were baby boomers were 3.36 times more likely to receive HCV antibody screening during the intervention period in 2018 than during a similar period in 2017 (prevalence ratio = 3.36; P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 2.71, 4.16). Health officials have established the identification, treatment, and elimination of HCV as a national policy objective.

Acute hiccups can often be terminated by physical manoeuvres. In contrast, persistent and intractable hiccups that continue for days or months are rare, but can be distressing and difficult to treat. AIM To review the management of hiccups, including a systematic review of reported efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments. METHODS Available articles were identified using three electronic databases in addition to hand searching of published articles. Inclusion criteria were any reports of pharmaceutical therapy of 'hiccup(s)', 'hiccough(s)' or 'singultus' in English or German. RESULTS Treatment of 341 patients with persistent or intractable hiccups was reported in 15 published studies. Management was most effective when directed at the underlying condition. An empirical trial of anti-reflux therapy may be appropriate. If the underlying cause is not known or not treatable, then a range of pharmacological agents may provide benefit; however, systematic review revealed no adequately powered, well-designed trials of treatment. The use of baclofen and metoclopramide are supported by small randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Observational data suggest that gabapentin and chlorpromazine are also effective. Baclofen and gabapentin are less likely than standard neuroleptic agents to cause side effects during long-term therapy. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review revealed no high quality data on which to base treatment recommendations. Based on limited efficacy and safety data, baclofen and gabapentin may be considered as first line therapy for persistent and intractable hiccups, with metoclopramide and chlorpromazine in reserve.","Steger, M; Schneemann, M; Fox, M",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.13374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307025/,147

Data are conflicting and lacking key variables needed to assess infection risks. We provide a rapid scoping review on hand-drying methods relative to hygiene and health risks. Controlled vocabulary terms and keywords were used to search PubMed (1946-2018) and Embase (1947-2018). Multiple researchers independently screened abstracts for relevance using predetermined criteria and created a quality assessment scoring system for relative study comparisons. Of 293 papers, 23 were included in the final analysis. Five studies did not compare multiple methods; however, 2 generally favoured electric dryers (ED); 7 preferred PT; and 9 had mixed or statistically insignificant results (among these, 3 contained scenarios favourable to ED, 4 had results supporting PT, and the remaining studies had broadly conflicting results). Results were mixed among and within studies and many lacked consistent design or statistical analysis. The breadth of data does not favour one method as being more hygienic. However, some authors extended generalizable recommendations without sufficient scientific evidence. The use of tools in quantitative microbial risk assessment is suggested to evaluate health exposure potentials and risks relative to hand-drying methods.

We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tirofiban during MT for patients with preceding IVT. Patients and Methods Patients who underwent MT and preceding IVT were derived from the ANGEL registry and were dichotomized into tirofiban and non-tirofiban group according to whether rescue tirofiban was performed. The safety endpoints were sICH, total ICH and distal embolization. The efficacy endpoints were arterial recanalization, three-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]: 0-2) and mortality. Results We included 207 MT patients with preceding IVT from the entire registry. Among them, there were 55 in tirofiban group and 152 in non-tirofiban group, and 17 (8.2%) patients suffered sICH and 36 (17.4%) suffered ICH within 24 hours post-MT; 11 (5.3%) distal embolization of thrombus; 111 (53.6%) achieved functional independence and 34 (16.4%) died after three-month follow-up. No significant differences in safety outcomes on sICH, ICH and distal embolization of thrombus and efficacy outcomes on recanalization and long-term functional independence were found between tirofiban and non-tirofiban group for the entire cohort (p>0.05 for all groups). Tirofiban was correlated with long-term mortality reduction for patients underwent MT and preceding IVT (adjusted hazard ratio 0.28 [0.08-0.94], adjusted p=0.03). Conclusion In AIS patients who underwent MT and preceding IVT, rescue tirofiban was not correlated with increased risk of safety endpoints on sICH, ICH or distal embolization of thrombus, and might be associated with a lower risk of long-term mortality. Further study is needed to confirm the effect of early antiplatelet therapy with tirofiban for patients underwent MT and preceding IVT.","Huo, Xiaochuan; Yang, Ming; Ma, Ning; Gao, Feng; Mo, Dapeng; Li, Xiaoqing; Wang, Anxin; Wang, Yongjun; Miao, Zhongrong",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s238769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801672/,147

We have previously shown in apoE null mice uptake of a radiolabeled anti-RAGE antibody in atherosclerotic plaque and now evaluate RAGE-directed imaging to identify advanced plaques in a large animal model. METHODS Nine hyperlipidemic (HL) pigs were injected with 603.1 ± 129.5 MBq of (99m)Tc-anti-RAGE F(ab')2, and after 6 h (blood pool clearance), they underwent single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of the neck, thorax, and hind limbs. Two HL pigs received (99m)Tc non-immune IgG F(ab')2, and three farm pigs were injected with (99m)Tc-anti-RAGE F(ab')2. After imaging, the pigs were euthanized. The aorta from the root to bifurcation was dissected, and the innominates, proximal carotids, and coronaries were dissected and counted, stained for H&E and RAGE, and AHA-classified. RESULTS On pathology, 24% of the arterial segments showed AHA class III or IV lesions, and these lesions were confined almost exclusively to coronaries and carotids with % stenosis from 15% to 65%. Scatter plots of %ID/g for class III/IV vs. I/II lesions showed almost complete separation. Focal vascular uptake of tracer visualized on SPECT scans corresponded to class III/IV lesions in the coronary and carotid vessels. In addition, uptake in the hind limbs was noted in the HL pigs and corresponded to RAGE staining of small arteries in the muscle sections. Correlations for the vascular lesions were r = 0.747, P = 0.001 for %ID vs. %ID/g and r = 0.83, P = 0.002 for %ID/g vs. % RAGE staining. CONCLUSIONS Uptake of radiolabeled anti-RAGE antibody in coronary and carotid fibroatheroma and in the small arteries of the hind limbs in a relevant large animal model of atherosclerosis supports the important role of RAGE in atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease as a target for imaging and treatment.","Johnson, Lynne L; Tekabe, Yared; Kollaros, Maria; Eng, George; Bhatia, Ketan; Li, Chong; Krueger, Christian G; Shanmuganayagam, Dhanansayan; Schmidt, Ann Marie",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-014-0026-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006545/,147

141471,Clinical investigation of the protective effects of palm vitamin E tocotrienols on brain white matter.,2014,"OBJECTIVE An aetiological link between acute infection and major depression has long been hypothesized, and is increasingly gaining recognition within contemporary literature. This review aims to examine the evidence for such a link, specifically between acute, self-limiting infection and major depression, and to summarize the current understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this link. METHODS Relevant articles were sourced via an online search of published literature from Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed using a variety of search terms including mood disorder, depression, infection and inflammation. Additionally, a search for articles from the bibliographies of retrieved papers was conducted. RESULTS Findings from retrospective studies suggest an association between infection and subsequent mood disturbance, including major depression. This association has been confirmed by studies employing prospective observational or experimental challenge designs. The available evidence supports a multifactorial basis of vulnerability towards major depression in the context of acute infection. Genetic, neuroendocrine, autonomic and psychosocial factors may interact to potentiate the likelihood of a severe and prolonged depressive response to an immunological stressor in some individuals. CONCLUSION Mood disturbance is likely to have a host-protective role in the context of an acute sickness response to infection. However, this usually adaptive and reversible response may progress in some vulnerable individuals into a more sustained and severe pattern of behavioural and physiological changes of major depression. Further research is needed to delineate the factors that predispose, precipitate and perpetuate depression in the context of acute infective illness. Such insights will inform effective prevention and treatment strategies.","Gunaratne, Pramudie; Lloyd, Andrew R; Vollmer-Conna, Ute",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867413503718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056922/,147

CASE SUMMARY A 1.5-year-old Labrador Retriever developed spontaneous pneumothorax 12 days after an episode of exertional heat stroke. Computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral pneumothorax and multifocal pulmonary consolidation, especially at the lung periphery. A median sternotomy was performed, and multifocal, well-demarcated areas of consolidated pulmonary tissue with purple discoloration were identified and resected from the right middle, right caudal, and accessory lung lobes. Histologic examination of the resected pulmonary tissue indicated necrotizing pneumonia, and bacteriologic culture of the tissue resulted in growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Examination of tissue from a pectoral muscle biopsy performed at this time showed necrotizing myopathy. The dog was discharged 7 days after surgery and made a full recovery. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED This case report describes pneumothorax and multifocal necrotizing pneumonia as a delayed complication of heatstroke, and provides the first description of the computed tomography appearance of histologically confirmed necrotizing pneumonia in a dog. Multifocal necrotizing pneumonia with or without pneumothorax should be considered in dogs that develop respiratory distress following severe systemic illness.","Garber, Jocelyn B; Saile, Katrin; Rademacher, Nathalie; Wignall, James R; McLaughlin, Leslie D; Ryan, Kirk A",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/vec.12361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26426867/,147

142251,Clinical trial demonstrates exercise following bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity.,2015,"Mandatory attendance, particularly in didactic settings, is a highly debated topic in higher education, including dental education. Within dental education, a large portion of education occurs in preclinical laboratories and clinical environments. There is little to no research on attendance in these settings in dental schools. This point/counterpoint paper examines the pros and cons of mandatory attendance in these highly specialized educational settings. With the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 and continues to impact dental education at the time of publication, this topic has become even more relevant. Viewpoint 1 claims that attendance should be mandatory because a greater exposure to preclinical and clinical environments helps foster better clinical hand skills, critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving skills, and an overall sense of professional identity. It goes on further to suggest that there may be a link between attendance and performance in exams and that attendance is part of the dental school's responsibility. Viewpoint 2 argues that the rationale for attendance is complex, and that creating learning environments that are psychologically safe will incentivize students to attend, even without mandatory attendance policies. Furthermore, it explains that technological advances have allowed dental schools to think creatively about asynchronous learning, which by its very nature does not require attendance at a given time. The authors of both viewpoints conclude that the preclinical and clinical education and experience are critical dental education and that dental school leaders should focus on improving the quality of these experiences.","Saeed, Sophia G; Bain, Jennifer L; Khoo, Edmund; Siqueira, Walter L; van der Hoeven, Ransome",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169519/,147
142272,Two nasal swabs may not be enough to exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients.,2021-03-22,"In this study, we investigated the ability of curcumin alone or in combination with GLUT1 siRNA to radiosensitize laryngeal carcinoma (LC) through the induction of autophagy. Protein levels in tumour tissues and LC cells were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In vitro, cell proliferation, colony formation assays, cell death and autophagy were detected. A nude mouse xenograft model was established through the injection of Tu212 cells. We found that GLUT1 was highly expressed and negatively associated with autophagy-related proteins in LC and that curcumin suppressed radiation-mediated GLUT1 overexpression in Tu212 cells. Treatment with curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA, or the combination of the two promoted autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using 6-amino-3-methypourine (3-MA) promoted apoptosis after irradiation or treatment of cells with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA. 3-MA inhibited curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA-mediated non-apoptotic programmed cell death. The combination of curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA and 3-MA provided the strongest sensitization in vivo. We also found that autophagy induction after curcumin or GLUT1 siRNA treatment implicated in the AMP-activated protein kinase-mTOR-serine/threonine-protein kinase-Beclin1 signalling pathway. Irradiation primarily caused apoptosis, and when combined with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA treatment, the increased radiosensitivity of LC occurred through the concurrent induction of apoptosis and autophagy.","Dai, Li-Bo; Zhong, Jiang-Tao; Shen, Li-Fang; Zhou, Shui-Hong; Lu, Zhong-Jie; Bao, Yang-Yang; Fan, Jun",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.16450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955148/,147

METHODS Thirty-nine swine underwent creation of open-book pelvic fracture and iliac vascular injury. Animals were randomized to no intervention (n = 7), OP (n = 10), PPB (n = 9), zone 1 REBOA (n = 7), and zone 3 REBOA (n = 6) at a mean arterial pressure less than 40 mm Hg from uncontrolled hemorrhage. Primary outcome was survival at 1 hour. Secondary outcomes included survival in the immediate 10 m following intervention reversal, peak preperitoneal pressure (PP), blood loss, bleed rate, and peak lactate. RESULTS Prior to injury, no difference was measured between groups for weight, hemodynamics, lactate, and hematocrit (all p = NS). The injury was uniformly lethal without intervention, with survival time (mean) of 5 m, peak PP of 14 mm Hg, blood loss of 960 g, bleed rate of 450 g/m, and peak lactate of 2.6 mmol/L. Survival time (m) was extended to 44 with OP, 60 with PPB, and 60 with REBOA (p < 0.01). Peak PP (mm Hg) was 19 with OP, 23 with PPB, 10 with zone 1 REBOA, and 6 with zone 3 REBOA (p < 0.05). Blood loss (g) was 850 with OP, 930 with PPB, 610 with zone 1 REBOA, and 370 with zone 3 REBOA (p < 0.01). Peak lactate (mmol/L) was 3.3 with OP, 4.3 with PPB, 13.4 with zone 1 REBOA, and 5.3 with zone 3 REBOA (p < 0.01). Only 33% of zone 1 REBOA animals survived the initial 10 m after balloon deflation, compared to 60% for OP, 67% for PPB, and 100% for zone 3 REBOA (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Preperitoneal balloon tamponade and zone 3 REBOA are effective alternatives to OP in this animal model of lethal pelvic fracture-associated hemorrhage. Zone 1 REBOA extends survival time but with high mortality upon reversal.","Do, Woo S; Forte, Dominic M; Sheldon, Rowan R; Weiss, Jessica B; Barron, Morgan R; Sokol, Kyle K; Black, George E; Hegge, Sara R; Eckert, Matthew J; Martin, Matthew J",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000002266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260423/,147

142489,Systemic inflammatory cytokine analysis to monitor biomaterial augmented tissue healing.,2015,"Background Alterations in multiple domains of cognition have been observed in individuals who have experienced a traumatic stressor. These domains may provide important insights in identifying underlying neurobiological dysfunction driving an individual's clinical response to trauma. However, such assessments are burdensome, costly, and time-consuming. To overcome barriers, efforts have emerged to measure multiple domains of cognitive functioning through the application of machine learning (ML) models to passive data sources. Methods We utilized automated computer vision and voice analysis methods to extract facial, movement, and speech characteristics from semi-structured clinical interviews in 81 trauma survivors who additionally completed a cognitive assessment battery. A ML-based regression framework was used to identify variance in visual and auditory measures that relate to multiple cognitive domains. Results Models derived from visual and auditory measures collectively accounted for a large variance in multiple domains of cognitive functioning, including motor coordination (R2 = 0.52), processing speed (R2 = 0.42), emotional bias (R2 = 0.52), sustained attention (R2 = 0.51), controlled attention (R2 = 0.44), cognitive flexibility (R2 = 0.43), cognitive inhibition (R2 = 0.64), and executive functioning (R2 = 0.63), consistent with the high test-retest reliability of traditional cognitive assessments. Face, voice, speech content, and movement have all significantly contributed to explaining the variance in predicting functioning in all cognitive domains. Conclusions The results demonstrate the feasibility of automated measurement of reliable proxies of cognitive functioning through low-burden passive patient evaluations. This makes it easier to monitor cognitive functions and to intervene earlier and at a lower threshold without requiring a time-consuming neurocognitive assessment by, for instance, a licensed psychologist with specialized training in neuropsychology.","Schultebraucks, Katharina; Yadav, Vijay; Galatzer-Levy, Isaac R",Digital biomarkers,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615118/,147

143528,Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Glaucoma: A Review.,2018,"BACKGROUND Tuberculous meningitis is commonly associated with a poor outcome. Simple bedside prognostic scores can help immensely in predicting the outcome. MATERIALS AND METHOD A total of 721 patients, from 5 of our previous studies, were included. With primary outcome measure as death, a prognostic model was derived using binary logistic regression. The model was assessed using discrimination and calibration, and internally validated using the bootstrap method. A bedside prognostic score was derived by rounding of the regression coefficients to the nearest integers. RESULTS A total of 126 (17.48%) patients died. The final model found that higher age, stage III disease, baseline MBI ≤ 12, papilledema and hydrocephalus were significant predictors of death. The final model showed good discrimination as evident by an AUC = 83.1% (95% confidence interval 79.5%-86.7%, P < .001) and good calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow test P = .579). The model remained valid after internal validation by boot strapping. A simple bedside score with the acronym MASH-P to denote variables baseline MBI (M), age (A), stage (S), hydrocephalus (H) and papilledema (P), was thus derived. The score can range from 0 to 10. Higher the score, higher is the probability of death; a score of 0 carries a predicted probability of just 1.7% while a score of 10 corresponds to a predicted probability of 65%. An electronic ready reckoner has also been developed to aid prognostication on the go. CONCLUSION MASH-P is a simple prognostic scoring model that can be used at bedside and aid in decision making as well as counselling.","Rizvi, Imran; Malhotra, Hardeep Singh; Garg, Ravindra Kumar; Kumar, Neeraj",Journal of the neurological sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408191/,147

In armed conflict settings, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure poses major health risks for women and children. This review aimed to synthesise the existing information on WASH interventions being delivered to women and children in conflict settings in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to identify the personnel, sites and platforms being used to deliver such interventions. METHODS We conducted a systematic search for publications indexed in four databases, and grey literature was searched through the websites of humanitarian agencies and organisations. Eligible publications reported WASH interventions delivered to conflict-affected women or children. We extracted and synthesised information on intervention delivery characteristics, as well as barriers and facilitators. RESULTS We identified 58 eligible publications reporting on the delivery of WASH interventions, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)/United Nations (UN) agency staff were reported to be involved in delivering interventions in 62% of publications, with the most commonly reported delivery site being community spaces (50%). Only one publication reported quantitative data on intervention effectiveness among women or children. DISCUSSION This review revealed gaps in the current evidence on WASH intervention delivery in conflict settings. Little information is available on the delivery of water treatment or environmental hygiene interventions, or about the sites and personnel used to deliver WASH interventions. Limited quantitative data on WASH intervention coverage or effectiveness with respect to women or children are important gaps, as multiple factors can affect how WASH services are accessed differently by women and men, and the hygiene needs of adolescent girls and boys differ; these factors must be taken into account when delivering interventions in conflict settings.

Minimizing patient morbidity and cost by avoiding separate surgical procedures is advantageous, provided technical feasibility, and safety data. Our goal was to assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting robotic renal surgery and prostatectomy. We present our initial experience. PURPOSE To assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting concurrent robot-assisted renal surgery and radical prostatectomy utilizing the same port access scheme. PATIENTS AND METHODS From February 2009 to June 2009, we performed single-setting concurrent robot-assisted radical nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy on two patients with synchronous kidney tumors and prostate cancer. Identical port sites were used during both aspects of the procedure with the exception of one additional port during prostatectomy. Prostate cancer clinical stage and Gleason scores were T1c and 6 and T2a and 7, respectively. Corresponding renal tumors were 5 cm, respectively. RESULTS Both operations were performed, with no conversion to open surgery. There were no intraoperative complications and the postoperative course was uneventful in both patients. Discharge was on postoperative day 2 and 3, respectively. Patient 2 had an episode of delayed bleeding on postoperative day 9, treated by selective angio-embolization. Mean operative time for nephrectomy and prostatectomy (135 and 139 minutes, respectively) and estimated blood loss (75 and 100 mL, respectively) were reasonable. We began with the renal portion utilizing a lateral decubitus position before re-positioning into the lithotomy position for the prostatic portion. Clamping time was 34 minutes during partial nephrectomy. CONCLUSION Single-setting robotic radical/partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy is technically feasible and safe in properly selected patients who present with synchronous primary renal and prostate malignancies.","Boncher, Nicholas; Vricella, Gino; Greene, Graham; Madi, Rabii",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20645872/,147

144276,2019 Chinese clinical guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma: updates and insights.,2020-08-01,"COVID-19 has recently caused a global health crisis and an effective interventional therapy is urgently needed. Remdesivir is one effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA replication. It supersedes other NTP analogues because it not only terminates the polymerization activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), but also inhibits the proofreading activity of intrinsic exoribonuclease (ExoN). Even though the static structure of Remdesivir binding to RdRp has been solved and biochemical experiments have suggested it to be a ""delayed chain terminator"", the underlying molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 24 microseconds to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on nucleotide addition and proofreading. We found that when Remdesivir locates at an upstream site in RdRp, the 1'-cyano group experiences electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge (Asp865-Lys593), which subsequently halts translocation. Our findings can supplement the current understanding of the delayed chain termination exerted by Remdesivir and provide an alternative molecular explanation about Remdesivir's inhibitory mechanism. Such inhibition also reduces the likelihood of Remdesivir to be cleaved by ExoN acting on 3'-terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, our study also suggests that Remdesivir's 1'-cyano group can disrupt the cleavage site of ExoN via steric interactions, leading to a further reduction in the cleavage efficiency. Our work provides plausible and novel mechanisms at the molecular level of how Remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Wang, Xiaowei; Yuan, Congmin; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen, Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp05948j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688867/,147

Remodeling of gastric tissues was analyzed by routine histology and immunohistochemistry studies, and qRT-PCR analyses of ghrelin and gastrin mRNA levels. In obese rats with impaired glucose tolerance, VSG and RYGB caused substantial weight loss and rats greatly improved their oral glucose tolerance. The remaining gastric mucosa after VSG and gastric pouch (GP) after RYGB revealed a hyperplasia of the mucous neck cells that displayed a strong immunoreactivity for parietal cell H+/K+-ATPase. Ghrelin mRNA levels were reduced by 2-fold in remaining fundic mucosa after VSG and 10-fold in GP after RYGB. In the antrum, gastrin mRNA levels were reduced after VSG in line with the reduced number of gastrin positive cells. This study reports novel and important observations dealing with the remaining gastric mucosa after RYGB and VSG. The data demonstrate, for the first time, a hyperplasia of the mucous neck cells, a transit cell population of the stomach bearing differentiating capacities into zymogenic and peptic cells.","Arapis, Konstantinos; Cavin, Jean Baptiste; Gillard, Laura; Cluzeaud, Françoise; Lettéron, Philippe; Ducroc, Robert; Le Beyec, Johanne; Hourseau, Muriel; Couvelard, Anne; Marmuse, Jean-Pierre; Le Gall, Maude; Bado, André",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822172/,147
144457,Nipah virus disease: A rare and intractable disease.,2019,"BACKGROUND Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon vascular lesions, and hemorrhage secondary to AVM rupture results in significant morbidity and mortality. AVMs may be treated by endovascular embolization, and technical advances in microcatheter design are likely to improve the success and safety of endovascular embolization of cerebral AVMs. OBJECTIVE To describe our early experience with the Headway Duo microcatheter for embolization of cerebral AVMs with n-butyl-cyanoacrylate (n-BCA). METHODS Consecutive patients treated by endovascular embolization of a cerebral AVM with n-BCA delivered intra-arterially through the Headway Duo microcatheter (167 cm length) were identified. Patient demographic information, procedural details, and patient outcome were determined from electronic medical records. RESULTS Ten consecutive patients undergoing cerebral AVM embolization using n-BCA injected through the Headway Duo microcatheter were identified. Presenting symptoms included headache, hemorrhage, seizures, and weakness. Spetzler Martin grades ranged from 1 to 5, and AVMs were located in the basal ganglia (2 patients), parietal lobe (4 patients), frontal lobe (1 patient), temporal lobe (1 patient), an entire hemisphere (1 patient), and posterior fossa (1 patient). 50 arterial pedicles were embolized, and all procedures were technically successful. There was one post-procedural hemorrhage that was well tolerated by the patient, and no other complications occurred. Additional AVM treatment was performed by surgery and radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS The Headway Duo microcatheter is safe and effective for embolization of cerebral AVMs using n-BCA. The trackability and high burst pressure of the Headway Duo make it an important and useful tool for the neurointerventionalist during cerebral AVM embolization.","Heit, Jeremy J; Faisal, Abigail G S; Telischak, Nicholas A; Choudhri, Omar; Do, Huy M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603031/,147

Pain persists for years in approximately 10 % of those afflicted with acute herpes zoster. The likelihood of postherpetic neuralgia increases with older age, severity of the zoster, trigeminal location, and other factors. Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain and treatment usually involves sequential trials of topical and systemic drugs; a variety of other therapies may be considered in refractory cases. A new topical capsaicin 8 % patch has been approved for this indication based on the positive studies in patients with non-trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia. Experience with the use of the capsaicin 8 % patch for trigeminal distribution neuralgia is lacking.

METHODS Systematic review of published scientific evidence. A search of six bibliographic databases and grey literature was executed to identify relevant studies conducted in Malawi in the English language, with no time or study design restrictions. Data extraction was conducted in Excel and evidence synthesis followed a thematic analysis approach to identify and compare emerging themes. RESULTS One hundred and one unique records were retrieved and 6 studies were selected for final inclusion in the review. Multiple factors affect breast and cervical cancer service delivery in Malawi, operating at three interlinked levels. At the patient level, lack of knowledge and awareness of the disease, location, poor screening environment and perceived quality of care may act as deterrent to participation in screening; at the health facility level, services are affected by the availability of resources and delivery modalities; and at the healthcare system level, inadequate funding and staffing (distribution, supervision, retention), and lack of appropriate monitoring and guidelines may have a negative impact on services. Convenience of screening, in terms of accessibility (location, opening times) and integration with other health services (e.g. reproductive or HIV services), was found to have a positive effect on service uptake. Building awareness of cancer and related services, and offering quality screening (dedicated room, privacy, staff professionalism etc.) are significant determinants of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS Capitalising on these lessons is essential to strengthen breast and cervical cancer service delivery in Malawi, to increase early detection and to improve survival of women affected by the disease.","Pittalis, Chiara; Panteli, Emily; Schouten, Erik; Magongwa, Irene; Gajewski, Jakub",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07610-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183270/,147

DESIGN Systematic review. POPULATION Adults (aged 18 years and over) with intellectual disabilities. INTERVENTIONS A move from residential to community setting. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Studies were eligible if evaluating effect on QoL or life quality, as defined by study authors. SEARCH We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EconLit, Embase and Scopus to September 2017 and supplemented this with grey literature searches. We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme suite of tools, excluding those judged to be of poor methodological quality. RESULTS Thirteen studies were included; eight quantitative studies, two qualitative, two mixed methods studies and one case study. There was substantial agreement across quantitative and qualitative studies that a move to community living was associated with improved QoL. QoL for people with any level of intellectual disabilities who move from any type of institutional setting to any type of community setting was increased at up to 1 year postmove (standardised mean difference [SMD] 2.03; 95% CI [1.21 to 2.85], five studies, 246 participants) and beyond 1 year postmove (SMD 2.34. 95% CI [0.49 to 4.20], three studies, 160 participants), with total QoL change scores higher at 24 months comparative to 12 months, regardless of QoL measure used. CONCLUSION Our systematic review demonstrated a consistent pattern that moving to the community was associated with improved QoL compared with the institution. It is recommended that gaps in the evidence base, for example, with regard to growing populations of older people with intellectual disability and complex needs are addressed.

146358,[Supraglottic airways in infants and children].,2013,"BACKGROUND We aimed to synthesise qualitative studies exploring medication-related experiences of polypharmacy among patients with multimorbidity. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature in February 2020 for primary, peer-reviewed qualitative studies about multimorbid patients' medication-related experiences with polypharmacy, defined as the use of four or more medications. Identified studies were appraised for methodological quality by applying the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative research, and data were extracted and synthesised by the meta-aggregation approach. RESULTS We included 13 qualitative studies, representing 499 patients with polypharmacy and a wide range of chronic conditions. Overall, most Critical Appraisal Skills Programme items were reported in the studies. We extracted 140 findings, synthesised these into 17 categories, and developed five interrelated syntheses: (1) patients with polypharmacy are a heterogeneous group in terms of needing and appraising medication information; (2) patients are aware of the importance of medication adherence, but it is difficult to achieve; (3) decision-making about medications is complex; (4) multiple relational factors affect communication between patients and physicians, and these factors can prevent patients from disclosing important information; and (5) polypharmacy affects patients' lives and self-perception, and challenges with polypharmacy are not limited to practical issues of medication-taking. DISCUSSION Polypharmacy poses many challenges to patients, which have a negative impact on quality of life and adherence. Thus, when dealing with polypharmacy patients, it is crucial that healthcare professionals actively solicit individual patients' perspectives on challenges related to polypharmacy. Based on the reported experiences, we recommend that healthcare professionals upscale communicative efforts and involve patients' social network on an individualised basis to facilitate shared decision-making and treatment adherence in multimorbidpatients with polypharmacy.","Eriksen, Christian Ulrich; Kyriakidis, Stavros; Christensen, Line Due; Jacobsen, Ramune; Laursen, Jannie; Christensen, Mikkel Bring; Frølich, Anne",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895268/,147

146588,Haemopoietic cell transplantation in patients living with HIV.,2020-08-10,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate health outcomes and the economic burden of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States. METHODS Hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) from April 1 - October 31, 2020 were identified in the Premier Healthcare COVID-19 Database. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, and concomitant medical conditions were assessed. Hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital charges, and hospital costs were evaluated overall and stratified by age groups, insurance types, and 4 COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage. RESULTS Of the 173,942 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, median age was 63 years, 51.0% were male, and 48.5% were covered by Medicare. The most prevalent concomitant medical conditions were cardiovascular disease (73.5%), hypertension (64.8%), diabetes (40.7%), obesity (27.0%), and chronic kidney disease (24.2%). Approximately one-fifth (21.9%) of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU and 16.9% received IMV; most patients (73.6%) did not require ICU admission or IMV, and 12.4% required both. The median hospital LOS was 5 days, in-hospital mortality was 13.6%, median hospital charges were $43,986, and median hospital costs were $12,046. Hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality increased with ICU and/or IMV usage and age; hospital charges and costs increased with ICU and/or IMV usage. Patients with both ICU and IMV usage had the longest median hospital LOS (15 days), highest in-hospital mortality (53.8%), and highest hospital charges ($198,394) and hospital costs ($54,402). LIMITATIONS This retrospective administrative database analysis relied on coding accuracy and a subset of admissions with validated/reconciled hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS This study summarizes the severe health outcomes and substantial hospital costs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US.

METHODS We gathered clinical and initial laboratory variables on consecutive inpatients with COVID-19 who had either died or been discharged alive at 6 US health centers. Logistic regression was used to develop a predictive model using no laboratory values (COVID-NoLab) and one adding tests available in many outpatient settings (COVID-SimpleLab). The models were converted to point scores and their accuracy evaluated in an internal validation group. RESULTS We identified 1340 adult inpatients with complete data for nonlaboratory parameters and 741 with complete data for white blood cell (WBC) count, differential, c-reactive protein (CRP), and serum creatinine. The COVID-NoLab risk score includes age, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation and identified risk groups with 0.8%, 11.4%, and 40.4% mortality in the validation group (AUROCC = 0.803). The COVID-SimpleLab score includes age, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, WBC, CRP, serum creatinine, and comorbid asthma and identified risk groups with 1.0%, 9.1%, and 29.3% mortality in the validation group (AUROCC = 0.833).

The objective of our study was to determine the efficacy of synergistic treatment of daptomycin when given with either cefazolin or cloxacillin for the treatment of MSSA BSI. METHODS A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at two academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patients ≥ 18 years of age with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard of care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days. RESULTS Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention to treat analysis (median age 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.39 days, p=0.40). A modified intention to treat analysis involving participants who remained bacteremic at the time of enrollment found a median duration of bacteremia of 3.06 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 3.0 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.06 days, p=0.77). Ninety-day mortality in the daptomycin arm was 18.9% vs. 17.7% in the placebo arm (p=1.0). CONCLUSION Among patients with MSSA bloodstream infections, the administration of adjunctive daptomycin therapy to standard of care treatment did not shorten the duration of bacteremia and should not be routinely considered.","Cheng, Matthew P; Lawandi, Alexander; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; De l'Etoile-Morel, Samuel; Paquette, Katryn; Lee, Todd C",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667982/,147

147450,Transcriptomic profiling reveals three molecular phenotypes of adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction.,2019,"BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a commonly undiagnosed condition that predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Routine endoscopic screening for BE is not recommended because of the burden this would impose on the health care system. The objective of this study was to determine whether a novel approach using a minimally invasive cell sampling device, the Cytosponge, coupled with immunohistochemical staining for the biomarker Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3), could be used to identify patients who warrant endoscopy to diagnose BE. METHODS AND FINDINGS A case-control study was performed across 11 UK hospitals between July 2011 and December 2013. In total, 1,110 individuals comprising 463 controls with dyspepsia and reflux symptoms and 647 BE cases swallowed a Cytosponge prior to endoscopy. The primary outcome measures were to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and accuracy of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test compared with endoscopy and biopsy. In all, 1,042 (93.9%) patients successfully swallowed the Cytosponge, and no serious adverse events were attributed to the device. The Cytosponge was rated favorably, using a visual analogue scale, compared with endoscopy (p < 0.001), and patients who were not sedated for endoscopy were more likely to rate the Cytosponge higher than endoscopy (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.001). The overall sensitivity of the test was 79.9% (95% CI 76.4%-83.0%), increasing to 87.2% (95% CI 83.0%-90.6%) for patients with ≥3 cm of circumferential BE, known to confer a higher cancer risk. The sensitivity increased to 89.7% (95% CI 82.3%-94.8%) in 107 patients who swallowed the device twice during the study course. There was no loss of sensitivity in patients with dysplasia. The specificity for diagnosing BE was 92.4% (95% CI 89.5%-94.7%). The case-control design of the study means that the results are not generalizable to a primary care population. Another limitation is that the acceptability data were limited to a single measure. CONCLUSIONS The Cytosponge-TFF3 test is safe and acceptable, and has accuracy comparable to other screening tests. This test may be a simple and inexpensive approach to identify patients with reflux symptoms who warrant endoscopy to diagnose BE.","Ross-Innes, Caryn S; Debiram-Beecham, Irene; O'Donovan, Maria; Walker, Elaine; Varghese, Sibu; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; Lovat, Laurence; Griffin, Michael; Ragunath, Krish; Haidry, Rehan; Sami, Sarmed S; Kaye, Philip; Novelli, Marco; Disep, Babett; Ostler, Richard; Aigret, Benoit; North, Bernard V; Bhandari, Pradeep; Haycock, Adam; Morris, Danielle; Attwood, Stephen; Dhar, Anjan; Rees, Colin; Rutter, Matthew D D; Sasieni, Peter D; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",PLoS medicine,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25634542/,147

Determinants of H1N1 vaccine uptake among HCP in all work settings need to be identified so that interventions can be developed for use in encouraging uptake of future pandemic or emerging infectious disease vaccines. OBJECTIVE To identify factors influencing nonhospital HCP H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance. DESIGN AND SETTING An H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance questionnaire was administered to HCP working in myriad healthcare settings in March-June 2011. METHODS Surveys were used to assess H1N1 influenza vaccine compliance and examine factors that predicted H1N1 influenza vaccine uptake. RESULTS In all, 3,188 HCP completed the survey. Hospital-based HCP had higher compliance than did non-hospital-based personnel (Χ2 = 142.2, P < .001). In logistic regression stratified by hospital setting versus nonhospital setting, determinants of H1N1 vaccination among non-hospital-based HCP included extent to which H1N1 vaccination was mandated or encouraged, perceived importance of vaccination, access to no-cost vaccine provided on-site, no fear of vaccine side effects, and trust in public health officials when they say that the influenza vaccine is safe. Determinants of hospital-based HCP H1N1 vaccine compliance included having a mandatory vaccination policy, perceived importance of vaccination, no fear of vaccine side effects, free vaccine, perceived seriousness of H1N1 influenza, and trust in public health officials. CONCLUSIONS Non-hospital-based HCP versus hospital-based HCP reasons for H1N1 vaccine uptake differed.

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of amniotic membrane allograft as a mechanical barrier to decrease adhesion formation. METHODS Ten patients having flexor tendon injuries were planned to be recruited to the pilot study. The operative treatment consisted of tendon repair and fixation of amniotic membrane allograft around the repaired tendon. The primary outcome variable was the range of motion of the operated finger 6 months after the operation. Patients were monitored for infections and repair failures. RESULTS The study was terminated owing to unfavorable results after treatment of 5 patients. One patient had extensive stiffness and was subjected to tenolysis and joint release. Histopathological analysis of the tendon sheath revealed focal fibrosis. Another patient had a repair failure. The other 3 patients had fair to good results. CONCLUSIONS It seems improbable that the use of amniotic membrane allograft would yield clinically relevant improvement compared with the existing techniques. However, it remains unclear whether the unfavorable results are associated with technical factors, amniotic membrane allograft itself, or an irregular distribution of complications.

Preoperatively and at 6 months follow-up, patients underwent blood draw to determine levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, C peptide, and 2 h oral liquid glucose challenge test (OGTT). HOMA-IR and 1 to 2 h ratios of glucose and fasting to 1 h ratio of insulin were calculated. RESULTS All patients underwent a successful laparoscopic bariatric procedure (VSG =13, DS =13, and RYGB = 12). All operations reduced BMI, HgbA1c, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. HOMA IR and glucose tolerance improved with all procedures. In response to OGTT at 6 months, there was a 20-fold increase in insulin at 1 h in RYGB, which was not seen in DS. At 6 months, 1-h insulin was markedly lower in DS (p < .05), yet HbA1C was also lower in DS (p < .05). This resulted in 1- to 2-h glucose ratio of 1.9 for RYGB, 1.8 for VSG, and 1.3 for DS (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS All operations improve insulin sensitivity and decrease HgbA1c. Six-month weight loss was substantial in all groups between 22-29% excess body weight. RYGB results in marked rise in glucose following challenge with corresponding rise in 1-h insulin. VSG has a similar response to RYGB. In comparison, at 6 months following surgery, DS causes a much lower rise in 1-h insulin, with this difference being statistically significant at p < .05. As a result, DS results in a less abrupt reduction in blood glucose. Although 1-h insulin is lower, DS patients had the lowest HbA1C at 6 months (p < .05). We believe that these findings have important implications for the choice of bariatric procedure for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.","Roslin, Mitchell S; Dudiy, Yuriy; Weiskopf, Joanne; Damani, Tanuja; Shah, Paresh",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0686-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22684853/,147

Only a few studies have evaluated the reverse-flow FAB flap for skull base defects. Design Eight FAB flaps were raised in four cadaveric heads and divided into thirds; the facial artery's course at the superior and inferior borders of the flap was measured noting in which incisional third of the flap it laid. The flap's reach to the anterior cranial fossa, sella turcica, clival recess, and contralateral cribriform plate were studied. A clinical case and operative video are also presented. Results The facial artery had a near vertical course and stayed with the middle (⅝) or posterior third (⅜) of the flap in the inferior and superior incisions. Seven of eight flaps covered the sellar/planar regions. Only four of eight flaps covered the contralateral cribriform region. Lastly, none reached the middle third of the clivus. Conclusions The FAB flap requires an understanding of the facial artery's course, generally seen in the middle third of the flap, and is an appropriate alternative for sellar/planar and ipsilateral cribriform defects.","Farzal, Zainab; Lemos-Rodriguez, Ana M; Rawal, Rounak B; Overton, Lewis J; Sreenath, Satyan B; Patel, Mihir R; Zanation, Adam M","Journal of neurological surgery.

An 88-year-old Japanese man presented with abdominal pain, distension, and appetite loss. Computed tomography demonstrated distended ileum adherent to cecum with thickened walls. He was diagnosed with SBO, and open ileoceal resection was eventually performed. Pathological examination revealed that a pedunculated polyp had obstructed the appendiceal foramen and triggered acute appendicitis, thus leading to SBO. Histopathological examination of the polyp revealed that the long fronds of the adenoma were lined by dysplastic epithelial cells, which is a characteristic feature of TSA. This case report illustrates that a tiny TSA can trigger the obstruction of the appendiceal foramen and lead to acute appendicitis and SBO. We underline the need for the resection of the polyps in this region regardless of their size.","Akabane, Shota; Oonishi, Takahisa; Takenoue, Tomohiro; Kawamoto, Tatsunari; Kunimura, Toshiaki",Journal of surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjz047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834108/,147

METHODS Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020. RESULTS A sample of 1281 members aged 19-81 years were included (31% females; mean ± SD age 49 ± 11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep. CONCLUSION Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with sleep disturbances, but change in PA level during the COVID-19 lockdown did not influence the association between mental health and sleep disturbances.","Ernstsen, Linda; Havnen, Audun",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32951994/,147

Additionally, we assessed the utility of a screening tool in predicting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing results in our cohort. METHODS This was an observational study in which all women who were scheduled for a planned delivery within the Mount Sinai Health system from April 4 to April 15, 2020, were contacted and provided with an appointment for themselves as well as their support persons to undergo COVID-19 testing 1 day before their scheduled delivery. Both the patients and the support persons were administered a standardized screen specific for COVID-19 infection by telephone interview. Those support persons who screened positive were not permitted to attend the birth. All patients and screen-negative support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. RESULTS During the study period, 155 patients and 146 support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 15.5% (CI 9.8-21.2%) and 9.6% (CI 4.8-14.4%) among patients and support persons, respectively. The rate of discordance among tested pairs was 7.5%. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, 58% of their support persons also had infection; in patients without infection, fewer than 3.0% of their support persons had infection. CONCLUSION We found that more than 15% of asymptomatic maternity patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite having screened negative with the use of a telephone screening tool. Additionally, 58% of their asymptomatic, screen-negative support persons also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alternatively, testing of the support persons of women who had tested negative for COVID-19 infection had a low yield for positive results. This has important implications for obstetric and newborn care practices as well as for health care professionals.","Bianco, Angela; Buckley, Ayisha B; Overbey, Jessica; Smilen, Scott; Wagner, Brian; Dinglas, Cheryl; Loudon, Holly; Garely, Alan; Brodman, Michael; Stone, Joanne",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433448/,147

Vaccines are the most promising solution to mitigate new viral strains. The genome sequence and protein structure of the 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) were made available in record time, allowing the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines along with subunit vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment. Nanotechnology benefits modern vaccine design since nanomaterials are ideal for antigen delivery, as adjuvants, and as mimics of viral structures. In fact, the first vaccine candidate launched into clinical trials is an mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles. To eradicate pandemics, present and future, a successful vaccine platform must enable rapid discovery, scalable manufacturing and global distribution. Here, we review current approaches to COVID-19 vaccine development and highlight the role of nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing.","Shin, Matthew D; Shukla, Sourabh; Chung, Young Hun; Beiss, Veronique; Chan, Soo Khim; Ortega-Rivera, Oscar A; Wirth, David M; Chen, Angela; Sack, Markus; Pokorski, Jonathan K; Steinmetz, Nicole F",Nature nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-020-0737-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669664/,147

150326,Commentary on Martínez-Loredo et al.: Where do we go from here? Increasing the clinical utility of alcohol purchase tasks by expanding our definition of constraint.,2021-03-24,"PROBLEM Value-added medical education (VAME) has been difficult to implement due to student and educator constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a mass transition to online learning, removed students from clinical settings, and underscored students' desires for meaningful VAME opportunities. The authors introduced the Stanford Frontline COVID-19 Consult Service (SFCS), through which off-service medical and physician assistant (PA) students provided assistance to clinicians in the form of rapid research regarding COVID-19 clinical questions. APPROACH The SFCS, a student-derived VAME initiative, was implemented from March to May 2020 by Stanford University medical students, PA students, and faculty. SFCS aligned with not only the interests of clinicians and students, but also national accreditation standards. Students attended weekly editorial meetings, didactic sessions on literature reviews and information management, and they underwent rigorous training on the peer-review process. After two months, the authors expanded the service to local community clinicians. OUTCOMES The SFCS enrolled 16 students, was supported by 13 faculty members, and produced 87 peer-reviewed evidence syntheses. Of the 16 SFCS students, 13 (81%) completed evaluations; of 128 Stanford Primary Care and Population Health clinicians, 48 (38%) completed evaluations. Overall student satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.9/5 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3). Self-assessed achievement of SFCS learning objectives exceeded 90% for all objectives. Overall faculty satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.4/5 (SD 0.8). Most faculty (40/46 [87%]) planned to use the database to answer future COVID-19 questions. NEXT STEPS The SFCS is a novel, student-initiated VAME curriculum focused on increasing students' meaningful contributions to patient care. The authors will track SFCS students throughout their clerkships to gauge clerkship performance/preparedness, and they will develop training for integrating VAME into preclerkship curricula at other institutions. Given its adaptive, student-driven design, the VAME framework used to develop the SFCS empowers students to create their own personalized, experiential learning.","Zhou, Bright; Calkins, Christopher; Jayaraman, Tanvi; Cassells, Sandrene; Rotto, Torsten; Vaughan, Laura; Srinivasan, Malathi; Schillinger, Erika",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983140/,147

150542,Best practices in cancer nanotechnology: perspective from NCI nanotechnology alliance.,2012,"High-grade atrioventricular block (HAVB) is historically considered a marker of worse outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the predictors and prognostic impact of HAVB in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era remain poorly understood. We sought to describe the characteristics and predictors of HAVB in patients undergoing primary PCI in STEMI and to assess the prognostic significance of HAVB in the contemporary reperfusion era. The present analysis includes 3,115 patients presenting with STEMI from the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial who underwent primary PCI. Outcomes were examined according to the presence of HAVB on a presenting electrocardiogram, as interpreted by an independent electrocardiography core laboratory. HAVB (second-degree Mobitz II or third-degree atrioventricular block) was present at baseline in 46 patients (1.5%). Independent predictors of HAVB included increased age, diabetes mellitus, right coronary artery occlusion, sum of ST-segment deviation, and baseline Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 3 was restored in 83.7% and 91.5% of patients with versus without baseline HAVB respectively (p = 0.06). Mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with versus without HAVB at 30-day, 1-, and 3-year follow-ups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 10.48; unadjusted HR 4.37, 95% CI 2.09 to 9.38 and unadjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.91, respectively). After covariate adjustment, mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with HAVB at 1 year (adjusted HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.50, p = 0.03) but not at 30 days (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 5.01, p = 0.33) or 3 years (adjusted HR 0.71 to 3.41, p = 0.27). In conclusion, HAVB is a rare complication of STEMI but remains associated with increased mortality, even after primary PCI.","Kosmidou, Ioanna; Redfors, Björn; Dordi, Rushad; Dizon, José M; McAndrew, Thomas; Mehran, Roxana; Ben-Yehuda, Ori; Mintz, Gary S; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.01.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267964/,147

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective case series at an academic tertiary referral center from August 2010 to September 2014. METHODS The da Vinci surgical robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) was used on 16 pediatric patients for 18 procedures. A variety of upper airway pathologies and reconstructions in children with a wide range of ages and weights were treated. No lingual tonsillectomies or base-of-tongue reductions were included. RESULTS Sixteen children (6 males) underwent 18 TORS procedures, including resection of hamartoma (n = 1), repair of laryngeal cleft (n = 7), removal of saccular cyst (n = 2), release of pharyngeal or esophageal strictures (n = 2), and excision of lymphatic malformations (n = 4). Patient ages ranged from 14 days to 15 years. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients had successful robotic access, and no patients had conversions to open or traditional endoscopic surgery. Hospital courses varied with duration ranging from 1 to 20 days. The median follow up was 22 months. CONCLUSION Applying TORS to the pediatric population can be feasible and safe for appropriate airway pathologies. Because many patients are small in size, there is inherent risk in using robotic instruments and scopes transorally. Pearls in this series include a standardized two-robot experienced attending team and longitudinal airway follow-up.

Settings and Design This was a prospective observational study in a tertiary care center after obtaining the appropriate scientific and ethics committee clearance. Subjects and Methods Forty-five patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the time period from March 2018 to May 2019, were enrolled in the study. A planning computed tomography (CT) scan (CTplan) was done for all patients, followed by scans after 15 fractions (CT15) and after 25 fractions (CT25). The volume changes and the subsequent dose changes were assessed and recorded. Statistical Analysis Used Data entry was done in MS Excel spreadsheet. The continuous variables were expressed as mean + standard deviation. The comparison of normally distributed continuous variables was done by paired t-test. Data analysis was done by SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 16.0. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multivariate linear regression model was constructed to study the correlation between mean dose to the parotid glands and the other variables. All statistical modeling and analysis were done using SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) version 9.4. Results Of the 45 patients, 25 were male and 20 were female. The majority of the patients had malignancies in the oral cavity (16) and hypopharynx (14). Most of them had Stage III/IV (AJCC v 8) disease (41). There were a 36% decrease in the PTV-high risk (PTV-HR) volume and a 6.05% decrease in the PTV-intermediate risk (PTV-IR) volume CT15. In CT25, the volume decrease in the PTV-HR and the PTV-IR was 47% and 9.06%, respectively. The parotid glands also underwent a reduction in their volume which has been quantified as 21.7% and 20.9% in the ipsilateral and contralateral parotids in CT15 and 36% and 33.6% in CT25, respectively. The D2 (dose received by 2% of the volume) and D98 (dose received by 98% of the volume) of the PTV-IR showed changes of +3.5% and -0.2% in CT15 and + 4.6% and -0.31% in CT25, respectively. The homogeneity index and conformity number of the PTV-IR changes by 0.03 and 0.08 in CT15 and by 0.04 and 0.12 in CT25, respectively. The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland increased by 14% in CT15 and 19% in CT25. The mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland increased by 17% in CT15 and 25% in CT25. Conclusion The dose to the parotid glands increases as a result of the changes that occur during the course of radiation. The changes are significant after 15 fractions of radiation. A replanning at this juncture might be considered to reduce the dose to the parotid glands.","Ilangovan, Bhargavi; Venkatraman, Murali; Balasundaram, Subathira",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_589_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719270/,147
150807,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines in the United States and implications for the kidney transplant community.,2020-08-29,"INTRODUCTION Acute kidney injury (AKI) can evolve quickly and clinical measures of function often fail to detect AKI at a time when interventions are likely to provide benefit. Identifying early markers of kidney damage has been difficult due to the complex nature of human AKI, in which multiple etiologies exist. The objective of this study was to identify and validate novel biomarkers of AKI. METHODS We performed two multicenter observational studies in critically ill patients at risk for AKI - discovery and validation. The top two markers from discovery were validated in a second study (Sapphire) and compared to a number of previously described biomarkers. In the discovery phase, we enrolled 522 adults in three distinct cohorts including patients with sepsis, shock, major surgery, and trauma and examined over 300 markers. In the Sapphire validation study, we enrolled 744 adult subjects with critical illness and without evidence of AKI at enrollment; the final analysis cohort was a heterogeneous sample of 728 critically ill patients. The primary endpoint was moderate to severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 to 3) within 12 hours of sample collection. RESULTS Moderate to severe AKI occurred in 14% of Sapphire subjects. The two top biomarkers from discovery were validated. Urine insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, a key mechanism implicated in AKI, together demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (0.76 and 0.79 alone). Urine [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was significantly superior to all previously described markers of AKI (P <0.002), none of which achieved an AUC >0.72. Furthermore, [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] significantly improved risk stratification when added to a nine-variable clinical model when analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model, generalized estimating equation, integrated discrimination improvement or net reclassification improvement. Finally, in sensitivity analyses [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] remained significant and superior to all other markers regardless of changes in reference creatinine method. CONCLUSIONS Two novel markers for AKI have been identified and validated in independent multicenter cohorts. Both markers are superior to existing markers, provide additional information over clinical variables and add mechanistic insight into AKI.

151110,The oligometastatic state - separating truth from wishful thinking.,2014,"Already overwhelmed by the burden of communicable diseases, the health systems in South Asia face six global and regional transformational trends, which pose opportunities, challenges and threats. These six trends discussed in the paper are: (i) economic growth and globalization; (ii) technological changes; (iii) labor market changes; (iv) private sector growth; (v) demographic changes; and (vi) epidemiological changes. These trends have created dual challenges for the health systems in South Asia: (i) to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) relating to child and maternal health, and communicable diseases and (ii) to deal with the emerging challenges posed by the six transformational trends. The paper suggests and proposes the use of the transformational trends framework to investigate the various opportunities and challenges, and to design effective policy responses. The capacities and resources of the governments in the region are already stretched by legacy challenges posed by communicable diseases. Hence, effective responses to new challenges will need flexible and innovative approaches including partnership with private sector, civil society, and regional cooperation. The opportunities from the trends are more likely to benefit the richer sections of the society. Therefore, pro-poor measures are necessary to ensure inclusive development.","Bonu, Sekhar; Gutierrez, Leah C; Borghis, Alain; Roche, Frederick C",Health policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038473/,147

RESULTS Weight losses at 3 months were significantly greater in WWO (2.7 kg [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-3.5 kg] than Control (1.3 kg [95% CI, 0.5-2.0 kg]; P = 0.01); neither differed from WWO+AL (2.0 kg [95% CI, 1.3-2.7 kg]; Ps > 0.56). Significantly more WWO participants (24.5%) achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at 3 months than Control (9.4%) (P = 0.01); neither differed from WWO+AL (17.6%) (Ps = 0.13-0.28). At 12 months, there were no significant differences between groups in weight loss (Ps > 0.52). WWO (25.5%) continued to have a higher proportion of participants achieving ≥ 5% weight loss than Control (12.9%) (P = 0.04); neither differed from WWO+AL (14.3%) (Ps > 0.10). There were no significant between-group differences in change in physical activity (Ps > 0.17). CONCLUSIONS WWO produced significantly more weight loss at 3 months relative to Control, but not at 12 months. Significantly more WWO than Control participants lost ≥ 5% at both 3 and 12 months. Participants receiving an activity tracking device did not achieve greater weight loss or physical activity increases than those in a Control condition.","Thomas, J Graham; Raynor, Hollie A; Bond, Dale S; Luke, Anna K; Cardoso, Chelsi C; Foster, Gary D; Wing, Rena R",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.21846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437597/,147

Conventional anaesthesia ventilators include inbuilt spirometry to monitor inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes. The GE Aisys CS2 anaesthesia ventilator allows additional near-patient spirometry via a sensor interposed between the proximal end of the tracheal tube and the respiratory tubing. Near-patient and inbuilt spirometry of two different GE Aisys CS2 anaesthesia ventilators were compared in an in-vitro study. Assessments were made of accuracy and variability in inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume measurements during ventilation of six simulated paediatric lung models using the ASL 5000 test lung. A total of 9240 breaths were recorded and analysed. Differences between inspiratory tidal volumes measured with near-patient and inbuilt spirometry were most significant in the newborn setting (p < 0.001), and became less significant with increasing age and weight. During expiration, tidal volume measurements with near-patient spirometry were consistently more accurate than with inbuilt spirometry for all lung models (p < 0.001). Overall, the variability in measured tidal volumes decreased with increasing tidal volumes, and was smaller with near-patient than with inbuilt spirometry. The variability in measured tidal volumes was higher during expiration, especially with inbuilt spirometry. In conclusion, the present in-vitro study shows that measurements with near-patient spirometry are more accurate and less variable than with inbuilt spirometry. Differences between measurement methods were most significant in the smallest patients. We therefore recommend near-patient spirometry, especially for neonatal and paediatric patients.","Morgenroth, S; Thomas, J; Cannizzaro, V; Weiss, M; Schmidt, A R",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492954/,147

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the 500 most cited physical activity publications and report their bibliometric characteristics. METHODS The Web of Science database (all database indexes) was searched, and bibliometric characteristics were imported and calculated. RESULTS A total of 520 publications were ranked as the top 500. The sum of the citations was 326,258, and the average citation density was 41.0 (45.1) citations per year. Original research articles constituted the major portion of included publications (53.7%; 170,774 citations). Papers reporting relationship of physical activity with health were the most prevalent type of publication included (43.7%; 141,027 citations). Journal impact factor had a weak but significant positive correlation with citation density (r = .12; P = .006). The United States was ranked first in terms of the contributions from institutions and authors contributing to the most cited physical activity papers. CONCLUSIONS Top physical activity publications are well cited compared with other health behavior fields. Original research reporting on the associations between physical activity and health has a higher citation impact compared with other types of original research within the physical activity field. The physical activity research field continues to expand rapidly as newer publications attract more citations in a shorter time span compared with older publications.","Memon, Aamir R; To, Quyen G; Vandelanotte, Corneel",Journal of physical activity & health,https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140424/,147

METHODS Retrospective cohort study between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2018 at a single tertiary care academic pediatric otolaryngology practice of pediatric patients (≤18 years) who underwent tympanostomy tube placement for any indication. Patients had to have insurance providers recorded both at clinic visit and at the time of surgery. Rates of cancelation and postponement of tympanostomy tube placement were assessed. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with cancelation or postponement of surgery. RESULTS Of the 5080 patients, 2961 patients had Medicaid and 2012 patients had private insurance at the time of surgery. A total of 197 (3.96%) patients switched insurance between clinic appointment and date of surgery. Time to surgery was nearly 2 weeks more for those who had a change in insurance vs. those who did not (33 vs. 20 days, P < .001). Those who switched insurance were nearly twice as likely to have to reschedule surgery than those who did not (OR 1.95, CI 1.42-2.67). Patients who had Medicaid as the primary payer also had increased odds of needing to reschedule and postpone surgery (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17-1.63). CONCLUSION Difference in insurance carrier and loss/change of insurance appear to be associated with delays in tympanostomy tube placement. Standardization of re-enrollment schedules across insurance providers or a single payer model may be useful in addressing these delays in care.","Schwartz, Marissa; Shah, Rhea; Wetzel, Martha; Raol, Nikhila","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489420940333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633552/,147

There are numerous causes of OP including acute respiratory infections such as viral and bacterial infections. However, Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) has rarely been reported as a causative pathogen of OP. Here, we report a 67-year-old woman with rapidly progressive pulmonary M. abscessus infection who developed OP and acute respiratory failure (ARF). She was treated successfully with a corticosteroid and anti-mycobacterial therapy. Our observations suggest that pulmonary M. abscessus infection should be added to the list of infectious conditions associated with OP.","Hong, Goohyeon; Kim, Doh Hyung; Kim, Youn Seup",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2017.05.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28740697/,147

We investigated the prognostic value of TgAb positivity in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after initial therapy. Patients and Methods A database of 109 consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and therapeutic lateral neck dissection followed by remnant ablation for PTC between January 1989 and December 2014 was reviewed We recorded the patients' all serum Tg and TgAb levels over time to establish changing trends. Patients were classified as either positive or negative according to serum TgAb levels. The recurrence or persistence rates in both groups were compared. Results Of the 109 patients enrolled 14 patients had TgAb positivity. Thirty-two (29.3%) showed disease recurrence or persistent disease during 101 months of follow-up. Twenty-seven of 95 patients (28.4%) with negative TgAb had persistent or recurrent disease, whereas 5 of 14 patients (35.7%) with positive TgAb had persistence or recurrence (P = 0.57). No significant difference in disease-free survival (115.3 ± 10.8 vs. 224.1 ± 16.6 months, P = 0.78) and overall survival (P = 0.59) was observed between TgAb positive and TgAb negative patients.

Food security exemplifies this inequity and is a distinct determinant of Inuit health. This scoping review focuses on food security-related policies implemented in Nunatsiavut, located in Northern Labrador. The primary objective was to identify the range of existing policies that pertain to food security in Nunatsiavut. The secondary objective was to complete a directed content analysis to map each policy against the applicable dimension of food security. This scoping review followed the Johanna Briggs methodology. The search strategy included the databases: Medline (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL, and Scopus, and a hand search of the relevant journals, conference abstracts and grey literature. This search was undertaken from April 2019 - October 2019. A content analysis mapped each policy against the applicable dimension of food security. Results: The results showed that twenty five policies were identified, spanning three levels of government, that explicitly or implicitly addressed at least one dimension of food security. Accessibility was the most frequent food security dimension identified. The Government of Canada developed 60% of policies and the Nunatsiavut Government implemented 48% of policies. Most policies focused on proximal factors for food security. Identifying distal policies for food security and understanding the impact of existing policies in Nunatsiavut remain as areas of further investigation.

152602,Inhibition of zinc finger protein 367 exerts a tumor suppressive role in colorectal cancer by affecting the activation of oncogenic YAP1 signaling.,2021-08-05,"The overarching goal of positive pressure mechanical ventilation is to provide adequate gas exchange support while not causing harm. Indeed, positive pressure mechanical ventilators are only support technologies, not therapeutic technologies. As such they cannot be expected to ""cure"" disease; they can only ""buy time"" for other therapies (including the patient's own defenses) to work.Conventional approaches to positive pressure ventilation involve applying ventilatory patterns mimicking normal ones through either masks or artificial airways. This is usually done with modes of support incorporating assist/control breath-triggering mechanisms, gas delivery patterns governed by either a set flow or pressure, and breath cycling based on either a set volume, a set inspiratory time, or a set flow. Often this support includes positive end-expiratory pressure and supplemental oxygen. In recent decades several novel or unconventional approaches to providing mechanical ventilatory support have been introduced. For these to be considered of value, however, it would seem reasonable that they address important clinical challenges and be shown to improve important clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, duration of ventilation, sedation needs, complications). This article focuses on challenges facing clinicians in providing mechanical ventilatory support and assesses several novel approaches introduced over the last 2 decades in the context of these challenges.","Al-Hegelan, Mashael; MacIntyre, Neil R",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1351123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934718/,147

In this International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) communication, we examined the importance of identifying the underlying disorder causing DIC to help physicians in the diagnosis and management of this common and severe condition. METHODS Eight DIC experts participated in a three-step consensus process that searched for published guidelines and diagnostic scores on DIC to create a preliminary list of DIC underlying disorders from those reported in the literature Overall, 13 papers were identified, including three guidelines, one harmonization paper by the ISTH, one ISTH recommendation paper on cancer-associated DIC, five general diagnostic scores, two scores specific for pregnancy, and one specific for children. We then assessed the strength of the evidence on the association between the disease and DIC as many postulated DIC-associated disorders are rare. KEY RESULTS Eight main subgroups - 'severe infection', 'solid tumour', 'haematological neoplasia', 'pregnancy complication', 'vascular disease', 'newborn-complication', 'tissue damage due to internal or external insult', and 'chemical and biological agent' - and a detailed list of specific causes of DIC were provided. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Our results suggest more data are needed to determine the association between DIC and specific diseases such as malignant lymphoma, colorectal cancer, or vasculitis, for which the evidence remains limited. When a patient develops a coagulopathy consistent with DIC, the first step is to immediately search for an underlying disorder, including specific causes that are rarely associated with DIC and to consider that patients may have more than one cause of DIC to identify the principal precipitating disorder to prioritize treatment.","Squizzato, Alessandro; Gallo, Andrea; Levi, Marcel; Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Erez, Offer; Ten Cate, Hugo; Solh, Ziad; Gando, Satoshi; Vicente, Vicente; Di Nisio, Marcello",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881338/,147

This paper summarises data from the first two weeks of the study. METHODS COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-Cov-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. RESULTS In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency & Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (122 [67%]), cough (108 [56%]) or fever (98 [51%]). Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%), respectively. Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients respectively. Eleven patients (5%) received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. CONCLUSIONS Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-Cov-2. Although the low incidence of positive cases currently precludes the development of predictive tools, the COVED Project demonstrates that the rapid establishment of an agile clinical registry for emergency care is feasible.","O'Reilly, G M; Mitchell, R D; Rajiv, P; Wu, J; Brennecke, H; Brichko, L; Noonan, M P; Hiller, R; Mitra, B; Luckhoff, C; Paton, A; Smit, D V; Santamaria, M J; Cameron, P A",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378797/,147

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of adolescent alcohol and Δ9-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) vapour co-exposure on cognitive- and reward-related behaviours. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received vapourized THC (10 mg of THC vapourized for four adolescent rats) or vehicle every other day (from post-natal day (PND) 28-42) and had continuous voluntary access to ethanol (10% volume/volume) in adolescence. Alcohol intake was measured during the exposure period to assess the acute effects of THC on alcohol consumption. In adulthood (PND 56+), rats underwent behavioural testing. Adolescent rats showed higher alcohol preference, assessed using the two-bottle choice test, on days on which they were not exposed to THC vapour. In adulthood, rats that drank alcohol as adolescents exhibited short-term memory deficits and showed decreased alcohol preference; on the other hand, rats exposed to THC vapour showed learning impairments in a delay-discounting task. Vapourized THC, alcohol or their combination had no effect on anxiety-like behaviours in adulthood. Our results show that although adolescent THC exposure acutely affects alcohol drinking, adolescent alcohol and cannabis co-use may not produce long-term additive effects.","Hamidullah, Shahnaza; Lutelmowski, Claudia D; Creighton, Samantha D; Luciani, Karling R; Frie, Jude A; Winters, Boyer D; Khokhar, Jibran",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069816/,147

This trial examines the value of prophylactic intraperitoneal onlay mesh to reduce the risk of incisional hernia after a median follow-up time of 5.3 years. METHODS We conducted a parallel group, open-label, single center, randomized controlled trial (NCT01003067). After midline incision, the participants were either allocated to abdominal wall closure according to Everett with a PDS-loop running suture reinforced by an intraperitoneal composite mesh strip (Group A) or the same procedure without the additional mesh strip (Group B). RESULTS A total of 276 patients were randomized (Group A = 131; Group B = 136). Follow-up data after a median of 5.3 years after surgery were available from 183 patients (Group A = 95; Group B = 88). Incisional hernia was diagnosed in 25/95 (26%) patients in Group A and in 46/88 (52%) patients in Group B (risk ratio 0.52; 95% CI 0.36-0.77; p < 0.001). Eighteen patients with asymptomatic incisional hernia went for watchful waiting instead of hernia repair and remained free of symptoms after of a median follow-up of 5.1 years. Between the second- and fifth-year follow-up period, no complication associated with the mesh could be detected. CONCLUSION The use of a composite mesh in intraperitoneal onlay position significantly reduces the risk of incisional hernia during a 5-year follow-up period. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER Ref.

For feasibility, we assessed contact, preliminary screening and recruitment rates, adherence, and using a 5-point Likert scale to satisfaction and safety of the booklet. In the IG, we assessed preliminary changes in DPN symptoms, DPN severity (classified by a fuzzy model) and foot-ankle range of motion between baseline and Week 8. In the first 20 weeks, 1310 individuals were screened for eligibility by phone contact. Contact rate was 89% (contacted participants/20w), preliminary screening success 28% (participants underwent screening/20w), and recruitment rate 1.0 participants/week (eligible participants/20w). The recruitment rate was less than the ideal rate of 5 participants/week. The adherence to the exercises programme was 77%, and the dropout was 11% and 9% for the IG and CG, respectively. In the IG, participants' median level of satisfaction was 4 (IQR: 4-5) and perceived safety was 3 (IQR: 3-5). IG significantly decreased the DPN severity (p = 0.020), increased hallux relative to forefoot (first metatarsal) range of motion (ROM) (p < 0.001) and decreased maximum forefoot relative to hindfoot (midfoot motion) dorsiflexion during gait (p = 0.029).

METHODS Two reviewers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to locate original articles that compared SILH and CLH for inguinal hernia that were published until October 2015. Operative time, conversions, complications, length of hospital stay, recurrence, postoperative pain at 24 hours, and postoperative pain at 7 days were compared using Stata software, version 12.0. RESULTS Sixteen studies were selected for this analysis, which included a total of 1672 patients (907 in SILH and 765 in CLH). SILH showed a longer operative time; however, conversions, complications, length of hospital stay, recurrence, postoperative pain at 24 hours, and postoperative pain at 7 days were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis has shown that inguinal hernia repair using SILH is as safe as CLH. However, based on our evidence, we currently believe that SILH is not an efficacious surgical alternative to CLH for inguinal hernias due to the fact that it does not provide significant benefit in postoperative pain and cosmetic outcomes. However, large-scale, well-designed, and multicenter studies will be needed to further confirm the results of this study.","Luo, Shanshan; Wu, Shike; Lai, Hao; Mo, Xianwei; Chen, Jiansi",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350617690308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28164741/,147

Thus, we aimed to determine the impact and safety of BV as maintenance after ASCT in real-world patients. Seventy-five patients with relapsed/refractory HL started on BV consolidation therapy after ASCT due to high risk of relapse, between January 2016 and July 2019, from 25 institutions, were included in the study. The median follow-up time was 26 months. The most common high-risk features were primary refractory or relapsed disease <12 months (n = 61), lack of complete response (CR) to the last salvage regimen (n = 51), and having had at least two salvage regimens (n = 29). At the time of analysis, 42 patients completed consolidation courses, and BV was discontinued in 33 patients. Fifty patients had an ongoing response (CR in 41, PR in 6, and SD in 3 patients), 25 had progressed. Ten died in the follow-up, eight with progressive disease and two due to infection while in CR. The 2-year PFS and OS rates were 67.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.77) and 87.61% (95% CI: 0.76-0.94), respectively. Seventeen patients (23%) received BV in the pre-ASCT treatment lines, and there was no survival difference between the BV-naïve and BV-exposed groups.

155031,Eyes on new product development.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway participates in the development and progression of DN. Among the different mechanisms involved in JAK/STAT negative regulation, the family of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins has been proposed as a new target for DN. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of SOCS1 mimetic peptide in a mouse model of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with progressive DN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Six-week-old BTBR (black and tan brachyuric) mice with the ob/ob (obese/obese) leptin-deficiency mutation were treated for 7 weeks with two different doses of active SOCS1 peptide (MiS1 2 and 4 µg/g body weight), using inactive mutant peptide (Mut 4 µg) and vehicle as control groups. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed to obtain blood, urine and kidney tissue for further analysis. RESULTS Treatment of diabetic mice with active peptide significantly decreased urine albumin to creatinine ratio by up to 50%, reduced renal weight, glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage, and restored podocyte numbers. Kidneys from treated mice exhibited lower inflammatory infiltrate, proinflammatory gene expression and STAT activation. Concomitantly, active peptide administration modulated redox balance markers and reduced lipid peroxidation and cholesterol transporter gene expression in diabetic kidneys. CONCLUSION Targeting SOCS proteins by mimetic peptides to control JAK/STAT signaling pathway ameliorates albuminuria, morphological renal lesions, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipotoxicity, and could be a therapeutic approach to T2D kidney disease.","Opazo-Ríos, Lucas; Sanchez Matus, Yenniffer; Rodrigues-Díez, Raúl R; Carpio, Daniel; Droguett, Alejandra; Egido, Jesús; Gomez-Guerrero, Carmen; Mezzano, Sergio",BMJ open diabetes research & care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900697/,147

155287,Sustained Effects on Lung Function in Community Members Following Exposure to Hazardous PM2.5 Levels from Wildfire Smoke.,2020-08-05,"OBJECTIVES Prone position ventilation is a potentially life-saving ancillary intervention but is not widely adopted for coronavirus disease 2019 or acute respiratory distress syndrome from other causes. Implementation of lung-protective ventilation including prone positioning for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome is limited by isolation precautions and personal protective equipment scarcity. We sought to determine the safety and associated clinical outcomes for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with prolonged prone position ventilation without daily repositioning. DESIGN Retrospective single-center study. SETTING Community academic medical ICU. PATIENTS Sequential mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS Lung-protective ventilation and prolonged protocolized prone position ventilation without daily supine repositioning. Supine repositioning was performed only when FIO2 less than 60% with positive end-expiratory pressure less than 10 cm H2O for greater than or equal to 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Primary safety outcome: proportion with pressure wounds by Grades (0-4). Secondary outcomes: hospital survival, length of stay, rates of facial and limb edema, hospital-acquired infections, device displacement, and measures of lung mechanics and oxygenation. Eighty-seven coronavirus disease 2019 patients were mechanically ventilated. Sixty-one were treated with prone position ventilation, whereas 26 did not meet criteria. Forty-two survived (68.9%). Median (interquartile range) time from intubation to prone position ventilation was 0.28 d (0.11-0.80 d). Total prone position ventilation duration was 4.87 d (2.08-9.97 d). Prone position ventilation was applied for 30.3% (18.2-42.2%) of the first 28 days. PaO2:FIO2 diverged significantly by day 3 between survivors 147 (108-164) and nonsurvivors 107 (85-146), mean difference -9.632 (95% CI, -48.3 to 0.0; p = 0·05). Age, driving pressure, day 1, and day 3 PaO2:FIO2 were predictive of time to death. Thirty-eight (71.7%) developed ventral pressure wounds that were associated with prone position ventilation duration and day 3 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Limb weakness occurred in 58 (95.1%) with brachial plexus palsies in five (8.2%). Hospital-acquired infections other than central line-associated blood stream infections were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged prone position ventilation was feasible and relatively safe with implications for wider adoption in treating critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients and acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiologies.","Douglas, Ivor S; Swanson, Diandra D; Hiller, Terra; Oakes, Judy; Bach, Jamie; Whelchel, Christopher; Pickering, Jennifer; George, Tobias; Kearns, Mark; Hanley, Michael; Mould, Kara; Roark, Sarah; Mansoori, Jason; Mehta, Anuj; Schmidt, Eric P; Neumeier, Anna",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33405409/,147

The recombinant intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 4.5 hours was approved as an important thrombolytic treatment. However, the recanalization rate was low in patients with a large artery occlusion. The efficacy of intravenous rtPA regarding recanalization of a large artery occlusion was limited. In several clinical trials, pharmacological and mechanical intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy showed improved recanalization rates, but the favorable outcome had not been achieved. Through those trials and errors, researchers have learned that speed of treatment initiation, patient selection by documentation of large artery occlusion and the use of effective devices could be crucial for good clinical outcomes. Finally, five recent randomized controlled trials of endovascular therapy compared to standard medical care have been published. The superiority of endovascular thrombolysis to standard medical care was proved. In this article, we reviewed previous and recent clinical evidence about endovascular thrombolytic therapy of acute ischemic stroke.","Song, Dongbeum; Cho, A-Hyun",Neurointervention,https://doi.org/10.5469/neuroint.2015.10.2.51; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26389007/,147

The RV-C have been refractory to structure determination because they are difficult to propagate in vitro. Here, we report the cryo-EM atomic structures of the full virion and native empty particle (NEP) of RV-C15a. The virus has 60 ""fingers"" on the virus outer surface that probably function as dominant immunogens. Because the NEPs also display these fingers, they may have utility as vaccine candidates. A sequence-conserved surface depression adjacent to each finger forms a likely binding site for the sialic acid on its receptor. The RV-C, unlike other EVs, are resistant to capsid-binding antiviral compounds because the hydrophobic pocket in VP1 is filled with multiple bulky residues. These results define potential molecular determinants for designing antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.","Liu, Yue; Hill, Marchel G; Klose, Thomas; Chen, Zhenguo; Watters, Kelly; Bochkov, Yury A; Jiang, Wen; Palmenberg, Ann C; Rossmann, Michael G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606595113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27511920/,147

The development of automatic vessel sealers has resulted in the revival of a promising surgical alternative to the conventional procedure: close rectal dissection. By preserving the mesorectal layer it is hypothesized that nerve-related and other postoperative complications can be reduced. METHODS All patients with ulcerative colitis with indication for restorative proctocolectomy at our institution during the pilot study underwent the close rectal pouch procedure with temporary diverting ileostomy. Standardized clinical history, anorectal physiology measurements, and endoscopic and histological examination were carried out before and after surgery. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in all 10 patients, with a median age of 41 years and a median postoperative follow-up period of 16 months. There were no cases of pelvic sepsis and bladder or sexual dysfunction. The median daytime defecation frequency was 6.0. Endoscopic and histological examination showed no abnormalities. The anorectal physiology supported the good functional results. CONCLUSION The preliminary results of the close rectal pouch procedure are promising, with good functional results and a low complication rate after 1 year.","de Zeeuw, Sharonne; Ahmed Ali, Usama; van der Kolk, Marion B M; van Laarhoven, Kees C J H M",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000331255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22004850/,147

To date, no ELISA kits specific for CAV-2 antibody have been commercialized for dogs in Korea. OBJECTIVES We aimed to develop new indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) to perform rapid, accurate serological surveys of CAV-2 in dog serum samples. METHODS In total, 165 serum samples were collected from dogs residing in Chungbuk and Gyeongbuk provinces between 2016 and 2018. The Korean CAV-2, named the APQA1701-40P strain, was propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and purified in an anion-exchange chromatography column for use as an antigen for I-ELISA. The virus-neutralizing antibody titers of CAV-2 in the dog sera were measured by virus neutralization (VN) test. RESULTS We compared the results obtained between the VN and new I-ELISA tests. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of new I-ELISA were 98.6%, 86.4% and 97.0% compared with VN test, respectively. New I-ELISA was significantly correlated with VN (r = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that new I-ELISA is useful for sero-surveillance of CAV-2 in dog serum.","Yang, Dong Kun; Kim, Ha Hyun; Lee, Siu; Oh, Dongryul; Yoo, Jae Young; Hyun, Bang Hun",Journal of veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735100/,147

Three independent reviewers conducted quality assessment of forty-six eligible articles and performed thematic synthesis of articles' findings. We distinguish nine key themes describing factors influencing quality care: staffing levels, staff attitude, continuity, routine, environment, decision-making and choice, dignity of risk, activities, and culture and spirituality. While many themes were consistent across studies, residents' prioritization of them varied. Aged care home residents have differing conceptions of quality care as well as heterogeneous and dynamic needs and preferences.

We aim to determine the frequency, determinants, and significance of early seizures after thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke. Methods Data are from the Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED), an international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial where patients with acute ischemic stroke were randomized to low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) IV alteplase. The protocol prespecified prospective data collection on in-hospital seizures over 7 days postrandomization. Logistic regression models were used to determine variables associated with seizures and their significance on poor outcomes of death or disability (modified Rankin scale scores 3-6), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions questionnaire [EQ-5D] over 90 days. Results Data were available for 3,139 acute ischemic stroke participants, of whom 42 (1.3%) had seizures at a median 22.7 hours after the onset of symptoms. Baseline variables associated with seizures were male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-4.50), severe neurologic impairment (NIH Stroke Scale score ≥10; OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.06-4.40), and fever (OR 4.55, 95% CI 2.37-8.71). Seizures independently predicted poor recovery: death or major disability (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.28-6.47), unfavorable ordinal shift of mRS scores (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10-3.39), and lower than median EQ-5D health utility index score (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.37-8.91). There was no association of seizures with sICH in adjusted analysis. Conclusions In thrombolysis-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke, seizures are uncommon, occur early, and predict poor recovery.

The US healthcare system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenged by a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Restricted use, re-use, and sanitation of PPE have been widely adopted to provide protection for frontline healthcare workers caring for often critically ill and highly contagious patients. This objective of this manuscript is to describe our validated process for N95 respirator sanitation. DESIGN Process development, validation, and implementation. SETTING Level-I urban academic medical center. METHODS A multidisciplinary team developed a novel evidence-based process for N95 respirator re-processing and sanitation using ultraviolet (UV) light. Dose measurement, structural integrity, moisture content, particle filtration, fit testing, and environmental testing were performed for both quality control and validation of the process. RESULTS The process achieved UV light dosing for sanitation while maintaining the functional and structural integrity of the N95 respirators, with a daily potential throughput capacity of ˜12,000 masks. This process has supported our health system to provide respiratory PPE to all frontline team members. CONCLUSIONS This novel method of N95 respirator sanitation can safely enable re-use of the N95 respirator essential for healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19. Our high-throughput process can extend local supplies of this critical PPE until the national supply is replenished.","Golladay, Gregory J; Leslie, Kevin A; Zuelzer, Wilhelm A; Cassano, Anthony D; Plauny, Joshua J; Daniels, Frank E; Bearman, Gonzalo; Kates, Stephen L",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526158/,147

However, its efficacy remains to be validated. METHODS Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. RESULTS There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer. The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029), or D-dimer > 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.","Tang, Ning; Bai, Huan; Chen, Xing; Gong, Jiale; Li, Dengju; Sun, Ziyong",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32220112/,147

Methods This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized investigational device exemption trial was conducted across 16 US and German centers between August 2010 and April 2013. Intention-to-treat enrollment was 128 patients (mean age: 71.8 years, 59% male) with 149 lesions (mean length: 34 mm, mean diameter stenosis: 89.5%), and the primary analysis per-protocol population consisted of 105 patients with 123 lesions. The primary efficacy endpoint, technical success, was the achievement of acute debulking with a post-atherectomy residual diameter stenosis ≤50% (before adjunctive therapy). The primary safety endpoint was the major adverse event (MAE) rate through 30 days. Results For the primary analysis per-protocol population, the rate of lesion technical success was 95.1% (117/123), with the lower limit of the 95% CI 90.6%, meeting the prospectively established target performance goal of ≥86%. After post-atherectomy adjunctive therapy, residual stenosis was ≤30% for 99.2% (122/123) of lesions (mean final diameter stenosis 10.5%). Improvement of ≥1 Rutherford class occurred for 74.5% of patients through 30 days and for 80% through six months. MAEs were experienced by 5.7% (6/105) of patients through 30 days (with the upper limit of the 95% CI 11.0%, meeting the target performance goal of <20%), and 16.8% through six months. Six-month freedom from TLR and TVR was 88.0% and 86.1%, respectively. Conclusions Based on the high rate of technical success and the low rates of MAEs through six months, the Phoenix Atherectomy System is safe and effective for the debulking of lower-extremity arterial lesions.

MERS-CoV spread from Saudi Arabia to other countries, including South Korea. Dysfunction of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system has many effects due to genetic complexity and its role in the adaptive immune response. We investigated the association of HLA class I and II alleles with MERS-CoV in 32 patients with MERS. METHODS HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing. RESULTS HLA-DQB1*03:02 are significantly associated with moderate/mild cases of MERS-CoV. Other alleles are no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Treatment strategies based on current research on the HLA gene and MERS-CoV will provide potential therapeutic targets.","Baek, In-Cheol; Choi, Eun-Jeong; Shin, Dong-Hwan; Kim, Hyoung-Jae; Choi, Haeyoun; Shin, Hyoung-Shik; Lim, Dong-Gyun; Kim, Tai-Gyu","Immunity, inflammation and disease",https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637605/,147
159987,Eyes on New Product Development.,2016,"The Mediterranean diet is appraised as the premier dietary regimen and its espousal is correlated with the prevention of degenerative diseases and extended longevity. The consumption of olive oil stands out as the most peculiar feature of the Mediterranean diet. Olive oil rich in various bioactive compounds like oleanolic acid, oleuropein, oleocanthal, and hydroxytyrosol is known for its anti-inflammatory as well as cardioprotective property. Recently in silico studies have indicated that phytochemicals present in olive oil are a potential candidate to act against SARS-CoV-2. Although extensive studies on olive oil and its phytochemical composition; still, some lacunas persist in understanding how the phytochemical composition of olive oil is dependent on upstream processing. The signaling pathways regulated by olive oil in the restriction of various diseases is also not clear. To answer these queries, a detailed search of research and review articles published between 1990 to 2019 were reviewed in this effect. Olive oil consumption was found to be advantageous for various chronic non-communicable diseases. Olive oil's constituents are having potent anti-inflammatory activities and thus restrict the progression of various inflammation-linked diseases ranging from arthritis to cancer. But it is also notable that the amount and nature of phytochemical composition of household olive oil are regulated by its upstream processing and the physicochemical properties of this oil can give a hint regarding the manufacturing method as well as its therapeutic. Moreover, daily uptake of olive oil should be monitored as excessive intake can cause body weight gain and change in the basal metabolic index. So, it can be concluded that olive oil consumption is beneficial for human health, and particularly for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, and inflammation. The simple way of processing olive oil maintains the polyphenol constituents and provides more protection against non-communicable diseases and SARS-CoV-2.","Majumder, Debabrata; Debnath, Mousumi; Sharma, Kamal Nayan; Shekhawat, Surinder Singh; Prasad, G B K S; Maiti, Debasish; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201022666210412143553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845735/,147
160010,Transfusion medicine and blood banking education and training for blood establishment laboratory staff: A review of selected countries in Africa.,2021-03-19,"Re-entrant condensation results in the formation of a condensed protein regime between two critical ion concentrations. The process is driven by neutralization and inversion of the protein charge by oppositely charged ions. Re-entrant condensation of cationic proteins by the polyvalent anions, pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate, has previously been observed, but not for citrate, which has similar charge and size compared to the polyphosphates. Therefore, besides electrostatic interactions, other specific interactions between the polyphosphate ions and proteins must contribute. Here, we show that additional attractive interactions between arginine and tripolyphosphate determine the re-entrant condensation and decondensation boundaries of the cationic, intrinsically disordered saliva protein, histatin 5. Furthermore, we show by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that polyvalent anions cause compaction of histatin 5, as would be expected based solely on electrostatic interactions. Hence, we conclude that arginine-phosphate-specific interactions not only regulate solution properties but also influence the conformational ensemble of histatin 5, which is shown to vary with the number of arginine residues. Together, the results presented here provide further insight into an organizational mechanism that can be used to tune protein interactions in solution of both naturally occurring and synthetic proteins.","Lenton, Samuel; Hervø-Hansen, Stefan; Popov, Anton M; Tully, Mark D; Lund, Mikael; Skepö, Marie",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c01765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730849/,147

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January and December 2009, 11 consecutive pediatric patients underwent treatment of primary UPJO via a laparoscopic approach. All patients underwent LESS-pyeloplasty. Radiographic success was defined as improvement of hydronephrosis with a patent UPJ on intravenous urography, or improved drainage on diuretic renal scan. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 10 (2-17) years. Crossing lower pole vessel and severe adhesion were found in three (27%) and eight (73%) cases, respectively. The mean operating-room time was 182.5 (160-300) min, and the mean estimated blood loss, including urine, was 97.3 (80-160) mL. Mean hospital stay was 2 (1-3) days. Wound infection at port site and urinary infection occurred in one case each. All parents seem extremely satisfied with postoperative cosmetic outcome. The success rate was 100%. CONCLUSION Preliminary experience with LESS-pyeloplasty in children suggests that outcomes are comparable to conventional laparoscopic surgery but with improved cosmesis; however, a larger study is necessary to confirm these findings and to determine if there are any benefits in postoperative pain or recovery.","Tugcu, Volkan; Ilbey, Yusuf Ozlem; Polat, Hakan; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Journal of pediatric urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2010.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131232/,147

Previous work has focused on patients with cancer and COVID-19, but little has been reported on healthcare system changes among patients without COVID-19. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients with breast cancer (BC) in New York City between February 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. New patients were included as were patients scheduled to receive intravenous or injectable therapy. Patients with COVID-19 were excluded. Demographic and treatment information were obtained by chart review. Delays and/or changes in systemic therapy, surgery, radiation, and radiology related to the pandemic were tracked, along with the reasons for delay and/or change. Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to identify factors associated with delay and/or change. RESULTS We identified 350 eligible patients, of whom 149 (42.6%) experienced a delay and/or change, and practice reduction (51.0%) was the most common reason. The patients who identified as Black or African American, Asian, or Other races were more likely to experience a delay and/or change compared with White patients (Black, 44.4%; Asian, 47.1%; Other, 55.6%; White, 31.4%; P = .001). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid compared with commercial insurance (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.32 to 7.27) was associated with increased odds of a delay and/or change, whereas stage II or III BC compared with stage I (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.95; and OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.092, respectively) was associated with decreased odds of a delay and/or change. CONCLUSION Almost half of the patients with BC without COVID-19 had a delay and/or change. We found racial and socioeconomic disparities in the likelihood of a delay and/or change. Further studies are needed to determine the impact these care alterations have on BC outcomes.","Satish, Tejus; Raghunathan, Rohit; Prigoff, Jake G; Wright, Jason D; Hillyer, Grace A; Trivedi, Meghna S; Kalinsky, Kevin; Crew, Katherine D; Hershman, Dawn L; Accordino, Melissa K",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.01062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739850/,147
160941,The MCF10 Model of Breast Tumor Progression.,2021-08-15,"OBJECTIVES The number of young surgeons in Japan has significantly decreased in recent years, which may lead to future problems in the medical field. Therefore, comprehensive training programs for young surgeons are needed. DESIGN Retrospective study SETTING We developed a specific education program called the ""Recruitment of Young Medical Apprentices"" (RYOMA) project. PARTICIPANTS We performed this project between January 2008 and August 2013 on fourth- to sixth-year medical students and internship doctors. The RYOMA project included step-by-step surgical education programs on open and scopic procedures as dry, wet, and animal laboratory training. Our goal was to increase the number of young and specialist surgeons. RESULTS Based on an interview questionnaire answered by 90 medical students, most young students were interested in surgical training and several chose to become surgeons in the future. The most positive opinions regarding the field of surgery were the impressive results achieved with surgery, whereas negative opinions included the difficulty of the surgical skill, physical concerns related to difficult work environments, and the severity of surgical procedures. The present program has begun to resolve negative opinions through adequate training or simulations. Of the 19 medical students and internship doctors who attended the RYOMA project in 2008, 17 trainees (90%) were satisfied with this special surgical program and 16 (88%) showed interest in becoming surgeons. The number of participants considering the field of surgery increased between 2008 and 2013. Of 23 participants, 19 (83%) had a positive opinion of the program after the training. CONCLUSIONS Gaining experience in surgical training from an early stage in medical school and step-by-step authorized education by teaching staff are important for recruiting students and increasing the number of young surgeons.","Nanashima, Atsushi; Hidaka, Shigekazu; Nonaka, Takashi; Yamasaki, Naoya; Tsuchiya, Tomoshi; Matsumoto, Keitaro; Miyazaki, Takuro; Hatachi, Go; Sumida, Yorihisa; Sawai, Terumitsu; Yasutake, Toru; Nagayasu, Takeshi",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776875/,147

There is a lack of consensus on the appropriate management of these patients. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE A 43-year-old male was evaluated for a left flank bulge eight months after a motorcycle collision. He was diagnosed with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia at time of injury that was managed non-operatively. He noticed a left flank bulge two months after his collision that progressively worsened in size and in discomfort. The patient underwent laparoscopic repair of the traumatic flank hernia. His postoperative course was uneventful and there was no recurrence at 3 years. DISCUSSION Historically, exploratory laparotomy was considered necessary in patients diagnosed with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia at time of injury due to the high-percentage of concomitant intra-abdominal injuries. More recent studies suggest that some patients with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia may be safely managed non-operatively. A minority of these patients will require surgery for symptoms or complications related to the hernia and laparoscopic repair performed in a delayed fashion appears to have improved outcomes when compared to those that undergo repair at time of injury. CONCLUSION There is growing evidence supporting a non-operative management strategy in patients with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia who do not have a clear indication for abdominal surgery. These patients may be safely observed with delayed laparoscopic repair using synthetic mesh reserved for traumatic abdominal wall hernias that become symptomatic.","Ferris, Mead; Pirko, Christopher; Nottingham, James",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268063/,147

Characterizing the current state of advocacy training in U.S. medical schools may help set expectations for physician advocacy and predict future curricular needs. METHOD Using the members school directory provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the authors compiled a list of 154 MD-granting medical schools in the United States in 2019-2020. They used multiple search strategies to identify online course catalogues and advocacy-related curricula using variations of the terms ""advocacy,"" ""policy,"" ""equity,"" and ""social determinants of health."" They used an iterative process to generate a preliminary coding schema and to code all course descriptions, conducting content analysis to describe the structure of courses and topics covered. RESULTS Of 134 medical schools with any online course catalogue available, 103 (76.9%) offered at least one advocacy course. Required courses were typically survey courses focused on general content in health policy, population health, or public health/epidemiology, whereas elective courses were more likely to focus specifically on advocacy skills building and to feature field experiences. Of 352 advocacy-specific courses, 93 (26.4%) concentrated on a specific population (e.g., children or persons with low socioeconomic status). Few courses (n = 8) focused on racial/ethnic minorities and racial inequities. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that while most U.S. medical schools offer at least one advocacy course, the majority are elective rather than required, and the structure and content of advocacy-related courses vary substantially. Given the urgency to address social, economic, and political factors affecting health and health equity, this study provides an important and timely overview of the prevalence and content of advocacy curricula at U.S. medical schools.","Brender, Teva D; Plinke, Wesley; Arora, Vineet M; Zhu, Jane M",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039856/,147

Articles with insufficient data on the prevalence of PTSD or without any available full-text were excluded. Major study variables consist of the prevalence of PTSD of the included studies, gender, and the elapsed time after the disaster. The overall PTSD prevalence was determined using a fixed-effect model for eligible studies. Of 4107 studies listed using our search strategy, 439 underwent full-text review, 59 records included in the systematic review, and 39 records met the criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of PTSD among children and adolescent survivors after earthquakes and floods was 19.2% (95%CI = 18.6-19.7%), 30.0% (95%CI = 29.5-30.6%), 24.4% (95%CI = 23.4-25.4%) and 20.4% (95%CI = 19.1-21.7%), in the first, second, third and fourth six-month intervals after the disaster, respectively. Our analysis also revealed that PTSD was more prevalent among girls (p < 0.001). The absence of psychological support for affected areas considerably increases the risk of PTSD among survivors. Our results indicated that children and adolescents, especially girls, are more vulnerable and should be in top priority.

Methods: In this retrospective study, hospitalized elderly people with virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Participants were divided into three groups of mild, moderate, and severe based on oxygenation. The primary outcome was death or discharge to home. Results: A total of 169 patients were studied (mean age: 68 years). Apart from respiratory symptoms, other reported symptoms included gastrointestinal complaints in 11% (n = 19), acute stroke in 1.1% (n = 2), delirium in 1.7% (n = 3), and anosmia or ageusia in 8.88% (n = 15). Also, 65 (38.5%) patients required oxygen support, 25 (14.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 7 (4.1%) required non-invasive ventilation (Fio2 0.6 to 1.0), 14 (8.28%) were mechanically ventilated. 72 (42%) received steroid, and 100 (59%) received prophylactic heparin.

166105,Anti-tumor effects from simultaneous cancer and TAM targeting by 010DS-Zn,2021,"Based on the ways in which people's behavior and perception of space changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, I focus on the special attitude toward air, which goes beyond the common perception expressed in the body of scientific knowledge and poetic metaphors. In this new dimension of air, and proceeding from the ideas of the Presocratics and Gaston Bachelard, I consider the possibility of revisiting the logic of the elements, which has been supplanted in culture by atomistic rationality and metaphysical abstractions. In the elements, movement and transformation prevail over essence, cause, and purpose. I hold that the elements have no essence and manifest themselves only through clashing and mixing with other elements. Thus, during epidemics, the element of air comes into contact with the element of community. I contend that material manifestations of non-individual ""common sense"" (sensus communis) may be found at this intersection. Within this frame of reference, social and ethical relations acquire a ""physical dimension"" (in the sense of Aristotle's physis) and lend themselves to being interpreted in dynamic terms of forces and energies. This approach also makes it possible to discover many other elements, which are in contact with deindividualized sensus communis. Such areas of contact between elements (turbulence zones) manifest themselves in the anthropomorphic world in the shape of scientifically inexplicable phenomena, theoretical phantasms or incredible (""silly"") correlations that used to be the domain of magic but today are the domains of neural networks and big data.","Aronson, Oleg",Social Sciences,https://doi.org/10.21557/ssc.68515153,147

While the number of academically affiliated medical human rights programs has increased in recent years, there is still substantial unmet need for pro bono evaluations throughout the United States, especially for individuals in detention. Approach The Mount Sinai Human Rights Program launched its pilot Remote Evaluation Network in September 2019, with the aim to coordinate forensic mental health evaluations by telephone or video call for individuals who are unable to access in-person services. The authors recruited mental health clinicians from across the country, trained them in best practices in conducting forensic evaluations using telehealth platforms, and coordinated pro bono mental health evaluations of individuals seeking immigration relief. Remote forensic services have been a particularly relevant solution in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes The Remote Evaluation Network consists of seventeen active evaluators. From December 2019 to April 2020, the pilot program has coordinated fifteen forensic evaluations of individuals seeking asylum and other forms of protected immigration status in six different states. All clinicians participated in a training module on best practices in conducting forensic evaluations by telephone; respondents to optional pre-and-post-module surveys reported an increase in comfort level with conducting telephonic evaluations after participating in the module. Next Steps We will formally evaluate this pilot program's services by assessing the quality of medico-legal affidavits from telephonic evaluations, tracking legal outcomes and qualitative feedback from attorneys, and investigating the acceptability of telephonic mental health evaluations among legal professionals.

Health care providers (HCPs) require education to synthesize new evidence in the context of clinical practice including three approved HER2-directed therapies between December 2019 and April 2020. Concurrent patient and caregiver education is imperative to improve collaborative treatment decisions for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: Two, 1-hour online video-based programs were hosted in June, 2020 for HCPs and patients/caregivers, respectively. Practice and knowledge gaps among HCPs, and knowledge, communication and self-efficacy behaviors among patients were assessed. Each activity was interactive, consisting of slides, polling and live questions, and both remain on-demand (and on social media for patients/caregivers) for 12 months. Assessments were administered at 3 time points (pre-, immediate post-, and 2 mos. post-activity). Data from these questions, responses to live polling questions, and learner-submitted questions during live Q&A were analyzed to determine engagement, lessons learned, and continuing education gaps. Results: As of February 2021, 525 HCPs and 9,582 patients (9,449 Facebook Video;133 CancerCoachLive.com) participated in the ongoing activities. Post education, HCP learners anticipated the education would positively impact practice behavior (77%) and patient clinical outcomes (73%). HCP improvements in pre/post knowledge and competence questions were realized in 3/4 of the questions. Of patients/caregivers, 34% more learners reported confidence in managing their condition post vs. pre-education. They listed 'affording therapy' and 'understanding treatment options' as their greatest challenges, and reported 'self-care strategies' as their most sought information during the COVID-19 pandemic. At 2-mos. follow-up, 83% of patients reported improvements in communication with their HCPs, and 77% of HCPs reported improvements in their clinical practice. Updated data will be shared, including aligned HCP and patient questions pertaining to care challenges and communication goals. Conclusions: CME and patient education can yield gains in clinical practice behaviors, patient healthcare communication and confidence, and treatment knowledge of HER2- postive breast cancer. Together, aligned education directed to HCPs and patients can improve the ability to provide evidence-based treatment for patients.","Turell, W.; Ackbarali, T.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.e23007,147

Recently, researchers and public health officials from different disciplines studied the pathogenesis of SARS CoV 2 and found that the imaging pattern of patients with SARS CoV 2 infection had been observed on computed tomography (CT). This article is to measure whether the traditional deep learning algorithm can rely solely on lung CT images as a basis for the presence of new coronary pneumonia. Using the classic deep learning algorithms of AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, SqueezeNet and DenseNet as the basis, using the lung CT data of patients with new coronary pneumonia published on Kaggle as training and testing, and testing whether the pretraining migration learning method will Make the algorithm get a higher accuracy rate. According to the results, the accuracy rate of all algorithms without the pre-training model is more than 70%, and the accuracy rate of some algorithms reaches 82%. It shows that the deep learning algorithm, driven by a small amount of data, can not be completely used as a means of identification, but the algorithm using deep learning can help doctors identify. Moreover, with the increase of data, a more optimized learning algorithm can also obtain higher accuracy.","Wu, X. Y.; Wang, Z. H.; Hu, S.

168328,A Next Generation Liquid Biopsy Approach for Multiple Myeloma,2020,"COVID-19 rapidly spread throughout the United States (US) early in 2020. In March, the US federal government mandated that all residents and citizens remain in quarantine to reduce the spread and ease the burden on the healthcare system, which unwillingly impacted the rise in unemployment. Even though these preventative measures were necessary, it may have unwillingly shifted dietary habits based on food security status. To identify adults' demographics, dietary habits, and its relationship with food security status amid COVID-19. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between April – June 2020 throughout the United States. Participants (n = 3,133) completed a demographic questionnaire, the modified Dana-Farber's Cancer Institute Eating Habits Questionnaire and USDA Food Security Module once during the study period. Frequency counts and percentages were tabulated for demographics, dietary habits, and food security scores. One-way ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate relationships between dietary habits and food security status and correlations among demographics using STATA v14 at a statistical significance level of P &lt; 0.05. Participants were White (84.5%), female (79.4%), and between the ages of 30 to 49 years old (30.2%). Participants increased their consumption of sweets (43.8%) and salty snacks (37.4%) and decreased their consumption of fruit (33.4%), poultry products (31%) and non-starchy vegetables (28.2%). Average scores for food security were 0.69 ± 1.77. Per each month, there was a relationship between dietary habits and food security status;April (P &lt; 0.02), May (P &lt; 0.000) and June (P &lt; 0.03). A significant negative correlation was found for female sex (P = 0.009), race (P &lt; 0.001), and age range (P &lt; 0.001) with total dietary habits score. COVID-19 continues to affect individuals, which influences the relationship between dietary habits and food security status. Future population studies are recommended in the US to help public health authorities frame actions to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 has on dietary habits and food security to minimize the risk factors today and in future inevitable pandemics.

168342,A review of the anti-viral effects of ivermectin,2021,"This chapter explores the impact of the global pandemic on Africa’s weak economies and how to coalesce different levels of intervention—national, regional and international—to leverage recovery and avert a major economic crisis following the pandemic. The chapter reveals that the approach to Covid-19 pandemic has been mixed in Africa. While some countries have downplayed the severity of the virus, others have only paid lip service to it with no serious action. There are yet other countries that have responded effectively to the pandemic using all the necessary medical technologies and following all the WHO safety guidelines. It is remarkable that virtually all the African governments have already promulgated post-Covid-19 stabilization and revitalization programmes that can help their economies absorb the pandemic-related shocks in the short run and hopefully bounce back on a growth trajectory. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Omeje, K.",International Political Economy Series,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75170-8_9,147

170466,Effects of sub-threshold transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on cerebral blood flow,2021-07-14,"Background: Reddit is an anonymous, international, social media platform with 430 million active users;most are age 18-40 and a majority are male. Its discussion-based format is well-suited to healthcare, allowing patients, loved ones, and healthcare providers (HCPs) to interact, and numerous medical-focused 'subreddit' (SR) communities exist. Previous work has analyzed SR topics including breast cancer, radiation therapy, COVID-19, and depression. To date, no comprehensive list of cancer-related SRs has been compiled or analyzed. Methods: Between 1/7/21 and 2/10/21, a list of cancer-related keywords were queried on reddit.com, SRs were identified, and information was coded from their homepages;final membership numbers were updated on 2/10/21. Tumor subtypes included those listed on the SEER website (seer.cancer.gov/statfacts) where data on prevalence, annual incidence, death, and 5-year survival were pulled. Historical SR membership data was determined using subredditstats.com. Descriptive stats, Pearson's correlation, and regression were performed using R software and Excel. Results:36 cancer-related SRs were identified: 31 (86.1%) active in last 6 months, 17 (47.2%) with daily activity, 24 (66.7%) focused on tumor subtypes, 9 (25.0%) for general support and discussion, and 3 (8.3%) focused on treatment modalities. Median time since inception of SRs was 6 years (range 1 - 12), median number of members was 739 (range 42 - 36519), and median number of moderators was 2 (range 1 - 8). 16 (44.4%) had formal rules for members. Only 1 (2.7%) prohibited those without cancer from posting. Among the groups with &gt; 500 members (25, 69.4%), median growth since 1/1/20 was 66% (range 10 - 370%). 16 (59.3%) of the 27 SEER tumor sub-types were represented by a SR, 5 (18.5%) of which had more than one SR, and 14 (51.8%) had &gt; 500 members. Correlation and R Square via regression between tumor subtype prevalence, annual incidence, deaths, and 5-year survival and associated SR members was 0.61 and 0.368 (p = 0.02), 0.45 and 0.199 (p = 0.11), -0.07 and 0.005 (p = 0.82), 0.33 and 0.107 (p = 0.26), respectively. Based on the prevalence regression line, over-represented tumor subtypes include brain, testicular, and lymphoma. Underrepresented sub-types include cervical, ovarian, colon/rectal, prostate, and lung. Conclusions: SRs represent rapidly growing online communities for those with cancer to seek information and support. Many tumor subtypes are represented;however, some common cancers are either not represented (renal, liver, stomach, endometrial) or underrepresented (colon, prostate, lung). The demographic makeup of Reddit users may explain the over-representation of brain, testicular, and lymphoma, as they can arise in younger patients, particularly men. Future work should assess the content of specific SRs and investigate the role of anonymous HCP input.","Shakespeare, C. S.; O039,; Keefe, R. M.; Caputo, K. L.; Archambeault, M. G.; Elaba, K.

171595,The Amortization of Funding Gene Therapies: Making the 'Intangibles' Tangible for Patients,2021-04-20,"As genomic sequence data becomes increasingly available, inferring the phylogeny of the species as that of concatenated genomic data can be enticing. However, this approach makes for a biased estimator of branch lengths and substitution rates and an inconsistent estimator of tree topology. Bayesian multispecies coalescent methods address these issues. This is achieved by embedding a set of gene trees within a species tree and jointly inferring both under a Bayesian framework. However, this approach comes at the cost of increased computational demand. Here, we introduce StarBeast3 – a software package for efficient Bayesian inference of the multispecies coalescent model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We gain efficiency by introducing cutting-edge proposal kernels and adaptive operators, and StarBeast3 is particularly efficient when a relaxed clock model is applied. Furthermore, gene tree inference is parallelised, allowing the software to scale with the size of the problem. We validated our software and benchmarked its performance using three real and two synthetic datasets. Our results indicate that StarBeast3 is up to one-and-a-half orders of magnitude faster than StarBeast2, and therefore more than two orders faster than *BEAST, depending on the dataset and on the parameter, and is suitable for multispecies coalescent inference on large datasets (100+ genes). StarBeast3 is open-source and is easy to set up with a friendly graphical user interface.","Douglas, Jordan; Jiménez-Silva, Cinthy L.; Bouckaert, Remco",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.06.463424,147
171633,Prevention of ARVI in newborns and their mothers under pandemic conditions of new coronavirus infection,2021,"Since there is no cure for the COVID-19 pandemic yet, personal hygiene management is important for protecting oneself from the deadly virus. Personal hygiene management comes from personal hygiene habits. Thus, this study investigated the association between personal hygiene habits, consumers’ infection-prevention behaviors, and the effects of social support on the latter. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire survey of 620 Korean adults. An online survey agency was used to conduct the questionnaire over eight days, from 18 May to 25 May, 2020. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results were as follows. First, personal hygiene habits positively affected self-efficacy for infection prevention (β = 0.123, p < 0.01). Moreover, personal hygiene habits indirectly affected virus spread-prevention behaviors (β = 0.457, p < 0.000) and product-purchasing behaviors for infection prevention (β = 0.146, p < 0.01) through self-efficacy for infection prevention. Second, informational support for infection prevention increased self-efficacy influence for infection prevention on the virus spread prevention behaviors among the public (composite reliability: −2.627). Thus, continued education of the public is imperative to ensuring compliance with personal hygiene practices. Furthermore, timely dissemination of relevant information on infection-prevention practices through various media during an infection outbreak is critical. © 2021 by the authors.

172051,Chase-Escape Percolation on the 2D Square Lattice,2020-10-11,"Background: Malignancy is thought to be an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. However, neoplastic diseases encompass a heterogenous group of pathologic processes, and further stratification of those patients prone to severe disease is necessary. We sought to identify predictors of poor COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized patients with malignancy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of hematologic and solid tumor malignancy within the regional Scripps Health hospital system in San Diego County from March 1, 2020 to January 5, 2021 with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Cancer diagnoses were confirmed via manual chart review;in situ non-melanoma skin cancers were excluded. Only hospitalizations greater than one day were included in the analysis and readmissions were excluded. Outcomes of interest included admission to the ICU, intubation during hospitalization, and death. Associations between outcomes of interest and tumor types, metastatic disease (with or without lung involvement) and those receiving active systemic anticancer therapy (treatment within 3 months of admission) were determined using univariable logistic regression analyses. The study was approved by the Scripps Health Institutional Review Board. Systemic anticancer therapy included cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunomodulators, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other targeted therapies. Results: Among a total of 2,771 hospitalized patients, 204 (7.36%) met inclusion criteria. The average age was 72.7 years, 48.5% were male, 33.3% were Hispanic and the average BMI was 27.5. The majority of patients (82.8%) had solid tumors, with the most prevalent being breast carcinoma (17.6%) and prostate carcinoma (17.2%). Overall, 21.9% had metastatic disease and 16% had lung involvement. 17.2% had been receiving active cancer systemic treatment. On univariate analysis, patients who were actively receiving treatment had an increased rate of death (37.1% vs 18.9%, OR: 2.5 (1.1-5.5) p= .021). Among patients receiving systemic anticancer therapy, 48.6% received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 5.7% immune checkpoint inhibitors, 22.9% immunomodulators, 17.1% molecularly targeted agents and 2.7% other agents. Moreover, there was a trend towards increased mortality in those with lung involvement (33.3% vs 17.6%, OR: 2.3 (0.9-5.7) p= .067) and those with hematologic malignancy (31.4% vs 20.1%, OR: 0.5 (0.2-1.3) p = 0.146). Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cancer, systemic anticancer therapy was associated with a significantly increased odds of death. Other factors potentially increasing risk of death include hematologic malignancy and solid tumors with lung involvement. Further validation of these findings in a larger sample could impact therapeutic decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hermel, D. J.; Bagsic, S. R. S.; Bhangoo, M. S.; Bollin, K.

Spectroscopic data demonstrated that the preferential binding site for DHLA on HSA is IIA (Sudlow I). Hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions were identified as the key binding interactions. DHLA binding thermally stabilized HSA, yet it had no effect on HSA structure and its susceptibility to trypsin digestion. Molecular docking confirmed that Sudlow I site accommodated DHLA in a certain conformation in order for binding to occur. Molecular dynamic simulation showed that formed complex is stable.

With the aim of providing preliminary insight into this possibility, we theoretically construct and empirically test hypotheses for how exposure to COVID-19 stimuli (e.g., reading or watching media coverage, observing relief efforts) relates to the deep-seated values that guide workers' attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, we build from prior work to posit that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli is positively associated with workers' self-transcendent prosocial values, which motivate prosocial behaviors directed toward society as a whole (i.e., charitable donations) and coworkers (i.e., helping). Extend the extant literature, we further argue that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli will be positively associated with conservation values emphasizing self-restraint, submission, protection of order, and harmony in relations, which in turn influences workers' willingness to tolerate mistreatment by authorities (i.e., abusive supervision, authoritarian leadership, exploitation). Evidence from 2,929 full-time Chinese employees tracked for nearly 2 months and a diverse sample of 310 workers in the United States generally support our arguments, but also provide insight into potential cultural nuances.

Des-Arg10-kallidin, the carboxy-terminal des-Arg metabolite of kallidin, and bradykinin selectively activate two G protein-coupled receptors, type 1 and type 2 bradykinin receptors (B1R and B2R), respectively. The hyperactivation of bradykinin receptors, termed “bradykinin storm”, is associated with pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that bradykinin receptors are important targets for COVID-19 intervention. Here we report two G protein complex structures of B1R and B2R bound to des-Arg10-kallidin and bradykinin. Combined with functional analysis, our structures reveal the mechanism of ligand selectivity and specific activation of the bradykinin receptor. These findings also provide a framework for guiding drug design targeting bradykinin receptors for the treatment of inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, and COVID-19.","Yin, Yu-Ling; Ye, Chenyu; Zhou, Fulai; Wang, Jia; Yang, Dehua; Yin, Wanchao; Wang, Ming-Wei; Xu, H.

177749,Gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy on small and large scales: Toward the extension of lung spectroscopic monitoring to adults,2021,"Recently, because of the outbreak of COVID‐19, the demand for various types of filter elements in protective materials has increased globally. Furthermore, new requirements for the filtration performance of PM2.5 liquid (oil) particles have been put forward. In this work, Superhydrophobic and superoleophobic composite nanofibers with excellent filtration capacity for oil and salt particles are developed through the modification of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by fluoro‐polyurethane (FPU) doping. The results show that the PAN/FPU composite nanofibers doped with 9 wt% FPU has a uniform fiber morphology with a diameter of 240 ± 30 nm. Compared to the pure PAN nanofibers, the water‐based contact angle of PAN/FPU increases from 90 ± 5° to 151 ± 5°, and the oil‐based contact angle increases from 58 ± 2° to 152 ± 3°. Importantly, at a high flow rate of 95 L min−1, the filtration efficiency of the PAN/FPU nanofiber membrane for 0.3 µm oil particles increases from 92 ± 1% to 99.2 ± 0.1%. After cyclic loading, the filtration efficiency of 0.3 µm oil particles remains above 98%. Meanwhile, the filtration efficiency for 0.3 µm salt particles remains at 98.23 ± 0.1%. The PAN/FPU nanofiber membrane developed in this work is effective in applications and has good market prospects as a protective filtration material.

These objectives have been achieved through several factors, including the Government?s commitment, excellent success of the health service, and the ?wholeheartedness? of the armed forces, especially the social consensus, which is clearly reflected in the decisions and policies made. Among those crucial decisions, the stable social security system has been the key priority of the government of Vietnam because it provides a strong foundation for the disadvantaged, who are not expected to overcome the pandemic based on their low-level ?resistance.? The article aims at illustrating Vietnam?s social security interventions and strategies when faced the global COVID-19 pandemic and it also draws some experience that need to be referenced in implementing Social Security Society witnessed from Vietnamese reality.","Hoang Viet Lam, Le",Journal of Applied Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/19367244211026912,147
181475,VirusBoxing: A HIIT-based VR boxing game,2020-10-08,"When subject to disruptive events, the dynamics of human-infrastructure interactions can absorb, adapt, or, in a more abrupt manner, undergo substantial change. These changes are commonly studied when a disruptive event perturbs the physical infrastructure. Infrastructure breakdown is, thus, an indicator of the tipping point, and possible regime shift, in the human-infrastructure interactions. However, determining the likelihood of a regime shift during a global pandemic, where no infrastructure breakdown occurs, is unclear. In this study, we explore the dynamics of human-infrastructure interactions during the global COVID-19 pandemic for the entire United States and determine the likelihood of regime shifts in human interactions with six different categories of infrastructure. Our results highlight the impact of state-level characteristics, executive decisions, as well as the extent of impact by the pandemic as predictors of either undergoing or surviving regime shifts in human-infrastructure interactions.","Mohammadi, N.; Taylor, J.

181768,Michael B.A. Oldstone Ljubisa Vitkovic,1996-08-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked controversies over health security strategies adopted in different countries. The urge to curb the spread of the virus has supported policies to restrict mobility and to build up state surveillance, which might induce authoritarian forms of government. In this context, the Copenhagen School has offered an analytical repertoire that informs many analyses in the fields of critical security studies and global health. Accordingly, the securitisation of COVID-19 might be necessary to deal with the crisis, but it risks unfolding discriminatory practices and undemocratic regimes, with potentially enduring effects. In this article, we look into controversies over pandemic-control strategies to discuss the political and analytical limitations of securitisation theory. On the one hand, we demonstrate that the focus on moments of rupture and exception conceals security practices that unfold in ongoing institutional disputes and over the construction of legitimate knowledge about public health. On the other hand, we point out that securitisation theory hinders a genealogy of modern apparatuses of control and neglects violent forms of government which are manifested not in major disruptive acts, but in the everyday dynamics of unequal societies. We conclude by suggesting that an analysis of the bureaucratic disputes and scientific controversies that constitute health security knowledges and practices enables critical approaches to engage with the multiple - and, at times, mundane - processes in which (in)security is produced, circulated, and contested.Alternate abstract:A pandemia de COVID-19 tem gerado controvérsias em torno das políticas de saúde adotadas em diferentes países. A necessidade de controlar a propagação do vírus tem sido usada como justificativa para medidas de restrição da mobilidade e para largos investimentos em dispositivos de vigilância, o que pode abrir espaço para formas não democráticas de governo. Nesse contexto, a Escola de Copenhague tem oferecido o instrumental teórico que informa muitas das análises nos campos de estudos críticos de segurança e saúde global. Segundo esta perspectiva, a securitização da COVID-19 agiliza as respostas à crise, mas guarda caráter discriminatório, contribuindo ainda para o avanço de políticas autoritárias potencialmente duradouras. Neste artigo, exploramos os debates recentes em torno das políticas de contenção da pandemia para abordar os limites políticos e analíticos da teoria da securitização. Por um lado, demonstramos que o foco em momentos de ruptura e políticas de exceção negligencia práticas de segurança que se desenvolvem no dia a dia das disputas institucionais e na construção de conhecimento especializado sobre saúde pública. Por outro, apontamos que a proposta da Escola de Copenhague impede uma genealogia dos aparatos modernos de segurança e ignora formas violentas de governo que não se manifestam em grandes atos disruptivos, mas na rotina de sociedades desiguais. Sugerimos, por fim, que a análise das disputas burocráticas e controvérsias científicas que constituem os conhecimentos e práticas dos campos de segurança e saúde permite que abordagens críticas se engajem com os múltiplos e, por vezes, mundanos processos pelos quais a (in)segurança é produzida, disseminada e contestada.","Duarte, Daniel Edler Valença Marcelo M.",Contexto Internacional,https://doi.org/10.1590/s0102-8529.2019430200001,147
183070,What Did We Expected from Porto's ECDP2020?,2020-09-18,"Plants respond to environmental cues via adaptive cell reprogramming that can affect whole plant and ecosystem functionality. Microbiota constitutes part of plant’s inner and outer environment. This Umwelt underlies steady dynamics, due to complex local and global biotic and abiotic changes. Hence, adaptive plant holobiont responses are crucial for continuous metabolic adjustment at systems levels. Plants require oxygen-dependent respiration for energy-dependent adaptive morphology, such as, germination, root and shoot growth, formation of adventitious, clonal and reproductive organs, fruits and seeds. Fermentative paths can help in acclimation and, to our view the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in coordinating complex metabolic and physiologic adjustments is underestimated. Cellular level of sucrose is an important sensor of environmental stress. We explored the role of exogenous sucrose and its interplay with AOX during early seed germination. We found that sucrose-dependent initiation of fermentation during the first 12 hours after imbibition (HAI) was beneficial to germination. However, parallel enhanced AOX expression was essential to control negative effects by prolonged sucrose treatment. Early down-regulated AOX activity until 12 HAI improved germination efficiency in the absence of sucrose, but suppressed early germination in its presence. Our results also suggest that seeds-inoculated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can buffer sucrose stress during germination to restore normal respiration more efficiently. Following this approach, we propose a simple method to identify organic seeds and low-cost on-farm perspectives for early selection on disease tolerance, predicting plant holobiont behavior and improving germination. Furthermore, our research strengthens the view that AOX can serve as powerful functional marker source for seed hologenomes.","Revuru, Bharadwaj; Noceda, Carlos; Gunasekaran, Mohanapriya; Kumar, Sarma Rajeev; Lima Thiers, Karine Leitão; Costa, José Hélio; Macedo, Elisete Santos; Kumari, Aprajita; Gupta, Kapuganti Jagadis; Srivastava, Shivani; Adholeya, Alok; Oliveira, Manuela; Velada, Isabel; Sircar, Debabrata; Sathishkumar, Ramalingam; Arnholdt-Schmitt, Birgit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447570,147

This poorly sequenced region was identified from the early phases of the Delta variant spread and the phenomenon is still ongoing. As many commonly-used protocols rely on amplicon-based sequencing procedures, we investigated the likely origin of the issue. We established its biological origin as resulting from mutations in the viral genomes at primer binding sites. We designed and evaluated new PCR primers to circumvent this issue in order to complement the ARTIC v3 set, and validated their performance for the sequencing of circulating Delta variants.","Borcard, L.; Gempeler, S.; Terrazos Miani, M.

183175,Decluttering,2020-12-31,"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are widely used in various applications of information retrieval. Despite the large scale of KGs, they are still facing incomplete problems. Conventional approaches on Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) require a large number of training instances for each relation. However, long-tail relations which only have a few related triples are ubiquitous in KGs. Therefore, it is very difficult to complete the long-tail relations. In this paper, we propose a meta pattern learning framework (MetaP) to predict new facts of relations under a challenging setting where there is only one reference for each relation. Patterns in data are representative regularities to classify data. Triples in KGs also conform to relation-specific patterns which can be used to measure the validity of triples. Our model extracts the patterns effectively through a convolutional pattern learner and measures the validity of triples accurately by matching query patterns with reference patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Besides, we build a few-shot KGC dataset of COVID-19 to assist the research process of the new coronavirus. © 2021 ACM.","Jiang, Z.; Gao, J.; Lv, X.","44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3404835.3463086,147

The importance of these platforms in clinical and translational studies led us to investigate the impact of delayed blood processing on the numbers and state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the plasma proteome. Similar to previous studies, we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMCs up to 18 hours. In contrast, profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology.

In conflict settings, war-wounds and malnutrition can combine with existing social determinants to increase demand for antibiotics, compounding irrational use. In this study, we focus on Yemen, a low-income country with active conflict for the last five years, and analyze the current status of awareness and stewardship efforts regarding AMR. We performed a survey of prescribers/physicians and pharmacists to describe perceptions of AMR prevalence, antibiotic use practices and stewardship in Yemen, supported by a non-systematic scoping literature review and a key informant interview. Participants (96%, n=57) reported a perceived high AMR prevalence rate. Prescribers (74%, 20/27) reported pressure to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the majority of cases (81%, 22/27), Antimicrobial Sensitivity Tests (AST) were not performed to inform antibiotic choice. The main barrier to AST was cost. Most pharmacists (67%, 18/27) sold antibiotics without prescriptions. Amoxicillin (including amoxicillin-clavulanate) was the most-commonly prescribed (63%, 17/27) or dispensed (82%, 22/27) antibiotic. AST was rated the least important solution to AMR in Yemen. While there was awareness of a high AMR rate, stewardship is poor in Yemen. We note that barriers to the use of AST could be addressed through the deployment of low-cost AST kits. Compulsory continuing education emphasizing the use of AST to guide prescribing and patients' awareness programs could help avoid irrational use.","Orubu, S. E.

Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic. Methods: To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results: We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was 'thinking positively' and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. Conclusion: A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.","Wright, L.; Fluharty, M.

Methods Cross-sectional observational sample of 116 patients with a disorder of consciousness secondary to brain injury, collected prospectively at a tertiary center between 2011 and 2013. Multimodal analyses relating clinical measures of impairment, electroencephalographic measures of spontaneous brain activity, and magnetic resonance imaging data of subcortical atrophy were conducted in 2018. Results In the final analyzed sample of 61 patients, systematic associations were found between electroencephalographic power spectra and subcortical damage. Specifically, the ratio of beta-to-delta relative power was negatively associated with greater atrophy in regions of the bilateral thalamus and globus pallidus (both left > right) previously shown to be preferentially atrophied in chronic disorders of consciousness. Power spectrum total density was also negatively associated with widespread atrophy in regions of the left globus pallidus, right caudate, and in brainstem. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of demographics, encephalographic, and imaging data in an analytic framework can be employed to aid behavioral diagnosis. Conclusions These results ground, for the first time, electroencephalographic presentation detected with routine clinical techniques in the underlying brain pathology of disorders of consciousness and demonstrate how multimodal combination of clinical, electroencephalographic, and imaging data can be employed in potentially mitigating the high rates of misdiagnosis typical of this patient cohort.

We report here that DPP-IV cleaves the first two amino acids from insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), revealed by mass spectrometry. The kinetic parameters of the proteolytic cleavage indicate that this reaction is physiologically relevant. Interestingly, truncated IGF-1 is less potent than the full-length protein in activating the IGF-1R, but binds more readily to IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Quantitative RT–PCR showed that the level of DPP-IV mRNA is dramatically lower in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues than in adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues. However, this reduction was not observed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Our study suggests a possible link between IGF-1 and DPP-IV in cancer development in a specific tumor niche. A DPP-IV-related pathway may be important in mitigating IGF-1 signaling. Consequently, a robust IGF signaling pathway may accelerate early carcinogenesis in environments lacking DPP-IV.","Lin, Ching-Ting; Tang, Hsiang-Yun; Han, Yu-San; Liu, Hui-Ping; Huang, Shiu-Feng; Chien, Chia-Hui; Shyy, John; Chiu, Jeng-Jian; Chen, Xin",Int J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615292/,147

Virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by self-assembly of individual rotavirus structural proteins coexpressed by baculovirus recombinants in insect cells were the subunit vaccine tested. We first compared the immunogenicities and protective efficacies of VLPs containing VP2 and VP6 (2/6-VLPs) and G3 2/6/7-VLPs mixed with cholera toxin and administered by oral and intranasal routes in the adult mouse model of rotavirus infection. VLPs administered orally induced serum antibody and intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG. The highest oral dose (100 microg) of VLPs induced protection from rotavirus challenge (> or = 50% reduction in virus shedding) in 50% of the mice. VLPs administered intranasally induced higher serum and intestinal antibody responses than VLPs administered orally. All mice receiving VLPs intranasally were protected from challenge; no virus was shed after challenge. Since there was no difference in immunogenicity or protective efficacy between 2/6- and 2/6/7-VLPs, protection was achieved without inclusion of the neutralization antigens VP7 and VP4. We also tested the immunogenicities and protective efficacies of 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without the addition of cholera toxin. 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without cholera toxin induced lower serum and intestinal antibody titers than 2/6-VLPs administered with cholera toxin. The highest dose (100 microg) of 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without cholera toxin resulted in a mean reduction in shedding of 38%. When cholera toxin was added, higher levels of protection were achieved with 10-fold less immunogen.

Here they present a novel method to detect antigen-specific B-cells using cell-microarray system. To detect antigen-specific B-cells, they arrayed live lymphocytes on a chip, stained cells with fluorescence-labeled nonspecific proteins, and analyzed them with a fluorescence scanner to detect nonspecific protein binding to B-cells. They then stained cells with fluorescence-labeled antigen and analyzed them with the scanner. Cells stained with specific antigen, but not with nonspecific proteins, were determined as antigen-specific B-cells and harvested. Antibody cDNA was amplified from retrieved B-cells by single-cell RT-PCR, inserted into expression vectors, and was examined for its specificity by ELISA. They could detect antigen-specific B-cells at a frequency of 0.01% in a model system using transgenic mice that express antibody to hen-egg lysozyme on the surface of B-cells. They applied this system to directly detect hepatitis B virus surface-antigen (HBs-Ag)-specific B-cells from peripheral blood in HBs-Ag-vaccinated volunteers and succeeded in producing HBs-Ag-specific monoclonal antibody.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of local anesthesia with bupivacaine and intravenous parecoxib on postoperative abdominal pain relief up to 24 h after surgery. METHODS One hundred and eighty patients who underwent LC were randomized to one of three groups with sixty patients each: Group A received 50 mg 0.5% bupivacaine subcutaneously at trocar sites before incision closure; Group B received intravenous parecoxib (40 mg) after entering the recovery room; Group C did not receive postoperative analgesia unless needed and was served as control. The postoperative pain at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the operation was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes, including intraoperative and postoperative complications, the incidence of shoulder pain, pethidine requirements, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and hospital stay were also recorded. RESULTS At 1, 2, and 4 hours after surgery, VAS pain scores were significantly lower in group A and B compared with group C (P < 0.05 for all). There was no significant difference among the three groups at 8, 12, and 24 hours after the procedure (P > 0.05 for all). A repeated-measures ANOVA analysis revealed that VAS pain scores over the first 24 hours after LC were significantly lower in group A and B compared with group C (P = 0.014 and P = 0.029 for between-group comparison, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of patients requiring postoperative rescue analgesics was significantly higher in group C as compared with group A and group B (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION Local anesthesia with bupivacaine and intravenous parecoxib are both effective at decreasing postoperative pain and pethidine requirements after LC.","Lin, Shengping; Hua, Jie; Xu, Bin; Yang, Tingsong; He, Zhigang; Xu, Chenglei; Meng, Hongbo; Zhou, Bo; Song, Zhenshun",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26550332/,147

In order to control such high-mortality infectious diseases, the work of the Chinese government and the medical community in detection reagents, drugs, and vaccines had been speeded up. This research extensively searched the medical data of drugs, vaccines and kits development, the company's business report and the government's policy documents and conducted case analysis. We found some national mobilization measures had been put on the agenda and some special marketing authorization measures had been adopted. Due to the limitations of biotechnology research and the pharmaceutical industry, some key technologies and drugs still had a high external dependence.

We used an approach previously described for other parvoviruses to clone and express viral structural proteins in insect cells from recombinant baculovirus vectors. In baculovirus recombinant-infected Sf9 cells, the chicken parvovirus (ChPV) structural viral protein 2 (VP2) was detected as an abundant protein, and the 60-kDa VP2 strongly reacted with parvovirus-infected chicken serum in Western blot. A semipurified VP2 was then used in capture ELISA. Sera from chickens experimentally infected with ChPV and sera from uninfected chickens were tested to evaluate the assay. The ELISA was 93.3% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting ChPV-infected birds. Subsequent assays identified IgG type ChPV-specific maternally acquired antibodies in day-old chickens and demonstrated the production of virus-specific antibodies in young birds following infection with ChPV. In our study, a specific antibody response of infected chickens was observed starting with IgM production between 14 and 21 days postinfection (DPI) and switching into a predominant IgG response by 32 DPI. The availability of an ELISA for detection of virus-specific antibodies and its ability to differentiate between maternally acquired antibodies and antibodies produced following acute infection could prove to be a valuable tool to characterize pathobiological properties and immunogenicity of ChPV.","Strother, Keith O; Zsak, Laszlo",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095161/,147

The discovery of SARS-CoV-like viruses in masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) raises the possibility that civets play a role in SARS-CoV transmission. To test the susceptibility of civets to experimental infection by different SARS-CoV isolates, 10 civets were inoculated with two human isolates of SARS-CoV, BJ01 (with a 29-nucleotide deletion) and GZ01 (without the 29-nucleotide deletion). All inoculated animals displayed clinical symptoms, such as fever, lethargy, and loss of aggressiveness, and the infection was confirmed by virus isolation, detection of viral genomic RNA, and serum-neutralizing antibodies.

190730,Case Report: Flavored Vaping-Associated Hypokalemia.,2020-07-15,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV. The spike (S) glycoprotein of CoV is the major structural protein responsible for induction of host immune response and virus neutralization by antibodies. Hence, knowledge of neutralization determinants on the S protein is helpful for designing protective vaccines. To analyze the antigenic structure of the SARS-CoV S2 domain, the carboxyl-terminal half of the S protein, we first used sera from convalescent SARS patients to test the antigenicity of 12 overlapping fragments spanning the entire S2 and identified two antigenic determinants (Leu 803 to Ala 828 and Pro 1061 to Ser 1093). To determine whether neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by these two determinants, we immunized animals and found that both of them could induce the S2-specific antisera. In some animals, however, only one determinant (Leu 803 to Ala 828) was able to induce the antisera with the binding ability to the native S protein and the neutralizing activity to the SARS-CoV pseudovirus. This determinant is highly conserved across different SARS-CoV isolates. Identification of a conserved antigenic determinant on the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein, which has the potential for inducing neutralizing antibodies, has implications in the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV.","Zhang, Hong; Wang, Guangwen; Li, Jian; Nie, Yuchun; Shi, Xuanling; Lian, Gewei; Wang, Wei; Yin, Xiaolei; Zhao, Yang; Qu, Xiuxia; Ding, Mingxiao; Deng, Hongkui",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194770/,147

Infection prevention and control is an integral part of pediatric practice in ambulatory medical settings as well as in hospitals. Infection prevention and control practices should begin at the time the ambulatory visit is scheduled. All health care personnel should be educated regarding the routes of transmission and techniques used to prevent transmission of infectious agents. Policies for infection prevention and control should be written, readily available, updated annually, and enforced. The standard precautions for hospitalized patients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with a modification from the American Academy of Pediatrics exempting the use of gloves for routine diaper changes and wiping a well child's nose or tears, are appropriate for most patient encounters. As employers, pediatricians are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to take precautions to identify and protect employees who are likely to be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials while on the job. Key principles of standard precautions include hand hygiene (ie, use of alcohol-based hand rub or hand-washing with soap [plain or antimicrobial] and water) before and after every patient contact; implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough-etiquette strategies for patients with suspected influenza or infection with another respiratory tract pathogen to the extent feasible; separation of infected, contagious children from uninfected children when feasible; safe handling and disposal of needles and other sharp medical devices and evaluation and implementation of needle-safety devices; appropriate use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection; and appropriate sterilization, disinfection, and antisepsis.",,Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17766540/,147

It embraces a wide number of strategies from the management of the disease to facilitating business continuity. The key strategy underlying Australia's planned response is an intensive effort to reduce transmission of the virus. This includes actions to reduce the likelihood of entry of the virus into the country and to contain outbreaks when they occur. Containment will provide time to allow production of a matched vaccine. The health strategies are outlined in the Australian health management plan for pandemic influenza. The plan is accompanied by technical annexes setting out key considerations and guidelines in the areas of clinical management and infection control. National plans present overall strategies and guidance, but the operational details can only be determined by individual states and territories, regions, and the services themselves. Primary health care practices will be on the frontline of an influenza pandemic. Every practice needs a plan that defines the roles of staff, incorporates infection control and staff protection measures, and considers business continuity.

METHOD This study estimated the reproduction number and its time dependent change through investigations of outbreaks in Mukden, China (1946), and Madagascar (1957). Reconstruction of an epidemic tree, which shows who infected whom, from the observed dates of onset was performed using the serial interval. Furthermore, a likelihood based approach was used for the time inhomogeneous evaluation of the outbreaks for which there was scarcity of cases. RESULTS According to the estimates, the basic reproduction number, R(0), was on the order of 2.8 to 3.5, which is higher than previous estimates. The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity. The effective reproduction number declined below unity after control measures were introduced in Mukden, and before the official implementation in Madagascar. CONCLUSION While the time course of the latter outbreak could be explained by intrinsic factors and stochasticity in this remote and scarcely populated area, the former in Mukden suggests the possible continued chains of transmission in highly populated areas. Using the proposed methods, the who infected whom information permitted the evaluation of the time inhomogeneous transmission potential in relation to public health measures. The study also tackles the problem of statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information, which was previously performed simply by counting the number of secondary transmissions regardless of time.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Schwehm, Markus; Kakehashi, Masayuki; Eichner, Martin",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16790838/,147
192613,Dangerous liaisons at the virological synapse.,2004,"To study naive and memory CD8 T cell turnover, we performed BrdU incorporation experiments in adult thymectomized C57BL/6 mice and analyzed data in a mathematical framework. The following aspects were novel: 1) we examined the bone marrow, in addition to spleen and lymph nodes, and took into account the sum of cells contained in the three organs; 2) to describe both BrdU-labeling and -delabeling phase, we designed a general mathematical model, in which cell populations were distinguished based on the number of divisions; 3) to find parameters, we used the experimentally determined numbers of total and BrdU(+) cells and the BrdU-labeling coefficient. We treated mice with BrdU continuously via drinking water for up to 42 days, measured by flow cytometry BrdU incorporation at different times, and calculated the numbers of BrdU(+) naive (CD44(int/low)) and memory (CD44(high)) CD8 T cells. By fitting the model to data, we determined proliferation and death rates of both subsets. Rates were confirmed using independent sets of data, including the numbers of BrdU(+) cells at different times after BrdU withdrawal. We found that both doubling time and half-life of the memory population were approximately 9 wk, whereas for the naive subset the doubling time was almost 1 year and the half-life was roughly 7 wk. Our findings suggest that the higher turnover of memory CD8 T cells as compared with naive CD8 T cells is mostly attributable to a higher proliferation rate. Our results have implications for interpreting physiological and abnormal T cell kinetics in humans.","Parretta, Elisabetta; Cassese, Giuliana; Santoni, Angela; Guardiola, John; Vecchio, Antonia; Di Rosa, Francesca",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18490722/,147

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty patients (20 women, 20 men; mean age, 42.90 years +/- 14.01 [SD]; median age, 41.5 years; age range, 25-82 years) with SARS were evaluated. Daily chest radiographs were graded according to percentage of lung involvement during 20.15 days +/- 5.56 (median, 20 days; range, 14-38 days). Times between symptoms and treatment and time to reach maximal radiographic score from admission and treatment day were determined. Daily oxygen saturation (Sao2) and oxygen supplementation including mechanically assisted ventilation were recorded. Treatment response was defined as good, fair, and poor. Patterns of radiographic opacity at admission and at maximal radiographic score were noted. Differences in radiographic and clinical parameters with respect to oxygen supplementation and treatment response were respectively evaluated with Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS Larger maximal radiographic scores, lower Sao2 at maximal radiographic change, longer time from treatment to maximal radiographic score (P <.01), and diffuse consolidation at maximal radiographic score were associated with oxygen supplementation. Parameters that influenced treatment response were time from symptom onset to treatment day (P =.003), time from admission to treatment day (P <.001), time to maximal radiographic score from treatment day (P =.001), maximal radiographic score (P =.009), Sao2 at maximal radiographic score (P =.13), and treatment radiographic score (P =.03). Fair responders had shorter time between admission and treatment than did either good (P <.001) or poor responders (P =.002) and shorter time between symptoms and treatment (P <.001) and lower treatment radiographic score (P =.012) than did good responders. Good (82%), poor (36%), and fair (33%) responders developed maximal chest radiographic scores within 4 days of treatment (P =.008). Radiographic patterns at both admission and maximal radiographic score did not influence treatment response. CONCLUSION There are significant relationships among radiographic parameters, oxygen supplementation, and treatment response, and these relationships appear to be clinically useful in the treatment of SARS.","Ooi, Clara G C; Khong, Pek L; Ho, James C M; Lam, Bing; Wong, Wai M; Yiu, Wai C; Wong, Poon C; Wong, Chi F; Lai, Kar N; Tsang, Kenneth W T",Radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595150/,147

METHODS In 1998, we conducted a multicentre, hospital-based case-control study which enrolled 402 cases of first CNS demyelinating event occurring between 1994 and 1995 and 722 controls matched for centre, age, sex and date of admission. An independent expert committee validated the diagnoses of cases and controls. Data on vaccinations were obtained from a standardized phone interview. Forty percent of eligible cases and 50% of eligible controls could not be localized or were excluded because they did not satisfy inclusion or matching criteria. RESULTS Conditional logistic regression performed on 236 and 355 matched controls showed that adjusted odds ratios for the first CNS demyelinating event within 2 months following an injection of HB vaccine were 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-4.6] in the whole group and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.4-4.5) in the subgroup of cases (n = 152) and controls (n = 253) referring to vaccination certificates during the phone interview. Restricting the analyses to the cases with definite or probable multiple sclerosis, these odds ratios were 2.0 (95% CI, 0.8-5.4) and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.4-5.6), respectively. Odds ratios tend towards 1 for a longer interval between HB vaccine and demyelinating event. CONCLUSIONS This study was sufficiently powerful to rule out a strong association between HB vaccine exposure and a subsequent demyelinating event. However, it could not provide a clear indication of a moderately increased risk of a CNS demyelinating event shortly after HB vaccination in adults.","Touzé, Emmanuel; Fourrier, Annie; Rue-Fenouche, Cécile; Rondé-Oustau, Véronique; Jeantaud, Isabelle; Bégaud, Bernard; Alpérovitch, Annick",Neuroepidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12065880/,147

An epidemic in 2003 affected 8,098 patients in 29 countries with 774 deaths. The aetiological agent is a new coronavirus spread by droplet transmission. Clinical and general laboratory manifestations included fever, chills, rigor, myalgia, malaise, diarrhoea, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LD), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) activities. Treatment has been empirical; initial potent antibiotic cover, followed by simultaneous ribavirin and corticosteroids, with or without pulse high-dose methylprednisolone, have been used. The postulated disease progression comprises (1) active viral infection, (2) hyperactive immune response, and (3) recovery or pulmonary destruction and death. We investigated serum LD isoenzymes and blood lymphocyte subsets of SARS patients, and found LD1 activity as the best biochemical prognostic indicator for death, while CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and natural killer cell counts were promising predictors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles showed markedly elevated Th1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma, inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and IL-12, neutrophil chemokine IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and Th1 chemokine IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) for at least two weeks after disease onset, but there was no significant elevation of inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Corticosteroid reduced IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10 concentrations from 5-8 days after treatment. Measurement of biochemical markers of bone metabolism demonstrated significant but transient increase in bone resorption from Day 28-44 after onset of fever, when pulse steroid was most frequently given. With tapering down of steroid therapy, there was a decrease in bone resorption marker together with an increase in bone formation markers round Day 50, suggesting that some of the bone loss might be reversed. Our research studies on the chemical pathology and clinical immunology of SARS should have implications for the pathophysiology and therapy of this potentially lethal infection.","Lam, Christopher W K; Chan, Michael H M; Wong, Chun K",The Clinical biochemist.

194256,Pneumonia.,1902,"The mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM was injected intracerebrally into newborn and weanling rats. Three types of diseases were observed: 1. Acute panencephalitis: Almost all suckling rats became moribund within 6 days. Histologically severe panencephalitis with demyelinating foci was noticed; the foci were similar to those found in mice. Virus was easily detectable in the oligodendroglial cells and neurons both by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Infectious virus could be isolated. 2. Subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE): Three weeks after infection of weanling rats, about 35% of the animals developed paralysis. Neuropathologically, demyelination with a striking predilection for white matter was observed in the brain stem, optic nerve and spinal cord. Virus was detectable by electron microscopy in degenerating oligodendroglial cells only, which corresponded to the results obtained by the immunofluorescent techniques. Infectious virus could be recovered. 3. Chronic progressive paralysis: Inoculated weanling rats without SDE developed 6 to 8 months later a slowly progressing paralysis of the legs.

To develop an alternative system for the study of SARS-CoV, we introduced individual SARS-CoV genes (open reading frames [ORFs]) into the genome of an attenuated murine coronavirus. One protein, the product of SARS-CoV ORF6, converted a sublethal infection to a uniformly lethal encephalitis and enhanced virus growth in tissue culture cells, indicating that SARS-CoV proteins function in the context of a heterologous coronavirus infection. Furthermore, these results suggest that the attenuated murine coronavirus lacks a virulence gene residing in SARS-CoV. Recombinant murine coronaviruses cause a reproducible and well-characterized clinical disease, offer virtually no risk to laboratory personnel, and should be useful for elucidating the role of SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis.","Pewe, Lecia; Zhou, Haixia; Netland, Jason; Tangudu, Chandra; Olivares, Heidi; Shi, Lei; Look, Dwight; Gallagher, Thomas; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103185/,147

Apelin is also a catalytic substrate for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the key severe acute respiratory syndrome receptor. The in vivo physiological role of Apelin is still elusive. Here we report the generation of Apelin gene-targeted mice. Apelin mutant mice are viable and fertile, appear healthy, and exhibit normal body weight, water and food intake, heart rates, and heart morphology. Intriguingly, aged Apelin knockout mice developed progressive impairment of cardiac contractility associated with systolic dysfunction in the absence of histological abnormalities. We also report that pressure overload induces upregulation of Apelin expression in the heart. Importantly, in pressure overload-induced heart failure, loss of Apelin did not significantly affect the hypertrophy response, but Apelin mutant mice developed progressive heart failure. Global gene expression arrays and hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in hearts of banded Apelin(-/y) and Apelin(+/y) mice showed concerted upregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and muscle contraction. These genetic data show that the endogenous peptide Apelin is crucial to maintain cardiac contractility in pressure overload and aging.","Kuba, Keiji; Zhang, Liyong; Imai, Yumiko; Arab, Sara; Chen, Manyin; Maekawa, Yuichiro; Leschnik, Michael; Leibbrandt, Andreas; Markovic, Mato; Schwaighofer, Julia; Beetz, Nadine; Musialek, Renata; Neely, G Greg; Komnenovic, Vukoslav; Kolm, Ursula; Metzler, Bernhard; Ricci, Romeo; Hara, Hiromitsu; Meixner, Arabella; Nghiem, Mai; Chen, Xin; Dawood, Fayez; Wong, Kit Man; Sarao, Renu; Cukerman, Eva; Kimura, Akinori; Hein, Lutz; Thalhammer, Johann; Liu, Peter P; Penninger, Josef M",Circulation research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17673668/,147

195951,[Coccidiosis].,1972,"Respiratory infections with RNA viruses, such as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, are a major cause of asthma exacerbation, accompanied by enhanced neutrophilic and/or eosinophilic inflammation of the airways. We studied the effects of dsRNA synthesized during RNA virus replication, and of its receptor, TLR3, on the synthesis of eosinophilic chemokines in bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC). Synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic-cystidic acid (poly(I:C)), induced the synthesis of eosinophilic chemokines, eotaxin-1/CCL11 and RANTES/CCL5, from primary cultures of human BSMC, and IL-4 increased synergistically the synthesis of poly(I:C)-induced CCL11. A robust eosinophil chemotactic activity was released from BSMC stimulated with poly(I:C) and IL-4, which was mostly inhibited by preincubation with an anti-CCL11, but not with an anti-CCL5 Ab. Although the immunoreactivity of TLR3 was detectable on the cellular surface of BSMC by flow cytometric analysis, pretreatment with an anti-TLR3-neutralizing Ab failed to block the poly(I:C)-induced synthesis of CCL11. We have determined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy that the immunoreactivity of TLR3 was aggregated intracellularly in poly(I:C)-stimulated BSMC, colocalizing with fluorescein-labeled poly(I:C). The synthesis of CCL11 was prominently inhibited by the transfection of TLR3-specific small interfering RNA or by bafilomycin A1, an endosomal acidification inhibitor, further supporting the essential role played by intracellular TLR3 in the synthesis of poly(I:C)-induced CCL11 in BSMC. In conclusion, these observations suggest that, by activating intracellular TLR3 in BSMC, respiratory RNA virus infections stimulate the production of CCL11 and enhance eosinophilic inflammation of the airways in the Th2-dominant microenvironment.","Niimi, Kyoko; Asano, Koichiro; Shiraishi, Yoshiki; Nakajima, Takeshi; Wakaki, Misa; Kagyo, Junko; Takihara, Takahisa; Suzuki, Yusuke; Fukunaga, Koichi; Shiomi, Tetsuya; Oguma, Tsuyoshi; Sayama, Koichi; Yamaguchi, Kazuhiro; Natori, Yukikazu; Matsumoto, Misako; Seya, Tsukasa; Yamaya, Mutsuo; Ishizaka, Akitoshi",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182588/,147

It is also important for the influenza surveillance activities performed by national influenza centers. In the present study we modified a multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay (which uses TaqMan chemistry) and evaluated it for its ability to detect and concomitantly differentiate influenza viruses A and B in 370 patient samples collected during the 2001-2002 influenza season in Israel. The performance of the TaqMan assay was compared to those of a multiplex one-step RT-PCR with gel detection, a shell vial immunofluorescence assay, and virus isolation in tissue culture. The TaqMan assay had an excellent sensitivity for the detection of influenza viruses compared to that of tissue culture. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the TaqMan assay compared to the results of culture were 98.4 and 85.5%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the TaqMan assay for the detection of influenza virus A alone were 100 and 91.1%, respectively. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza virus B alone were 95.7 and 98.7%, respectively. The rapid turnaround time for the performance of the TaqMan assay (4.5 h) and the relatively low direct cost encourage the routine use of this assay in place of tissue culture. We conclude that the multiplex TaqMan assay is highly suitable for the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus infections both in well-established molecular biology laboratories and in reference clinical laboratories.","Hindiyeh, Musa; Levy, Virginia; Azar, Roberto; Varsano, Noemi; Regev, Liora; Shalev, Yael; Grossman, Zehava; Mendelson, Ella",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15695650/,147

We postulate that the variant MBL-2 genotypes are associated with increased susceptibility to and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN Nested case-control study. SETTING Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS Two hundred and twelve Caucasians with ARDS and 442 controls genotyped for the variant X, D, B, and C alleles of codon -221, 52, 54, and 57, respectively. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients homozygous for the variant codon 54B allele (54BB) had worse severity of illness on admission (p = .007), greater likelihood of septic shock (p = .04), and increased odds of ARDS (adjusted odds ratio, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-31) when compared with heterozygotes and homozygotes for the wild-type allele. This association with ARDS was especially strong among the 311 patients with septic shock (adjusted odds ratio, 12.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-74). Among the patients with ARDS, the 54BB genotype was associated with more daily organ dysfunction (p = .01) and higher mortality (adjusted hazard rate, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10). Development of ARDS and outcomes in ARDS did not vary significantly with variant alleles of codon -221, 52, and 57, but the power to detect an effect was limited secondary to the low allele frequencies. CONCLUSIONS The MBL-2 codon 54BB genotype may be important in ARDS susceptibility and outcome. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in other populations.","Gong, Michelle N; Zhou, Wei; Williams, Paige L; Thompson, B Taylor; Pothier, Lucille; Christiani, David C",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17133182/,147

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence referral guidelines highlight features that may suggest colorectal cancer (CRC) including rectal bleeding, palpable mass, iron deficiency anaemia, but also non-specific symptoms such as weight loss. In those patients referred for investigation on the basis of symptoms alone the yield of CRC is low (2-3%). Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) quantify faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) and are widely used in bowel screening programmes. A number of groups have now studied the utility of FIT in patients attending primary care with new bowel symptoms. Studies have concluded that if the FIT is negative and clinical assessment and full blood count normal then the risk of underlying significant bowel disease (SBD) is extremely small. Furthermore, patients with f-Hb ≥400 μgHb/g faeces have >50% risk of SBD and should be investigated urgently. Thus, a single f-Hb requested by GPs provides both a reliable prediction of the absence of SBD, and an objective assessment of the need and urgency of further investigation.","Strachan, Judith A; Mowat, Craig",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753974/,147

We evaluated the effect of chemically defined extracts from Echinacea angustifolia roots on rhinovirus infection. METHODS Three preparations of echinacea, with distinct phytochemical profiles, were produced by extraction from E. angustifolia roots with supercritical carbon dioxide, 60 percent ethanol, or 20 percent ethanol. A total of 437 volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either prophylaxis (beginning seven days before the virus challenge) or treatment (beginning at the time of the challenge) either with one of these preparations or with placebo. The results for 399 volunteers who were challenged with rhinovirus type 39 and observed in a sequestered setting for five days were included in the data analysis. RESULTS There were no statistically significant effects of the three echinacea extracts on rates of infection or severity of symptoms. Similarly, there were no significant effects of treatment on the volume of nasal secretions, on polymorphonuclear leukocyte or interleukin-8 concentrations in nasal-lavage specimens, or on quantitative-virus titer.

201086,"Anti-Inflammation, Immunomodulation and Therapeutic Repair in Current Clinical Trials for the Management of COVID-19",2021,"The murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus gene 1 is expressed as a polyprotein, which is cleaved into multiple proteins posttranslationally. One of the proteins is p28, which represents the amino-terminal portion of the polyprotein and is presumably generated by the activity of an autoproteinase domain of the polyprotein (S. C. Baker, C. K. Shieh, L. H. Soe, M.-F. Chang, D. M. Vannier, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol. 63:3693-3699, 1989). In this study, the boundaries and the critical amino acid residues of this putative proteinase domain were characterized by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Proteinase activity was monitored by examining the generation of p28 during in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Deletion analysis defined the proteinase domain to be within the sequences encoded from the 3.6- to 4.4-kb region from the 5' end of the genome. A 0.7-kb region between the substrate (p28) and proteinase domain could be deleted without affecting the proteolytic cleavage. However, a larger deletion (1.6 kb) resulted in the loss of proteinase activity, suggesting the importance of spacing sequences between proteinase and substrate. Computer-assisted analysis of the amino acid sequence of the proteinase domain identified potential catalytic cysteine and histidine residues in a stretch of sequence distantly related to papain-like cysteine proteinases. The role of these putative catalytic residues in the proteinase activity was studied by site-specific mutagenesis. Mutations of Cys-1137 or His-1288 led to a complete loss of proteinase activity, implicating these residues as essential for the catalytic activity. In contrast, most mutations of His-1317 or Cys-1172 had no or only minor effects on proteinase activity. This study establishes that mouse hepatitis virus gene 1 encodes a proteinase domain, in the region from 3.6 to 4.4 kb from the 5' end of the genome, which resembles members of the papain family of cysteine proteinases and that this proteinase domain is responsible for the cleavage of the N-terminal peptide.","Baker, S C; Yokomori, K; Dong, S; Carlisle, R; Gorbalenya, A E; Koonin, E V; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8396668/,147

201275,Health Canada: blood clots with AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"Historically, protection against virus infections has relied on the use of vaccines, but the induction of an immune response requires several days and in certain situations, like in newborn animals that may be infected at birth and die in a few days, there is not sufficient time to elicit a protective immune response. Immediate protection in new born could be provided either by vectors that express virus-interfering molecules in a tissue specific form, or by the production of animals expressing resistance to virus replication. The mucosal surface is the largest body surface susceptible to virus infection that can serve for virus entry. Then, it is of high interest to develop strategies to prevent infections of these areas. Virus growth can be interfered intracellularly, extracellularly or both. The antibodies neutralize virus intra- and extracellularly and their molecular biology is well known. In addition, antibodies efficiently neutralize viruses in the mucosal areas. The autonomy of antibody molecules in virus neutralization makes them functional in cells different from those that produce the antibodies and in the extracellular medium. These properties have identified antibodies as very useful molecules to be expressed by vectors or in transgenic animals to provide resistance to virus infection. A similar role could be played by antimicrobial peptides in the case of bacteria. Intracellular interference with virus growth (intracellular immunity) can be mediated by molecules of very different nature: (i) full length or single chain antibodies; (ii) mutant viral proteins that strongly interfere with the replication of the wild type virus (dominant-negative mutants); (iii) antisense RNA and ribozyme sequences; and (iv) the product of antiviral genes such as the Mx proteins. All these molecules inhibiting virus replication may be used to obtain transgenic animals with resistance to viral infection built in their genomes. We have developed two strategies to target into mucosal areas either antibodies to provide immediate protection, or antigens to elicit immune responses in the enteric or respiratory surfaces in order to prevent virus infection. One strategy is based on the development of expression vectors using coronavirus derived defective RNA minigenomes, and the other relies on the development of transgenic animals providing virus neutralizing antibodies in the milk during lactation. Two types of expression vectors are being engineered based on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) defective minigenomes. The first one is a helper virus dependent expression system and the second is based on self-replicating RNAs including the information required to encode the TGEV replicase. The minigenomes expressing the heterologous gene have been improved by using a two-step amplification system based on cytomegalovirus (CMV) and viral promoters. Expression levels around 5 micrograms per 10(6) cells were obtained. The engineered minigenomes will be useful to understand the mechanism of coronavirus replication and for the tissue specific expression of antigen, antibody or virus interfering molecules. To protect from viral infections of the enteric tract, transgenic animals secreting virus neutralizing recombinant antibodies in the milk during lactation have been developed. Neutralizing antibodies with isotypes IgG1 or IgA were produced in the milk with titers of 10(6) in RIA that reduced virus infectivity by one million-fold. The recombinant antibodies recognized a conserved epitope apparently essential for virus replication. Antibody expression levels were transgene transgene copy number independent and were related to the transgene integration site. This strategy may be of general use since it could be applied to protect newborn animals against infections of the enteric tract by viruses or bacteria for which a protective MAb has been identified. Alternatively, the same strategy could be used to target the expression of antibio","Enjuanes, L; Sola, I; Izeta, A; Sánchez-Morgado, J M; González, J M; Alonso, S; Escors, D; Sánchez, C M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10659342/,147
201276,Health Canada: blood clots with AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"The formation of epididymal stones in the rooster epididymis is a widespread problem that has detrimental effects on sperm production and fertility. The cause of epididymal stones is unknown, but an infectious agent, the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), has been implicated. The goal of this study was to determine if administering the live attenuated AIBV vaccine to male chicks increases the incidence of stones in the epididymal region of the adult rooster. Specific pathogen free (SPF) Leghorn roosters were divided into two groups: a vaccine-free group (n = 7) and a group vaccinated with AIBV (n = 12). The vaccine was administered orally at 2, 4, 10, and 14 wk of age. Blood was drawn weekly to monitor antibodies to AIBV. At 26 wk of age, blood was obtained to determine testosterone concentrations, and reproductive tracts were removed to analyze daily sperm production and to detect epididymal stones. Nine of 12 vaccinated roosters developed stones, whereas those not given the vaccine did not develop stones. Serum testosterone concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (3.6 +/- 0.30 ng/ml) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters that did not have epididymal stones (7.0 +/- 1.63 ng/ml). Testis weight was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (12.1 +/- 0.76 g), as compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (15.2 +/- 0.81 g). Daily sperm production was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (5.03 +/- 0.31 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (7.43 +/- 0.52 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day). Comparing daily sperm production on a per gram basis, vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones had 4.38 +/- 0.14 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis, which was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones, which had 5.17 +/- 0.17 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis. We conclude that the use of a live attenuated AIBV vaccine increases the incidence of epididymal stones in roosters, resulting in decreased sperm production and decreased serum testosterone concentrations.","Boltz, David A; Nakai, Masaaki; Bahra, Janice M",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15666874/,147
201772,How to boost your immune system against coronavirus infection?,2020,"PURPOSE To investigate periimplant soft tissue response following flapless extraction and immediate implant placement and provisionalization (IIPP) associated with bovine hydroxyapatite bone and connective tissue grafting in the anterior maxilla. The study evaluated the effectiveness of this technique in terms of soft tissue contours in esthetic areas with the use of the pink esthetic score (PES). MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 39 consecutive patients were treated and followed by two experienced clinicians for single-tooth implant treatment in the esthetic zone. Treatment consisted of flapless extraction, immediate implant placement, inorganic bovine bone filling of the periimplant gap, and connective tissue grafting. A provisional crown was placed at the time of implant placement. The final crown was positioned 5 to 8 months after surgery. To assess the esthetic outcome of the technique, the soft tissue around the tooth to be extracted was scored according to the PES by seven evaluators before the surgery at visit 1 (v1), and at least 1 year after the final prosthesis placement at visit 2 (v2). RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 4 years, the mean total PES score on a scale from 1 to 10 was 5.64 and 7.07 at v1 and v2, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the PES scores before surgery and at the follow-up examination of the anterior single implants (P = 0.0008). CONCLUSION Within the limitations of this study, postextraction with immediate implant loading associated with bovine hydroxyapatite and connective tissue grafting is a predictable technique. The esthetic outcome is that soft tissue seems to be maintained or improved significantly according to PES assessment compared with baseline.","Bonnet, Franck; Karouni, Michel; Antoun, Hadi",The international journal of esthetic dentistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073219/,147

Here, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with malignant disease in the times of COVID-19. These recommendations were prepared by an international panel of experts and then consented by the EHA Scientific Working Group on Infection in Hematology. The primary aim is to enable clinicians to provide optimal cancer care as safely as possible, since the most important protection for patients with malignant disease is the best-possible control of the underlying disease.","von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie; Vehreschild, Jörg Janne; Cornely, Oliver; Pagano, Livio; Compagno, Francesca; Hirsch, Hans H",Leukemia,,147

Many wildlife species have been suggested as possible intermediate sources for the transmission of COVID-19 virus from bats to humans. The quick transmission of COVID-19 outbreak has imposed quarantine measures across the world, and as a result, most of the world's towns and cities fell silent under lockdowns. The current study comes to investigate the ways by which the COVID-19 outbreak affects wildlife globally. Hundreds of internet sites and scientific reports have been reviewed to satisfy the needs of the study. Stories of seeing wild animals roaming the quiet, deserted streets and cities during the COVID-19 outbreak have been posted in the media and social media. The strong link between wildlife markets and COVID-19 resulted in international calls asking countries to shut down wildlife markets forever. Poorer and vulnerable people around the world overexploit natural resources including wildlife. Roadkills became minimal because of the lockdown measures. The reduction in noise pollution level is expected to improve wildlife health and ecology including breeding success. The shortage of food items provided to zoo and park animals constituted a real threat to animals and the institution harboring them. The increase in fish biomass comes as a result of the sharp decline in fishing activities. The isolation of antibodies from certain wildlife species is promising in saving humankind against COVID-19. The infection of wild and pet animals with COVID-19 virus from humans and the interspecific transmission of the infection are disastrous to animal ecology. Finally, closures may enhance people to connect more and more with nature in order to acknowledge wildlife in their surrounding environments. In conclusion, the study asks the world's different parties to conserve wildlife in a sustainable fashion and to regulate exotic animal trade in wet markets in order to lower the incidence of zoonoses.","Rabou, A.

204647,Converted neurosurgeons in a converted coronavirus hospital: sharing the experience of a metamorphosis,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 outbreak restricting measures may have affected the provision of good end-of-life care for patients with and without COVID-19. AIM: To describe characteristics of patients who died and the care they received, and to examine how patient characteristics, setting and visiting restrictions are related to provided care and evaluation of the dying process. DESIGN: An open observational online survey among healthcare professionals about their experience of end-of-life care that was provided to a patient with or without COVID-19 who died between March and July 2020. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals (nurses, physicians and others) in the Netherlands from all settings: home (n = 163), hospital (n = 249), nursing home (n = 192), hospice (n = 89) or elsewhere (n = 68). RESULTS: Of patients reported on, 56% had COVID-19. Among these patients, 358 (84.4%) also had a serious chronic illness. Having COVID-19 was negatively, and having a serious chronic illness was positively associated with healthcare staff's favourable appreciation of end-of-life care. Often there had been visiting restrictions in the last 2 days of life (75.8%). This was negatively associated with appreciation of care at the end of life and the dying process. Finally, care at the end of life was less favourably appreciated in hospitals and especially nursing homes, and more favourably in home settings and especially hospices. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic may be further optimised, especially in nursing homes and hospitals. Allowing at least some level of visits of relatives seems a key component.","Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D; Pasman, H Roeline W; Korfage, Ida J; Witkamp, Erica; Zee, Masha; van Lent, Liza Gg; Goossensen, Anne; van der Heide, Agnes",Palliat Med,,147

Within the context of the new coronavirus pandemic, these patients are highly vulnerable to infection by COVID-19, which might increase the care demands and burden of family caregivers. AIM: This study aimed to explore the subjective experiences of family caregivers of non-COVID-19 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing in-centre haemodialysis during the COVID-19 lockdown. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative study was performed with a purposive sample. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 19 family caregivers (50.7 ± 14 years old) of patients undergoing in-centre haemodialysis in April 2020. FINDINGS: Four major themes were identified: (1) emotional distress; (2) changes in caregiving responsibilities; (3) educational and supportive needs; and (4) coping strategies to deal with the outbreak and with the lockdown. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that family caregivers of patients undergoing in-centre haemodialysis have to manage several additional care responsibilities due to COVID-19 lockdown. The dialysis team should consider the development of educational and supportive interventions to meet family caregivers' needs, mitigate emotional distress, fears and concerns, and prevent caregiver burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sousa, Helena; Frontini, Roberta; Ribeiro, Oscar; Paúl, Constança; Costa, Elísio; Amado, Leonilde; Miranda, Vasco; Ribeiro, Fernando; Figueiredo, Daniela",Scand. j. caring sci,,147

As a field evolves, so too will that field's measurement instruments and data storage systems, as they are invented, improved upon, and made obsolete. For data streams generated by opaque sociotechnical systems which may have episodic and unknown internal rule changes, detecting and accounting for shifts in historical datasets requires vigilance and creative analysis. Here, we show that around 10\% of day-scale word usage frequency time series for Twitter collected in real time for a set of roughly 10,000 frequently used words for over 10 years come from tweets with, in effect, corrupted language labels. We describe how we uncovered problematic signals while comparing word usage over varying time frames. We locate time points where Twitter switched on or off different kinds of language identification algorithms, and where data formats may have changed. We then show how we create a statistic for identifying and removing words with pathological time series. While our resulting process for removing `bad' time series from ensembles of time series is particular, the approach leading to its construction may be generalizeable.","Dodds, P. S.; Minot, J.

208387,ASCO 2020: highlights in breast cancer,2021,"Background Nationwide, unbiased, and unselected data of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 are scarce. Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. METHODS: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. FINDINGS: Of 10â021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18-59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60-69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70-79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged &#8805;80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10â021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 13·5 days (SD 12·1). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with terms COVID and SARS-COV-2 from December 1, 2019 till April 5, 2020. We estimated overall prevalence, stratified prevalence based on severity, estimated risk ratio (RR), and estimated standardized mean difference (SMD) of liver function parameters in severe as compared to non-severe COVID. Random effect method utilizing inverse variance approach was used for pooling the data. RESULTS: In all, 128 studies were included. The most frequent abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia [61.27% (48.24-72.87)], elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) [27.94% (18.22-40.27)], alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [23.28% (19.92-27.01)], and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [23.41% (18.84-28.70)]. Furthermore, the relative risk of these abnormalities was higher in the patients with severe COVID-19 when compared to non-severe disease [Hypoalbuminemia-2.65 (1.38-5.07); GGT-2.31 (1.6-3.33); ALT-1.76 (1.44-2.15); AST-2.30 (1.82-2.90)]. The SMD of hypoalbuminemia, GGT, ALT, and AST elevation in severe as compared to non-severe were - 1.05 (- 1.27 to - 0.83), 0.76 (0.40-1.12), 0.42 (0.27-0.56), and 0.69 (0.52-0.86), respectively. The pooled prevalence and RR of chronic liver disease as a comorbidity was 2.64% (1.73-4) and 1.69 (1.05-2.73) respectively. CONCLUSION: The most frequent abnormality in liver functions was hypoalbuminemia followed by derangements in gamma-glutamyl transferase and aminotransferases, and these abnormalities were more frequent in severe disease.

The immune system is crucial in defending and eliminating the virus and infected cells. However, immune dysregulation may result in the rapid progression of COVID-19. Here, we evaluated the subsets, phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer (NK) and T cells in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with disease severity. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients enrolled in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 25 to February 27, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells and T cells subsets in circulating blood and serum levels of cytokines were analyzed via flow cytometry. Then the LASSO logistic regression model was employed to predict risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Results: The counts and percentages of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were significantly reduced in patients with severe symptoms. The cytotoxic CD3-CD56dimCD16+ cell population significantly decreased, while the CD3-CD56dimCD16- part significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, elevated expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD244 and programmed death-1 (PD-1), on NK cells and T cells, as well as decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin and granzyme A, were detected in patients with COVID-19. The serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in severe patients. Moreover, the CD3-CD56dimCD16- cells were screened out as an influential factor in severe cases by LASSO logistic regression. Conclusions: The functional exhaustion and other subset alteration of NK and T cells may contribute to the progression and improve the prognosis of COVID-19. Surveillance of lymphocyte subsets may in the future enable early screening for signs of critical illness and understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.","Li, Mingyue; Guo, Weina; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Xiaobei; Dai, Die; Liu, Xingxing; Wu, Yiquan; Li, Mengmeng; Zhang, Wenjing; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Lin, Lan; Kang, Zhenyu; Yu, Ting; Tian, Chunxia; Qin, Renjie; Gui, Yang; Jiang, Feng; Fan, Heng; Heissmeyer, Vigo; Sarapultsev, Alexey; Wang, Lin; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng",Front Immunol,,147

Treating models as 'boundary objects', and focusing on media and public communications, we 'follow the numbers' to trace the social life of key projections from prominent mathematical models of COVID-19. Public deliberations and controversies about models and their projections are illuminating. These help trace how projections are 'made multiple' in their enactments as 'public troubles'. We need an approach to evidence-making for policy which is emergent and adaptive, and which treats science as an entangled effect of public concern made in social practices.

We show that 81.3-100% of individuals with high-viral-load SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal-positive samples also test positive for PoST, suggesting this method is effective in identifying COVID-19 contagious individuals. Furthermore, we successfully identified polymorphisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants, in SARS-CoV-2-positive PoST samples. Overall, we report that PoST is a new non-invasive, cost-effective, and easy-to-implement smartphone-based smart alternative for SARS-CoV-2 testing, which could help to contain COVID-19 outbreaks and identification of variants of concern in the years to come.","Young, Rodrigo M; Solis, Camila J; Barriga-Fehrman, Andres; Abogabir, Carlos; Thadani, Alvaro R; Labarca, Mariana; Bustamante, Eva; Tapia, Cecilia V; Sarda, Antonia G; Sepulveda, Francisca; Pozas, Nadia; Cerpa, Leslie C; Lavanderos, María A; Varela, Nelson M; Santibañez, Alvaro; Sandino, Ana M; Reyes-Lopez, Felipe; Dixon, Garth; Quiñones, Luis A",eLife (Cambridge),,147

A series of country-specific and multicountry consultative meetings were conducted during 2018-2019 that involved 15 countries across five regions to determine the status of implementation of HHSDGs. Almost 120 representatives from health and non-health sectors participated. The assessment relied on a multidomain analytical framework drawing on existing public health policy frameworks. During the first 5 years of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) era, participating LMICs from South and Central Asia, East Africa and Latin America demonstrated growing political commitment to HHSDGs, with augmentation of multisectoral institutional arrangements, strengthening of monitoring systems and engagement of development partners. On the other hand, there has been limited involvement of civic society representatives and academia, relatively few capacity development initiatives were in place, a well-crafted communication strategy was missing, and there is limited evidence of additional domestic financing for implementing HHSDGs. While the momentum towards universal health coverage is notable, explicit linkages with non-health SDGs and integrated multisectoral implementation strategies are lacking. The study offers messages to LMICs that would allow for a full decade of accelerated implementation of HHSDGs, and points to the need for more implementation research in each domain and for testing interventions that are likely to work before scale-up.","Siddiqi, Sameen; Aftab, Wafa; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Huicho, Luis; Mogilevskii, Roman; Friberg, Peter; Lindgren-Garcia, Johanna; Causevic, Sara; Khamis, Anil; Shah, Mashal Murad; Bhutta, Zulfiqar Ahmed",,,147

Application to a Covid-19 treated patient,2020,"Mathematical modelling studies predicting the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been used worldwide, but precisions are limited. Thus, continuous evaluation of the modelling studies is crucial. We investigated situations of virus importation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to assess effectiveness of a modelling study by Haider N et al. titled 'Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America'. We obtained epidemiological data of 2417 COVID-19 cases reported by 40 countries in SSA within 30 days of the first case confirmed in Nigeria on 27 February. Out of 442 cases which had travel history available, only one (0.2%) had a travel history to China. These findings underline the result of the model. However, the fact that there were numbers of imported cases from other regions shows the limits of the model. The limits could be attributed to the characteristics of the COVID-19 which is infectious even when the patients do not express any symptoms. Therefore, there is a profound need for all modelling researchers to take asymptomatic cases into account when they establish modelling studies.","Miyachi, T; Tanimoto, T; Kami, M",Epidemiol Infect,,147

Approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 progress to severe pneumonia and eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and/or multiple organ failure with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence points towards a determinant pathogenic role of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in mediating the susceptibility, infection, inflammatory response and parenchymal injury in lungs and other organs of COVID-19 patients. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has important roles in pulmonary pathological states, including fibrosis, pneumonia and ARDS. RAGE overexpression/hyperactivation is essential to the deleterious effects of RAS in several pathological processes, including hypertension, chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, all of which are major comorbidities of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose RAGE as an additional molecular target in COVID-19 patients for ameliorating the multi-organ pathology induced by the virus and improving survival, also in the perspective of future infections by other coronaviruses.","Chiappalupi, Sara; Salvadori, Laura; Vukasinovic, Aleksandra; Donato, Rosario; Sorci, Guglielmo; Riuzzi, Francesca",Life Sci,,147

221516,Acute myocarditis following administration of BNT162b2 vaccine,2021,"OBJECTIVES: From 2016 to 2018 Florida documented 1471 cases of Zika virus, 299 of which were pregnant women (Florida Department of Health, https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-bornediseases/surveillance.html , 2019a). Florida's response required unprecedented rapid and continuous cross-sector communication, adaptation, and coordination. Zika tested public health systems in new ways, particularly for maternal child health populations. The systems are now being challenged again, as the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic spreads throughout Florida. This qualitative journey mapping evaluation of Florida's response focused on care for pregnant women and families with infants exposed to Zika virus. METHODS: Fifteen focus groups and interviews were conducted with 33 public health and healthcare workers who managed outbreak response, case investigations, and patient care in south Florida. Data were thematically analyzed, and the results were framed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Healthcare Systems Framework of six building blocks: health service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership and governance (World Health Organization, https://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf , 2007, https://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/ , 2010). RESULTS: Results highlighted coordination of resources, essential services and treatment, data collection, communication among public health and healthcare systems, and dissemination of information. Community education, testing accuracy and turnaround time, financing, and continuity of health services were areas of need, and there was room for improvement in all indicator areas. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO Framework encapsulated important infrastructure and process factors relevant to the Florida Zika response as well as future epidemics. In this context, similarities, differences, and implications for the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic response are discussed.","Marshall, Jennifer; Scott, Blake; Delva, Jennifer; Ade, Cedrick; Hernandez, Santiago; Patel, Jaladhikumar; Moreno-Cheek, Mantero; Rojas, Dogeli; Tanner, Jean-Paul; Kirby, Russell S",Matern Child Health J,,147

As the scope and magnitude of the pandemic became clearer, the initial plans by the USMLE program's sponsoring organizations (NBME and Federation of State Medical Boards) to resume Step 2 CS in the short-term shifted to long-range plans to relaunch an exam that could harness technology and reduce infection risk. Insights about ongoing changes in undergraduate and graduate medical education and practice environments, coupled with challenges in delivering a transformed examination during a pandemic, led to the January 2021 decision to permanently discontinue Step 2 CS. Despite this, the USMLE program considers assessment of clinical skills to be critically important. The authors believe this decision will facilitate important advances in assessing clinical skills. Factors contributing to the decision included concerns about achieving desired goals within desired timeframes; a review of enhancements to clinical skills training and assessment that have occurred since the launch of Step 2 CS in 2004; an opportunity to address safety and health concerns, including those related to examinee stress and wellness during a pandemic; a review of advances in the education, training, practice, and delivery of medicine; and a commitment to pursuing innovative assessments of clinical skills. USMLE program staff continue to seek input from varied stakeholders to shape and prioritize technological and methodological enhancements to guide development of clinical skills assessment. The USMLE program's continued exploration of constructs and methods by which communication skills, clinical reasoning, and physical examination may be better assessed within the remaining components of the exam provides opportunities for examinees, educators, regulators, the public, and other stakeholders to provide input.","Katsufrakis, Peter J; Chaudhry, Humayun J",Acad. med,,147

METHODS: In an open-label trial with blinded assessment of outcomes, we randomly assigned 1900 adults with coma who had had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause to undergo targeted hypothermia at 33°C, followed by controlled rewarming, or targeted normothermia with early treatment of fever (body temperature, &#8805;37.8°C). The primary outcome was death from any cause at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included functional outcome at 6 months as assessed with the modified Rankin scale. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to sex, age, initial cardiac rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and presence or absence of shock on admission. Prespecified adverse events were pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise, and skin complications related to the temperature management device. RESULTS: A total of 1850 patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. At 6 months, 465 of 925 patients (50%) in the hypothermia group had died, as compared with 446 of 925 (48%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.14; P = 0.37). Of the 1747 patients in whom the functional outcome was assessed, 488 of 881 (55%) in the hypothermia group had moderately severe disability or worse (modified Rankin scale score &#8805;4), as compared with 479 of 866 (55%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.09). Outcomes were consistent in the prespecified subgroups. Arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise was more common in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (24% vs. 17%, P<0.001). The incidence of other adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, targeted hypothermia did not lead to a lower incidence of death by 6 months than targeted normothermia.

Like most of the affected countries in the globe, India is now facing serious crisis due to COVID-19 in the recent times. The evaluation of the present status of the provinces affected by COVID-19 is very much essential to the government authorities to impose preventive strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and to take necessary measures. In this article, a computational methodology is developed to estimate the present status of states and provinces which are affected due to COVID-19 using a fuzzy inference system. The factors such as population density, number of COVID-19 tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, recovery rate, and mortality rate are considered as the input parameters of the proposed methodology. Considering positive and negative factors of the input parameters, the rule base is developed using triangular fuzzy numbers to capture uncertainties associated with the model. The application potentiality is validated by evaluating Pearson's correlation coefficient. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to observe the changes of final output by varying the tolerance ranges of the inputs. The results of the proposed method show that some of the provinces have very poor performance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in India. So, the government needs to take serious attention to deal with the pandemic situation of COVID-19 in those provinces.","Ghosh, Bappaditya; Biswas, Animesh",Appl Soft Comput,,147

We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods: We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (≤12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (≥2 strains) and PICU admission. Results: A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3–4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6–6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P &lt; 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P = 0.02).

However, the estimated prevalence essential to guide public health policy varies in published literature. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate prevalence of smell and taste loss among COVID-19 patients. Data Sources: We conducted systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for studies published on the prevalence of smell and taste loss in COVID-19 patients. Review Methods: Two authors extracted data on study characteristics and the prevalence of smell and taste loss. Random-effects modeling was used to estimate pooled prevalence. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. This study used PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Results: Twenty-seven of 32 studies reported a prevalence of loss of smell, taste, or both from a combined sample of 20,451 COVID-19 patients. The estimated global pooled prevalence of loss of smell among 19,424 COVID-19 patients from 27 studies was 48.47% (95% CI, 33.78%-63.29%). Loss of taste was reported in 20 studies and 8001 patients with an estimated pooled prevalence of 41.47% (95% CI, 3.13%-31.03%), while 13 studies that reported combined loss of smell and taste in 5977 COVID-19 patients indicated a pooled prevalence of 35.04% (95% CI, 22.03%-49.26%). Conclusions: The prevalence of smell and taste loss among COVID-19 patients was high globally, and regional differences supported the relevance of these symptoms as important markers. Health workers must consider them as suspicion indices for empirical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","Ibekwe, Titus Sunday; Fasunla, Ayotunde James; Orimadegun, Adebola Emmanuel",OTO Open,,147

Herein, a valid ratiometric fluorescence strategy using g-C3N4 nanosheets coupled with Eu3+ is designed for the assay of TC. In this strategy, both Eu3+ and g-C3N4 nanosheets serve as the recognition units of TC. The blue fluorescence of g-C3N4 nanosheets can be quenched by TC via the inner filter effect (IFE); meanwhile, the red fluorescence of Eu3+ can be enhanced by TC through the antenna effect (AE). The synergistic effect of AE and IFE caused by TC makes the developed ratiometric fluorescent sensor display a wide linear range for TC from 0.25 to 80 µM with a detection limit of 6.5 nM and a significant fluorescence color evolution from blue to red. Given its simplicity, free-label, excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, and recognizable color change, point-of-care testing systems, including smartphones and test paper-based assays, are developed for the visual sensing of TC. The integration of smartphones and test paper on a ratiometric fluorescent sensor greatly reduces the detection cost and time, providing a promising method for the qualitative discernment and semi-quantitative assay of TC on-site. Moreover, the potential application of the approach is also verified by detecting TC in milk.","Han, Lei; Fan, Yu Zhu; Qing, Min; Liu, Shi Gang; Yang, Yu Zhu; Li, Nian Bing; Luo, Hong Qun",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,147

However, we should not lose sight of the fact that COVID-19 will attack any cell type in the body expressing ACE2 - including human spermatozoa. These cells possess the entire repertoire of receptors (AT1R, AT2R, MAS) and ligand processing enzymes (ACE1 and ACE2) needed to support the angiotensin signalling cascade. The latter not only provides COVID-19 with a foothold on the sperm surface but may also promote integration, given the additional presence of a range of proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS12, furin) capable of promoting viral fusion. This article reviews the roles played by these various cellular constituents in maintaining the vitality of human spermatozoa and their competence for fertilization. The reproductive consequences of a viral attack on these systems, in terms of fertility and the risk of sexual transmission, are currently unknown. However, we should be alive to the possibility that there may be reproductive consequences of COVID-19 infection in young males that go beyond their capacity to survive a viral attack.","Aitken, Robert John",Androl.

DESIGN: Randomised, open label trial. SETTING: Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34%) who did not receive tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe or critical covid-19, tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving clinical outcomes at 15 days, and it might increase mortality.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify existing gaps where further research is needed on the diagnosis and treatment of DIC complicated by COVID-19. METHODS: We used the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. MEDLINE, CENTRAL, WHO-ICTRP, ClinicalTrial.gov and PROSPERO were searched from their inception to 6 October 2020. RESULTS: Seven studies were selected; five were already published and two are ongoing. DIC was diagnosed using the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) DIC score (n = 4) and the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) DIC score (n = 5). Seven studies examined the effectiveness of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); of these, four studies used a prophylactic dose and five used a therapeutic dose of LMWH. A prophylactic dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH) was investigated in two studies. CONCLUSION: Studies on DIC diagnostic criteria and anticoagulants were limited to the ISTH or SIC scores and heparinoids, particularly LMWH. Further studies are needed to compare these with other available DIC scoring systems and anticoagulants.","Mori, Hirotaka; Ohkawara, Hiroshi; Togawa, Ryuichi; Rikimaru, Mami; Shibata, Yoko; Ikezoe, Takayuki",Int J Hematol,,147

The present study aimed to compare the emotional exhaustion of South Korean employees before and after the pandemic, as well as to examine how the demographic characteristics of employees affected their emotional exhaustion. We administered surveys to 276 employees before the COVID-19 pandemic (from July to October 2019) and 301 employees after its onset (from March to April 2020). A series of t-tests demonstrated that both employee samples were similar demographically. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that even when controlling for baseline emotions, the employees assessed after the COVID-19 experienced significantly higher emotional exhaustion than those assessed before. Furthermore, in reaction to COVID-19, female employees felt more emotionally exhausted than their male counterparts. Finally, after the COVID-19 pandemic, younger and short-tenured employees reported higher emotional exhaustion than older and more experienced employees. These findings provide insight into managing the mental health of employees during the COVID-19 crisis. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The emotional exhaustion of the South Korean workforce increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. After the pandemic, female employees experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion than their male counterparts. After the pandemic, younger and short-tenured employees experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion than older and long-tenured employees.","Hwang, Hansol; Hur, Won-Moo; Shin, Yuhyung",Psychol. psychother,,147

247614,Practical approach to prevent COVID-19 infection at breast cancer screening,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Besides distinctive respiratory and digestive hallmarks, COVID-19 has been recently associated with a high prevalence of pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable states known as ""COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy"" (CAC), corresponding to a worsening in patients' conditions, whose causes are still to be elucidated. A link between anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and viral infections has long been suggested. APLs are assessed for anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) diagnosis, characterized by thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and coagulopathy. Furthermore, circulating immune complexes (CICs), arisen upon inflammatory responses and related immune dysregulation, can lead to endothelial cell damage and thrombotic complications. METHOD: We performed an extended panel including IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin, IgG/IgM anti-ß2-glycoprotein-1, coupled with IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin, IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time), and a negative control group. IgG CIC analysis followed to evaluate inflammatory status, through a possible complement system activation. RESULTS: Our results showed low positive case percentage in IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin and IgG/IgM anti-ß2-glycoprotein-1 assays (4.54%, 6.25%, and 4.55%; in early infection group, late infection group, and control group, respectively); few positive cases in IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V immunoassays; and no IgG CIC positivity in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data show a low aPL prevalence, likely excluding an involvement in the pathogenesis of CAC. Interestingly, IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and anti-annexin-V positive cases, detected in late infection group, suggest that aPLs could temporarily increase or could trigger a ""COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome"" in predisposed patients. Key Points â¢ To our knowledge, anti-prothrombin (aPT) antibodies, anti-annexin-V antibodies and CICs in COVID-19 patients have not been reported in the scientific literature. â¢ Lack of uniformity and the low percentage of aCL/aß2GP1 positivity preclude a putative role in CAC pathogenesis. â¢ IgG/IgM anti-prothrombin and IgG/IgM anti-annexin-V data show that distribution of positive case number increases in late infection patients, significantly in anti-annexin-V results, suggesting a possible role for these anti-phospholipid antibodies in disease course. â¢ aPLs can arise transiently in some patients with critical illness and SARS-CoV-2 infection (disappearing in a few weeks), as well as in other genetically predisposed patients; they could trigger a ""COVID-19-induced-APS-like-syndrome"".","Cristiano, Antonio; Fortunati, Valentina; Cherubini, Fabio; Bernardini, Sergio; Nuccetelli, Marzia",Clin. rheumatol,,147

253360,Cancer screenings decline significantly during pandemic,2020,"An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention in the treatment of COVID-19, but the detailed mechanisms by which natural products inhibit SARS-CoV-2 have not been elucidated. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by the pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in patients with Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol distribution. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that briefly disrupting the distribution of membrane cholesterol is a potential novel therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kim, Tai Young; Jeon, Sangeun; Jang, Youngho; Gotina, Lizaveta; Won, Joungha; Ju, Yeon Ha; Kim, Sunpil; Jang, Minwoo Wendy; Won, Woojin; Park, Mingu Gordon; Pae, Ae Nim; Han, Sunkyu; Kim, Seungtaek; Lee, C Justin",Exp Mol Med,,147

I know has studied the role of children in intrafamily contagion and the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an area with low community transmission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study. Patients between 0-15 years studied by RT-PCR technique due to clinical suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus in the months of March-May 2020. Survey on symptoms and contacts. Determination of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at least 21 days after the RT-PCR test. RESULTS: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and age mean 8.4 years (95% CI 6.8-10,5) higher than not infected. Fever was the most common and with greater sensitivity. The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P=0.029) and headache (P=.009) among children infected with a specificity of 96.7% and 81.5% respectively. There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms. 81.8% of those infected were probably infected in the nucleus 85.2% by a parent who worked outside the home. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70.9% and its negative predictive value 91.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the symptoms more specific difficult to detect in younger children. Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission. The sensitivity of RT-PCR could be related to a less contagiousness in children after one week of infection.","Fiel-Ozores, Antia; González-Durán, María Luisa; Novoa-Carballal, Reyes; Portugués-de la Red, María Del Mar; Fernández-Pinilla, Isabel; Cabrera-Alvargonzález, Jorge Julio; Martínez-Reglero, Cristina; Rey-Cao, Sonia; Concheiro-Guisán, Ana",An. pediatr.

A stochastic lattice gas version of the model was applied on hybrid lattices which, in turn, are generated from typical square lattices when inserting a connection probability p that a given lattice site has both first- and second-nearest-neighbor interactions. By combining percolation theory and finite-size scaling analysis, we estimate both the critical threshold and leading critical exponent ratios of the non-absorbing SIR model in different cases of hybrid lattices. An analysis of the average size of the percolating cluster of recovered individuals, as well as the size distribution of non-percolating clusters, was carried out to determine the universality class of the model.","Ferraz, Carlos Handrey Araujo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01054v1.pdf,147

257330,Pediatric genetics: rare is common,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes various cardiopulmonary manifestations. Bedside ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of these manifestations. Vscan Extend™ (GE, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) is a handheld ultrasound device with a dual probe and an artificial intelligence application to detect ejection fraction. It can help in reducing the time for diagnosis, duration, and the number of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19. This is a prospective observational study comparing the cardiorespiratory parameters and time duration for assessment between Vscan Extend™ and the conventional ultrasound machine. Patients and methods: Paired observations were made in 96 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by two intensivists. Intensivist A used the Vscan Extend™ device to assess the cardiac function, lung fields, diaphragm, deep veins, and abdomen. Intensivist B used clinical examination, X-ray chest, ECG, and conventional echocardiogram for assessment. The agreement between the findings and the time duration required in both the methods was compared. Results: The use of handheld ultrasound has significantly decreased the duration of bedside examination of patients than the conventional method. The median duration of examination using handheld ultrasound was 9 (8.0-11.0) minutes, compared to 20 (17-22) minutes with the conventional method (P &lt; 0.001). The Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 1.0 for left ventricular systolic function, most of the lung fields, and diaphragmatic movement. Conclusion: Vscan Extend™ helps in the rapid identification and diagnosis of cardiopulmonary manifestations in COVID-19 patients. The agreement between the handheld device and the conventional method proves its efficacy and safety.","Maheshwarappa, H. M.; Mishra, S.; Kulkarni, A.

To address this, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the association between cardiac injury and all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury and coagulopathy. Further, studies comparing cardiac biomarker levels in survivors versus nonsurvivors were included. A total of 14 studies (3,175 patients) were utilized for the final analysis. Cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR]:7.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.69 to 13.01; I2=58%), ICU admission (RR: 4.06; 95% CI: 1.50 to 10.97; I2â¯=â¯61%), mechanical ventilation (RR: 5.53; 95% CI: 3.09 to 9.91; I2â¯=â¯0%), and developing coagulopathy (RR: 3.86; 95% CI:2.81 to 5.32; I2â¯=â¯0%). However, cardiac injury was not associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR:3.22; 95% CI:0.72 to 14.47; I2â¯=â¯73%) or acute kidney injury (RR: 11.52, 95% CI:0.03 to 4,159.80; I2â¯=â¯0%).

265118,Thrombocytopathies: Not Just Aggregation Defects-The Clinical Relevance of Procoagulant Platelets,2021,"Acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world, since its discovery in 2019, Wuhan, China. This disease is called COVID-19 and already killed over 1 million people worldwide. The clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unfortunately, so far, there is no validated vaccine, and its management consists mainly of supportive care. Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are highly prevalent in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. In fact, a prothrombotic state seems to be present in most fatal cases of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, causing immune-mediated tissue damage, disruption of the endothelial barrier, and uncontrolled thrombogenesis. Thrombin is the key regulator of coagulation and fibrin formation. In severe COVID-19, a dysfunctional of physiological anticoagulant mechanisms leads to a progressive increase of thrombin activity, which is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome development and a poor prognosis. Protease-activated receptor type 1 (PAR1) is the main thrombin receptor and may represent an essential link between coagulation and inflammation in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the potential role of PAR1 inhibition and regulation in COVID-19 treatment.","Rovai, Emanuel S; Alves, Tomaz; Holzhausen, Marinella",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,147

OBJECTIVE: Conduct an exploratory analysis of potential correlations between the population distribution of cycle threshold (CT) values and COVID-19 disease dynamics, operationalized as percent positivity, transmission rate and COVID-19 hospitalizations. METHODS: 148,410 specimens collected between September 15th, 2020 and January 11th, 2021 from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. Daily median CT value, daily transmission rate R(t), daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression evaluated possible associations between daily median CT and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots determined whether a time delay existed between changes in the daily median CT value and measure of community disease dynamics. RESULTS: Daily median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization count (with a 33 day time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among testing samples (p<.001 for all correlations). Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT and COVID-19 hospitalization count (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the literature by analyzing samples collected from an entire geographical area, and contextualizing the results with other research investigating population CT values.","Tso, Chak Foon; Garikipati, Anurag; Green-Saxena, Abigail; Mao, Qingqing; Das, Ritankar",,,147

However, the molecular composition of B-cell endosomal trafficking pathways and their specific roles in B-cell responses have not been systematically investigated. Here, we report high-throughput identification of genes regulating B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated antigen internalization using genome-wide functional screens. We show that antigen internalization depends both on constitutive, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and on antigen-induced, clathrin-independent endocytosis mediated by endophilin A2. Although endophilin A2-mediated endocytosis is dispensable for antigen presentation, it is selectively required for metabolic support of B-cell proliferation, in part through regulation of iron uptake. Consequently, endophilin A2-deficient mice show defects in GC B-cell responses and production of high-affinity IgG. The requirement for endophilin A2 highlights a unique importance of clathrin-independent intracellular trafficking in GC B-cell clonal expansion and antibody responses.","Malinova, Dessislava; Wasim, Laabiah; Newman, Rebecca; Martínez-Riaño, Ana; Engels, Niklas; Tolar, Pavel",EMBO Rep,,147

Methods: Serum N protein level in SARS-COV-2 infected patients and non-SARS-COV-2 infected population was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) double antibody sandwich assay. Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was used to detect serum N protein antibodies in the above populations. Results: Fifty cases of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-positive and SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative patients had a serum N protein positivity rate of 76%. Thirty-seven patients who were positive for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody after infection had a serum SARS-CoV-2 N protein positivity rate of 2.7%. Serum N protein test results of 633 non-SARS-COV-2 infected patients, including pregnant women, patients with other respiratory infections, and individuals with increased rheumatoid factor were all negative, with serum N protein concentration <10.00 pg/mL at 100% specificity. Using SPSS 19.0 to calculate the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve was determined to be 0.9756 (95% confidence interval 0.9485-1.000, p < 0.0001), and sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% confidence interval 81.16-96.85%) and 96.84% (95% confidence interval 95.17-97.15%), respectively. The best CUT-OFF value was 1.850 pg/mL. Conclusion: The measurement of serum SARS-COV-2 N protein has a high diagnostic value for infected patients before the antibody appears and shortens the window period of serological diagnosis.

271542,Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics: 2020 in Review,2020,"Machine learning models' goal is to make correct predictions for specific tasks by learning important properties and patterns from data. By doing so, there is a chance that the model learns properties that are unrelated to its primary task. Property Inference Attacks exploit this and aim to infer from a given model (\ie the target model) properties about the training dataset seemingly unrelated to the model's primary goal. If the training data is sensitive, such an attack could lead to privacy leakage. This paper investigates the influence of the target model's complexity on the accuracy of this type of attack, focusing on convolutional neural network classifiers. We perform attacks on models that are trained on facial images to predict whether someone's mouth is open. Our attacks' goal is to infer whether the training dataset is balanced gender-wise. Our findings reveal that the risk of a privacy breach is present independently of the target model's complexity: for all studied architectures, the attack's accuracy is clearly over the baseline. We discuss the implication of the property inference on personal data in the light of Data Protection Regulations and Guidelines.","Parisot, Mathias P.

271543,Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics: 2020 in Review,2020,"Although transport into the nucleus mediated by the importin (IMP) &#945;/ß1-heterodimer is central to viral infection, small molecule inhibitors of IMP&#945;/ß1-dependent nuclear import have only been described and shown to have antiviral activity in the last decade. Their robust antiviral activity is due to the strong reliance of many different viruses, including RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV), on the IMP&#945;/ß1-virus interface. High-throughput compound screens have identified many agents that specifically target this interface. Of these, agents targeting IMP&#945;/ß1 directly include the FDA-approved macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, which has documented broad-spectrum activity against a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, DENV1-4, ZIKV, West Nile virus (WNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Ivermectin has thus far been tested in Phase III human clinical trials for DENV, while there are currently close to 80 trials in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2; preliminary results for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) as well as observational/retrospective studies are consistent with ivermectin affording clinical benefit. Agents that target the viral component of the IMP&#945;/ß1-virus interface include N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), which specifically targets DENV/ZIKV/WNV non-structural protein 5 (NS5). 4-HPR has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of infection by DENV1-4, including in an antibody-dependent enhanced animal challenge model, as well as ZIKV, with Phase II clinical challenge trials planned. The results from rigorous RCTs will help determine the therapeutic potential of the IMP&#945;/ß1-virus interface as a target for antiviral development.","Martin, Alexander J; Jans, David A",Biochem Soc Trans,,147
271913,Response to: Status of Remdesivir: Not Yet Beyond Question!,2020,"The quest for ligands alternative to Protein A for the purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been pursued for almost three decades. Yet, the IgG-binding peptides known to date still fall short of the host cell protein (HCP) logarithmic removal value (LRV) set by Protein A media (2.5-3.1). In this study, we present an integrated computational-experimental approach leading to the discovery of peptide ligands that provide HCP LRVs on par with Protein A. First, the screening of 60,000 peptide variants was performed using a high-throughput search algorithm to identify sequences that ensure IgG affinity binding. Select sequences WQRHGI, MWRGWQ, RHLGWF, and GWLHQR were then negatively screened in silico against a panel of model HCPs to ensure the selection of peptides with high binding selectivity. Candidate ligands WQRHGI and MWRGWQ were conjugated to chromatographic resins and characterized by isothermal binding and breakthrough assays to quantify static and dynamic binding capacity (Qmax and DBC10%), respectively. The resulting Qmax were 52.6 mg of IgG per mL of adsorbent for WQRHGI and 57.48 mg/mL for MWRGWQ, while the DBC10% (2 minutes residence time) were 30.1 mg/mL for WQRHGI and 36.4 mg/mL for MWRGWQ. Evaluation of the peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the binding energy predicted in silico, and an amino acid scanning study corroborated the affinity-like binding activity of the peptides. WQRHGI-WorkBeads resin was finally characterized by purification of a monoclonal antibody from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture harvest, affording a remarkable HCP LRV of 2.7, and consistent product yield and purity over 100 chromatographic cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of WQRHGI as an effective alternative to Protein A for antibody purification.","Reese, Hannah R; Xiao, Xingqing; Shanahan, Calvin C; Van Den Driessche, George A; Fourches, Denis; Carbonell, Ruben G; Hall, Carol K; Menegatti, Stefano",J Chromatogr A,,147

272129,Increase in Cord Blood Transplant-Related Activities Across the AusCord Network due to COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In North America the opioid poisoning crisis currently faces the unprecedented challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, further straining people and communities already facing structural and individual vulnerabilities. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they're financially insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have other medical conditions that make them more likely to be immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless, this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present the first case of a patient in Canada with long-term OUD that received take home injectable diacetylmorphine to self-isolate in an approved site after being diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present case we demonstrated that it is feasible to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with no apparent negative consequences. Improving upon and making permanent these recently introduced risk mitigating guidance during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect during the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access evidence-based care in addiction treatment.","Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia; MacDonald, Scott; Boissonneault, Charles; Harper, Kelli",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,,147
272453,The hit of the novel coronavirus outbreak to China's economy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The disruption of health services due coronavirus disease (COVID) is expected to dramatically alter cancer care; however, the implications for care quality and outcomes remain poorly understood. We undertook a scoping review to evaluate what is known in the literature about how cancer treatment has been modified as a result of the COVID pandemic in patients receiving treatment for solid tumours, and what domains of quality of care are most impacted. METHODS: Citations were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE (1 Jan 2019 to 28 Oct 2020), utilizing search terms grouped by key concept (oncology, treatment, treatment modifications and COVID). Articles were excluded if they dealt exclusively with management of COVID-positive patients, modifications to cancer screening, diagnosis or supportive care, or were not in English. Articles reporting on guidelines, consensus statements, recommendations, literature reviews, simulations or predictive models, or opinions in the absence of accompanying information on experience with treatment modifications in practice were excluded. Treatment modifications derived from the literature were stratified by modality (surgery, systemic therapy and radiotherapy) and thematically grouped. To understand what areas of quality were most impacted, modifications were mapped against the Institute of Medicine's quality domains. Where reported, barriers and facilitators were abstracted and thematically grouped to understand drivers of treatment modifications. Findings were synthesized into a logic model to conceptualize the inter-relationships between different modifications, as well as their downstream impacts on outcomes. RESULTS: In the 87 retained articles, reductions in outpatients visits (26.4%), and delays/deferrals were commonly reported across all treatment modalities (surgery: 50%; systemic therapy: 55.8%; radiotherapy: 56.7%); as were reductions in surgical capacity (57.1%), alternate systemic regimens with longer treatment intervals or use of oral agents (19.2%), and the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens (40.0%). Delivery of effective, timely and equitable care were the quality domains found to be most impacted. The most commonly reported facilitator of maintaining cancer care delivery levels was the shift to virtual models of care (62.1%), while patient-initiated deferrals and cancellations (34.8%), often due to fear of contracting COVID (60.9%), was a commonly reported barrier. CONCLUSIONS: As it will take a considerable amount of time for the cancer system to resume capacity and adjust models of care in response to the pandemic, these treatment delays and modifications will likely be prolonged, and will negatively impact quality of care and patient outcomes.","Powis, Melanie; Milley-Daigle, Carissa; Hack, Saidah; Alibhai, Shabbir; Singh, Simron; Krzyzanowska, Monika K",Int. j. qual. health care,,147

273671,"The potential link between inherited G6PD deficiency, oxidative stress, and vitamin D deficiency and the racial inequities in mortality associated with COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, the Constitutional Court of South Korea ruled that the anti-abortion provisions in the Criminal Act, which criminalize abortion, do not conform to the Constitution. This decision will lead to a total reversal of doctors' legal duty from the obligation to refuse abortion services to their requirement to provide them, given the Medical Service Act that states that a doctor may not refuse a request for treatment or assistance in childbirth. I argue, confined to abortion services in Korea that will take place in the near future, that doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection to abortion. MAIN TEXT: Considering that doctors in Korea have been ethically and legally obligated to refrain from abortions for many years, imposing a universal legal duty to provide abortions that does not allow exception may endanger the moral integrity of individual doctors who chose a career when abortion was illegal. The universal imposition of such a duty may result in repudiation of doctors as moral agents and damage trust in doctors that forms the basis of medical professionalism. Even if conscientious objection to abortion is granted as a legal right, most patients would experience no impediment to receiving abortion services because the healthcare environment of Korea provides options in which patients can choose their doctors based on prior information, there are many doctors who would be willing to provide an abortion, and Korea is a relatively small country. Finally, the responsibility to effectively balance and guarantee the respective rights of the two agents involved in abortion, the doctor and the patient, should be imposed on the government rather than individual doctors. This assertion is based on the government's past behaviours, the nature of its relationship with doctors, and the capacity it has to satisfy both doctors' right to conscientious objection and patients' right to legal medical services. CONCLUSION: With regard to abortion services that will be sought in the near future, doctors should be granted the legal right to exercise conscientious objection based on the importance of doctor's moral integrity, lack of impediment to patients, and government responsibility.","Kim, Claire Junga",BMC Med Ethics,,147

Updated analysis of cases might help identify the risk factors of illness severity. RESULTS: The median age was 63 years, and 44.9% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (8.5 vs. 4.0) and SOFA (2 vs. 1) scores on admission. Among all univariable parameters, lymphocytes, CRP, and LDH were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. LDH was positively related both with APACHE II and SOFA scores, as well as P/F ratio and CT scores. LDH (AUC = 0.878) also had a maximum specificity (96.9%), with the cutoff value of 344.5. In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocytes and its subsets. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that LDH could be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 107 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia.","Han, Yi; Zhang, Haidong; Mu, Sucheng; Wei, Wei; Jin, Chaoyuan; Tong, Chaoyang; Song, Zhenju; Zha, Yunfei; Xue, Yuan; Gu, Guorong",Aging (Albany NY),,147

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. Thirty-six subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Conjunctival swabs were collected from 18 patients with conjunctivitis and 18 patients without conjunctivitis and RT-PCR was performed. Conjunctival swab was collected from both eyes of 36 patients (72 eyes), detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swab of two patients (5.5%). Among the 18 patients with conjunctivitis, only one of them (5.5%) showed positive results. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one patient without conjunctivitis (5.5%). The mean age of the 36 patients was 67.9 years (range, 28-92 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.44 (16:20). The mean days since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms until conjunctivitis manifestation was 8 (range, 1-24 days). The mean duration of the conjunctivitis was 3 days (range, 1-7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected in conjunctival swabs of both patients with and without conjunctivitis. This study revealed the same rate of positive results amongst the group with and without conjunctivitis, suggesting that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in ocular fluids is not conditioned on the presence of conjunctivitis. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular samples highlights the role of the eye as a possible route of transmission of the disease.","Güemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Arribi-Vilela, Ana; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; Rico-Luna, Carla M; Cuiña-Sardiña, Ricardo; Delgado-Iribarren, Alberto; García-Feijoó, Julián",J. med. virol,,147

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom&#8482; D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase â ¡ promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The expression of circRNA in PBMC of mild and severe influenza pneumonia patients is significantly different, and it may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of influenza pneumonia through multiple signal pathways.","Yin, Y D; Cao, D; Shen, H; Feng, S H; Chen, X; Yang, C X; Gu, L",Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,,147

The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency.

Considering the different roles of autophagy during viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this review, we discuss several clinically used drugs that have effects at different stages of autophagy. Among them, we mention (1) lysosomotropic agents, which can prevent CoVs infection by alkalinizing the acid pH in the endolysosomal system, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, artemisinins, two-pore channel modulators and imatinib;(2) protease inhibitors that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of the spike CoVs protein, which is necessary for viral entry into host cells, such as camostat mesylate, lopinavir, umifenovir and teicoplanin and (3) modulators of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, such as rapamycin, heparin, glucocorticoids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (IECAs) and cannabidiol. Thus, this review aims to highlight and discuss autophagy-related drugs for COVID-19, from in vitro to in vivo studies. We identified specific compounds that may modulate autophagy and exhibit antiviral properties.

Here, we present an extremely rare case of late phytobezoar formation following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 40.7 kg/m2 underwent LSG. Following persistent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and tremendous weight loss, endoscopy was performed, and gastric phytobezoar was detected at one-year post-operation. After endoscopic fragmentation, phytobezoar was removed by snare, and the patient later underwent redo bariatric surgery (conversion of LSG to LRYGB). CONCLUSIONS: With an increase in the number of LSG procedures performed globally, and the late-onset nature of phytobezoar formation, more cases of this complication are expected to be detected in future. Long-term postoperative follow-up alongside applying surgical methods to avoid gastric stenosis are needed to reduce the chance of phytobezoar formation in patients undergoing LSG.","Aryannezhad, Shayan; Sadeghian, Yasaman; Shapoori, Parvin; Valizadeh, Majid; Barzin, Maryam",BMC Surg,,147

The literature published until May 24, 2020 was searched in the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar databases with the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""oral fluid"", ""saliva"", and ""diagnosis"", individually and in combination, and 11 studies that explored the efficacy of saliva in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in different patient groups were found. Together, these studies suggest that saliva is a safe and reliable tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Further, saliva offers enhanced safety as well as logistical and economic benefits as compared to the current methods used to diagnose COVID-19. However, there is still limited evidence in the literature to make a definitive, clinically appropriate decision. The ideal specimen for the detection of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still an issue under investigation. Thus, new studies with large sample sets for the validation of easy, safe and reliable methods applicable for large-scale testing are immediately required.","Torul, Damla; Omezli, Mehmet Melih",Dent.

Concerning medical students, practical teaching and classrooms were substituted with a virtual curriculum. However, how this new academic environment has affected students' health and lifestyles has yet to be studied. In this study, we surveyed 2,776 students from nine different countries about changes in their university curricula and potential alterations in their daily habits, physical health, and psychological status. We found negative changes across all countries studied, in multiple categories. We found that 99% of respondents indicated changes in their instruction delivery system, with 90% stating a transition to online education, and 93% stating a reduction or suspension of their practical activities. On average, students spent 8.7 hours a day in front of a screen, with significant differences among countries. Students reported worsened studying, sleeping, and eating habits with substantial differences in Latin American countries. Finally, the participants frequently expressed onset and increase in both mental and physical health symptoms: backache, asthenopia, irritability, and emotional instability. Altogether, these results suggest a potential risk in the health and academic performance of future doctors if these new academic modalities are maintained.","Perez-Dominguez, Francisco; Polanco-Ilabaca, Francisca; Pinto-Toledo, Fernanda; Michaeli, Daniel; Achiardi, Jadi; Santana, Valeria; Urnelli, Chiara; Sawaguchi, Yoshihiro; Rodríguez, Perla; Maldonado, Mónica; Raffeeq, Zaheer; de Araujo Madeiros, Otavio; Rebolledo, Cristián",Health Educ Behav,,147

We believe that the histopathological features of early COVID-19 could be considered the pathophysiological hallmark of this disease. Lung cryobiopsies show almost pristine alveoli, enlarged/hyperplasic alveolar capillaries along with dilatation of the post capillary pulmonary venules. Hypoxemia could therefore be explained by a reduction of the normal V/Q ratio, due to blood overflow around well ventilated alveoli. This could clarify typical manifestations of type L COVID-19, such as happy hypoxemia, response to awake prone positioning, response to PEEP/CPAP and platypnea orthodeoxia.","Oldani, S; Ravaglia, C; Bensai, S; Bertolovic, L; Ghirotti, C; Puglisi, S; Martinello, S; Sultani, F; Colinelli, C; Piciucchi, S; Simoncelli, S; Poletti, V","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,147

In humans, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted ""hot-spot"" residues in a positive-control PPI (PMI/MDM2) and the CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs' free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive-control PPI and SARS CoV-2/ACE2 PPI. Finally, a comparative analysis of hot-spot residues for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, in complex with ACE2, is provided. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.","Rosario, Pedro A; McNaughton, Brian R",Chembiochem,,147

Assessing a system's proneness to facilitate spreading phenomena, which we refer to as its spreading vulnerability, from its topological information alone remains a challenging task. We report a methodological advance in terms of a novel metric for topological complexity: 'entanglement entropy'. Using publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that the metric naturally allows for topological comparisons across vastly different systems, and importantly, reveals that the spreading vulnerability of a system can be quantitatively related to its topological complexity. In doing so, the metric opens itself for applications in a wide variety of natural, social, biological and engineered systems.","Dekker, Mark M.; Schram, Raoul D.; Ou, Jiamin; Panja, Debabrata",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01651v2.pdf,147

Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID-19 associated PE. METHODS: We studied COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19-03-2020 and 17-05-2020. Point-of-care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7-12) days. A significant increase in the immune-suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright /CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission (P = 0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright /CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID-19 patients.","Spijkerman, Roy; Jorritsma, Nikita K N; Bongers, Suzanne H; Bindels, Bas J J; Jukema, Bernard N; Hesselink, Lillian; Hietbrink, Falco; Leenen, Luke P H; van Goor, Harriët M R; Vrisekoop, Nienke; Kaasjager, Karin A H; Koenderman, Leo",Scand J Immunol,,147

Currently, nearly 77 million cases have been confirmed worldwide with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Individuals are getting vaccinated with recently approved vaccines, which are highly protective in suppressing COVID-19 symptoms but there will be a long way before the majority of individuals get vaccinated. In the meantime, safety precautions and effective disease control strategies appear to be vital for preventing the virus spread in public places. Due to the longevity of the virus on smooth surfaces, photocatalytic properties of ""self-disinfecting/cleaning"" surfaces appear to be a promising tool to help guide disinfection policies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread in high-traffic areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, airports, schools, and stadiums. Here, we explored the photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO2 (TNPs) as induced by the UV radiation, towards virus deactivation. Our preliminary results using a close genetic relative of SAR-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, showed the virucidal efficacy of photoactive TNPs deposited on glass coverslips, as examined by quantitative RT-qPCR and virus infectivity assays.

305101,From Icebox to Tinderbox - A View from the Southern Border,2020,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a methylation in the N6 position of adenosine especially in the mRNA, exerts diverse physiological and pathological functions. However, the precise role of m6A methylation in hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) is still unknown. Here, we observed that HPC treatment protected H9c2 cells against H2O2-induced injury, upregulated the m6A level in the total RNA and the expression of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14), and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19. Either knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 notably reversed the HPC-induced enhancement of cell viability, anti-apoptosis ability, and H19 expression. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) indicated that knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 decreased m6A level in the lncRNA H19. Gain-of-function assay demonstrated that H19 overexpression could partially rescue the decreased protection mediated by METTL3 or METTL14 knockdown in HPC-treated H9c2 cells. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay showed that METTL3 and METTL14 could directly bind with H19. Our study identified a novel pattern of posttranscriptional regulation in HPC treatment. Since METTL3, METTL14, and lncRNA H19 were involved in HPC protection, they could be considered as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HPC-derived cardiac rehabilitation and therapeutic approaches.","Su, Yamin; Xu, Rongfeng; Zhang, Rui; Qu, Yangyang; Zuo, Wenjie; Ji, Zhenjun; Geng, Haihua; Pan, Min; Ma, Genshan",Acta biochim. biophys.

Here we profile metabolic changes conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney epithelial cells and lung air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, and show that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases glucose carbon entry into the TCA cycle via increased pyruvate carboxylase expression. SARS-CoV-2 also reduces oxidative glutamine metabolism while maintaining reductive carboxylation. Consistent with these changes, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the activity of mTORC1 in cell lines and lung ALI cultures. Lastly, we show evidence of mTORC1 activation in COVID-19 patient lung tissue, and that mTORC1 inhibitors reduce viral replication in kidney epithelial cells and lung ALI cultures. Our results suggest that targeting mTORC1 may be a feasible treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients, although further studies are required to determine the mechanism of inhibition and potential efficacy in patients.","Mullen, Peter J; Garcia, Gustavo; Purkayastha, Arunima; Matulionis, Nedas; Schmid, Ernst W; Momcilovic, Milica; Sen, Chandani; Langerman, Justin; Ramaiah, Arunachalam; Shackelford, David B; Damoiseaux, Robert; French, Samuel W; Plath, Kathrin; Gomperts, Brigitte N; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Christofk, Heather R",Nat Commun,,147

Phase 1 (29 weeks) represented pre-pandemic, normal operations. Phase 2 was the period when telephone encounters were available (11 weeks), with Phase 3 representing the period when both telephone and video encounters were available (12 weeks). The final day of in-person clinic visits was March 23, 2020. Telephone visits were initially used to maintain clinic access for patients. After a period of development and testing, video consultation was available after 76 days. Guidelines and requirements related to the provision of telemedicine services, as outlined at institutional, state and national levels, were adhered to over the study period. Visit type and basic patient demographic information was recorded. Results: There were 6,522 clinic visits over the study period. In the pre-pandemic period (Phase 1), telephone encounters represented 2.4% of monthly clinic encounters (range 0.4 – 3.7%), with a total of 104 telephone visits completed in this time. In phases 2 and 3, the monthly telephone encounters ranged from 242 to 466, representing 70% - 86% of all clinic encounters. There were 420 video visits completed in Phase 3, representing between 25.4% - 32% of monthly clinic encounters. Of these video encounters, 35.2% were performed at satellite centers, with the remainder performed by providers on the main campus. Telemedicine services were provided to residents of 41 states and the District of Columbia;however, provision of services was contingent on the patient’s physical location at the time of the encounter, based on billing and licensing requirements. Out-of-state residents represented 15% and 27.2% of video and telephone encounters, respectively. With the availability of both telephone and video visits in Phase 3, clinic encounters in June, July and August were at 98.7%, 104% and 87.7% of average monthly pre-pandemic volume, respectively. However, despite restoration of clinic encounters in phase three to 96.4% of pre-pandemic levels, billing for Evaluation and Management lagged behind, reaching 38.9% of pre-pandemic levels in the same period. Conclusions: Despite a precipitous fall in clinic volume in the earliest days of the pandemic, roll-out of telemedicine services allowed for restoration of clinic volumes to near pre-pandemic levels.","McCarthy, C.; Sheth, R.; Patel, R.; Cheung, S.; Simon, N.; Huang, S.; Gupta, S.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,147

314513,An in-depth look at media subsidies in Spain's autonomous communities in 2019,2020,"Imitation Learning is a promising paradigm for learning complex robot manipulation skills by reproducing behavior from human demonstrations. However, manipulation tasks often contain bottleneck regions that require a sequence of precise actions to make meaningful progress, such as a robot inserting a pod into a coffee machine to make coffee. Trained policies can fail in these regions because small deviations in actions can lead the policy into states not covered by the demonstrations. Intervention-based policy learning is an alternative that can address this issue -- it allows human operators to monitor trained policies and take over control when they encounter failures. In this paper, we build a data collection system tailored to 6-DoF manipulation settings, that enables remote human operators to monitor and intervene on trained policies. We develop a simple and effective algorithm to train the policy iteratively on new data collected by the system that encourages the policy to learn how to traverse bottlenecks through the interventions. We demonstrate that agents trained on data collected by our intervention-based system and algorithm outperform agents trained on an equivalent number of samples collected by non-interventional demonstrators, and further show that our method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baselines for learning from the human interventions on a challenging robot threading task and a coffee making task.

Understanding the associations of school closures with the number of incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases is critical for decision-making. Objective: To estimate the association of schools being open or closed with the number of COVID-19 cases compared with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modelling study developed an agent-based transmission model using a synthetic population of 1â¯000â¯000 individuals based on the characteristics of the population of Ontario, Canada. Members of the synthetic population were clustered into households, neighborhoods, or rural districts, cities or rural regions, day care facilities, classrooms (ie, primary, elementary, or high school), colleges or universities, and workplaces. Data were analyzed between May 5, 2020, and October 20, 2020. Exposures: School reopening on September 15, 2020, vs schools remaining closed under different scenarios for nonpharmaceutical interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases between September 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. Results: Among 1â¯000â¯000 simulated individuals, the percentage of infections among students and teachers acquired within schools was less than 5% across modeled scenarios. Incident COVID-19 case numbers on October 31, 2020, were 4414 (95% credible interval [CrI], 3491-5382) cases in the scenario with schools remaining closed and 4740 (95% CrI, 3863-5691) cases in the scenario for schools reopening, with no other community-based nonpharmaceutical intervention. In scenarios with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented, the incident case numbers on October 31 were 714 (95% CrI, 568-908) cases for schools remaining closed and 780 (95% CrI, 580-993) cases for schools reopening. When scenarios applied the case numbers observed in early October in Ontario, the cumulative case numbers were 777 (95% CrI, 621-993) cases for schools remaining closed and 803 (95% CrI, 617-990) cases for schools reopening. In scenarios with implementation of community-based interventions vs no community-based interventions, there was a mean difference of 39â¯355 cumulative COVID-19 cases by October 31, 2020, while keeping schools closed vs reopening them yielded a mean difference of 2040 cases. Conclusions and Relevance: This decision analytical modeling study of a synthetic population of individuals in Ontario, Canada, found that most COVID-19 cases in schools were due to acquisition in the community rather than transmission within schools and that the changes in COVID-19 case numbers associated with school reopenings were relatively small compared with the changes associated with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Naimark, David; Mishra, Sharmistha; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Sander, Beate",JAMA Netw Open,,147

In this new normal, utilization of digital learning technologies (DLT) is a versatile opportunity to continue the learning in an online learning environment;however, there could be barriers that can impede its adoption and acceptance. This study followed the exploratory sequential design. The qualitative phase analyzed the data related to design factors that affect the 14 senior high school participants' attitudes in using digital technology. The qualitative phase results helped develop the nine Google Forms-based Lesson Playlists (GF-LP) for the nine-week Research Methods class. The quantitative phase analyzed the data from the 105 senior high school students with partial least squares-structural equation modeling to test the effect of the design factors on students' attitudes towards using GF-LP and their academic performance. The study found a high level of acceptance of GF-LP in terms of the design factors. Results showed that all design factors affect students' attitudes towards using GF-LP. Moreover, the students' attitude towards using GF-LP does not mediate the design factors' effect on their academic performance. These findings proved that using GF-LP in a Home-based ODL environment was effective and successful. © 2021 ACM.","Madrona Ferran, F.; Sison Prudente, M.; Aguja, S.

As with other practice lessons in education, instrument training also collides with its own unique problems during pandemic. Therefore, it is thought that the experiences of Turkish instrument educators regarding the process will create new discussions. The research was conducted by analyzing the findings obtained from semi-structured interviews with 14 participants with a phenomenological model. Considering the findings of the study, it can be seen that distance education conditions affect the instrument educators and the instrument training process both positively and negatively, and these effects bring some practices to the experience of instrument training permanently, possibly irreversible from now on. In the study, it was seen that an important source of the problems experienced by the instrument educators during the distance education process was related to technical facilities, such as connection speed and software.","Okay, Hasan H.",World Journal on Educational Technology: Current Issues,,147

Although various studies explore the relationship between stock returns and IVOL, the empirical findings are mixed. We are motivated by unique market microstructures in Taiwan, such as individual investors' aggressive trading volume and low transaction costs in Taiwan, discouraging arbitrary trading activities. Our empirical results indicate a negative relationship between IVOL and stock returns by using data from the Taiwan stock market. However, the IVOL anomaly does not exist during the Covid-19 pandemic, even in the small stocks sample. Besides, our findings suggest that four proxies of limits-to-arbitrage, such as reversal, transaction costs, turnover and Amihud's Illiquidity, have statistically significant impacts on the return of IVOL anomaly in Taiwan except for the pandemic period. Finally, our finding suggests that the stock turnover is the only limit-to-arbitrage factor that helps investors earn arbitrary profits during the COVID-19 period. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Duong, K.

Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 4 (ppGalNAc-T4), responsible for the initial step of mucin-type O-glycosylation, has been reported to be implicated in diverse types of human tumors. However, the biological role of ppGalNAc-T4 in breast cancer is still undetermined. In this study, we investigate the effects and mechanism of ppGalNAc-T4 to the breast cancer cell proliferation. From analysis of high throughput RNA sequencing datasets of GEO and ArrayExpress, a positive correlation between ppGalNAc-T4 and the recurrence-free survival was observed in multigroup of human breast cancer datasets. Moreover, transcriptomes analysis using RNA-sequencing in MCF7 cells revealed that cell cycle-related genes induced the effects of ppGalNAc-T4 on breast cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, investigations showed that ppGalNAc-T4 impaired cell proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cells. Furthermore, our results suggested that ppGalNAc-T4 knockout activated Notch signaling pathway and enhanced cell proliferation. Collectively, our data indicated that ppGalNAc-T4 affected proliferation of human breast cancer cells, which appears to be a novel target for understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of breast cancer.

Our data showed that the inactivated vaccine successfully induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and non-human primates, and subsequently provided partial (in low dose) or full (in high dose) protection of challenge in the tested animals. In addition, passive serum transferred from vaccine-immunized mice could also provide full protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science and pre-prints in Europe PMC through August 12 th, 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. RESULTS: Five identified studies found that a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred outdoors (<10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% CI 6.0, 57.9). Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and two described adenovirus transmission outdoors. There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. In general, factors such as duration and frequency of personal contact, lack of personal protective equipment and occasional indoor gathering during a largely outdoor experience were associated with outdoor reports of infection. CONCLUSION: Existing evidence supports the wide-held belief that the the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lower outdoors but there are significant gaps in our understanding of specific pathways.","Bulfone, Tommaso Celeste; Malekinejad, Mohsen; Rutherford, George W; Razani, Nooshin",,,147

Limited data exist regarding changes in heart transplant (HT). Objective: To describe national and regional trends in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, donor recovery, and HT volume during COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using 8 prespecified United Network for Organ Sharing regions. Adult (18 years or older) HT candidates listed and deceased donors recovered between January 19 to May 9, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, deceased donor recovery, and transplant volumes from the pre-COVID-19 (January 19-March 15, 2020) to the COVID-19 era (March 15-May 9, 2020). Density mapping and linear regression with interrupted time series analysis were used to characterize changes over time and changes by region. Results: During the COVID-19 era, there were 600 waitlist inactivations compared with 343 during the pre-COVID era (75% increase). Waitlist additions decreased from 637 to 395 (37% reduction). These changes were most profound in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions with high rates of COVID-19. Deceased donor recovery decreased by 26% from 1878 to 1395; the most significant decrease occurred in the North Midwest despite low COVID-19 prevalence. Heart transplant volumes were significantly reduced across all regions except the Northwest. The largest decrease was seen in the Northeast where COVID-19 case rates were highest. From the pre-COVID-19 era to the COVID-19 era, there was significant regional variation in waitlist additions (eg, 69% decrease in the Northeast vs 8.5% increase in the South Midwest; P < .001) and deceased donor recovery (eg, 41% decrease in North Midwest vs 16% decrease in South Midwest; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart transplant volumes have been significantly reduced in recent months, even in regions with a lower prevalence of COVID-19 cases. This has been accompanied by increased waitlist inactivations, decreased waitlist additions, and decreased donor recovery. Future studies are needed to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with changes in waitlist mortality.","DeFilippis, Ersilia M; Sinnenberg, Lauren; Reza, Nosheen; Givertz, Michael M; Kittleson, Michelle M; Topkara, Veli K; Farr, Maryjane A",JAMA Cardiol,,147

341241,Multiple sclerosis in 2020: un bon cru,2021,"The latest global outbreak of 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is triggered by the inception of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2. If recent events are of any indicators of the epidemics of past, it is undeniable to state a fact that the SARS-CoV2 viral infection is highly transmissible with respect to its previously related SARS-CoV's. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an enzyme that is required by the virus itself for replicating into the host system; and it does so by processing its polyproteins into a functional replicase complex. PLpro is also known for downregulating the genes responsible for producing interferons, an essential family of molecules produced in response to viral infection, thus making this protein an indispensable drug target. In this study, PLpro inhibitors were identified through high throughput structure-based virtual screening approach from NPASS natural product library possessing ~ 35,000 compounds. Top five hits were scrutinised based on structural aromaticity and ability to interact with a key active site residue of PLpro, Tyr268. For second level of screening, the MM-GBSA End-Point Binding Free Energy Calculation of the docked complexes was performed, which identified Caesalpiniaphenol A as the best hit. Caesalpiniaphenol A not only possess a double ring aromatic moiety but also has lowest minimum binding energy, which is at par with the control GRL0617, the only known inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro. Details of the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and ADMET analysis helped to conclusively determine Caesalpiniaphenol A as potentially an inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro.","Parmar, Paritosh; Rao, Priyashi; Sharma, Abhilasha; Shukla, Arpit; Rawal, Rakesh M; Saraf, Meenu; Patel, Baldev V; Goswami, Dweipayan",Mol. divers,,147

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January - November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. RESULTS: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. CONCLUSION: Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality. Injury outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic should be addressed by timely public health responses.","Harmon, Katherine J; Fliss, Mike Dolan; Marshall, Stephen W; Peticolas, Kathy; Proescholdbell, Scott K; Waller, Anna E",Am J Emerg Med,,147

This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to study in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients who were on ACEI/ARB as compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. METHODS: We search PubMed, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar between 1 January 2020 and 30 May 2020 to identify all studies that evaluated the use of ACEI/ARB and reported the in-hospital mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Nine non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The primary outcome studied was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients who were on ACEI/ARB compared with those not on ACEI/ARB. RESULTS: Of the 8,313 patients in the nine studies, 7,622 (91.7%) were from studies with all-comers, while 691 (8.3%) were from studies with only hypertensive patients. 577 (14.6%) in-hospital deaths were observed out of a total of 3,949 patients with an outcome in the nine studies. Overall, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between patients on ACEI/ARB and those not on ACEI/ARB (odds radio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.73). Further sensitivity analysis in the hypertensive group and all-comers group showed similar results (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58-1.32; p = 0.53 and OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.43; p = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study found that ACEI/ARB has no significant impact on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients and can be used safely in patients with indications.","Cai, Xinzhe James; Tay, Julian Cheong Kiat; Kui, Swee Leng; Tin, Aung Soe; Tan, Vern Hsen",Singap. med. j,,147

351148,The infectious complications of atopic dermatitis,2020,"From the early 1990s the quality of public space is at the centre of the Agenda of major European cities. Today, more than before, the health emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemy has pointed out the importance of the relationship among public space, quality of life and health. Public and semi-private spaces, especially in high-dense cities and in the most affected areas by Covid-19, represent a strong driver both for restarting and for helping cities to face the new normal age. Despite the advancement of research during the past two decades and empirical evidence about the relationship among quality of open spaces, quality of life and urban sustainability, there is still a lack of studies on how to measure the quality of open spaces. Among the several research lines, the Urban Design approach across its evolution has always focused on it, starting from aesthetic as well as technical issues and increasingly including the social and economic ones. The current paper proposes an integrated approach supported by Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of open spaces under the Urban Design perspective. In detail, the issue of urban quality has been divided into 5 criteria and 12 sub-criteria which consider both the characteristics of the built environment and its organization and the perception of users. The evaluation process has been structured according to the traditional steps – Intelligence, Design and Choice – and it has been applied to three different areas in the city of Milan, in order to achieve a broad measurement of urban quality with respect to various urban locations. What’s new in this research is the spatialization of the urban quality scores and their assessment based on specific value functions, that shows potentials for future implementations in the sphere of urban planning, where the proposed evaluation approach could be applied with different purposes: an evaluation model for supporting public and private planning agreements by the use of value maps;a companion guide with operational recommendations for open spaces design;a model to estimate the marginal price of the urban quality through hedonic price analyses. © 2021, Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile.

351970,RE: Respiratory Infectious Disease in Resource Limited Setting: Radiology Management Advice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 patients typically test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for extended periods of time, even after recovery from severe disease. Due to the timeframe involved, these patients may have developed humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while still testing positive for viral RNA in swabs. Data are lacking on exposure risks in these situations. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination in an ICU and an isolation ward caring for such COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected air and surface samples in a hospital caring for critical and severe COVID-19 cases from common areas and areas proximal to patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 ICU samples, an air sample contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the 182 isolation ward samples, nine contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These were collected from a facemask, the floor, mobile phones, and the air in the patient room and bathroom. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in these patients at the beginning of the study. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a perception of increased risk in the ICU, our study demonstrates that isolation wards may pose greater risks to healthcare workers and exposure risks remain with clinically improved patients, weeks after their initial diagnoses. As these patients had serum antibodies, further studies may be warranted to study the utility of serum antibodies as a surrogate of viral clearance in allowing people to return to work. We recommend continued vigilance even with patients who appear to have recovered from COVID-19.","Lei, Hui; Ye, Feng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Huang, Zhenting; Ling, Shiman; Jiang, Zhanpeng; Cheng, Jing; Huang, Xiaoqun; Wu, Qiubao; Wu, Shiguan; Xie, Yanmin; Xiao, Cheng; Ye, Dan; Yang, Zifeng; Li, Yimin; Leung, Nancy H L; Cowling, Benjamin J; He, Jianxing; Wong, Sook-San; Zanin, Mark",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,147

352865,A model to rate strategies for managing disease due to COVID-19 infection,2020,"Background Psychiatric morbidities have been associated with a risk of severe infections through compromised immunity, health behaviours, or both. However, data are scarce on the association between multiple types of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. We aimed to assess the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the subsequent risk of COVID-19 using UK Biobank. Methods For this cohort analysis, we included participants from UK Biobank who were registered in England and excluded individuals who died before Jan 31, 2020, (the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) or had withdrawn from UK Biobank. Participants diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder before Jan 31 were included in the group of individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, whereas participants without a diagnosis before the outbreak were included in the group of individuals without pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We used the Public Health England dataset, UK Biobank hospital data, and death registers to collect data on COVID-19 cases. To examine the relationship between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and susceptibility to COVID-19, we used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs), controlling for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. Key outcomes were all COVID-19, COVID-19 specifically diagnosed in inpatient care, and COVID-19-related deaths. ORs were also estimated separately for each psychiatric disorder and on the basis of the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. As a positive disease control, we repeated analyses for hospitalisation for other infections. Findings We induded 421 014 UK Biobank participants in our study and assessed their COVID-19 status between Jan 31 and July 26, 2020. 50 809 participants were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders before the outbreak, while 370 205 participants had no psychiatric disorders. The mean age at outbreak was 67.80 years (SD 8.12). We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders compared with that of individuals without such conditions. The fully adjusted ORs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.28-1.62) for All COVID-19 cases, 1.55 (1.34-1.78) for Inpatient COVID-19 cases, and 2.03 (1.59-2.59) for COVID-19-related deaths. We observed excess risk, defined as risk that increased with the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, across all diagnostic categories of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between psychiatric disorders and elevated risk of hospitalisation due to other infections (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.58-1.93). Interpretation Our findings suggest that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for surveillance of and care for populations with pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

They constitute a risk group in the development of anxiety due to their psychological, social,andacademicdemands,thereforeitisnecessary to propose intervention alternatives in this population. Objective: To test the effectiveness of online self-help programs on psychological discomfort in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a secondary objective;to associate difficulties and physical situation with emotional problems. Methods: Undergraduate and postgraduate students participated in a 6-month prospective, two-measure longitudinal cohort study from a private university. In Wave I, the participants was n = 641 (evaluated on May 2020) and in Wave II n = 304 (evaluated on November 2020). A school survey composed of 5 subscales with α = 0.91 was used. Results: Begin a woman, older age and postgraduate students had a greater risk of persistence of psychological distress in comparison with all of their peers (RRs ranging from 1.89 to 2.19). In contrast, those students who received self-help strategy and/ or healthcare professional showed a lower risk for persistence of psychological distress (RR 0.31-0.87). Conclusions: The interventions online and the implementation of a protocol that includes the work of a health professional seem to improve psychological well-being and decrease depression and anxiety problems in university students. Also, avenues will be opened for new research on the effectiveness of these interventions focused on the prevention and promotion of mental health. © Universidad De La Salle Bajío (México).","Gutiérrez-García, R.

358484,Reply to Dutheil et al,2020,"Background: In February 2020, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was classified as a pandemic. In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the &#967;2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results: Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions: The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain.","Olivar-López, Víctor; Leyva-Barrera, Ana; López-Martínez, Briceida; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Márquez-González, Horacio",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,147

359556,"Epidemic Characteristics of 2019-nCoV in China, Jan 23, 2020-Fe11, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health problem globally and in Europe, while the prevalence of childhood obesity is also soaring. Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast-food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviours and obesity. The H2020 project ""BigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity"" (http://bigoprogram.eu) aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data. OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data exploration of objective obesity related behaviours and local environment based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth app. METHODS: OPdashboard allows for (i) the real time monitoring of children's obesogenic behaviours in a city area, (ii) the extraction of associations between them and the local environment and, (iii) the evaluation of an intervention in time. More than 3700 children, from 33 schools and 2 clinics, in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile application for the extraction of behavioural patterns through the capturing of accelerometer and geolocation data, while online databases were assessed in order to have a description of the environment. RESULTS: The preliminary association outcomes in two European cities, namely Thessaloniki in Greece and Stockholm in Sweden, indicate a correlation between children's eating and physical activity behaviours and the availability of food related places or sport facilities close to schools. In addition, OPdashboard was used to assess the modification of children's physical activity as the result of the health policies applied for the deceleration of the COVID-19 outbreak. The preliminary outcomes of the analysis revealed that in urban areas the decrease on physical activity was statistically significant, while in the suburbs a slight increase was observed. Those findings suggest the importance of the availability of open spaces on children's behavioural change. The above analyses act as initial investigations using the OPdashboard. Additional factors must be incorporated in order to optimize its use and have a clearer understanding of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes in detail the OPdashboard which is exposed as a web interface (http://bigo.med.auth.gr:3838/). Its functionality was evaluated during a focus group with experts on public health, where its potential on the better understanding of the interplay between children's obesogenic behaviours and the environment was underlined.","Filos, Dimitris; Lekka, Irini; Kilintzis, Vasileios; Stefanopoulos, Leandros; Karavidopoulou, Youla; Maramis, Christos; Diou, Christos; Sarafis, Ioannis; Papapanagiotou, Vasileios; Alagialoglou, Leonidas; Ioakeimidis, Ioannis; Hassapidou, Maria; Charmandari, Evangelia; Heimeier, Rachel; O039,; Donnell, Shane; Doyle, Gerardine; Delopoulos, Anastasios; Maglaveras, Nicos",,,147

360181,Expression Profile and Prognostic Values of Mini-Chromosome Maintenance Families (MCMs) in Breast Cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing haemodialysis may experience troubling symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality, which may affect their quality of life. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (n = 66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (n = 54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (n = 41) reported depression and 56.9% (n = 70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (P < .05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that being within the age group 31-40, having a secondary education level, anxiety, depression and sleep quality were the main predictors affecting the fatigue group. CONCLUSION: Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality are significant problems for patients receiving haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce fatigue, psychological problems and sleep quality amongst these patients are needed. This can help to strengthen preparations for responding to possible future outbreaks or pandemics of infectious diseases for patients receiving haemodialysis.","Al Naamani, Zakariya; Gormley, Kevin; Noble, Helen; Santin, Olinda; Al Maqbali, Mohammed",BMC Nephrol,,147

362049,The Role of the Poison Center and the Use of an Intradepartmental Data Repository During the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak,2020,"Summary Background During the 2009 pandemic of an emerging influenza A virus (IAV;H1N1pdm09), data from several European countries indicated that the spread of the virus might have been interrupted by the annual autumn rhinovirus epidemic We aimed to investigate viral interference between rhinovirus and IAV with use of clinical data and an experimental model Methods We did a clinical data analysis and experimental infection study to investigate the co-occurrence of rhinovirus and IAV in respiratory specimens from adults (≥21 years) tested with a multiplex PCR panel at Yale-New Haven Hospital (CT, USA) over three consecutive winter seasons (Nov 1 to March 1, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018–19) We compared observed versus expected co-detections using data extracted from the Epic Systems electronic medical record system To assess how rhinovirus infection affects subsequent IAV infection, we inoculated differentiated primary human airway epithelial cultures with rhinovirus (HRV-01A;multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0·1) or did mock infection On day 3 post-infection, we inoculated the same cultures with IAV (H1N1 green fluorescent protein [GFP] reporter virus or H1N1pdm09;MOI 0·1) We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR or microscopy to quantify host cell mRNAs for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) on day 3 after rhinovirus or mock infection and IAV RNA on days 4, 5, or 6 after rhinovirus or mock infection We also did sequential infection studies in the presence of BX795 (6 μM), to inhibit the interferon response We compared ISG expression and IAV RNA and expression of GFP by IAV reporter virus Findings Between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, examination of 8284 respiratory samples positive for either rhinovirus (n=3821) or IAV (n=4463) by any test method was used to establish Nov 1 to March 1 as the period of peak virus co-circulation After filtering for samples within this time frame meeting the inclusion criteria (n=13 707), there were 989 (7·2%) rhinovirus and 922 (6·7%) IAV detections, with a significantly lower than expected odds of co-detection (odds ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·09–0·28) Rhinovirus infection of cell cultures induced ISG expression and protected against IAV infection 3 days later, resulting in an approximate 50 000-fold decrease in IAV H1N1pdm09 viral RNA on day 5 post-rhinovirus inoculation Blocking the interferon response restored IAV replication following rhinovirus infection Interpretation These findings show that one respiratory virus can block infection with another through stimulation of antiviral defences in the airway mucosa, supporting the idea that interference from rhinovirus disrupted the 2009 IAV pandemic in Europe These results indicate that viral interference can potentially affect the course of an epidemic, and this possibility should be considered when designing interventions for seasonal influenza epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic Funding National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and the Yale Department of Laboratory Medicine","Wu, Anchi; Mihaylova, Valia T.; Landry, Marie L.; Foxman, Ellen F.",The Lancet Microbe,,147

367951,How and when maternal viral infections can be a contraindication to breastfeeding: a narrative review,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has enormous impact on society and healthcare. Countries imposed lockdowns, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization. The aims of this study were to quantify the effects of lockdown on pediatric care in the Netherlands, to elucidate the cause of the observed reduction in pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions, and to summarize the literature regarding the effects of lockdown on pediatric care worldwide. ED visits and hospital admission data of 8 general hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2016 and June 2020 were summarized per diagnosis group (communicable infections, noncommunicable infections, (probable) infection-related, and noninfectious). The effects of lockdown were quantified with a linear mixed effects model. A literature review regarding the effect of lockdowns on pediatric clinical care was performed. In total, 126,198 ED visits and 47,648 admissions were registered in the study period. The estimated reduction in general pediatric care was 59% and 56% for ED visits and admissions, respectively. The largest reduction was observed for communicable infections (ED visits: 76%; admissions: 77%), whereas the reduction in noninfectious diagnoses was smaller (ED visits 36%; admissions: 37%). Similar reductions were reported worldwide, with decreases of 30-89% for ED visits and 19-73% for admissions.Conclusion: Pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization during lockdown were decreased in the Netherlands and other countries, which can largely be attributed to a decrease in communicable infectious diseases. Care utilization for other conditions was decreased as well, which may indicate that care avoidance during a pandemic is significant. What is Known: â¢ The COVID-19 pandemic had enormous impact on society. â¢ Countries imposed lockdowns to curb transmission rates, which were followed by a reduction in care utilization worldwide. What is New: â¢ The Dutch lockdown caused a significant decrease in pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization, especially in ED visits and hospital admissions because of infections that were not caused by SARS-CoV-2. â¢ Care utilization for noninfectious diagnoses was decreased as well, which may indicate that pediatric care avoidance during a pandemic is significant.","Kruizinga, Matthijs D; Peeters, Daphne; van Veen, Mirjam; van Houten, Marlies; Wieringa, Jantien; Noordzij, Jeroen G; Bekhof, Jolita; Tramper-Stranders, Gerdien; Vet, Nienke J; Driessen, Gertjan J A",Eur J Pediatr,,147
368618,"Interleukin 6 in inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer",2020,"BACKGROUND: This paper evaluates the increase in coverage and use of Covid-19 testing services for vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations through the introduction of community-based walk-up sites in New Orleans, LA. While most GIS work on Covid-19 testing coverage and access has used census tract or ZIP code aggregated data, this manuscript is unique in that it uses individual level demographics and exact addresses to calculate distances actually traveled by patients. METHODS: We used testing data recorded for 9721 patients at 20 sites operating in May-June 2020. The dataset includes detailed age, race and ethnicity, and testing results as well as the exact address of each individual. Using GIS, we estimated changes in testing coverage for minority neighborhoods and calculated the actual distance covered by individuals. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were used to identify socio-demographic variables associated with distance travelled to and used of nearest testing site. We used a secondary dataset from drive-through sites to evaluate change in coverage at the census tract level for the metropolitan area. RESULTS: Walk-up sites significantly increased testing availability in New Orleans, and specifically in minority neighborhoods. Both African Americans and Asians were more likely (14.7 and 53.0%) to be tested at the nearest walk-up site. They also covered shorter distances to get tested. Being elderly was also significantly and positively associated with testing at the nearest site. Hispanics, however, were not associated with increased proximity to and use of nearest sites, and they traveled an additional 0.745 km to get tested. Individuals who tested positive also travelled significantly longer distances to obtain a test. CONCLUSIONS: Walk-up sites increased testing availability for some vulnerable populations who took advantage of the sites' proximity, although inequalities appear at the metropolitan scale. As cities are planning community vaccination campaigns, mobile, walk-up sites appear to improve both coverage and accessibility for hard-to-reach populations. With adequate technical (vaccine dose refrigeration) and messaging (addressing reticence to immunization) adaptations, they could constitute a key complementary approach to health facility points of delivery.","Hernandez, Julie H; Karletsos, Dimitris; Avegno, Jennifer; Reed, Chantell H",BMC Public Health,,147

370297,Courage in a climate of fear,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the latest outbreak of infectious disease, has caused huge medical challenges to China and the entire globe. No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. RESULT: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was -1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6-24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2-43.0. CONCLUSION: The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.","Zhifeng, Jiang; Feng, Aiqiao; Li, Tao",J Clin Virol,,147

In view of this, there is an outstanding need for in vitro systems in which to assess the impact of both infectious agents and xenobiotic substances of the lungs. To address this issue, we have developed a protocol to generate airway epithelial basal-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells, which simplifies the manufacture of cellular models of the human upper airways. Basal-like cells generated in this study were cultured on transwell inserts to allow formation of a confluent monolayer and then exposed to an air-liquid interface to induce differentiation into a pseudostratified epithelial construct with a marked similarity to the upper airway epithelium in vivo. These constructs contain the component cell types required of an epithelial model system, produce mucus and functional cilia, and can support SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication and the secretion of cytokines in a manner similar to that of in vivo airways. This method offers a readily accessible and highly scalable protocol for the manufacture of upper airway models that could find applications in development of therapies for respiratory viral infections and the assessment of drug toxicity on the human lungs.","Djidrovski, Ivo; Georgiou, Maria; Hughes, Grant L; Patterson, Edward I; Casas-Sanchez, Aitor; Pennington, Shaun H; Biagini, Giancarlo A; Moya-Molina, Marina; van den Bor, Jelle; Smit, Martine J; Chung, Git; Lako, Majlinda; Armstrong, Lyle",Stem cells (Dayt.),,147

In the weeks after, South Korea had 24 confirmed cases by February 8, and the number has increased steadily since then. The highly contagious virus known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected Case No. 31 in Daegu; she was the first patient related to Sincheonji Church. Later, the number of cases involved with Sincheonji skyrocketed. On March 6, 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 6284, with 42 dead. This study, through collecting epidemiological data about various COVID-19 infection cases, discovered that getting together in large groups leads to mass infection, and that paying close attention to personal hygiene by means of wearing masks, sanitary gloves, etc., can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additional epidemiological data and related studies on COVID-19 infections in South Korea are likely to support or slightly modify this conclusion. However, this study is significant in that it emphasizes the precautionary principle in preventing and managing infectious diseases, and has a suggestion for public health policies, which are currently in high demand.","Kang, Yun-Jung",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,147

The present study aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the dental biofilm of symptomatic patients who tested positive in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NASO/ORO) samples. MATERIALS & METHODS: An observational clinical study of individuals with flu-like symptoms was conducted between July and September 2020. Dental biofilm (BIO) samples were collected and analysed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to determine the virus's presence. RESULTS: Seventy participants (40 ± 9.8 years of age, 71.4% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NASO/ORO samples and were included in the study. Among them, 13 tested positive in BIO samples (18.6%; 95% CI: [9.5, 27.7]). The median and interquartile range of cycle quantification (Cq) for NASO/ORO and BIO samples were 15.9 [6.9] and 35.9 [4.0] (p = .001), respectively. BIO-positive participants showed a higher virus load in NASO/ORO samples (p = .012) than those testing negative (Cq = 20.4 [6.1]).

Detailed histopathological descriptions of COVID-19 chilblains have not been reported, and causality of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established yet. OBJECTIVE: To describe histopathological features of Covid-19 chilblains and explore the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue. METHODS: We examined skin biopsies from 7 paediatric patients presenting with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all cases and electron microscopy in one. RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endothelialitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage, support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS-CoV-2. Endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 chilblains and perhaps also in a group of patients severely affected by COVID-19 presenting with features of microangiopathic damage.","Colmenero, I; Santonja, C; Alonso-Riaño, M; Noguera-Morel, L; Hernández-Martín, A; Andina, D; Wiesner, T; Rodríguez-Peralto, J L; Requena, L; Torrelo, A",Br. j. dermatol,,147

However, there are enough researches that negates the positive impact of microfinance loans on spousal violence. Recognized as one of the most predominant social evils, violence against women is not only a violation of their human rights but also an act of exploitation and denial of freedom. In the present study, we have tried to investigate if microfinance loan takers experience more spousal violence as compared to their counterparts by analyzing the National Family Health Survey IV, 2015-16. Our results indicate that 40.8% of women microfinance participants experience spousal violence. Additionally, the likelihood of microfinance participants to experience spousal violence is much higher than the non-microfinance participants (odds ratio = 1.35, p value = .000). Microfinance programs are designed to increase the individual agencies of women participants, which, in turn, reduce the chances of them becoming victims of spousal violence. However, if the credit program participation induces the woman to be a victim of spousal violence together with becoming financially autonomous, then such hidden costs need to be taken into account while evaluating the effectiveness of the gendered policy design.","Sinha, Debashree; Kumar, Pradeep",J Interpers Violence,,147

These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS: Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS: A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION: A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Coshic, Poonam; C S, Chippy; Arcot, Priyadarsini Jayachandran; Kumar, Karan",Vox sang,,147
398444,Accelerated infection testing at scale: a proposal for inference with single test on multiple patients,2020-03-30,"When ambulances’ turnaround time (TT) in emergency departments is prolonged, it not only affects the victim severely but also causes unavailability of resources in emergency medical services (EMSs) and, consequently, leaves a locality unprotected. This problem may worsen with abnormal situations, e.g., the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Taking this into consideration, this paper presents a first study on the COVID-19 impact on ambulances’ TT by analyzing historical data from the Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of the Doubs (SDIS 25), in France, for three hospitals. Because the TTs of SDIS 25 ambulances increased, this paper also calculated and analyzed the number of breakdowns in services, which augmented due to shortage of ambulances that return on service in time. It is, therefore, vital to have a decision-support tool to better reallocate resources by knowing the time EMSs ambulances and personnel will be in use. Thus, this paper proposes a novel two-stage methodology based on machine learning (ML) models to forecast the TT of each ambulance in a given time and hospital. The first stage uses a multivariate model of regularly spaced time series to predict the average TT (AvTT) per hour, which considers temporal variables and external ones (e.g., COVID-19 statistics, weather data). The second stage utilizes a multivariate irregularly spaced time series model, which considers temporal variables of each ambulance departure, type of intervention, external variables, and the previously predicted AvTT as inputs. Four state-of-the-art ML models were considered in this paper, namely, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory, and Prophet. As shown in the results, the proposed methodology provided remarkable results for practical purposes. The AvTT accuracies obtained for the three hospitals were 90.16%, 97.02%, and 93.09%. And the TT accuracies were 74.42%, 86.63%, and 76.67%, all with an error margin of ±10 min.","Cerna, Selene Arcolezi Héber H.; Guyeux, Christophe Royer-Fey Guillaume Chevallier Céline",Applied Soft Computing,,147

BACKGROUND: Midwives provide care to childbearing women across the continuum and are key members of the maternity workforce in Australia. AIM: To explore and describe midwives' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A two-phased cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected through an online survey and semi-structured interviews between May-June 2020. FINDINGS: Six hundred and twenty midwives responded to the online survey. Many reported a move to telehealth appointments. For labour care, 70% of midwives reported women had limited support; 77% indicated postnatal visiting was impacted. Five main themes were derived from the qualitative data including: coping with rapid and radical changes, challenges to woman-centred care, managing professional resilience, addressing personal and professional challenges, and looking ahead. DISCUSSION: Restrictions applied to women's choices, impacted midwives' ability to provide woman-centred care, which resulted in stress and anxiety for midwives. Professional resilience was supported through collaborative relationships and working in continuity models. Midwives revealed 'silver linings' experienced in providing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Findings provide valuable evidence to understand the impact on midwives who have provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge will be useful for health leaders and policy makers as they consider ways to continue care during the pandemic and support the essential midwifery workforce. Recommendations are presented to improve preparedness for future pandemics.","Bradfield, Zoe; Hauck, Yvonne; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wynter, Karen; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley",Women and birth (Online),,147
400043,Filtering facepiece respirators decontamination using a low-temperature-steam-2% formaldehyde sterilisation process during a pandemic: a safe alternative for reuse,2020,"PURPOSE: The UK government introduced a nationwide lockdown on the 23rd March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. All elective hospital and dental practice assessments and procedures were mandated to stop. Key hospital dental workers were required to work, and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust became a designated Urgent Dental Care Centre (UDC) for the greater London area. The paediatric dental emergency walk-in service was suspended and replaced with a telephone triage system and evaluation of digital images sent by parents/carers when needed. The aim of this paper is to describe the emergency service provided by staff in the department of Paediatric Dentistry at St Thomas' Hospital during the first lockdown. METHODS: A prospective service evaluation of the modified paediatric dental emergency service was carried out between 25th March and 29th May 2020. RESULTS: Four-hundred and sixty-four patients accessed the paediatric dental emergency service via telephone during the service evaluation period. Of these, 192 (41%) had dental pain, 121 (26%) had pain and swelling of dental origin, and 89 (19%) had trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Remote telephone consultations and digital photographs were useful to screen emergency paediatric dental patients, but lack of face-to-face consultations with radiographic assessment and access to general anaesthetic services were major limiting factors.","Patel, N; Viswanathan, A; Lee, J; Barrow, S; Cant, A; Sanghvi, R; Deseta, M; Layton, J; Bhujel, N; Sheehy, E C",Eur.

Drawing on event system theory and literature on job insecurity, we conceptualize COVID-19 as an event relevant to employees' work, and propose that event strength (i.e., novelty, disruption, and criticality) of COVID-19 influences employee job insecurity, which in turn affects employee work and non-work outcomes. We also identified important organization adaptive practices responding to COVID-19 based on a preliminary interview study, and examined its role in mitigating the undesired effects of COVID-19 event strength. Results from a two-wave lagged survey study indicated that employees' perceived COVID-19 event novelty and disruption (but not criticality) were positively related to their job insecurity, which in turn was positively related to their emotional exhaustion, organizational deviance, and saving behavior. Moreover, organization adaptive practices mitigated the effects of COVID-19 event novelty and criticality (but not disruption) on job insecurity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

404117,p38 MAPK inhibition: A promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19,2020,"The primary mode of respiratory virus transmission is by means of virus-laden aerosols. The aerosols are inhaled into the respiratory tract and deposited in the mucosa, where the virus may interact with the epithelial tissue causing infection. Transport of virus within the respiratory tract and clearance from the lungs, as such, becomes extremely important. This phenomena is mathematically modelled using a coupled model of aerosol transport and virus transport within a Weibel-like idealisation of the lung geometry. The analysis is carried out in a dimensionless manner and the results are presented in terms of various dimensionless parameters. It is observed that the main factor determining virus transport and clearance from the lungs is the region where the virus-laden aerosols are deposited within the lungs. Viruses deposited in the upper respiratory tract are cleared out of the lung relatively faster due to the impact of mucociliary clearance. Viruses deposited in the deep lung are cleared much slowly due to absence of mucociliary clearance. Deep lung deposition is observed to take place for a specific range of aerosol sizes. Slower breathing and deep breaths is observed to promote deep lung deposition. Slower breathing and larger mucus clearance is also observed to enhance virus clearance from the upper respiratory tract. It is further observed that virus clearance from the deep lung can only be enhanced by increasing virus diffusivity. This enhancement is, however, not substantial. It is, thus, essential to eliminate the situations which promote deep lung deposition of the viruses.","Chakravarty, Aranyak; Panchagnula, Mahesh V.; Patankar, Neelesh A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00676v1.pdf,147

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect size of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on post-operative mortality by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was performed. A search was undertaken using electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library to identify eligible studies published from 1 November 2019 until 21 August 2020. Eligible papers for meta-analysis were those that provided mortality rates following elective and emergency surgery in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Forest plots and estimates of odds of death related to having COVID-19 were formed using MedCalc version 9.6 software. Funnel plots to assess for publication bias and heterogeneity were formed in Meta-Essentials. RESULTS: There were 140 records screened for inclusion. Full texts of 39 articles were reviewed, and 36 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. There were eight studies eligible for meta-analysis. There was a total of 193 operations performed on patients with a concurrent COVID-19 infection and 910 performed on patients who were COVID-19 negative. The odds ratio for mortality in patients who underwent a surgical procedure while COVID-19 positive was 7.9 (95% confidence interval: 3.2-19.4). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis confirms that concurrent COVID-19 infection increases the risk of surgical mortality. The magnitude of this risk mandates that strategies are developed to mitigate the risk at both an individual and system level.","Brown, Wendy A; Moore, Eileen M; Watters, David A",ANZ J Surg,,147

This brief report evaluates the effect of travel bans imposed to prevent COVID-19 importation in the Australian context. METHODS: We developed a stochastic meta-population model to capture the global dynamics and spread of COVID-19. By adjusting our model to capture the travel bans imposed globally and in Australia, the predicted COVID-19 cases imported to Australia were evaluated in comparison to observed imported cases. RESULTS: Our modelling results closely aligned with observed cases in Australia and elsewhere. We observed a 79% reduction in COVID-19 importation and a delay of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia by approximately one month. Further projection of COVID-19 to May 2020 showed spread patterns depending on the basic reproduction number. CONCLUSION: Imposing the travel ban was effective in delaying widespread transmission of COVID-19. However, strengthening of the domestic control measures is needed to prevent Australia from becoming another epicentre.

408313,Coronovirus infection as a novel delusional topic,2020,"During a disease outbreak, healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to treat infected individuals. However, these HCWs are themselves susceptible to contracting the disease. As more HCWs get infected, fewer are available to provide care for others, and the overall quality of care available to infected individuals declines. This depletion of HCWs may contribute to the epidemic's severity. To examine this issue, we explicitly model declining quality of care in four differential equation-based susceptible, infected and recovered-type models with vaccination. We assume that vaccination, recovery and survival rates are affected by quality of care delivered. We show that explicitly modelling HCWs and accounting for declining quality of care significantly alters model-predicted disease outcomes, specifically case counts and mortality. Models neglecting the decline of quality of care resulting from infection of HCWs may significantly under-estimate cases and mortality. These models may be useful to inform health policy that may differ for HCWs and the general population. Models accounting for declining quality of care may therefore improve the management interventions considered to mitigate the effects of a future outbreak.","Phadke, I; McKee, A; Conway, J M; Shea, K",Epidemiol Infect,,147

We aimed to assess the number, characteristics and in-hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients admitted urgently for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure or arrhythmias from 1 March to 31 May 2020 (outbreak period) and 2019 (control period). We evaluated the time from symptoms onset to presentation, clinical conditions at admission, length of hospitalization, in-hospital medical procedures and outcome. The combined primary end point included in-hospital death for cardiovascular causes, urgent heart transplant or discharge with a ventricular assist device. RESULTS: A similar number of admissions were observed in 2020 (Nâ=â210) compared with 2019 (Nâ=â207). Baseline characteristics of patients were also similar. In 2020, a significantly higher number of patients presented more than 6âh after symptoms onset (57 versus 38%, Pâ<â0.001) and with signs of heart failure (33 versus 20%, Pâ=â0.018), required urgent surgery (13 versus 5%, Pâ=â0.004) and ventilatory support (26 versus 13%, Pâ<â0.001). Hospitalization duration was longer in 2020 (median 10 versus 8 days, Pâ=â0.03). The primary end point was met by 19 (9.0%) patients in 2020 versus 10 (4.8%) in 2019 (Pâ=â0.09). CONCLUSION: Despite the similar number and types of unplanned admissions for acute cardiac conditions during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same period in 2019, we observed a higher number of patients presenting late after symptoms onset as well as longer and more complicated clinical courses.","Zorzi, Alessandro; Vio, Riccardo; Rivezzi, Francesco; Falzone, Pasquale V; Giordani, Andrea S; Condello, Chiara; Dellino, Carlo M; Deola, Petra; Gallucci, Marco; Giannattasio, Alessia; Licchelli, Luca; Lupasco, Diana; Montonati, Carolina; Ravagnin, Alberto; Sinigiani, Giulio; Torreggiani, Gianpaolo; Vianello, Riccardo; Migliore, Federico; Famoso, Giulia; Babuin, Luciano; Cacciavillani, Luisa; Iliceto, Sabino",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,147

It is not yet understood whether IS therapy may protect from the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or a temporary adjustment/withdrawal of IS therapy to restore the immune system may be necessary. We performed a systematic literature review to investigate the current management of IS therapy in KT recipients with COVID-1. Materials and Methods: Out of 71 articles published from 1 February 2020 until 30 October 2020, 554 KT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Results: Modifications of IS therapy were based on the clinical conditions. For asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, a ""wait and see approach"" was mostly used; a suspension of antimetabolites drugs (347/461, 75.27%) or mTOR inhibitors (38/48, 79.2%) was adopted in the majority of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infections. For CNIs, the most frequent attitude was their maintenance (243/502, 48.4%) or dose-reduction (99/502, 19.72%) in patients asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms, while drug withdrawal was the preferred choice in severely symptomatic patients (160/450, 31.87%). A discontinuation of all IS drugs was used only in severely symptomatic COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Renal function remained stable in 422(76.17%) recipients, while 49(8.84%) patients experienced graft loss. Eight (1.44%) patients experienced a worsening of renal function. The overall mortality was 21.84%, and 53(9.56%) patients died with functioning grafts. Conclusion: A tailored approach to the patient has been the preferred strategy for the management of IS therapy in KT recipients, taking into account the clinical conditions of patients and the potential interactions between IS and antiviral drugs, in the attempt to balance the risks of COVID-19-related complications and those due to rejection or graft loss.","Angelico, Roberta; Blasi, Francesca; Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Toti, Luca; Tisone, Giuseppe; Cacciola, Roberto",Medicina (Kaunas),,147
413244,Status of Remdesivir: Not Yet Beyond Question!,2020,"Prediction and control of chemical mixing are vital for many scientific areas such as subsurface reactive transport, climate modeling, combustion, epidemiology, and pharmacology. Due to the complex nature of mixing in heterogeneous and anisotropic media, the mathematical models related to this phenomenon are not analytically tractable. Numerical simulations often provide a viable route to predict chemical mixing accurately. However, contemporary modeling approaches for mixing cannot utilize available spatial-temporal data to improve the accuracy of the future prediction and can be compute-intensive, especially when the spatial domain is large and for long-term temporal predictions. To address this knowledge gap, we will present in this paper a deep-learning (DL) modeling framework applied to predict the progress of chemical mixing under fast bimolecular reactions. This framework uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for capturing spatial patterns and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting temporal variations in mixing.

417487,COVID-19: Beyond the virus. The use of Photodynamic Therapy for the Treatment of Infections in the Respiratory Tract,2020,"PURPOSE: With the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health institutions and hospitals are increasingly relying on e-learning for continuing education. However, in many countries there is still limited data on the effectiveness of online learning particularly in the healthcare field. This study aims to evaluate whether webinar as a form of online educational intervention is satisfactory and effective for the continuing education of health professionals in Indonesia. METHODS: We collected participants' demographic information including health profession, place of work, work unit, and year of graduation. There were six independent webinars included in this study. Webinar outcomes included satisfaction and learning scores. Regarding satisfaction, participants were told to complete a satisfaction survey and asked whether they would recommend the webinar to their colleagues. Regarding learning, information on their mean pre-test and post-test scores was collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,607 health professionals were enrolled, with the highest participation in webinars about emergency cases and COVID-19 management. The response towards satisfaction was overwhelmingly positive. In all six webinars, post-test scores were statistically significantly higher than pre-test scores. Recently graduated physicians scored higher in learning than senior physicians, while place of work and work unit did not significantly affect the scores. CONCLUSION: The use of webinar for health professionals training in Indonesia was well-received amid the ongoing pandemic. In the future, health institutions and teaching hospitals should optimize the implementation of webinar training as it is associated with low cost, high flexibility, and less time commuting.","Yo, Edward Christopher; Witjaksono, Anissa Nindhyatriayu; Fitriani, Dewi Yunia; Werdhani, Retno Asti; Parikesit, Dyandra",Korean J Med Educ,,147

418505,Virtual medication tours with a pharmacist as part of a cystic fibrosis telehealth visit,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has passed its first peak in Europe. AIM: To describe the mortality in England and its association with SARS-CoV-2 status and other demographic and risk factors. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analyses of people with known SARS-CoV-2 status in the Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network. METHOD: Pseudonymised, coded clinical data were uploaded from volunteer general practice members of this nationally representative network (n = 4 413 734). All-cause mortality was compared with national rates for 2019, using a relative survival model, reporting relative hazard ratios (RHR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) analysis was conducted for those with known SARS-CoV-2 status (n = 56 628, 1.3%) including multiple imputation and inverse probability analysis, and a complete cases sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Mortality peaked in week 16. People living in households of &#8805;9 had a fivefold increase in relative mortality (RHR = 5.1, 95% CI = 4.87 to 5.31, P<0.0001). The ORs of mortality were 8.9 (95% CI = 6.7 to 11.8, P<0.0001) and 9.7 (95% CI = 7.1 to 13.2, P<0.0001) for virologically and clinically diagnosed cases respectively, using people with negative tests as reference. The adjusted mortality for the virologically confirmed group was 18.1% (95% CI = 17.6 to 18.7). Male sex, population density, black ethnicity (compared to white), and people with long-term conditions, including learning disability (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.18, P = 0.0056) had higher odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: The first SARS-CoV-2 peak in England has been associated with excess mortality. Planning for subsequent peaks needs to better manage risk in males, those of black ethnicity, older people, people with learning disabilities, and people who live in multi-occupancy dwellings.","Joy, Mark; Hobbs, Fd Richard; Bernal, Jamie Lopez; Sherlock, Julian; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; McGagh, Dylan; Akinyemi, Oluwafunmi; Byford, Rachel; Dabrera, Gavin; Dorward, Jienchi; Ellis, Joanna; Ferreira, Filipa; Jones, Nicholas; Oke, Jason; Okusi, Cecilia; Nicholson, Brian D; Ramsay, Mary; Sheppard, James P; Sinnathamby, Mary; Zambon, Maria; Howsam, Gary; Williams, John; de Lusignan, Simon",Br J Gen Pract,,147

Animal models are urgently needed to study the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to screen vaccines and treatments. We show that African green monkeys (AGMs) support robust SARS-CoV-2 replication and develop pronounced respiratory disease, which may more accurately reflect human COVID-19 cases than other nonhuman primate species. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mucosal samples, including rectal swabs, as late as 15 days after exposure. Marked inflammation and coagulopathy in blood and tissues were prominent features. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated stimulation of interferon and interleukin-6 pathways in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and repression of natural killer cell- and T cell-associated transcripts in peripheral blood. Despite a slight waning in antibody titers after primary challenge, enhanced antibody and cellular responses contributed to rapid clearance after re-challenge with an identical strain. These data support the utility of AGM for studying COVID-19 pathogenesis and testing medical countermeasures.","Woolsey, Courtney; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Prasad, Abhishek N; Agans, Krystle N; Deer, Daniel J; Dobias, Natalie S; Heymann, John C; Foster, Stephanie L; Levine, Corri B; Medina, Liana; Melody, Kevin; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W; Cross, Robert W",Nat. immunol,,147

METHODS: Three dissemination scenarios were built according to level of adherence to social distancing measures in the context of Brazil's Federal District, based on a dynamic transition compartmental model and Monte Carlo simulations. The model's parameter values were based on official sources, indexed bibliographic databases and public data repositories. RESULTS: The favorable scenario, with constant 58% adherence to social distancing, estimated a peak of 189 (interquartile range [IQR]: 57 - 394) ICU hospitalizations on March 3rd2021. Absence of social distancing would result in an unfavorable scenario with a peak of 6,214 (IQR: 4,618 - 8,415) ICU hospitalizations probably as soon as July 14th2020.

420181,Cancer metabolism and mitochondria: Finding novel mechanisms to fight tumours,2020,"Perillyl alcohol (POH) has been extensively studied for the treatment of peripheral and primary brain tumors. The intranasal route of administration has been preferred for dosing POH in early-stage clinical trials associated with promising outcomes in primary brain cancer. However, it is unclear how intranasal POH targets brain tumors in these patients. Multiple studies indicate that intranasally applied large molecules may enter the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through direct olfactory and trigeminal nerve-associated pathways originating in the nasal mucosa that bypass the blood-brain barrier. It is unknown whether POH, a small molecule subject to extensive nasal metabolism and systemic absorption, may also undergo direct transport to brain or CSF from the nasal mucosa. Here, we compared CSF and plasma concentrations of POH and its metabolite, perillic acid (PA), following intranasal or intravascular POH application. Samples were collected over 70 min and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intranasal administration resulted in tenfold higher CSF-to-plasma ratios for POH and tenfold higher CSF levels for PA compared to equal dose intravascular administration. Our preclinical results demonstrate POH undergoes direct transport from the nasal mucosa to the CSF, a finding with potential significance for its efficacy as an intranasal chemotherapeutic for brain cancer.","Nehra, Geetika; Andrews, Shannon; Rettig, Joan; Gould, Michael N; Haag, Jill D; Howard, Steven P; Thorne, Robert G",Sci Rep,,147

We also conducted weighting-based analyses to estimate the causal effect of network exposure. Results showed that commuting networks matter for COVID-19 deaths and cases, net of spatial proximity, socioeconomic, and demographic factors. Different local racial and ethnic concentrations are also associated with unequal outcomes. These findings suggest that commuting is an important causal mechanism in the spread of COVID-19 and highlight the significance of interconnected of communities. The results suggest that local level mitigation and prevention efforts are more effective when complemented by similar efforts in the network of connected places.

Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Illarro-Uranga, Aitziber; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Monte-Boquet, Emilio; Márquez-Saavedra, Esther; Fernández-Bargiela, Noelia; Gómez-Gómez, David; Lago-Rivero, Natividad; Poveda-Andrés, José Luis; Díaz-Acedo, Rocío; Hurtado-Bouza, Juan Luis; Sánchez-Gundín, Julia; Casanova-Martínez, Cristina; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón",Farm Hosp,,147

Twelve recommendations including, among others, the consideration of shorter courses, delays, and the omission of RT for lung cancer are proposed by the panel. In summary, we recommend the screening of every single person accessing the treatment room, the consideration of hypofractionation and to delay postoperative RT for non-small cell lung cancer, to avoid twice-daily treatments and delay or deliver prophylactic cranial irradiation during radio(chemo)therapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, review image guided RT images for suspicious image findings, and the use of single-fraction RT for the palliative treatment of stage IV lung cancer patients. Given that lung cancer is one of the most common and severe pathologies in radiation oncology departments, the following recommendations require particularly urgent consideration. The decision-making paths strongly depend on locally available resources, and a tailored approach should be used to attend lung cancer patients during this pandemic.","Liao, Zhongxing; Rivin Del Campo, Eleonor; Salem, Ahmed; Pang, Qingsong; Liu, Hui; Lopez Guerra, Jose Luis",Lung Cancer,,147

This, however, often proves intractable; massive numbers of agents, strategies and their change over time in reaction to each other leads to difficulties in both theoretical and simulational approaches. Notable work has been done on strategy dominance in stock markets with respect to the ratios of agents with certain strategies. Perfect knowledge of the strategies employed could then put an individual agent at a consistent trading advantage. This research reports the effects of imperfect oracles on the system - dispensing noisy information about strategies - information which would normally be hidden from market participants. The effect and achievable profits of a singular trader with access to an oracle were tested exhaustively with previously unexplored factors such as changing order schedules. Additionally, the effect of noise on strategic information was traced through its effect on trader efficiency.","Borsi, Miklos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10837v1.pdf,147

Method: an analytical and theoretical-reflective text, based on the central construct of ""Nursing knowledge"", whose theoretical framework of reference was formed by two of the fundamental patterns of knowing, from Chinn & Kramer's perspective: the ethical and the empirical. Results: newly graduated nurses, in the process of accelerated training, will have few resources available from the empirical knowledge pattern, both due to the reduced framework of knowledge evidence and to the difficulty in dealing with mechanisms that are often unknown. As they do not have levels of clinical knowledge, such as that developed in the applications of practical experience, recent graduates may have to confront situations that will impact on the ethical knowledge pattern. Conclusion: the acceleration in the training of Nursing students and their insertion in the health system in the current pandemic situation must be viewed with caution, as the risks are high, both from the point of view of clinical decision-making and from the perspective of facing dilemmas and ethical problems.","Peres, Maria Angélica de Almeida; Brandão, Marcos Antônio Gomes; Aperibense, Pacita Geovana Gama de Sousa; Lacerda, Alessandra Cabral de; Paim, Lygia; Ferreira, Márcia de Assunção",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,,147

431833,[Assessment of Chemotherapy-Induced Adverse Events Using a Sharing System of Patient-Reported Information via a Touch Panel],2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Case series indicating cerebrovascular disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been published. Comprehensive workups, including clinical characteristics, laboratory, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid findings, are needed to understand the mechanisms. METHODS: We evaluated 32 consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated at a tertiary care center from March 9 to April 3, 2020, for concomitant severe central nervous system involvement. Patients identified underwent computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and autopsy in case of death. RESULTS: Of 32 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 8 (25%) had severe central nervous system involvement. Two presented with lacunar ischemic stroke in the early phase and 6 with prolonged impaired consciousness after termination of analgosedation. In all but one with delayed wake-up, neuroimaging or autopsy showed multiple cerebral microbleeds, in 3 with additional subarachnoid hemorrhage and in 2 with additional small ischemic lesions. In 3 patients, intracranial vessel wall sequence magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the first time to our knowledge. All showed contrast enhancement of vessel walls in large cerebral arteries, suggesting vascular wall pathologies with an inflammatory component. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions for SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid were all negative. No intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG synthesis was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: Different mechanisms of cerebrovascular disorders might be involved in COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke might occur early. In a later phase, microinfarctions and vessel wall contrast enhancement occur, indicating small and large cerebral vessels involvement. Central nervous system disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to long-term disabilities. Mechanisms should be urgently investigated to develop neuroprotective strategies.","Keller, Emanuela; Brandi, Giovanna; Winklhofer, Sebastian; Imbach, Lukas L; Kirschenbaum, Daniel; Frontzek, Karl; Steiger, Peter; Dietler, Sabeth; Haeberlin, Marcellina; Willms, Jan; Porta, Francesca; Waeckerlin, Adrian; Huber, Michael; Abela, Irene A; Lutterotti, Andreas; Stippich, Christoph; Globas, Christoph; Varga, Zsuzsanna; Jelcic, Ilijas",Stroke,,147

435324,Predicting Obesity Using Facial Pictures during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Nowadays, automation is a critical topic due to its significant impacts on the productivity of construction projects. Utilizing automation in this industry brings about great results, such as remarkable improvements in the efficiency, quality, and safety of construction activities. The scope of automation in construction includes a wide range of stages, and monitoring construction projects is no exception. Additionally, it is of great importance in project management since an accurate and timely assessment of project progress enables managers to quickly identify deviations from the schedule and take the required actions at the right time. In this stage, one of the most important tasks is to daily keep track of the project progress, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive, but automation has facilitated and accelerated this task. It also eliminated or at least decreased the risk of many dangerous tasks. In this way, the first step of construction automation is to detect used materials in a project site automatically. In this paper, a novel deep learning architecture is utilized, called Vision Transformer (ViT), for detecting and classifying construction materials. To evaluate the applicability and performance of the proposed method, it is trained and tested on three large imbalanced datasets, namely Construction Material Library (CML) and Building Material Dataset (BMD), used in the previous papers, as well as a new dataset created by combining them. The achieved results revealed an accuracy of 100 percent in all parameters and also in each material category. It is believed that the proposed method provides a novel and robust tool for detecting and classifying different material types.","Soleymani, Maryam; Bonyani, Mahdi; Mahami, Hadi; Nasirzadeh, Farnad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09527v1.pdf,147

435620,AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine recommended in ≥50s in Australia,2021,"In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical role on productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with complex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the process outputs. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process. However, a common challenge in industry is the availability of only very limited amount of data especially in the development and early stage of production. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation process under model risk. In particular, we adopt a Bayesian approach to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in decision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement learning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical results on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and explicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution approach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower batch-to-batch variability.","Wang, Bo; Xie, Wei; Martagan, Tugce; Akcay, Alp; Ravenstein, Bram van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03735v3.pdf,147

Akin to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, there is a similar rise in the incidence of KD in children affected with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has been reported to induce an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response resulting in multi-organ involvement, particularly initiated with pulmonary parenchymal damage. This review article will discuss KD-like manifestations in COVID-19 patients in the pediatric cohort. METHODOLOGY: Search terms ""Kawasaki"" ""COVID-19"" ""SARS-COV-2"" ""PIM-TS"" and ""MIS-C"" were used to look for relevant articles in PubMed and Google Scholar published in the last 5 years. RESULTS: There is some evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 stimulates dysfunctional and hyperactive immune reactions mimicking KD in young patients. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic options, both investigational and repurposed, include intravenous immunoglobulins, steroids and anticoagulation. More studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatment options.","Fang, Yulin; Aravamudan, Veeraraghavan Meyyur; Sridharan, Gurusaravanan Kutti; Mehta, Keyur Kamlesh; Sekhar, Ramkumar; Senguttuvan, Nagendra Boopathy; Venkatachalam, Indumathi; Abid, Muhammad Bilal",J Infect Dev Ctries,,147

In addition, this study analysed the association of socio-demographic variables with KAP apart from finding the relationship between KAP. Subject and methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in India. Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables. Conclusion: One-fourth of the students demonstrated only low and moderate levels of knowledge, negative attitude and undesirable practices in preventing COVID-19.

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing Surgical Site Infections (SSI) in elective colorectal surgery. In a multicentre trial, we randomized patients undergoing elective colorectal resection surgery, comparing the effectiveness of OIVA versus intravenous antibiotics (IVA) regimens to prevent SSI as the primary outcome (NCT04438655). In addition to intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanic, patients in the OIVA group received Oral Neomycin and Bacitracin 24 h before surgery. MBP was administered according to local habits which were not changed for the study. The trial was terminated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many centers failed to participate as well as the pandemic changed the rules for engaging patients. Two-hundred and four patients were enrolled (100 in the OIVA and 104 in the IVA group); 3 SSIs (3.4%) were registered in the OIVA and 14 (14.4%) in the IVA group (p = 0.010). No difference was observed in terms of anastomotic leak. Multivariable analysis indicated that OIVA reduced the rate of SSI (OR 0.21 / 95% CI 0.06-0.78 / p = 0.019), while BMI is a risk factor of SSI (OR 1.15 / 95% CI 1.01-1.30 p = 0.039). Subgroup analysis indicated that 0/22 patients who underwent OIVA/MBP + vs 13/77 IVA/MBP- experienced an SSI (p = 0.037). The early termination of the study prevents any conclusion regarding the interpretation of the data. Nonetheless, Oral Neomycin/Bacitracin and intravenous beta-lactam/beta-lactamases inhibitors seem to reduce SSI after colorectal resections, although not affecting the anastomotic leak in this trial.

441816,Editorial: A Journal Associated with the Records of Early Drama,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite being a common gynaecological procedure, abortion continues to be widely stigmatised. The research and medical communities are increasingly considering ways of reducing stigma, and health professionals have a role to play in normalising abortion as part of routine sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH). We sought to investigate how health professionals may normalise abortion and challenge prevailing negative sociocultural narratives. METHODS: As part of the Sexuality and Abortion Stigma Study (SASS), qualitative secondary analysis was conducted on two datasets containing health professionals' accounts of providing abortion in Scotland and England. A subsample of 20 interviews were subjected to in-depth, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified in heath professionals' accounts: (1) encountering resistance to abortion from others working in SRH; (2) contending with prevailing negative sociocultural narratives of abortion; (3) enacting overt positivity towards abortion provision; and (4) presenting abortion as part of normal, routine healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that negative attitudes toward abortion persist both inside and outside of healthcare systems, and need to be challenged in order to destigmatise those accessing and providing services. Health professionals can play a key role in normalising abortion, through the ways in which they frame their work and present abortion to women they treat, and others more widely. Our analysis suggests a key way to achieve this is by presenting abortion as part of normal, routine SRH, but that appropriate support and structural change are essential for normalisation to become embedded.","Maxwell, Karen J; Hoggart, Lesley; Bloomer, Fiona; Rowlands, Sam; Purcell, Carrie",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,147

442998,Non-invasive red-light optogenetic control of Drosophila cardiac function,2020,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DA). PD treatment remains unsatisfactory as the current synthetic drugs in clinical use relies on managing only motor symptoms. This study investigated antioxidant potentials of selected compounds namely, 5,6,7,4´-tetramethoxyflavone (1), 6-hydroxy-2,3,4,4´-tetramethoxychalcone (2), 6-methoxyhamiltone A (3), diosquinone (4) and toussantine D (5) against rotenone (6) induced PD in Drosophila melanogaster. Toxicity of these compounds was conducted by monitoring flies' survival for seven days and determining the lethal concentrations (LC50). Whereas compound 1 had LC50 value of 91.3 µM within three days, compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 had LC50 values of 87.2, 58.0, 64.0 and > 1000 µM, respectively on the seventh day of the experiment. We exposed flies (1-4 days old) to 500 µM rotenone and co-treated with different doses of the test compounds in the diet for seven days at final concentrations of 11.0, 43.6 and 87.2 µM for compounds 2 and 3. The concentrations used for compound 4 were 8.0, 32.0 and 64.0 µM, while 250, 500 and 1000 µM were used for compound 5. Rotenone fed flies showed impaired climbing ability compared to control flies, the phenotype that was rescued by the treatment of tested phytochemicals. Rotenone toxicity also increased malondialdehyde levels assayed by lipid peroxidation in the brain tissues relative to control flies. This effect was reduced in flies exposed to rotenone and co-treated with the phytochemicals. Moreover, expression levels of mRNA of antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase and catalase were elevated in flies treated with rotenone and normalized in flies that were co-treated with tested compounds. Besides compound 1, this study provides overall evidence that the tested flavonoids and polyketides ameliorated the rotenone provoked neurotoxicity in D. melanogaster by battling the induced oxidative stress in brain cells including DA neurons and hence rescue the locomotor behaviour deficits.","Siima, Angela A; Stephano, Flora; Munissi, Joan J E; Nyandoro, Stephen S",,,147

The need for therapeutic alternatives to stop this new pandemic is urgent. Nowadays, no efficacious therapy is available, and vaccines and drugs are underdeveloped to cure or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in many countries. Some vaccines candidates have been approved; however, a number of people are still skeptical of this coronavirus vaccines. Probably because of issues related to the quantity of the vaccine and a possible long-term side effects which are still being studied. The previous pandemics of infections caused by coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43 were described in the 1960s, -HCoV-NL63 isolated in 2004, and HCoV-HKU1identified in 2005 prompted researchers to characterize many compounds against these viruses. Most of them could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus. Five membered nitrogen heterocycles with a triazole, imidazole, and thiazole moiety are often found in many bioactive molecules such as coronavirus inhibitors. This present work summarizes to review the biological and structural studies of these compound types as coronavirus inhibitors.","Seck, Insa; Nguemo, Filomain",Results Chem,,147

445181,Estimates of population-based incidence of malignant arrhythmias associated with medication use - a narrative review,2020,"Urban, socio-economic and eco-environmental influences on people's health are widely studied and well-known. Their relation to COVID-19, however, is still a novel research topic. Thus, we investigated if COVID-19 parameters are higher in cities with higher urbanization, worst socio-economic conditions, and less vegetation cover, considering 3,052 municipalities in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Brazil is the second country most affected by COVID-19, and the Atlantic Forest is its most urbanized, populous, and deforested region. Indexes were created through multivariate principal components analysis using secondary official data: population, demographic density, absolute built area, and relative built area as urbanization parameters; average per capita income, relative people vulnerable to poverty, illiteracy rate of the population aged 18 or over, and human development index (HDI) as socio-economic parameters; and absolute and relative vegetation cover, absolute and relative forest cover as eco-environmental parameters. These indexes were correlated with absolute and relative confirmed COVID-19 cases, absolute and relative confirmed deaths, and mortality rate via Spearman's and Kendall's coefficients. Strong correlations (>0.50) were found between COVID-19 and urbanization. Socio-economic and eco-environmental aspects, although weaker predictors of COVID-19, presented meaningful relations with the health parameters. This study contributes to the evidence regarding COVID-19 incidence in the Brazilian population.","Viezzer, Jennifer; Biondi, Daniela",Sustain Cities Soc,,147

447710,Developing membrane-derived nanocarriers for ex vivo therapy of homologous breast cancer cells,2021,"The third pandemic of coronavirus infection, called COVID-19 disease, was first detected in November 2019th. Various determinants of disease progression such as age, sex, virus mutations, comorbidity, lifestyle, host immune response, and genetic background variation have caused clinical variability of COVID-19. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an enveloped coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that invades host cells using an endocytic pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the main viral protein that contributes to the fusion of the virus particle to the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The highly conserved expression of ACE2 is found in various animals, which indicates its pivotal physiological function. The ACE2 has a crucial role in vascular, renal, and myocardial physiology. Genetic factors contributing to the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown; however, variants in the specific sites of ACE2 gene could be regarded as a main genetic risk factor for COVID-19. Given that ACE2 is the main site for virus landing on host cells, the effect of amino acid sequences of ACE2 on host susceptibility to COVID-19 seems reasonable. It would likely have a substantial role in the occurrence of a wide range of clinical symptoms. Several ACE2 variants can affect the protein stability, influencing the interaction between spike protein and ACE2 through imposing conformational changes while some other variants are known to cause a decrease or an increase in the ligand-receptor affinity. The other variations are located at the proteolytic cleavage site, which can influence virus infection; because soluble ACE2 can act as a decoy receptor for virus and decrease virus intake by cell surface ACE2. Notably, polymorphisms of regulatory and non-coding regions such as promoter in ACE2, can play crucial role in different expression levels of ACE2 among different individuals. Many studies should be performed to investigate the involvement of ACE2 polymorphism with susceptibility to COVID-19. Herein, we discuss some reported associations between variants of ACE2 and COVID-19 in details. In addition, the mode of action of ACE2 and its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted which is followed by addressing the effects of several ACE2 variants on its protein stability, viral tropism or ligand-receptor affinity, secondary and tertiary structure or protein conformation, proteolytic cleavage site, and finally inter-individual clinical variability in COVID-19. The polymorphisms of regulatory regions of ACE2 and their effect on expression levels of ACE2 are also provided in this review. Such studies can improve the prediction of the affinity of mutant ACE2 variations with spike protein, and help the biopharmaceutical industry to design effective approaches for recombinant hACE2 therapy and vaccination of COVID-19 disease.","Bakhshandeh, Behnaz; Sorboni, Shokufeh Ghasemian; Javanmard, Amir-Reza; Mottaghi, Seyed Saeed; Mehrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Sorouri, Farzaneh; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Jahanafrooz, Zohreh",Infect Genet Evol,,147

454039,RAND Review: COVID Slide (July-August 2020),2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the rapid integration of telemedicine services across several specialties, especially in Otolaryngology where risk of transmission is very high. Studies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that Otolaryngology is generally amenable to telemedicine. However, few studies have assessed patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, and fewer have focused on patient satisfaction with telehealth in Rhinology. OBJECTIVES: To determine if patients believe the benefits of virtual live synchronous telemedicine visits out-weigh the drawbacks when compared to in-person clinical visits. METHODS: Single center retrospective case series and survey study of patients presenting to a tertiary care Rhinology practice between 3/15/2020 and 6/1/2020. All patients had previous in-person encounters with Rhinology (n = 45). RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants (64.4%) had audio-video visits while 16 (35.6%) had audio visits. 36 (80%) patients stated that their needs were met during their telemedicine visit while 32 (71.1%) patients felt that nothing was missed or not addressed during the virtual visit. The most commonly cited advantage to telemedicine visits was convenience (22.2%) and provider availability (20.0%). While most participants did not disclose a disadvantage to a virtual visit besides the lack of a physical exam (68.9%), the most commonly cited disadvantage to a virtual visit was technological difficulties (17.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual telemedicine visits were shown to effectively meet the needs of established patients and address concerns in a convenient time efficient manner. However, patients indicated that limited technology and a less personalized feel hindered the telemedicine experience in Rhinology.","Hentati, Firas; Cabrera, Claudia I; D039,; Anza, Brian; Rodriguez, Kenneth",Am J Otolaryngol,,147

The extent of this phenomenon and its mechanisms are unclear.MethodsâandâResults:This study prospectively included 50 consecutive STEMI patients admitted to our center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the peak of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak. At admission, a COVID-19 test was positive in 24 patients (48%), negative in 26 (52%). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Upon admission, COVID-19 subjects had lower PO2/FiO2 (169 [100-425] vs. 390 [302-477], P<0.01), more need for oxygen support (62.5% vs. 26.9%, P=0.02) and a higher rate of myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <30% in 45.8% vs. 19.2%, P=0.04). All patients underwent emergency angiography. In 12.5% of COVID-19 patients, no culprit lesions were detected, thus PCI was performed in 87.5% and 100% of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P=0.10). Despite a higher rate of obstinate thrombosis in the COVID-19 group (47.6% vs. 11.5%, P<0.01), the PCI result was similar (TIMI 2-3 in 90.5% vs. 100%, P=0.19). In-hospital mortality was 41.7% and 3.8% in COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P<0.01). Respiratory failure was the leading cause of death (80%) in the COVID-19 group, frequently associated with severe myocardial dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with STEMI remains high despite successful PCI, mainly due to coexisting severe respiratory failure. This may be a critical factor in patient management and treatment selection.","Pellegrini, Dario; Fiocca, Luigi; Pescetelli, Irene; Canova, Paolo; Vassileva, Angelina; Faggi, Lara; Senni, Michele; Guagliumi, Giulio",Cir. j,,147

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies investigating the association between vitamin D levels and risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease and mortality among those infected have yielded mixed results. Thus far, the majority of studies investigating the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 have been observational and rely on vitamin D levels obtained at the time of admission, limiting causal inference. Currently, clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation in individuals with COVID-19 infection are extremely limited. Randomized, interventional trials may offer more clarity on the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19 infection and outcomes. SUMMARY: Decreased levels of vitamin D may amplify the inflammatory effects of COVID-19 infection, yet, data regarding the mortality benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals are still limited. Current observational data provides the impetus for future studies to including randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19-infected individuals with kidney disease can improve mortality outcomes.","Szeto, Betsy; Fan, Lena; Nickolas, Thomas L",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,147

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 300 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were treated with TCM, at a designated hospital in China. The patients were categorized into three groups: TCM1, TCM2 and TCM3, who respectively received TCM interventions within 7, 8-14, and greater than 15 days of hospitalization. Different indicators such as the conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, length of hospital stay, and inflammatory markers (leukocyte count, and lymphocyte count and percentage) were analyzed to observe the impact of early TCM interventions on these groups. RESULTS: The median conversion times of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid in the three groups were 5.5, 7 and 16 d (P < 0.001), with TCM1 and TCM2 being statistically different from TCM3 (P < 0.01). TCM1 (P < 0.05) and TCM3 (P < 0.01) were statistically different from TCM2. The median conversion times of fecal nucleic acid in the three groups were 7, 9 and 17 d (P < 0.001). Conversion times of fecal nucleic acid in TCM1 were statistically different from TCM3 and TCM2 (P < 0.01). The median lengths of hospital stay in the three groups were 13, 16 and 21 d (P < 0.001). TCM1 and TCM2 were statistically different from TCM3 (P < 0.01); TCM1 and TCM3 were statistically different from TCM2 (P < 0.01). Both leucocyte and lymphocyte counts increased gradually with an increase in the length of hospital stay in TCM1 group patients, with a statistically significant difference observed at each time point in the group (P < 0.001). Statistically significant differences in lymphocyte count and percentage in TCM2 (P < 0.001), and in leucocyte count (P = 0.043) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.038) in TCM3 were observed. The comparison among the three groups showed a statistically significant difference in lymphocyte percentage on the third day of admission (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: In this study, it was observed that in COVID-19 patients treated with a combination of Chinese and Western medicines, TCM intervention earlier in the hospital stay correlated with faster conversion time of pharyngeal swab and fecal nucleic acid, as well as shorter length of hospital stay, thus helping promote faster recovery of the patient. The underlying mechanism of action may be related to improving inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Shi, Miao-Yan; Sun, Shi-Qi; Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Xing; Xu, Gui-Hua; Chen, Xuan; Su, Zi-Jian; Song, Xiu-Ming; Liu, Lu-Jiong; Zhang, Yi-Bao; Zhang, Yi-le; Sun, Meng; Chen, Qi; Xue, Yan; Lü, Hua; Yuan, Wei-An; Chen, Xiao-Rong; Lu, Yun-Fei",J.

458426,IQGAP3 promotes cancer proliferation and metastasis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,2020,"Chlorinated compounds such as sphingolipid-based organochlorine compounds are precursors for the formation of 3-monochlororopanediol (3-MCPD) esters in palm oil. This study evaluates the effects of several factors within the palm oil supply chain on the levels of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, which in turn may influence the formation of 3-MCPD esters during refining. These factors include application of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in the oil palm plantation, bruising and degradation of oil palm fruits after harvest, recycling of steriliser condensate as water for dilution of crude oil during oil palm milling, water washing of palm oil and different refining conditions. It was observed that bruised and degraded oil palm fruits showed higher content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine than control. In addition, recycling steriliser condensate during milling resulted in elevated content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine in palm oil. However, the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine compounds was reduced by neutralisation, degumming and bleaching steps during refining. Although water washing of crude palm oils (CPO) prior to refining did not reduce the content of sphingolipid-based organochlorine, it did reduce the formation of 3-MCPD esters through the removal of water-soluble chlorinated compounds. It was found that the use of inorganic chlorinated fertiliser in plantations did not increase the content of chlorinated compounds in oil palm fruits and extracted oil, and hence chlorinated fertiliser does not seem to play a role in the formation of 3-MCPD esters in palm oil. Overall, this study concluded that lack of freshness and damage to the fruits during transport to mills, combined with water and oil recycling in mills are the major contributors of chlorinated precursor for 3-MCPD esters formation in palm oil.","Tiong, Soon Huat; Nair, Anusha; Abd Wahid, Siti Aishah; Saparin, Norliza; Ab Karim, Nur Azwani; Ahmad Sabri, Maizatul Putri; Md Zain, Mohd Zairey; Teh, Huey Fang; Adni, Ahmad Sarwani; Ping Tan, Chin; Lai, Oi Ming; Cheah, See Siang; Appleton, David Ross",Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,,147
458654,Malakoplakia of the gastrointestinal tract: clinicopathologic analysis of 23 cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies for online communication of personal medical information and patient empowerment. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the pandemic's consequences. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and communicate the results. OBJECTIVE: Reducing the communication burden for healthcare professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online which is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. METHODS: The application draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. RESULTS: The test status and results are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks by patients not using smartphones, which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. Stress tests and statistics show the performance of our software. CTest is currently running at two University Hospitals (Ulm, Tübingen; Germany) with thousands of tests each week. Results show a mean number of 10 views per testee. CONCLUSIONS: CTest runs independent of existing infrastructures, aims at straight-forward integration, and safe transmission of information. The system is easy-to-use for testees. QR Code links allow for quick accession to the test results. The mean number of views per entry indicates the reduced amount of time for both, healthcare professionals and testees. The system is quite generic and can be extended and adapted to other communication tasks.","Völkel, Gunnar; Fürstberger, Axel; Schwab, Julian D; Werle, Silke D; Ikonomi, Nansi; Gscheidmeier, Thomas; Kraus, Johann M; Groß, Alexander; Holderried, Martin; Balig, Julien; Jobst, Franz; Kuhn, Peter; Kuhn, Klaus A; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Kaisers, Udo X; Seufferlein, Thomas; Kestler, Hans A",J. med. internet res,,147

Organ donation processes got more complex because the exclusion of the disease in a short period became more difficult than normal. The exclusion of the disease is vital not only for recipients but also for the medical staff, transplantation teams, and intensive care professionals to reduce the transmission risk. The main steps for diagnosis of COVID-19 are investigation of symptoms, recollection of travel and physical contact history, and testing using the real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although it has limitations such as false negative results, RT-PCR is the most accurate method to detect COVID-19, and it is mandatory before donation processes in many countries. In this case report, we aim to share our experience about the first organ donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey.","Yakar, Mehmet Nuri; İstan, Pakize; Gürkök, Mehmet Çağatay; Yıldız, Diren; Yaka, Erdem; Gökmen, Ali Necati",Tur.

To investigate this critical question, we conducted a clinical meta-analysis including all available currently reported cases of potential COVID-19 reinfections. We searched for all peer-reviewed articles in the search engine of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. While there are over 30,000 publications on COVID-19, only about 15 specifically target the subject of COVID-19 reinfections. Available patient data in these reports was analyzed for age, gender, time of reported relapse after initial infection and persistent COVID-19 positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. Following the first episode of infection, cases of clinical relapse are reported at 34 (mean) ± 10.5 days after full recovery. Patients with clinical relapse have persisting positive COVID-19 PCR testing results until 39 ± 9 days following initial positive testing. For patients without clinical relapse, positive testing was reported up to 54 ± 24 days. There were no reports of any clinical reinfections after a 70-day period following initial infection.","Arafkas, Mohamed; Khosrawipour, Tanja; Kocbach, Piotr; Zielinski, Kacper; Schubert, Justyna; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Celinska, Maria; Khosrawipour, Veria",J. med. virol,,147

(Special section: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),2021,"Processes on networks consist of two interdependent parts: the network topology, consisting of the links between nodes, and the dynamics, specified by some governing equations. This work considers the prediction of the future dynamics on an unknown network, based on past observations of the dynamics. For a general class of governing equations, we propose a prediction algorithm which infers the network as an intermediate step. Inferring the network is impossible in practice, due to a dramatically ill-conditioned linear system. Surprisingly, a highly accurate prediction of the dynamics is possible nonetheless: Even though the inferred network has no topological similarity with the true network, both networks result in practically the same future dynamics.","Prasse, Bastian; Mieghem, Piet Van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14575v1.pdf,147

BACKGROUND: Commitment to a profession requires doing the best for that profession. In the case of the nursing profession, professional commitment gains greater importance in times of crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 389 nurses in the Turkish state hospital. Institutional permissions, ethical approval and written consents from the participants were obtained before carrying out the study. RESULTS: The participants' mean Perceived Organizational Obstruction Scale score was 20.07 ± 8.06 (min = 5.0, max = 35.0), and their mean Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.20 ± 11.94 (min = 30.0, max = 103.0). Socio-demographic variables and perception of organisational obstruction predicted 36.7% of the variance in the professional commitment (p < .001). CONCLUSION: A road map based on the study results was developed for hospitals and nurse managers to maintain and increase nurses' professional commitment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results of this study may help institutions and nurse managers understand the factors affecting professional commitment during the pandemic as a whole, as well as determine primary strategies based on the importance of these factors.","Duran, Secil; Celik, Isa; Ertugrul, Bekir; Ok, Serife; Albayrak, Sevil",J. nurs. manag,,147
461732,Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT)for1200 early breast tumors,2021,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology affecting young adults, which is burdened by life-threatening complications, mostly macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Interferons (IFNs) are signalling molecules that mediate a variety of biological functions from defence against viral infections, to antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. These molecules have been classified into three major types: IFN I, IFN II, IFN III, presenting specific characteristics and functions. In this work, we reviewed the role of IFNs on AOSD and MAS, focusing on their pathogenic role in promoting the hyperinflammatory response and as new possible therapeutic targets. In fact, both preclinical and clinical observations suggested that these molecules could promote the hyperinflammatory response in MAS during AOSD. Furthermore, the positive results of inhibiting IFN-Î³ in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may provide a solid rationale to arrange further clinical studies, paving the way for reducing the high mortality rate in MAS during AOSD.","Di Cola, Ilenia; Ruscitti, Piero; Giacomelli, Roberto; Cipriani, Paola",,,147

462444,Enabling Warp Speed Using the Hypervelocity Innovation Model: A Blue Print for Drug Development in Pandemics,2020,"Patients with rheumatic diseases are often more susceptible to different bacteria and viruses because of immune impairment, but it is not clear whether there is a higher risk of infection and a more serious course of disease for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We performed this systematic review and meta analysis to assess the risk and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases compared with the general population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 1, 2020 to October 20, 2020 to determine epidemiological information related to patients with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19, including clear risk estimate or data that could be converted and extracted. We included 26 observational studies, totaling about 2000 patients with rheumatic diseases of whom were infected with COVID-19. Meta-analysis showed that the risk of COVID-19 infection in rheumatic patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.24-1.88, P = 0.000). In terms of hospitalization and severe clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19, we found that rheumatic patients showed similar results to the reference population (hospitalization OR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.81-2.29, P = 0.247; admitted to ICU OR = 1.94, 95% CI 0.88-4.27, P = 0.098; death OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.84-1.97, P = 0.248). The presence of comorbidities, hypertension, lung diseases were significantly associated with the increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization in rheumatic patients and anti-TNF drugs were associated with lower hospitalization risk. Older age was related to severe COVID-19. Our meta-analysis indicated that rheumatic patients were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection but might not lead to a more serious disease process.","Wang, Qingxiu; Liu, Jianbo; Shao, Runxia; Han, Xiaopeng; Su, Chenhao; Lu, Wenjia",Rheumatol Int,,147

We evaluated the association between recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (RZV) and COVID-19 outcomes at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. MethodsIn a cohort design, adults aged [≥]50 years who received [≥]1 RZV dose prior to 3/1/2020 were matched 1:2 to unvaccinated individuals and followed until 12/31/2020. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for COVID-19 outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. In a test-negative design, cases had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and controls had only negative tests, from 3/1/2020-12/31/2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs for prior receipt of RZV were estimated using logistic regression. ResultsIn the cohort design, 149,244 RZV recipients were matched to 298,488 unvaccinated individuals. The aHRs (95% CI) for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were 0.84 (0.81-0.87) and 0.68 (0.64-0.74), respectively. In the test-negative design, 8.4% of 75,726 test-positive cases and 13.1% of 340,898 test-negative controls had received [≥]1 RZV dose. The aOR (95% CI) was 0.84 (0.81-0.86).

465574,Dissecting miRNA signature in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis,2020,"Background: During the lockdown period caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we monitored via online survey the trend of allergic symptoms and the therapeutic compliance in patients followed at our center. Material and methods: In June 2020, we selected children followed at the Allergy and Immunology Service of Umberto I Hospital, aged between 6 and 16 years old, diagnosed with asthma and/or rhinitis and sensitized to grass pollen or dust mite. We sent an email with 12 multiple-choice questions investigating several areas: type of disease and sensitization, recurrence of symptoms, medication use during lockdown compared to the same period of the previous year. Results: The results of 82 questionnaires showed that 17.8% of patients suffered from asthma, 24.4% from rhinitis, and 57.8% from both. Within the group of asthmatic children, most of them presented an improvement of their symptoms. Likewise, with regard to allergic rhinitis, most of them reported better clinical conditions. Regarding treatment, we observed a global decrease in the use of on-demand therapies (salbutamol, nasal corticosteroid, and antihistamine) for both pathologies. In addition, there was a reduction in the use of basal therapy for asthma and rhinitis from 2019 (23.3%) to 2020 (15.5%). Conclusions: Our data show a general trend of clinical improvement and a reduction in the use of on-demand and basal therapy in allergic children during the lockdown.","Brindisi, Giulia De Vittori Valentina De Nola Rosalba Pignataro Elia Anania Caterina De Castro Giovanna Cinicola Bianca Gori Alessandra Cicinelli Ettore Zicari Anna Maria",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,147
467111,Deconstructing Inequities - Transparent Values in Measurement and Analytic Choices,2021,"PurposeTo develop a reliable tool that predicts which patients are most likely to be COVID-19 positive and which ones have an increased risk of hospitalization. MethodsFrom February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, and symptoms in an outpatient COVID-19 testing center. All positive patients were followed up by phone for 14 days or until symptom-free. We calculated the symptoms odds ratio for positive results and hospitalization and proposed a ""random forest"" machine-learning model to predict positive testing. ResultsA total of 8,998 patients over 16 years old underwent COVID-19 RT-PCR, with 1,914 (21.3%) positives. Fifty patients needed hospitalization (2.6% of positives), and three died (0.15%). Most common symptoms were: cough, headache, sore throat, coryza, fever, myalgia (57%, 51%, 44%, 36%, 35%, 27%, respectively). Cough, fever, and myalgia predicted positive COVID-19 test, while others behaved as protective factors. The best predictors of positivity were fever plus anosmia/ageusia (OR=6.31), and cough plus anosmia/ageusia (OR=5.82), both p<0.0001. Our random forest model had an ROC-AUC of 0.72 (specificity=0.70, sensitivity=0.61, PPV=0.38, NPV=0.86). Having steady fever during the first days of infection and persistent dyspnea increased the risk of hospitalization (OR=6.66, p<0.0001 and OR=3.13, p=0.003, respectively), while anosmia-ageusia (OR=0.36, p=0.009) and coryza (OR=0.31, p=0.014) were protective.

Targeting an allosteric binding pocket can allow a modulator to have protein subtype selectivity and low drug resistance. Utilizing covalent warheads further enables the modulator to increase the binding potency and extend the duration of action. This review starts with GPCR allosteric modulation to discuss the structural biology of allosteric binding pockets, the different types of allosteric modulators, as well as the advantages of employing allosteric modulation. This is followed by a discussion on covalent modulators to clarify how covalent ligands can benefit the receptor modulation and to illustrate moieties that can commonly be used as covalent warheads. Finally, case studies are presented on designing class A, B, and C GPCR covalent allosteric modulators to demonstrate successful stories on combining allosteric modulation and covalent binding.

470606,COVID-19 infection and oxidative stress: an under-explored approach for prevention and treatment?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are polymers of varying molecular weight (MW) used widely as excipients in drugs and other products, including the mRNA vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019. Allergy to PEGs is rare. Skin testing and graded challenge carries a high risk of inducing systemic reactions. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated skin prick test (SPT) results and in vitro reactivity over time to different MW PEGs and assessed cross-sensitization patterns in PEG allergy. METHODS: Ten patients with previously diagnosed PEG allergy underwent SPT twice with PEGs 26 months apart. Lower MW (PEG 300, 3000, 6000) were tested, followed by PEG 20,000, in stepwise, increasing concentrations. Cross-sensitization to polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 was assessed. SPT was performed in 16 healthy controls. In vitro basophil histamine release (HR) test and passive sensitization HR test were performed in patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients previously testing positive on SPT to PEG 3000 and/or 6000 also tested positive to PEG 20,000. Patients with a longer interval since diagnosis tested negative to lower MW PEGs and positive mainly to higher concentrations of PEG 20,000. Three patients developed systemic urticaria during SPT. Eight patients showed cross-sensitization to poloxamer 407 and 3 to polysorbate 80. All controls tested negative. In vitro tests showed limited usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Skin test reactivity to PEG can decrease over time, but titrated SPT with increasing concentrations of PEG 20,000 can be diagnostic when lower MW PEGs test negative. To avoid systemic reactions, stepwise SPT is mandatory.","Bruusgaard-Mouritsen, Maria Anna; Jensen, Bettina Margrethe; Poulsen, Lars K; Duus Johansen, Jeanne; Garvey, Lene Heise",J. allergy clin. immunol,,147

From the data collected in São Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates. Based on the estimated model parameters, we calculated the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$, and we retrieved the number of deaths due to CoViD-19, which was three times lower than those found in the literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied the isolation rates in the young and elder subpopulations to assess the epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the reduction in the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.","Mo Yang, Hyun; Pedro Lombardi Junior, Luis; Campos Yang, Ariana",Math. med. biol,,147

(Special Issue: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),2020,"OBJECTIVES: We describe a hospital's implementation of predictive models to optimise emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison. RESULTS: We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model run.DiscusssionOur model allowed us to shape our health system's executive policy response to implement a 'hospital within a hospital'-one for patients with COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population. The surgical scheduleis modified according to models that predict the number of new patients withCovid-19 who require admission. This enabled our hospital to coordinateresources to continue to support the community at large. Challenges includedthe need to frequently adjust or create new models to meet rapidly evolvingrequirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs ofmultiple stakeholders. The model we created can be adapted to other health systems,provide a mechanism to predict local peaks in cases and inform hospitalleadership regarding bed allocation, surgical volumes, staffing, and suppliesone for COVID-19 patients within a hospital able to care for the regularnon-COVID-19 population. CONCLUSION: Predictive models are essential tools in supporting decision making when coordinating clinical operations during a pandemic.","Warde, Prem Rajendra; Patel, Samira; Ferreira, Tanira; Gershengorn, Hayley; Bhatia, Monisha Chakravarthy; Parekh, Dipen; Manni, Kymberlee; Shukla, Bhavarth",,,147

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health emergency. This situation has exacerbated the need for additional healthcare employees, forcing the Spanish government to incorporate volunteer nursing students as auxiliary health staff. DESIGN: A qualitative study framed in the constructivist paradigm. METHODS: Twenty-two students of nursing were recruited. A purposeful sampling was implemented until reaching saturation. A semi-structured interview as a conversational technique was used to collect information based on three dimensions: academic curriculum, disciplinary professional development, and patient care. Subsequently, a content analysis of the information was carried out. Three phases were followed in the data analysis process: theoretical, descriptive-analytical, and interpretive. The COREQ checklist was used to evaluate the study. RESULTS: The most important results are linked to the students' professional and academic preparation, how the nurses handled the pandemic situation and the characteristics of the COVID-19 patients.

chapters The objective of this electronic monograph is to show the impact of pandemics on the economic performance of any country anytime and anywhere This first chapter explains each chapter of this electronic monograph The second chapter analyses the impact of Globalization as in the main reason of the fast spread of COVID-2019 worldwide We divided into three large sections how Globalization is the main reason of the faster COVID-19 spread worldwide followed by: (a ) the institutional, legal, and political approach of Globalization;(b ) the massive transportations systems and the development of information communication technologies (ICT’s);(c ) the free trade liberalization and labor mobility Hence, the main objective of this research is to show that Globalization is the major responsible of the fast and unstoppable spread of COVID-2019 globally Finally, the same research suggests a deep reform of Globalization to avoid again any massive contagious epidemic diseases to reduce its impact economically and socially The third chapter tries to expose how poverty can be a crucial issue in the faster expansion of COVID-19 in developing countries like Guatemala This research chapter's primary objective is to prove that the rapid development of COVID-19 infected cases is directly involved in the massive poverty levels in developing countries However, this chapter also looks at the dramatic reduction of the middle class and the expansion of poverty This research focuses on how developing, and least developed countries are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), how developing countries such as Guatemala got exponential COVID-19 contagious cases growth rates of 300% daily According to our preliminary results in the case of Guatemala, we can observe that poverty originated from enormous inflation, massive unemployment, deep-rooted discrimination -by race and economic-, income inequality -the largest in Latin America-, a large informal economy –urban and rural-, and a vast corruption -myopic governments with personal agendas- Finally, this chapter tries to present policies (Ruiz Estrada, 2011) and (Ruiz Estrada and Park, 2018) to the Guatemalan government, the private sector, and civil society from a holistic approach to Guatemala conditions and characteristics In the fourth chapter, we evaluate visually how the COVID-19 quarantines can generate massive unemployment, the constant expansion of inflation, the reduction of the purchasing power parity, and the poverty expansion from a multidimensional perspective This visualization is only possible under the creation of a new multidimensional graphical modeling is called “The Multidimensional Poverty Kaleidoscope Graph ” The multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph is not intended to use a forecasting model in any case However, its application is not limited to the study of a select group of countries It is not constrained by issues about the region or countries interested in applying the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph There are four primary phases in the implementation of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph The first phase is the design of the input-output-table The second phase is divided into two sections of analysis: the first section of study assumes that the COVID-19 quarantine time framework growth rate (Y = Independent variable) impact directly on our four variables in the report such as the inflation growth rate (X1), the unemployment growth rate (X2), purchasing power parity growth rate (X3) and the government budget deficit (X4) In the second section of the analysis, the last past four variables in analysis became our dependent variables and directly affected the poverty growth rate (Z) The third phase is the construction of the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph Finally, the multidimensional poverty kaleidoscope graph was applied to three countries: The U S , Malaysia, and Guatemala The chapter fifth exposes a new view of COVID-19 in general We are interested in going more rooted in the transformation from COVID-19 to COVID-20 This research aims to prove that COVID-19 can transform anytime and anywhere quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively This research believes that COVID-19 is transforming and generating a new mutation that can change in a new virus This new virus will be entitled “COVID-20 ” The COVID-20 is going to be more potent and complex than COVID-19, according to our observations We are considering that COVID-20 started massively from January 2020 until the end of December 2020, according to this research This transformation is not only in symptoms and characteristics but also in its way of transmission, controls, treatments, and eradication The sixth chapter tries to compare the characteristics of the animal viral strain (e g , avian influenza and rabies) and the new viral strain called the COVID-19 The main idea is to evaluate a serial of parameters such as the composition, behavior, structure, environments, reproduction, mutation periods, and the reaction together of different viral strains under the use of an extensive database according to twenty-six variables with his twenty-six large databases respectively This research aims to plot the twenty-six databases in the viral strain coordinate space (VS-Coordinate Space) to generate different viral strain surfaces (VS-Surfaces) Therefore, we will build three different VS-Surfaces with similar sizes and colors to identify different viral strains' characteristics and behavior simultaneously Hence, we can compare the COVID-19 viral strain surface with each animal viral strain surface, such as avian influenza and rabies If the COVID-19 viral strain surface cannot show similitudes with the other VS-surfaces from the animal viral strain surfaces (avian influenza and rabies), we can confirm that the new COVID-19 viral strain surface has a possible human intervention, manipulation, and reproduction Finally, we can generate a list of possible origins of the latest COVID-19 viral strain surface according to missing characteristics and behavior from the animal viral strains surfaces as soon as possible It is to control this worldwide pandemic urgently The chapter seventh intends to evaluate how long any country it takes for its economic recovery from the Post-COVID-19 period under the application of a new indicator called ""COVID-19 Waves Oscillations "" The main objective is to evaluate the world economy economic recovery time framework from COVID-19, respectively The calculation of COVID-19 Waves Oscillation requests a holistic mathematical approach under the creation of a simple formula This formula uses the interval of COVID-19 cases daily to elaborate a series of waves from Nano-Waves until Mega-Waves At the same time, we will demonstrate how the COVID-19 waves oscillation can significantly impact COVID-19 openness behavior (full business and financial activities reactivation –commonly) Finally, we can elaborate on a large number of simulations to evaluate how long it can take different countries to full economic recovery from COVID-19 According to chapter eighth evaluates the big socio-economic dilemma of COVID-19, such as whether we stay at home in quarantine or work as usual We try to assess quarantines' pros and cons or work in pandemic times from a multidimensional perspective This research chapter's primary objective is to prove the final impact in both scenarios and the ultimate effect on any country's socio-economic performance However, this chapter also looks at the negative implications of quarantine (s) on different social groups from low-income people (informal labor sector) to high-income people (formal labor sector) This research focuses on how quarantine or without quarantine is not the most significant public health policy to solve COVID-19 in the medium and long run Simultaneously, we did many simulations to evaluate the negative impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic performance in households and firms Additionally, we propose a new socio-economic simulator to assess the decision to implement full quarantine or without quarantine and its negative impact in the short run The new simulator is entitled ""The Virtual Socio-Economic Evaluation of Decisions and Scenarios Disk Synchronization for Pandemics Simulator (VSEDSDSP-Simulator) "" According to the VSEDSDSP-Simulator results from different simulations, we can observe that extremes such as a full quarantine or without quarantine can generate an immediately deadly effect in the socio-economic performance in the short and long run without prejudice or preference among different social groups Hence, this chapter supports an alternative statement is that COVID-19 is not only a simple physical disease;also, COVID-19 is a psychological disease (depression, anxiety, and nostology) that also can directly affect producers' and consumers' productivity and behavior (decisions) considerably","Ruiz Estrada, Mario Arturo",,,147

Rearrangements involving CCND1 are observed in a subset of mature B-cell neoplasms and can be reliably detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in most cases. However, cryptic and complex chromosomal rearrangements may pose a technical challenge for accurate diagnosis. Herein, we describe two patients with suspected mantle cell lymphoma that lacked obvious CCND1 rearrangements by FISH studies. A next generation sequencing (NGS) based assay, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), was utilized in each case to investigate potential cryptic CCND1 rearrangements and revealed cryptic insertional events resulting in CCND1/IGH and CCND1/IGK rearrangements. These cases demonstrate that NGS-based assays, including MPseq, are a powerful approach to identify cryptic rearrangements of clinical importance that are not detected by current clinical genomics evaluation.","Polonis, Katarzyna; Schultz, Matthew J; Olteanu, Horatiu; Smadbeck, James B; Johnson, Sarah H; Vasmatzis, George; Xu, Xinjie; Greipp, Patricia T; Ketterling, Rhett P; Hoppman, Nicole L; Baughn, Linda B; Peterson, Jess F",Ann Diagn Pathol,,147
486120,Response to Alpert and Taioli,2021,"Mixed reality is advancing exponentially in some innovative industries, includingmanufacturing and aerospace. However, advanced applications of these technologies in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) businesses remain nascent. While it is in demand, the use of these technologies in developing the AEC digital pedagogy and for improving professional competence have received little attention. This paper presents a set of five novel digital technologies utilising virtual and augmented reality and digital twin, which adds value to the literature by showing their usefulness in the delivery of construction courses. The project involved designing, developing, and implementing a construction augmented reality (AR), including Piling AR (PAR) and a virtual tunnel boring machine (VTBM) module. The PAR is a smartphone module that presents different elements of a building structure, the footing system, and required equipment for footing construction. VTBM is developed as a multiplayer and avatar-included module for experiencing mechanisms of a tunnel boring machine. The novelty of this project is that it developed innovative immersive construction modules, practices of implementing digital pedagogy, and presenting the capacity of virtual technologies for education. This paper is also highly valuable to educators since it shows how a set of simple to complex technologies can be used for teaching various courses from a distance, either in emergencies such as corona virus disease (COVID-19) or as a part of regular teaching. This paper is a step forward to designing future practices full of virtual education appropriate to the new generation of digitally savvy students.","Sepasgozar, Samad M.E.",Appl. Sci.,,147

Keeping Coronavirus Out When a Doctor Comes Home,2020,"The extent and duration of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical outstanding questions about the epidemiology of this novel virus, and studies are needed to evaluate the effects of serostatus on reinfection. Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods to alleviate biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing whether seropositivity confers protection against future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","Kahn, Rebecca; Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Grad, Yonatan H; Robins, James M; Lipsitch, Marc",Am. j. epidemiol,,147
487926,Simplifying LR-HSQC spectra using a triple-quantum filter: The LR-HTQC experiment,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has a high spreading rate and a high fatality rate. To control the rapid spreading of COVID-19 virus, Chinese government ordered lockdown policies since late January 2020. The aims of this study are to quantify the relationship between geographic information (i.e., latitude, longitude and altitude) and cumulative infected population, and to unveil the importance of the population density in the spreading speed during the lockdown. COVID-19 data during the period from December 8, 2019 to April 8, 2020 were collected before and after lockdown. After discovering two important geographic factors (i.e., latitude and altitude) by estimating the correlation coefficients between each of them and cumulative infected population, two linear models of cumulative infected population and COVID-19 spreading speed were constructed based on these two factors. Overall, our findings from the models showed a negative correlation between the provincial daily cumulative COVID-19 infected number and latitude/altitude. In addition, population density is not an important factor in COVID-19 spreading under strict lockdown policies. Our study suggests that lockdown policies of China can effectively restrict COVID-19 spreading speed.","Sun, Zhibin; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Yifei; Wan, Hua; Wang, Yixiang",Sci Total Environ,,147

488427,"The Complex Roadmap to Infectious Disease Innovation: The Intersection of Bugs, Drugs, and Special Populations",2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide. The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiviral, prosurvival, and antiaging effects. In light of the research advances on H2S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19. It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19.","Yang, Guangdong",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,,147

490121,Cancer Immunotherapies Helped Shape COVID Vaccines,2020,"Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the world stock markets have suffered huge losses prompting investors to limit or avoid these losses. The stock market was one of the businesses that were affected the most. At the same time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have already been used for the prediction of the closing prices in stock markets. However, standalone ANN has several limitations, resulting in the lower accuracy of the prediction results. Such limitation is resolved using hybrid models. Therefore, a combination of artificial intelligence networks and particle swarm optimization for efficient stock market prediction was reported in the literature. This method predicted the closing prices of the shares traded on the stock market, allowing for the largest profit with the minimum risk. Nevertheless, the results were not that satisfactory. In order to achieve prediction with a high degree of accuracy in a short time, a new improved method called PSOCoG has been proposed in this paper. To design the neural network to minimize processing time and search time and maximize the accuracy of prediction, it is necessary to identify hyperparameter values with precision. PSOCoG has been employed to select the best hyperparameters in order to construct the best neural network. The created network was able to predict the closing price with high accuracy, and the proposed model ANN-PSOCoG showed that it could predict closing price values with an infinitesimal error, outperforming existing models in terms of error ratio and processing time. Using S&P 500 dataset, ANN-PSOCoG outperformed ANN-SPSO in terms of prediction accuracy by approximately 13%, SPSOCOG by approximately 17%, SPSO by approximately 20%, and ANN by approximately 25%. While using DJIA dataset, ANN-PSOCoG outperformed ANN-SPSO in terms of prediction accuracy by approximately 18%, SPSOCOG by approximately 24%, SPSO by approximately 33%, and ANN by approximately 42%. Besides, the proposed model is evaluated under the effect of COVID-19. The results proved the ability of the proposed model to predict the closing price with high accuracy where the values of MAPE, MAE, and RE were very small for S&P 500, GOLD, NASDAQ-100, and CANUSD datasets. © 2021 Razan Jamous et al.","Jamous, R.; Alrahhal, H.; El-Darieby, M.",Scientific Programming,,147

During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple societies issued caution statements because of the unknown effect of corticosteroids on the patient's immune system. The purpose is to determine if image-guided corticosteroid injections administered during the COVID-19 lockdown phase were associated with a higher infection rate compared to the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, patients undergoing image-guided corticosteroid injections for pain management during the lockdown phase between April 15 and May 22, 2020, were enrolled. One month after the injection, patients were surveyed by telephone for any COVID-19-related symptoms, and the electronic medical record (EMR) was reviewed for symptoms and test results. RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects were recruited, 31 (44%) females, 40 (56%) males, ages 58 ± 17 (20-92) years. Follow-up was available in 66 (93%) of subjects, 60 (91%) by phone survey and EMR, 6 (9%) by EMR only, 45 ± 22 (19-83) days after injection. One (1/66, 1.52%; 95% CI 0.04-8.2%) 25-year-old male subject developed symptomatic infection 19 days after a tibiotalar injection.

Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. METHODS: We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals' psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. LIMITATIONS: The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain social groups are at a higher risk of distress than others.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",J Affect Disord,,147

This pandemic has transformed the way in which Perinatal Psychiatric services are delivered in the United Kingdom and countries across the globe acting as a catalyst for innovation.MethodThe databases searched for peer reviewed literature written since December 2019 were: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PUBMED. Search strategy key words were: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, perinatal psychiatry and maternal mental health. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was utilised. Data were collated and summarized thematically.Result42 studies met the inclusion criteria. The aforementioned studies included data from over 60,000 women from the following countries: China, Italy, Netherlands, United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, India, Spain, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, Iran, Japan and Nepal. Literature clearly indicates that during the pandemic there was an increase in depression and anxiety. Risk factors included: financial insecurity, disrupted antenatal care, isolation, poor physical health and domestic violence. Evidence also suggested COVID-19 stressors impacted feeding practices and infant development as cytokines pass from mother to baby.Perinatal Psychiatry services have adopted social media apps to provide antenatal information, teleconsultations, smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs and increased utilisation of screening tools such as the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale.ConclusionWhilst this review features literature centred on women from across the globe African women are underrepresented. This should be addressed in future studies. This review shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted maternal mental health and acted as a catalyst for innovation. It is essential that efforts are made to support women during pregnancy and the perinatal period now more than ever.","Adeyemi, Stephanie",BJPsych Open,,147

494098,Haemopoietic cell transplantation in patients living with HIV,2020,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.","Paltiel, A David; Zheng, Amy; Walensky, Rochelle P",JAMA Netw Open,,147
494687,Hypoxia-stimulated tumor therapy associated with the inhibition of cancer cell stemness,2020,"A simple, common-sense, three-component procedure-the Carrier Separation Plan (CSP)-can immediately halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a comparable pathogen, allow the safe reopening of an entire economy without the need for social distancing, and quickly eradicate the pathogen from the population (assuming the pathogen can be killed by the immune systems of the carriers). The three components are (a) nearly simultaneous self-testing for the pathogen by an entire population, followed rapidly by (b) nearly simultaneous self-isolation of carriers, and (c) secondary screening at entrances to facilities where people congregate. After a period of preparation lasting roughly 5-10 weeks, these steps could and probably should be taken in a single day. The power of this methodology has already been demonstrated in varying degrees with groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 11 million. Although this plan might seem daunting, its costs are minimal compared to the losses we have incurred by relying on half measures, and the US and other countries have the technological, logistical, and industrial capacities to implement this plan in a matter of weeks. With proper messaging during the weeks leading up to the testing, compliance in such a program is likely to be high given the potential benefits, and because participation is voluntary and testing is noninvasive, the legal and ethical issues associated with such a program are minimal - trivial, in fact, compared to those associated with imposing a months-long lockdown on an entire population. A SIRD/CSP model suggests that the single-day testing and separation procedure will substantially lower the number of infections, even if compliance with the procedure is modest. Modeling also suggests that when long-term secondary screening is added to the 1-day procedure, over time, the pathogen is eradicated from the population. This can occur even when compliance with secondary screening is itself relatively low.","Epstein, Robert; Houser, Connan; Wang, Ruixiao",Front Public Health,,147

500897,Immune checkpoint analysis in lip cancer,2021,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to impact the lives of everyone and has influenced the functioning of all the sectors. In general, obesity tends to alter most of the physiological processes in the human body, including the immune system. Thus, it is important to get insights about the effect of obesity on the course of infection, so that morbidity and mortality can be minimized. An extensive search of all materials related to the topic was carried out in the PubMed search engine and World Health Organization website, and a total of 16 articles were selected based on the suitability with the current review objectives. Keywords used in the search include COVID-19 and obesity. It has been reported that obesity plays an important role in different aspects of the infection (viz., increased risk to acquire the infection or more chances to transmit the infection), management, and the worst clinical outcome. To conclude, obesity has to be acknowledged as one of the risk factors for compromising the pulmonary functions and thus should be considered as a high-risk group. In fact, as obesity is an independent risk factor to warrant hospitalization of the COVID-19 patients, it is essential that the medical team anticipates the challenges and manages the obese patients proactively and improves their clinical outcomes.","Shrivastava, S.

Patients with COVID-19 were also identified in Chongqing. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic characteristics of cluster cases and sporadic cases of COVID-19 in 141 patients in the main district of Chongqing during one month, between January and February 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study included 141 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The patients were divided into cluster cases (n=90) and sporadic cases (n=51). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study groups and included the presence of comorbidities, the presenting symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings, and laboratory findings. RESULTS The mean age of the 141 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was 47.3 years, and the most common presenting symptom was a persistent cough (48.9%). The 90 cluster cases (63.8%) were older than the sporadic cases, and cross-infection from family gathering occurred in 82.2%, and cough was more common than fever, and there was an increased prevalence of asymptomatic, mild, and moderate cases. Cluster cases showed fewer typical manifestations of COVID-19 on chest CT. However, the laboratory findings between the cluster and sporadic cases showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS There were demographic and clinical differences between cluster cases and sporadic cases of COVID-19 in the main district of Chongqing during the month between January to February 2020.","Chen, Peng; Zhang, Ying; Wen, Yongsheng; Guo, Jinjun; Bai, Weizhi; Jia, Jinwei; Ma, Yu; Xu, Yi",Med Sci Monit,,147

The etiopathogenesis is speculatively linked to an unidentified viral trigger on the background of genetic predisposition culminating in an acquired type I interferonopathy. The clinical phenotype is highly varied in different ethnicities, with new clinical features having been recently described, expanding the spectrum of cases that should raise the suspicion of anti-MDA-5 DM. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is frequently missed despite excessive mortality, calling for wider awareness of suspect symptoms.

However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM). METHODS: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (&#967;23=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (&#967;23=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR]United States 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; ORMexico 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; ORHong Kong 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; ORTaiwan 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (ORUnited States 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; ORMexico 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; ORHong Kong 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; ORTaiwan 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing. Policies that address relevant health beliefs can facilitate adoption of necessary actions for preventing COVID-19. Our findings may be explained by the timing of government policies, the number of cases reported in each country, individual beliefs, and cultural context.","Hsing, Julianna C; Ma, Jasmin; Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Jani, Shilpa G; Pulendran, Uma Palam; Lin, Bea-Jane; Thomas-Uribe, Monika; Wang, C Jason",J Med Internet Res,,147

To counteract this, actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders have been used termed as lockdown. This study aims to study lifestyle, behaviour, perception and practice of people regarding during the lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with structured questionnaire in Google forms after ethical approval from Nepal Health Research Council (Ref-2631). The attributes of knowledge, attitude and practices were explored using multiple-choice questions and results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-five respondents completed the survey with 280 (50.5%) males and 275 (49.5%) female. The knowledge regarding viral pandemic was increased in 496 (89.3%) respondents. 424 (76.4%) people developed stress due to pandemic. Three hundred fifty three (63.6%) were adversely affected by professional works or suffered economic loss in business. More than 42% participants are using their time for study in personal development, online classes etc. Conclusions: The knowledge of viral pandemic as well as personal hygiene habits have improved in majority of people but many also developed stress. They were convinced that lockdown lowered transmission of infection which in turn affected lifestyle behaviour and practices. Practicing social distancing becomes too difficult for the poor in the absence of proper social security system and government support. E-Learning has become more acceptable due to lockdown. Further studies with in-person interviews are warranted.","Kandel, Samikshya; Lamsal, Mahesh; Yadav, Saroj Adhikari; Bhandari, Dipak; Adhikari, Ganesh; Poudel, Sagar; Sharma, Pawan; Gautam, Swotantra",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,,147

Such a model could be a precursor to implementing smart lockdowns and vaccine distribution strategies. METHODS: The training cohort comprised 2337 COVID-19 inpatients from nine hospitals in The Netherlands. The clinical outcome was death within 21 days of being discharged. The features were derived from electronic health records collected during admission. Three feature selection methods were used: LASSO, univariate using a novel metric, and pairwise (age being half of each pair). 478 patients from Belgium were used to test the model. All modeling attempts were compared against an age-only model. RESULTS: In the training cohort, the mortality group's median age was 77 years (interquartile range = 70-83), higher than the non-mortality group (median = 65, IQR = 55-75). The incidence of former/active smokers, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic cardiac disease, chronic neurological disease, and chronic kidney disease was higher in the mortality group. All stated differences were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. LASSO selected eight features, novel univariate chose five, and pairwise chose none. No model was able to surpass an age-only model in the external validation set, where age had an AUC of 0.85 and a balanced accuracy of 0.77. CONCLUSION: When applied to an external validation set, we found that an age-only mortality model outperformed all modeling attempts (curated on www.covid19risk.ai) using three feature selection methods on 22 demographic and comorbid features.","Chatterjee, Avishek; Wu, Guangyao; Primakov, Sergey; Oberije, Cary; Woodruff, Henry; Kubben, Pieter; Henry, Ronald; Aries, Marcel J H; Beudel, Martijn; Noordzij, Peter G; Dormans, Tom; Gritters van den Oever, Niels C; van den Bergh, Joop P; Wyers, Caroline E; Simsek, Suat; Douma, Renée; Reidinga, Auke C; de Kruif, Martijn D; Guiot, Julien; Frix, Anne-Noelle; Louis, Renaud; Moutschen, Michel; Lovinfosse, Pierre; Lambin, Philippe",PLoS One,,147

517065,How should schools respond to the novel coronavirus?,2020,"Increasing evidence indicates that superspreading plays a dominant role in COVID-19 transmission. Recent estimates suggest that the dispersion parameter k for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is on the order of 0.1, which corresponds to about 10% of cases being the source of 80% of infections. To investigate how overdispersion might affect the outcome of various mitigation strategies, we developed an agent-based model with a social network that allows transmission through contact in three sectors: ""close"" (a small, unchanging group of mutual contacts as might be found in a household), ""regular"" (a larger, unchanging group as might be found in a workplace or school), and ""random"" (drawn from the entire model population and not repeated regularly). We assigned individual infectivity from a gamma distribution with dispersion parameter k We found that when k was low (i.e., greater heterogeneity, more superspreading events), reducing random sector contacts had a far greater impact on the epidemic trajectory than did reducing regular contacts; when k was high (i.e., less heterogeneity, no superspreading events), that difference disappeared. These results suggest that overdispersion of COVID-19 transmission gives the virus an Achilles' heel: Reducing contacts between people who do not regularly meet would substantially reduce the pandemic, while reducing repeated contacts in defined social groups would be less effective.","Sneppen, Kim; Nielsen, Bjarke Frost; Taylor, Robert J; Simonsen, Lone",Proc.

We aimed to reveal the general health status of the pediatric asthmatic patients during the pandemic, considering the role of household factors in parental attitudes. METHODS: We asked 60 asthmatic patients and their parents to respond to a questionnaire, aiming to reveal the current health status of the patients and the general approach of the family to the asthma management during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 8 patients had had an asthma attack during the outbreak, but there was no confirmed correlation with COVID-19 infection. Most of the parents had never considered to stop their children's current medications. However, the majority of them reported concerns about failure of the ambulatory care services and almost all saw their children as being at high risk for COVID-19 infection. There was no significant relationship between these concerns and their psychological statuses (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The crucial point of asthma management is to keep down both patients' medical and psychological status that may lead to minimize the effects of the pandemic. Healthcare professionals should also pay attention to household members of the patients that their adaptation period to 'new normal'of pandemic may directly effect the patients state of health.","Hepkaya, Evrim; Kilinc, Ayse Ayzit; Cebi, Memnune Nur; Koyuncu, Zehra; Cokugras, Haluk",Pediatr. int,,147

522192,"Trends & treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Delhi, India (2009-2014): A retrospective record-based study",2020,"Background: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) include a broad range of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders and are characterized by diffuse parenchymal lung abnormalities leading to irreversible fibrosis. ILDs are correlated with the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), which generally also results in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Interferons, secreted in larger amounts during viral infections, are an important possible risk factor contributing to this outcome. Aims: In this narrative review, the role of 10 different viral infections on the generation/development of ILDs and their outcomes are described in detail. The aim of this review is to determine the probable risk that COVID-19 and other viral infections pose in the post-infection development of ILDs, PF, and PH. Methods: Searches in PubMed (Medline), Google Scholar, Web of Science (ISI, Researcher ID, Publons), ResearchGate, Scopus, and secondary sources yielded 134 studies. After exclusion criteria, 92 studies containing the terms ""Coronavirus"" (COVID-19), ""Interstitial Lung Diseases,"" ""Pulmonary Fibrosis,"" ""Pulmonary Hypertension"" and ""viral infections"" were selected for inclusion. Selected articles were read with a focus on the roles of the 10 commonly studied viral infections on generation/intensification of ILDs and classified according to their dominant effect on the respiratory system, with a focus on each infection's effects on parenchyma of the lungs and generation and/or intensification of ILDs. Results: This review found that ILDs, PF, and PH can occur after a COVID-19 viral infection. Similar results are also seen in post-infection cases of other viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus-8, adenovirus, Hepatitis C, Torque-Teno (Transfusion-Transmitted) Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Conclusion: Results of current studies show probable possibility for generation and/or intensification of ILDs in COVID-19 infected patients like other studied viruses. Studies on determination of the actual prevalence of ILD, PF and PH in post-COVID-19 infected patients, follow-up studies on the prevention of ILDs in recovered COVID-19 patients, and meta-analyzed studies on pulmonary outcomes of pandemic corona viruses are strongly recommended as topics for future studies.","Atabati, Elham; Dehghani-Samani, Amir; Mortazavimoghaddam, Sayyed Gholamreza",Can J Respir Ther,,147

Extending the theory of organizational learning, we propose the quadruple-loop learning model, through which we examine how a government can find solutions to a wicked policy problem like COVID-19. The quadruple-loop learning model is applied to explain how the Korean government could effectively tame COVID-19 in the initial stage through its agile as well as adaptive approach based on effective interactions of backstage (time, target, and context) and frontstage of policy processes mainly focusing on the initial stage until the highest alert level was announced. Based on the Korean case, this study also examines critical factors to effective learning organizations such as leadership, information and transparency, as well as citizen participation and governance.","Lee, Sabinne; Hwang, Changho; Moon, M.

In this study, we assessed the impact of changes in human activities on air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic by determining the relationships between air quality, traffic volume, and meteorological conditions. The megacities of Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou were selected as the study area, and the variation trends of air pollutants for the period January–May between 2016 and 2020 were analyzed. The passenger volume of public transportation (PVPT) and the passenger volume of taxis (PVT) along with data on precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and boundary layer height were used to identify and quantify the driving force of the air pollution variation. The results showed that the change rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), NO2, and SO2 before and during the lockdown in the four megacities ranged from -49.9% to 78.2% (average: -9.4% ± 59.3%), -55.4% to -32.3% (average: -43.0% ± 9.7%), and -21.1% to 11.9% (average: -10.9% ± 15.4%), respectively. The response of NO2 to the lockdown was the most sensitive, while the response of PM2.5 was smaller and more delayed. During the lockdown period, haze from uninterrupted industrial emissions and fireworks under the effect of air mass transport from surrounding areas and adverse climate conditions was probably the cause of abnormally high PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. In addition, the PVT was the most significant factor for NO2, and meteorology had a greater impact on PM2.5 than NO2 and SO2. There is a need for more national-level policies for limiting firework displays and traffic emissions, as well as further studies on the formation and transmission of secondary air pollutants.","Gao, Chanchan; Li, Shuhui; Liu, Min; Zhang, Fengying; Achal, V.; Tu, Yue; Zhang, Shiqing; Cai, Chaolin",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721006136?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721006136; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940731/,147

To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13(th), 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance ‘Lifeliner 1’ dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance ‘Lifeliner 1’ dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described. RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8–53). CONCLUSION: A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior. These findings highlight the importance of continued operability of the HEMS, even during pandemic circumstances. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective comparative study.","Rikken, Quinten G.

591392,Applied Magnetic Resonance Under Conditions of a Pandemic,2020-10-22,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat causing worldwide morbidity and mortality. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples, the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples. Here, we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions to achieve specific, rapid (30 min), and sensitive (<100 copies) fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples. When compared to RT-qPCR, positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98% (n = 41/42) concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87% (n = 59/68) concordance for the same samples. Importantly, the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR. We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WA1/2020), and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR. RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-qPCR including isothermal amplification, speed (<30 min), reduced costs, and similar sensitivity and specificity.","Jones, Les; Bakre, Abhijeet; Naikare, Hemant; Kolhe, Ravindra; Sanchez, Susan; Mosley, Yung-Yi C.; Tripp, Ralph A.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534259/,147
592247,Soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy for COVID-19,2021-03-01,"Background: The need for a fast and reliable test for COVID-19 is paramount in managing the current pandemic. A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","Osterdahl, Marc F; Lee, Karla A; Ni Lochlainn, Mary; Wilson, Stuart; Douthwaite, Sam; Horsfall, Rachel; Sheedy, Alyce; Goldenberg, Simon D; Stanley, Christoper J; Spector, Tim D; Steves, Claire",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047357,147

Description Nous avons conduit une étude de cohorte observationnelle dans 4 services de réanimation du CHU de Bordeaux du 3 mars au 14 avril 2020. Tous les patients diagnostiqués positifs au COVID-19 et présentant des signes de gravité respiratoire (besoin de ≥4 L/min d’oxygène pour maintenir une SpO2 ≥94 %) ont été inclus. Méthodes L’IRA était définie selon les critères KDIGO (créatinine+diurèse). Une analyse urinaire systématique (incluant ionogramme urinaire, protéinurie et recherche de glycosurie, leucocyturie et hématurie) a été réalisée le jour de l’apparition de l’IRA. Une IRA transitoire a été définie comme un retour à la créatininémie basale ou une baisse de plus de 50 % de la créatininémie dans les 72heures après le diagnostic d’IRA. Résultats Trois cent quatre-vingt patients positifs au COVID-19 ont été admis au CHU de Bordeaux. Parmi eux, 45 (12 %) ont été admis en réanimation auxquels s’ajoutent 26 patients transférés d’autres régions de France. Sur les 71 patients inclus, une IRA a été diagnostiquée chez 57 (80 %) dont 20/57 patients avec une IRA stade 1, 20/57 stade 2 et 17/57 stade 3. Le suivi médian était de 17 [12–23] jours.

Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, but relatively little is understood regarding host intrinsic mechanisms that guard against ZIKV. Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.","Yang, Darong; Li, Nan L.; Wei, Dahai; Liu, Baoming; Guo, Fang; Elbahesh, Husni; Zhang, Yunzhi; Zhou, Zhi; Chen, Guo-Yun; Li, Kui",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251739/,147

(*),2020-07-03,"PURPOSE: Research is beginning to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Our paper addresses a lack of in-depth qualitative research exploring their experiences and perceptions of how life has changed at this time. METHODS: We used qualitative interviews (N = 49) to explore experiences of the pandemic for people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In a participatory, coproduced approach, researchers with lived experiences of mental health conditions conducted interviews and analysed data as part of a multi-disciplinary research team. RESULTS: Existing mental health difficulties were exacerbated for many people. People experienced specific psychological impacts of the pandemic, struggles with social connectedness, and inadequate access to mental health services, while some found new ways to cope and connect to the community. New remote ways to access mental health care, including digital solutions, provided continuity of care for some but presented substantial barriers for others. People from black and ethnic minority (BAME) communities experienced heightened anxiety, stigma and racism associated with the pandemic, further impacting their mental health. CONCLUSION: There is a need for evidence-based solutions to achieve accessible and effective mental health care in response to the pandemic, especially remote approaches to care. Further research should explore the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on people with pre-existing mental health conditions.

The current research aims at the improvements of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. This research has been done using both the open source data sets taken from satellite and ground based for better analysis. For the satellite-based analysis, the Sentinel 5 Precauser’s Tropospheric NO(2) from the European Space Agency and for the ground-based numeric data sets from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been used. During the COVID-19 disease, outbreak the world has set in quarantine and as an overcome air quality improved in Asian countries after national lockdown, the average NO(2) rates plummeted calculated by 40–50%. Similarly, it dramatically decreased in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. The basic statistical patterns of the NO(2) concentration spectrum of historical data sets (2018–2020) bi-weekly showed during October to March were seen higher in each year.

Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. PURPOSE: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. RESULTS: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. KEY POINTS: • Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. • The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Salehi, Sana; Abedi, Aidin; Balakrishnan, Sudheer; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06863-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346790/,147

Our organization implemented an Incident Command System (ICS), based on previous experience, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in a comprehensive and effective manner. This well-known management and response framework is used by many specialties and organizations in disasters of different complexity and size. Our ICS was able to assemble the appropriate people, assess the situation, and develop and implement plans to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. The effectiveness of the ICS structure and its execution was instrumental in getting in front of the virus and managing regional activities. The ICS is an effective tool to improve safety and mitigate risk when dealing with large-scale disasters and should be implemented and practiced before the need arises.

At the pandemic's start, the federal government was in the process of tightening the ""public charge"" rule by adding nutrition and health benefits to the cash benefits that, if drawn, could subject immigrants to sanctions (for example, green card denial). Census Bureau data indicate that immigrants accounted for 13.6 percent of the population but 17.8 percent of essential workers in 2019. About 20.0 million immigrants held essential jobs, and more than one-third of these immigrants resided in US states bordering Mexico. Nationwide, 12.3 million essential workers and 18.9 million of their household members were at risk because of the new sanctions. The rule change (which was subsequently revoked) likely caused 2.1 million essential workers and household members to forgo Medicaid and 1.3 million to forgo Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program assistance on the eve of the pandemic, highlighting the potential of immigration policy changes to exacerbate health risks.","Touw, Sharon; McCormack, Grace; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie; Zallman, Leah",Health Aff (Millwood),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228520/; https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00059,147

The assumption is the shift from infectious diseases (IDs) to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Some authors argue that this theory failed to describe epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa. We considered the case of Mozambique, where is occurring a rapid demographic change, with dramatic growth of the population. According to the data, we concluded that NCDs are increasing in Mozambique, but due to the vast predominance of IDs, a double burden of disease model is more accurate to describe the actual epidemiological context of the country. Consequently, health funding focusing on IDs should take into account the concomitant epidemiological scenario and try to encompass other health challenges.","Ciccacci, Fausto; Orlando, Stefano; Majid, Noorjehan; Marazzi, Cristina",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.37.49.23310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209176/,147
597569,Cost-utility of talazoparib monotherapy treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in Spain,2021-04-16,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 outbreak has forced a 2-month lockdown (LD) in Spain. We aimed to assess how that had affected our cohort of bariatric patients waiting for surgery. METHODS: A review of electronic records and a structured phone interview with each patient were conducted. Changes in severity of obesity were analyzed using the Obesity Surgery Score (OSS) and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the validated EQ-5D questionnaire. Other miscellaneous questions about behavior modifications and surgical risk perception were also analyzed. RESULTS: All 51 patients fully answered the questionnaires. Mean age was 47 years and mean time on waiting list 91 days. Mean BMI increased during LD (42.7 vs 43.2; p < 0.001). Both OSS (2.84 vs 3; p = 0.011) and EQ-5D (69 vs 64; p < 0.001) mildly worsened during LD, mainly due to psychosocial issues. Twenty-seven patients (53%) thought that perioperative risks were higher under the current circumstances but they were as willing to undergo surgery as those who believed that the risks had not increased (74% vs 87%, p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 LD had a significant but mild effect on our cohort of bariatric surgery waiting list patients. Although perioperative risk perception had increased, patients were still willing to undergo their planned surgeries.","Beisani, Marc; Vilallonga, Ramon; Petrola, Carlos; Acosta, Asunción; Casimiro Pérez, José Antonio; García Ruiz de Gordejuela, Amador; Fernández Quesada, Carlos; Gonzalez, Oscar; Cirera de Tudela, Arturo; Caubet, Enric; Armengol, Manel; Fort, José Manuel",Langenbecks Arch Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244718/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-02040-5,147
597633,Community geography for precarious researchers: examining the intricacies of mutually beneficial and co-produced knowledge,2021-01-26,"The 2019 global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Based on statistics from 10 August 2020, more than 20.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported resulting in more than 738,000 deaths. This completely new coronavirus has spread worldwide in a short period, causing economic crises and healthcare system failures worldwide. Initially, it was thought that the main health threat was associated with respiratory system failures, but since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to a broad spectrum of symptoms indicating neurological manifestations, including ischemic stroke. Current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and its complications is very limited because of its rapidly evolving character. However, further research is undoubtedly necessary to understand the causes of neurological abnormalities, including acute cerebrovascular disease. The viral infection is inextricably associated with the activation of the immune system and the release of pro-inflammatory factors, that can stimulate the host organism to defend itself. However, the body’s immune response is a double-edged sword that on one hand, destroys the virus but also disrupts the homeostasis leading to serious complications, including thrombosis. Numerous studies have linked coagulopathies with COVID-19, however, there is great uncertainty regarding it functions on the molecular level. In this review, a detailed insight into the biological processes associated with ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients and suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon is provided.","Szelenberger, Rafal; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Bijak, Michal",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825182/,147

In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30(th), 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality. The cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 illness is also an important component of mortality in other viral diseases, including SARS, MERS and influenza. In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.","Sun, Xinjuan; Wang, Tianyuan; Cai, Dayong; Hu, Zhiwei; Chen, Jin’an; Liao, Hui; Zhi, Liming; Wei, Hongxia; Zhang, Zhihong; Qiu, Yuying; Wang, Jing; Wang, Aiping",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610120300484?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610120300484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.002,147
597939,Metformin and Niclosamide Synergistically Suppress Wnt and YAP in APC-Mutated Colorectal Cancer,2021-07-09,"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of children are not able to perform age-appropriate fundamental movement skills (FMS). Thus, it is important to assess FMS so that children needing additional support can be identified in a timely fashion. There is great potential for universal screening of FMS in schools, but research has established that current assessment tools are not fit for purpose. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the psychometric properties of a FMS assessment tool designed specifically to meet the demands of universal screening in schools. METHODS: A working group consisting of academics from developmental psychology, public health and behavioural epidemiology developed an assessment tool (FUNMOVES) based on theory and prior evidence. Over three studies, 814 children aged 4 to 11 years were assessed in school using FUNMOVES. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate structural validity and modifications were then made to FUNMOVES activities after each study based on Rasch results and implementation fidelity. RESULTS: The initial Rasch analysis found numerous psychometric problems including multidimensionality, disordered thresholds, local dependency, and misfitting items. Study 2 showed a unidimensional measure, with acceptable internal consistency and no local dependency, but that did not fit the Rasch model. Performance on a jumping task was misfitting, and there were issues with disordered thresholds (for jumping, hopping and balance tasks). Study 3 revealed a unidimensional assessment tool with good fit to the Rasch model, and no further issues, once jumping and hopping scoring were modified. IMPLICATIONS: The finalised version of FUNMOVES (after three iterations) meets standards for accurate measurement, is free and able to assess a whole class in under an hour using resources available in schools. Thus FUNMOVES has the potential to allow schools to efficiently screen FMS to ensure that targeted support can be provided and disability barriers removed.","Eddy, Lucy H.; Preston, Nick; Mon-Williams, Mark; Bingham, Daniel D.; Atkinson, Jo M.

Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqRT-PCR) was used to identify 12 respiratory viruses. Two hundred and forty-three (97%) of the 251 viruses identified in the separate samples were also identified in the mixed samples. The sensitivity rate was identical at 100% for all virus groups except coronaviruses. This sensitivity rate clearly justifies the use of pooled samples instead of separate samples for clinical and epidemiological purposes. The reduction in costs attained from the use of pooled samples may represent a critical advantage when considering its use in extensive clinical and epidemiological studies.","Lieberman, D.; Lieberman, D.; Shimoni, A.; Keren-Naus, A.; Steinberg, R.; Shemer-Avni, Y.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-010-0903-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20221890/,147

It is unclear how those most directly experiencing economic impacts may seek assistance from disparate safety net programs. To identify self-reported economic hardship and enrollment in major safety net programs before and early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we compared individuals with COVID-19 related employment or earnings reduction with other individuals. We created a set of questions related to COVID-19 economic impact that was added to a cross-sectional, nationally representative online survey of American adults (age ≥18, English-speaking) in the AmeriSpeak panel fielded from April 23–27, 2020. All analyses were weighted to account for survey non-response and known oversampling probabilities. We calculated unadjusted bivariate differences, comparing people with and without COVID-19 employment and earnings reductions with other individuals. Our study looked primarily at awareness and enrollment in seven major safety net programs before and since the pandemic (Medicaid, health insurance marketplaces/exchanges, unemployment insurance, food pantries/free meals, housing/renters assistance, SNAP, and TANF). Overall, 28.1% of all individuals experienced an employment reduction (job loss or reduced earnings). Prior to the pandemic, 39.0% of the sample was enrolled in ≥1 safety net program, and 50.0% of individuals who subsequently experienced COVID-19 employment reduction were enrolled in at least one safety net program. Those who experienced COVID-19 employment reduction versus those who did not were significantly more likely to have applied or enrolled in ≥1 program (45.9% versus 11.7%, p<0.001) and also significantly more likely to specifically have enrolled in unemployment insurance (29.4% versus 5.4%, p < .001) and SNAP (16.8% versus 2.8%, p = 0.028).

In order to maintain good care under necessary contact restrictions, especially in the outpatient sector, the use of telemedical applications was demanded and promoted. The exploratory survey among members of the Association of German Allergists (AeDA) was intended to show how these were received among allergists in private practice. METHODS: The survey was restricted to actively practising members of the AeDA who had previously given their consent to receive such surveys (n = 437). They were invited by email to participate in a survey on the topic of “Telemedicine in everyday clinical practice in allergology”. The survey included quantitative and qualitative questions on the use of telemedicine services before and during the pandemic and was conducted anonymously on the SoSci Survey platform. Participation was possible in the period from June to August 2020. RESULTS: In all, 76 specialists with additional qualification in allergology took part in the survey. Of these, 71 completed the full questionnaire. Before the start of the pandemic-related contact restrictions, 46.5% (33/71) stated that they had used telemedicine in their clinical practice. This number increased to 73.2% (52/71) after 31 January 2020. The largest increase (4.3% vs. 15.6%) was seen in the area of video consultations. Furthermore, 43/76 participants can imagine integrating telemedicine services into their daily clinical routine in the future. CONCLUSION: The use of telemedical services, especially video consultations, increased significantly during the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic in Germany. The majority of respondents perceive the implementation as positive and can imagine continuing to use telemedical methods after the end of the pandemic.","Dramburg, Stephanie; Matricardi, Paolo Maria; Casper, Ingrid; Klimek, Ludger",Allergo J Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40629-021-00175-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150465/,147

As opioid use rises, so too does the number of people who suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose-related deaths. As science and medicine progresses, new medications and therapies have arisen in order to help treat patients suffering from addiction. Treatment can be split into two main domains: pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Buprenorphine and methadone, currently the most prescribed medications for patients suffering from OUD, have been shown to be extremely effective in clinical trials but have significant real-world limitations. Geographical disparities between various locations, physician stigma with prescribing these medications, and training required to prescribe medication can make access to these treatments difficult for patients. Non-pharmacological interventions have also been shown to help with limited efficacy when combined with pharmacological interventions. However, the time and resources required to implement these strategies may be a difficult barrier to overcome. In this review, we assess pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological treatments, examine barriers to treatment for patients, and propose solutions to bypass these barriers.","Patel, Karan; Bunachita, Sean; Agarwal, Ank A; Lyon, Aaron; Patel, Urvish K",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717718/,147

Specifically, the presence of persistent symptoms after apparent resolution from COVID-19 have frequently been reported throughout the pandemic by individuals labeled as “long-haulers”. The purpose of this study was to assess for symptoms at days 0–10 and 61+ among subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The University of California COvid Research Data Set (UC CORDS) was used to identify 1407 records that met inclusion criteria. Symptoms attributable to COVID-19 were extracted from the electronic health record. Symptoms reported over the previous year prior to COVID-19 were excluded, using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) followed by graph lasso to assess relationships between symptoms. A model was developed predictive for becoming a long-hauler based on symptoms. 27% reported persistent symptoms after 60 days. Women were more likely to become long-haulers, and all age groups were represented with those aged 50 ± 20 years comprising 72% of cases. Presenting symptoms included palpitations, chronic rhinitis, dysgeusia, chills, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, anxiety, sore throat, and headache among others. We identified 5 symptom clusters at day 61+: chest pain-cough, dyspnea-cough, anxiety-tachycardia, abdominal pain-nausea, and low back pain-joint pain. Long-haulers represent a very significant public health concern, and there are no guidelines to address their diagnosis and management.

However, few studies have examined commonly posted grief photos. The purpose of the present study was to examine such pictures, as well as the motivations and reactions of those who posted them, among Italians and Americans. Surveys were sent to both Italian and US participants. The US group yielded 262 responses (mean age = 22 years; 81% female), and the Italian group yielded 51 (mean age = 32 years; 82% female). Several key issues emerged, such as the need for social media users to receive empathic support from other users, the desire to maintain continuing bonds, the wish to remember the deceased, and the desire to share beauty and symbolic pictures. The images were analyzed using content analysis. Both samples posted photos to remember, and to enhance their posts. A strong preference for pictures with a positive emotional connotation appeared, depicting the deceased in a conjoint appearance with the participant.

The objective of this paper is to examine how “tacit knowledge” – implicit knowledge used to guide everyday practice – is employed in professional relationships and communication processes between public health and acute care settings. A qualitative study design was used to explore the experiences of key informants from public health and acute care settings in Ontario, Canada, to examine how specific dimensions of tacit knowledge are employed in communications about EPHIs. Twenty-six in-depth interviews were conducted from 2014 to 2015. The results describe the way in which participants employ discretion and knowledge of local context, and rely on relationships built on trust and credibility, to facilitate decision-making and communication during EPHIs. Given the uncertainty characterizing most EPHIs, communicators rely a great deal on their informal knowledge and networks which allow them to remain flexible and respond quickly to changing situations. The results reveal that communication about public health guidance during emergencies is a complex and active process that draws from past experiences of the individuals involved, and is shaped by the requirements of local circumstances. The broader implications of these findings for building resilient and responsive health systems are considered. In particular, for rethinking the authority of standardized forms of evidence in public health decision-making, and the importance of knowledge which is grounded in the uniqueness of specific local contexts.","Sanford, S.; Schwartz, B.; Khan, Y.",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420919314840; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919314840?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834974/,147

The continued characterization of the nsps of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus has not only corroborated several important functional predictions, but also revealed various novel features of arteriviral replication. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), based on bioinformatics predictions and experimental studies, a processing map for the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins has been developed. Crystal structures have been resolved for two of the PRRSV nonstructural proteins that possess proteinase activity (nsp1α and nsp4). The functional characterization of the key enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis, the nsp9 RNA polymerase and nsp10 helicase, has been initiated. In addition, progress has been made on nsp functions relating to the regulation of subgenomic mRNAs synthesis (nsp1), the induction of replication-associated membrane rearrangements (nsp2 and nsp3), and an intriguing replicative endoribonuclease (nsp11) for which the natural substrate remains to be identified. The role of nsps in viral pathogenesis and host immunity is also being explored, and specific nsps (including nsp1α/β, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp11) have been implicated in the modulation of host immune responses to PRRSV infection. The nsp3–8 region was identified as containing major virulence factors, although mechanistic information is scarce. The biological significance of PRRSV nsps in virus-host interactions and the technical advancements in engineering the PRRSV genome by reverse genetics are also reflected in recent developments in the area of vaccines and diagnostic assays.","Fang, Ying; Snijder, Eric J.",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.07.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696193/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002765,147

Interestingly, while the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are higher in males than in females, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this review, we explore sex-related differences that may be contributing factors to the observed male-biased mortality from COVID-19. Males are considered the weaker sex in aspects related to endurance and infection control. Studies show that viral RNA clearance is delayed in males with COVID-19. A recent study has indicated that the testis can harbor coronavirus, and consequently, males show delayed viral clearance. However, the role of testis involvement in COVID-19 severity and mortality needs further research. Males and females show a distinct difference in immune system responses with females eliciting stronger immune responses to pathogens. This difference in immune system responses may be a major contributing factor to viral load, disease severity, and mortality. In addition, differences in sex hormone milieus could also be a determinant of viral infections as estrogen has immunoenhancing effects while testosterone has immunosuppressive effects. The sex-specific severity of COVID-19 infections indicates that further research on understanding the sex differences is needed. Inclusion of both males and females in basic research and clinical trials is required to provide critical information on sex-related differences that may help to better understand disease outcome and therapy.","Pradhan, Ajay; Olsson, Per-Erik",Biol Sex Differ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-020-00330-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948238/,147
606666,Tuberculosis-associated Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Case Report,2018-08-14,"SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a global pandemic with large variation in COVID-19 disease spectrum. SARS-CoV-2 infection requires host receptor ACE2 on lung epithelium, but epithelial underpinnings of variation are largely unknown. We capitalized on comprehensive organoid assays to report remarkable variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of lung organoids from different subjects. Tropism is highest for TUBA− and MUC5AC-positive organoid cells, but levels of TUBA−, MUC5A−, or ACE2− positive cells do not predict infection rate. We identify surface molecule Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as novel mediator of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is not downregulated by this specific virus. TSPAN8 levels, prior to infection, strongly correlate with infection rate and TSPAN8-blocking antibodies diminish SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose TSPAN8 as novel functional biomarker and potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Hysenaj, Lisiena; Little, Samantha; Kulhanek, Kayla; Gbenedio, Oghenekevwe M.; Rodriguez, Lauren; Shen, Alan; Lone, Jean-Christophe; Lupin-Jimenez, Leonard C.; Bonser, Luke R.; Serwas, Nina K.; Bahl, Kriti; Mick, Eran; Li, Jack Z.; Ding, Vivianne W.; Matsumoto, Shotaro; Maishan, Mazharul; Simoneau, Camille; Fragiadakis, Gabriela; Jablons, David M.; Langelier, Charles R.; Matthay, Michael; Ott, Melanie; Krummel, Matthew; Combes, Alexis J.; Sil, Anita; Erle, David J.; Kratz, Johannes R.; Roose, Jeroen P.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34100012/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.446640,147
607045,Mapping time use in clinical trials for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases,2021,"Background: Research ethics committees are comprised of policymakers, supervisors, and decision-makers and aim at increasing adherence to professional ethics standards in conducting health-related research. The existential philosophy of these committees is to preserve the patients’ health, maintain and promote public trust in health care providers, protect the rights of both patients and health care providers, and promote organizational ethics. However, this task can be complex and challenging during a public health emergency. Research ethics committees set the standard of research in the emergency situations through defining which research has the potential to promote the quality of response to a public health emergency. Methods: This study aims at collecting and classifying the valuable experiences of the research ethics committee members and reviewers during the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran University of Medical Sciences, one of the major universities in Tehran. It provides a basic understanding of the key concepts and challenges in reviewing and approving research by research ethics committees and the recommendations to overcome these challenging issues. Results: To accelerate the review process of COVID-19 research proposals, the scientific, methodological and ethical review panel was integrated as a large committee called ‘IUMS Corona Research Team’. The first meeting was held on March 7, two weeks after the official announcement of the first case of the disease and is continued once a week. A total of 130 projects have been discussed and evaluated in this committee, among which 83 proposals were approved after modification. Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach supports a flexible and effective scientific and ethical review of research leading to more protection of research subjects as well as promotion in the treatment and management of the pandemic ahead.","Hashemi, Akram; Bahmani, Fatemeh; Saeedi Tehrani, Saeedeh; Forouzandeh, Mina; Koohpayehzadeh, Jalil; Ashrafi, Mortaza; Khalajzadeh, Majid Reza; Motevalian, Seyed Abbas",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://doi.org/10.34171/mjiri.34.87; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306052/,147

A range of child negative (e.g., conduct problems) and positive outcomes (e.g., routine maintenance) were examined, along with a set of parent-related variables, including resilience, perceived distress, emotional problems, parenting distress and specific parenting practices (e.g., structured or avoidant parenting), which were modeled through path analysis to better understand child adjustment. Data were collected in April 2020, with information for the present study provided by 940 (89.6%) mothers, 102 (9.7%) fathers and 7 (0.7%) different caregivers, who informed on 1049 Spanish children (50.4% girls) aged 3 to 12 years (M(age) = 7.29; SD = 2.39). The results suggested that, according to parents’ information, most children did not show important changes in behavior, although some increasing rates were observed for both negative and positive outcomes. Child adjustment was influenced by a chain of effects, derived from parents’ perceived distress and emotional response to the COVID-19 crisis, via parenting distress and specific parenting practices. While parenting distress in particular triggered child negative outcomes, specific parenting practices were more closely related to child positive outcomes. These findings may help to better inform, for potential future outbreaks, effective guidelines and prevention programs aimed at promoting the child’s well-being in the family.","Romero, Estrella; López-Romero, Laura; Domínguez-Álvarez, Beatriz; Villar, Paula; Gómez-Fraguela, Jose Antonio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987641/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17196975,147

However, little is known about normative levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in parents of school-age children. The present study reports on generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in 1570 parents and guardians of a nationally representative sample of children ages five to twelve years using two widely used and validated questionnaires: the eight-item variant of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). Moderate to severe levels of generalized anxiety symptoms were reported in 12.7% of the total sample and moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms were reported in 14.1% of the sample; 17.7% of the sample reported moderate to severe levels of either generalized anxiety or depressive symptoms. This percentage was higher for females, younger parents and guardians, and parents and guardians reporting lower household incomes. These data, collected online in early 2018, may be useful for researchers and clinicians studying and treating anxiety and depression in parents. Further, these data provide a baseline for researchers currently studying the impact of changes related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (e.g., school closures) on the mental health of parents of school-age children.","Sequeira, Stefanie L.; Morrow, Kayley E.; Silk, Jennifer S.; Kolko, David J.; Pilkonis, Paul A.; Lindhiem, Oliver",J Child Fam Stud,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-02026-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230796/,147

611598,"Faster Than the Speed of Light, More Powerful Than…",2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND: England’s COVID-19 response transitioned from a national lockdown to localised interventions. In response to rising cases, these were supplemented by national restrictions on contacts (the Rule of Six), then 10 pm closing for bars and restaurants, and encouragement to work from home. These were quickly followed by a 3-tier system applying different restrictions in different localities. As cases continued to rise, a second national lockdown was declared. We used a national survey to quantify the impact of these restrictions on epidemiologically relevant contacts. METHODS: We compared paired measures on setting-specific contacts before and after each restriction started and tested for differences using paired permutation tests on the mean change in contacts and the proportion of individuals decreasing their contacts. RESULTS: Following the imposition of each measure, individuals tended to report fewer contacts than they had before. However, the magnitude of the changes was relatively small and variable. For instance, although early closure of bars and restaurants appeared to have no measurable effect on contacts, the work from home directive reduced mean daily work contacts by 0.99 (95% confidence interval CI] 0.03–1.94), and the Rule of Six reduced non-work and school contacts by a mean of 0.25 (0.01–0.5) per day. Whilst Tier 3 appeared to also reduce non-work and school contacts, the evidence for an effect of the lesser restrictions (Tiers 1 and 2) was much weaker. There may also have been some evidence of saturation of effects, with those who were in Tier 1 (least restrictive) reducing their contacts markedly when they entered lockdown, which was not reflected in similar changes in those who were already under tighter restrictions (Tiers 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The imposition of various local and national measures in England during the summer and autumn of 2020 has gradually reduced contacts. However, these changes are smaller than the initial lockdown in March. This may partly be because many individuals were already starting from a lower number of contacts.

This study aimed to examine the expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in tumor tissues of six common cancer types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tumors and control samples were obtained from online databases. Survival prognosis and biological functions of these genes were investigated for each tumor type. RESULTS: There was the overexpression of ACE2 in colon and stomach adenocarcinomas compared to controls, meanwhile colon and prostate adenocarcinomas showed a significantly higher expression of TMPRSS2. Additionally, survival prognosis analysis has demonstrated that upregulation of ACE2 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with higher overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.65; p=0.016) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.66; p=0.007), while overexpression of TMPRSS2 was associated with a 26% reduced risk of death in lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.047) but 50% increased risk of death in breast invasive carcinoma (p=0.015).

In this context, it is vital to ensure acute stroke care and optimise the care processes of the stroke code to reduce the risk of contagion and rationalise the use of hospital resources. To do this, the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group proposes a series of recommendations. Methods Non-systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms “stroke” and “COVID-19” or “coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2”, as well as other already known for the authors. We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid Multidisciplinary Group and its Neurology Committee. Results Our recommendations are structured on five lines: (1) coordinate to guarantee the access to hospital care for stroke patients, (2) recognise potentially COVID-19 infected stroke patients, (3) organise to ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infections, (4) neuroimaging and other procedures potentially associated to risks for COVID-19 infection should be reduced and secured to avoid contagion, and (5) at home as soon as possible and supported follow-up to optimise hospital occupancy. The procedure is shown summarised under the acronym CORONA (COordinate, Recognise, Organise, Neuroimaging, At home).

Here, temporal evolution of the coronavirus literature over the last 30 years (N = 43,769) is analysed along with its subdomain of SARS-CoV-2 articles (N = 27,460) and the subdomain of reviews and meta-analytic studies (N = 1027). The analyses are conducted through the lenses of co-citation and bibliographic coupling of documents. (1) Of the N = 1204 review and meta-analytical articles of the coronavirus literature, nearly 88% have been published and indexed during the first 8 months of 2020, marking an unprecedented attention to reviews and meta-analyses in this domain, prompted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. (2) The subset of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 articles is bibliographically distant from the rest of this literature published prior to 2020. Individual articles of the SARS-CoV-2 segment with a bridging role between the two bodies of articles (i.e., before and after 2020) are identifiable. (3) Furthermore, the degree of bibliographic coupling within the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 cluster is much poorer compared to the cluster of articles published prior to 2020. This could, in part, be explained by the higher diversity of topics that are studied in relation to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the literature of coronaviruses published prior to the SARS-CoV-2 disease. (4) The analyses on the subset of SARS-CoV-2 literature identified studies published prior to 2020 that have now proven highly instrumental in the development of various clusters of publications linked to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the so-called “sleeping beauties” of the coronavirus literature with an awakening in 2020 were identified, i.e., previously published studies of this literature that had remained relatively unnoticed for several years but gained sudden traction in 2020 in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This work documents the historical development of the literature on coronaviruses as an event-driven literature and as a domain that exhibited, arguably, the most exceptional case of publication burst in the history of science. It also demonstrates how scholarly efforts undertaken during peace time or prior to a disease outbreak could suddenly play a critical role in prevention and mitigation of health disasters caused by new diseases.

In the present study we widened the focus to examine the association between economic uncertainty and suicides. We used monthly suicide data from the US at the State level from 2000 to 2017 and combined them with the monthly economic uncertainty index. We followed a panel data econometric approach to study the association between economic uncertainty and suicide, controlling for unemployment and other indicators. Economic uncertainty is positively associated with suicide when controlling for unemployment [coeff: 8.026; 95% CI: 3.692–12.360] or for a wider range of economic and demographic characteristics [coeff: 7.478; 95% CI: 3.333–11.623].

We retrospectively reviewed cohort data from 7,590 de-identified patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed using severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction test up to May 15, 2020. We used linked-medical claims data provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. Underlying diseases were identified using the diagnostic codes in the patients’ files from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The total mortality rate was 3.0% in patients with COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex, and concomitant chronic conditions, we found that congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes without chronic complications, renal diseases, and malignancy were factors that significantly increased the cost of treatment. Cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and paralysis were found to be independent factors significant in prolonging hospital stay. Diabetes with chronic complications was independently associated with intensive care unit admission. In addition, underlying congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 1.724; P = 0.003), dementia (OR, 1.598; P = 0.012), diabetes with and without chronic complications (OR, 1.821; P = 0.002 and OR, 1.518; P = 0.022, respectively), renal disease (OR, 2.299; P = 0.002), and malignancy (OR, 1.529; P = 0.039) were significant factors associated with death, even after adjustments. Underlying diseases were significant independent factors of the poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. The effects were variable according to the type of underlying disease and clinical outcome. Therefore, patients with COVID-19 with underlying diseases should be monitored more closely because they are more at risk of a poor prognosis.","Choi, Yong Jun; Park, Ju-Young; Lee, Hye Sun; Suh, Jin; Song, Jeung Yoon; Byun, Min-Kwang; Cho, Jae Hwa; Kim, Hyung Jung; Park, Hye Jung",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280188/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254258,147
615212,"Proceedings of the Food and Drug Administration public workshop on pathogen reduction technologies for blood safety 2018 (Commentary, p. 3026)",2019-05-29,"BACKGROUND: The ability of emerging pathogens to infect new species is likely related to the diversity of pathogen variants present in existing reservoirs and their degree of genomic plasticity, which determines their ability to adapt to new environments. Certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpz, SIVsm) have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species, including humans, resulting in the HIV-1 and HIV-2 epidemics. Although SIV diversification has been studied on a population level, the essential substrates for cross-species transmission, namely SIV sequence diversity and the types and extent of viral diversification present in individual reservoir animals have not been elucidated. To characterize this intra-host SIV diversity, we performed sequence analyses of clonal viral envelope (env) V1V2 and gag p27 variants present in individual SIVsm-infected sooty mangabeys over time. RESULTS: SIVsm demonstrated extensive intra-animal V1V2 length variation and amino acid diversity (le38%), and continual variation in V1V2 N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence frequency and location. Positive selection was the predominant evolutionary force. Temporal sequence shifts suggested continual selection, likely due to evolving antibody responses. In contrast, gag p27 was predominantly under purifying selection. SIVsm V1V2 sequence diversification is at least as great as that in HIV-1 infected humans, indicating that extensive viral diversification in and of itself does not inevitably lead to AIDS. CONCLUSION: Positive diversifying selection in this natural reservoir host is the engine that has driven the evolution of the uniquely adaptable SIV/HIV envelope protein. These studies emphasize the importance of retroviral diversification within individual host reservoir animals as a critical substrate in facilitating cross-species transmission.","Demma, LJ; Vanderford, TH; Logsdon, JM; Feinberg, MB; Staprans, SI",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16549011/,147

615875,A Comparison of Serum and Plasma Blood Collection Tubes for the Integration of Epidemiological and Metabolomics Data,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing is a fundamental component of influenza surveillance for detecting novel strains with pandemic potential and informing biannual vaccine strain selection. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. METHODS: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. RESULTS: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country. Our approach serves as an example for capacity building for other diseases.","Johnson, Lucinda E.

615913,The First WHO International Standard for Adalimumab: Dual Role in Bioactivity and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The underlying changes of peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in COVID-19 patients are little known. Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T lymphocytes, CD8+T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR=7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P=0.027), eosinopenia (OR=5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P=0.049) and worse one-month outcome (OR=8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P=0.048). CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.","Sun, Da-wei; Zhang, Dong; Tian, Run-hui; Li, Yang; Wang, Yu-shi; Cao, Jie; Tang, Ying; Zhang, Nan; Zan, Tao; Gao, Lan; Huang, Yan-zhu; Cui, Chang-lei; Wang, Dong-xuan; Zheng, Yang; Lv, Guo-yue",Clin Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.05.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120302242?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120302242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417210/,147

617235,Isolation of a Coronavirus from Kidney Biopsies of Endemic Balkan Nephropathy Patients,1999-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1(st) 2020, while COVID-19 was largely localised to China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two and three were the current ban followed by a full or partial lifting (allow over 100 000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists) from the 8(th) of March 2020. METHODS: We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia during and after the epidemic peak in China, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We used the estimated incidence of disease in China, using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases, and an age specific deterministic model to model the epidemic in each scenario. RESULTS: The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well, predicting 57 cases on March 6(th) in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date, however we did not account for imported cases from other countries. The modelled impact without a travel ban results in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths, if the epidemic remained localised to China and no importations from other countries occurred. The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal, and may be a policy option. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia during the epidemic peak in China and averted a much larger epidemic at a time when COVID-19 was largely localised to China. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high disease incidence. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Costantino, Valentina; Heslop, David J; MacIntyre, C Raina",J Travel Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32453411/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa081,147

617748,Investigation of pneumonia-causing pathogenic organisms in children and the usefulness of tebipenem pivoxil for their treatment,2010-03-31,"Problematic internet use in adolescents has been shown to significantly increase over the past few years, with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns reinforcing this phenomena globally. We sought to explore whether problematic internet use in specific countries was related to emotional well-being and importantly whether this is predicted by psychological distress. There is a growing number of studies showing that problematic internet use is increasingly prevalent in countries with emerging economies, however we have yet to find out to what extent other factors are influencing this behaviour in adolescents and young people. This study invited young people from countries such India, Mexico, Philippines and Turkey to complete a set of self-reports on their daily internet habits, social media use, alongside questions on psychological distress, self-esteem, loneliness and escapism. A total of 1182 young people aged between 16 and 25 years old completed these questionnaires online. The results showed that there were significant difference in problematic internet use scores among adolescents in the Philippines and Turkey. More specifically, social media use was significantly higher amongst young people from the Philippines whereas gaming addiction was significantly high in the Turkish sample. These findings also revealed that psychological distress, loneliness, and low self-esteem consistently predicted problematic internet use. Taken together these results emphasise that there are several factors underlying growing figures of problematic internet use in young people, these factors include emotional distress, need for escapism, loneliness, and social media use, however, going forward more nuanced cultural differences should also be considered.","Fernandes, Blossom; Uzun, Bilge; Aydin, Caner; Tan-Mansukhani, Roseann; Vallejo, Alma; Saldaña-Gutierrez, Ashley; Nanda Biswas, Urmi; Essau, Cecilia A.",Addict Behav Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608443/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100379; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352853221000420?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352853221000420,147
618051,Designing and generating a mouse model: frequently asked questions,2021-03-26,"Abstract Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first cases in Italy were reported on January 30, 2020, and the outbreak quickly escalated. On March 19, 2020, deaths in Italy surpassed those in China. The Italian government implemented progressively restrictive measures leading to a nationwide lockdown on March 8, 2020. This study aimed to assess the impact of mitigation measures implemented in Italy on the spread of COVID-19. Methods Publicly available data were used to evaluate changes in the growth curve of the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care (IC) at three time intervals between February 19, 2020 and April 9, 2020, following the implementation of progressive measures: (1) containment and travel restrictions, (2) lockdown of the epicenter of the outbreak, (3) school closures and nationwide lockdown. The models that showed the highest reliability according to the Akaike Information Criterion and based on data from the three time intervals were projected to assess how the epidemic would have evolved if no other measure had been implemented. Results The most reliable models were (1) exponential, (2) quadratic and (3) cubic (R2 0.99, > 0.99 and > 0.99 respectively), indicating a progressive decrease in the growth of the curve. Conclusion This study suggests the measures were effective in flattening the epidemic curve and bought valuable time, allowing for the number of IC beds to be nearly doubled before the national health system reached maximum capacity.","Vicentini, Costanza; Bordino, Valerio; Gardois, Paolo; Zotti, Carla Maria",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620302663; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620302663?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593056/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.028,147

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unspecified etiology was reported to the World Health Organization in China. The availability of adequate SARS-CoV-2 drugs is also limited, and the efficacy and safety of these drugs for COVID-2019 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. For these reasons, there is a need for other strategies against COVID-19 that are capable of prevention and treatment. Physical exercise has proven to be an effective therapy for most chronic diseases and microbial infections with preventive/therapeutic benefits, considering that exercise involves primary immunological mediators and/or anti-inflammatory properties. This review aimed to provide an insight into how the implementation of a physical exercise program against COVID-19 may be a useful complementary tool for prevention, which can also enhance recovery, improve quality of life, and provide immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the long term. In summary, physical exercise training exerts immunomodulatory effects, controls the viral gateway, modulates inflammation, stimulates nitric oxide synthesis pathways, and establishes control over oxidative stress.","Fernández-Lázaro, Diego; González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.; Sánchez-Serrano, Nerea; Navascués, Lourdes Jiménez; Ascaso-del-Río, Ana; Mielgo-Ayuso, Juan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212762/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228496,147
618261,A Study on the Contaminant Dispersion from Isolation Ward under Abnormal Operation of Facilities,2015-11-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought lots of losses to the global economy. Within the context of COVID-19 outbreak, many emergency decision-making problems with uncertain information arose and a number of individuals were involved to solve such complicated problems. For instance, the selection of the first entry point to China is important for oversea flights during the epidemic outbreak given that reducing imported virus from abroad becomes the top priority of China since China has achieved remarkable achievements regarding the epidemic control. In such a large-scale group decision making problem, the non-cooperative behaviors of experts are common due to the different backgrounds of the experts. The non-cooperative behaviors of experts have a negative impact on the efficiency of a decision-making process in terms of decision time and cost. Given that the non-cooperative behaviors of experts were rarely considered in existing large-scale group decision making methods, this study aims to propose a novel consensus model to manage the non-cooperative behaviors of experts in large-scale group decision making problems. A group consistency index simultaneously considering fuzzy preference values and cooperation degrees is introduced to detect the non-cooperative behaviors of experts. We combine the cooperation degrees and fuzzy preference similarities of experts when clustering experts. To reduce the negative influence of the experts with low degrees of cooperation on the quality of a decision-making process, we implement a dynamic weight punishment mechanism to non-cooperative experts so as to improve the consensus level of a group. An illustrative example about the selection of the first point of entry for the flights entering Beijing from Toronto during the COVID-19 outbreak is presented to show the validity of the proposed model.","Li, Xiaofang; Liao, Huchang; Wen, Zhi",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620308176; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519328/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494620308176,147
618685,Steroid induced osteonecrosis: An analysis of steroid dosing risk,2010-07-09,"BACKGROUND: There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network. METHODS: We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network. FINDINGS: We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27–1·89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40–64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40–64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28–8·76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65–8·51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26·2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5·6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4·59, 95% CI 3·57–5·90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29·5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7·7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2·03, 95% CI 1·51–2·71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32·9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14·4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·31–2·78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20·9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13·2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1·41, 95% CI 1·04–1·91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11·4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17·9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0·49, 95% CI 0·34–0·71). INTERPRETATION: A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

Many Sub-Saharan African nations are now facing increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 and there is a need to understand what levels of measures may be required to successfully reduce transmission. Methods: We collated epidemiological data along with information on key COVID-19 specific response policies and health system capacity estimates for services needed to treat COVID-19 patients in Senegal. We calibrated an age-structured SEIR model to these data to capture transmission dynamics accounting for demography, contact patterns, hospital capacity and disease severity. We simulated the impact of mitigation and suppression strategies focussed on reducing social contact rates. Results: Senegal acted promptly to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and as a result has reduced the reproduction number from 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.2) to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), which has slowed but not fully interrupted transmission. We estimate that continued spread is likely to peak in October, and to overwhelm the healthcare system with an estimated 77,400 deaths(95% CI 55,270-100,700). Further reductions in contact rates to suppress transmission (Rt<1) could significantly reduce this burden on healthcare services and improve overall health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Senegal has already significantly reduced transmission. Enhanced physical distancing measures and rapid scale up of hospital capacity is likely to be needed to reduce mortality and protect healthcare infrastructure from high levels of demand.","Thompson, H.

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has caused immense disruption to healthcare services, and to reduce viral transmission, many services moved to off‐site care delivery modalities such as telehealth. DESIGN: We used a qualitative descriptive design for this study. METHODS: Secondary analysis of semistructured interviews with alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19) was conducted in July and August 2020. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and reported using COREQ guidelines. RESULTS: Three were identified: ‘“All our face‐to‐face contact ceased with clients”: Changing service delivery’, ‘“How do I do my job when I can't see you?”: An anxious shift in service delivery’ and ‘“A lot of Indigenous people don't like the FaceTiming and all that”: Challenges to delivery of services through telehealth’. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study reported challenges in transitioning to telehealth modalities. The perceived loss of therapeutic communication, difficulties in assessing risks to healthcare consumers such as domestic violence and challenges delivering telehealth care to a marginalized consumer cohort need to be overcome before telehealth is considered successful in alcohol and other drug treatment. However, telehealth was a successful adjunct to existing practices for nurses working with consumers in regional or remote areas or where consumers preferred this method of service delivery. IMPACT: Nurses in this study described substantial issues with the delivery of alcohol and other drug treatment via telehealth, including a perception that telehealth was a barrier to addressing risks to consumers who use alcohol and other drugs, and difficulties working in a therapeutically beneficial way via telehealth. Telehealth is a means to reduce viral transmission through a reduction in face‐to‐face contact, and although it may be useful for some service functions, it may be detrimental to the clinical services nurses provide.","Searby, Adam; Burr, Dianna",J Adv Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133036/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14939,147

We disclose the number of patients evaluated as “persons under investigation” and the proportion with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) results from these sites. We describe how the programs were applied to patient care and include considerations on how additional staffing, scalability, and flexibility of these services may be applied to future patient and health care crises. METHODS: This is a descriptive report of the implementation of MIH/CP test sites in our health care system’s early response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Retrospective data on the number of patients and their associated demographics are reported here as raw data. No statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between March 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, our 6 MIH/CP test sites evaluated 4342 patients. Of these, 401 patients (9.2%) had positive test results, 62.8% of whom were women. The estimated duration of each patient encounter under investigation was 3 to 5 minutes. The paramedics were able to perform a brief history, specific physical examination, and screening for signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. There were no cases of accidental exposure or failure of personal protective equipment for the MIH/CP paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: In our health care system, we pivoted the traditional MIH/CP model to rapidly initiate remote drive-through testing for COVID-19 in pre-screened individuals. This model allowed us to test patients with suspected COVID-19 patients away from traditional health care sites and mitigate exposure to health care workers and other patients.","Constantine, S.

Jordan declared a military-enforced curfew for three months, which successfully controlled the disease spreading. However, the curfew impacted several aspects of students’ lives and personalities. This study discusses the impact of the COVID-19 curfew restrictions on university students’ mental health, as this area was not fully discussed in previous studies. An online survey was distributed to cover the psychological symptoms and coping strategies of university students. Most of them experienced short temper, anxiety, and sleep problems. Female students expressed more psychological symptoms than males, they managed their stress by sleeping, studying, and worshiping. Whereas male students were working, exercising, and playing video games. A distinct interest was noticed among students of different ages. Young students (18–25 years) expressed unhappiness and distress-like symptoms; they advocated sleeping and playing video games. While elder students (>26 years) had anxiety, sleep problems, and short tempers, they managed their symptoms by studying, exercising, and worshiping. The curfew restrictions have negatively impacted the mental health of female and younger students more than other categories.

Sojourners are among those who have experienced a higher level of food insecurity during the crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak. The current research aimed to investigate the immediate consumption behavioral intentions of the Pakistani international students in the People's Republic of China (PRC) during the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. This study applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and background factors of food safety and health consciousness that influence the consumption behavioral intention of Pakistani students toward unfamiliar local food in China. A relational model was analyzed where food safety and health consciousness were hypothesized to serve as background variables associated with TPB components. Moreover, the indirect effects of food safety and health consciousness on behavioral intentions were assessed. The data were collected through convenience samples from 462 Pakistani international students and were analyzed through partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results confirmed that food safety and health consciousness were positively associated with attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). However, food safety and health consciousness were indirectly associated with the behavioral intention only through ATT and SN. The results highlighted the role of food safety and health consciousness as important antecedents of classical TPB components that affect intentions and behaviors to avoid unfamiliar local food in a migrated context. The present study provides enlightenment to those who aim to investigate the consumption behavioral intentions of sojourners in the wake of the pandemic situation based on food safety and health consciousness. The findings of the current study are also applicable to general consumption patterns in the food sector.","Khayyam, Muhammad; Chuanmin, Shuai; Qasim, Haroon; Ihtisham, Muhammad; Anjum, Raheel; Jiaxin, Li; Tikhomirova, Anna; Khan, Nawab",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385954/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673771,147

The author situates herself within a “positive deviance “ epistemology, which looks for what already works rather than getting captured by the current problem. We “flip” what are the usual ways of responding and explore three different programs that illustrate inventive and assets‐based approaches. Linking‐Lives Storython, created specifically to utilize our Covid shelter‐in‐place experience; Re‐Authoring Teaching: Creating a Collaboratory, begun 12 years ago to meet the needs of a wide‐spread community; and Witness‐to‐Witness, a current response to contemporary disastrous situations—all have utilized technology to open possibilities for those who are helped as well as those who are helpers. The article shows how each program has specifically flipped more traditional ways of responding, but also how this “flip” employs a practice of “disciplined improvisation.” Each program has a built‐in structure that depends on technology to make it work; each has a disciplined approach that allows the helpers to improvise to meet the needs of the receivers. It is this “flip,” this way of thinking, that can sustain us and our work in times of great complexity and multiplicity.","Dickerson, Victoria C.",Fam Process,https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663317/,147

At present, the whole world is trying to combat this coronavirus disease and scientific communities are putting rigorous efforts to develop vaccines. However, there are only a few specific medical treatments for SARS‐CoV‐2. Apart from other public health measures taken to prevent this virus, we can boost our immunity with natural products. In this article, we have highlighted the potential of common spices and herbs as antiviral agents and immunity boosters. A questionnaire‐based online survey has been conducted on home remedies during COVID‐19 among a wide range of peoples (n‐531) of different age groups (13–68 years) from various countries. According to the survey, 71.8% of people are taking kadha for combating infection and boosting immunity. Most people (86.1%) think that there is no side effect of kadha while 13.9% think vice versa. A total of 93.6% of people think that spices are helpful in curing coronavirus or other viral infection as well as boosting immunity. Most people are using tulsi drops, vitamin C, and chyawanprash for boosting their immunity.

Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the association of its Spike (S) protein with the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells, we computationally redesigned the S protein sequence to improve its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Toward this purpose, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants that perturb the core protein sequence but keep the surface conformation and B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope content and similarity scores of the perturbed sequences were calculated and evaluated. Out of 22,914 designs with favorable stability energy, 301 candidates contained at least two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes and had promising immunogenic potential. The benchmark tests showed that, although the epitope restraints were not included in the scoring function of EvoDesign, the top S protein design successfully recovered 31 out of the 32 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, where two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. Moreover, the newly designed S protein introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes that do not exist in the wildtype SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrated a new and effective avenue to enhance a target protein’s immunogenicity using rational protein design, which could be applied for new vaccine design against COVID-19 and other human viruses.","Ong, Edison; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang; He, Yongqun",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S200103702030564X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S200103702030564X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398234/,147

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Rehabilitation and neurology departments of a general hospital (Talavera de la Reina, Spain). Subjects: A total of 43 participants with subacute stroke. Intervention: Participants were randomized into experimental group (conventional treatment + virtual reality) and control (conventional treatment). Main measures: Health-related quality of life as measured by the EuroQoL-5 dimensions instrument (EQ-5D-5L) and EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). Results: A total of 23 patients in the experimental group (62.6 ± 13.5 years) and 20 in the control (63.6 ± 12.2 years) completed the study. In the experimental group, EQ-VAS score was 29.1 ± 12.8 at baseline, 86.5 ± 7.1 post-intervention, and 78.3 ± 10.3 at the three-month follow-up. The control group obtained scores of 25.5 ± 5.1, 57.0 ± 4.7, and 58.5 ± 5.9, respectively.

629713,Surfactant protein D and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a new way to approach an old problem,2021-05-08,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common clinically significant primary antibody deficiency diagnosed in adults. The early symptoms are not specific. They include common infections, mainly of the respiratory tract, caused by typical microorganisms, so cases can be missed in primary care. In the majority of patients increased susceptibility to infections coexists with signs or symptoms of autoimmunity, inflammation or polyclonal lymphoproliferation, which can divert diagnosis from immune deficiency. The overall incidence of malignancy is increased in CVID and certain cancers are significantly more common. Lymphomas and gastric carcinoma are the most frequently reported malignancies in CVID, so a high index of suspicion is recommended. Diagnostic delay in CVID is seen worldwide. The main goal of this paper is to increase the awareness about CVID among health care professionals. We aim to present features which can be helpful in CVID diagnosis in order to shorten the “latency” of proper management of CVID patients. We review clinical symptoms, complications and laboratory abnormalities of CVID. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is regarded as the cornerstone of pharmacological intervention. New modes of Ig application, mainly subcutaneously and via the hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous route, help to adjust therapy to patients’ needs and preferences. Still there remain unmet needs. It remains to be seen whether CVID complications can be avoided by earlier diagnosis, treatment and thorough monitoring in the context of increased risk of malignancy. Development of patient tailored protocols depending on the clinical phenotype and risk factors might be more appropriate. The most important consideration is to diagnose suspected cases and stratify patients in a precise and timely way. Work is needed to define features predictive of unfavorable prognosis.","Więsik-Szewczyk, Ewa; Jahnz-Różyk, Karina",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i18.3942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024751/,147

630323,A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern,2020-01-24,"BACKGROUND: The cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new coronavirus. Whole genome sequence analysis of various isolates might provide an indication of potential strain differences of this new virus. Moreover, mutation analysis will help to develop effective vaccines. METHODS: We sequenced the entire SARS viral genome of cultured isolates from the index case (SIN2500) presenting in Singapore, from three primary contacts (SIN2774, SIN2748, and SIN2677), and one secondary contact (SIN2679). These sequences were compared with the isolates from Canada (TOR2), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1 and HKU39849), Hanoi (URBANI), Guangzhou (GZ01), and Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04). FINDINGS: We identified 129 sequence variations among the 14 isolates, with 16 recurrent variant sequences. Common variant sequences at four loci define two distinct genotypes of the SARS virus. One genotype was linked with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong, the second contained isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing with no association with Hotel M (p<0.0001). Moreover, other common sequence variants further distinguished the geographical origins of the isolates, especially between Singapore and Beijing. INTERPRETATION: Despite the recent onset of the SARS epidemic, genetic signatures are emerging that partition the worldwide SARS viral isolates into groups on the basis of contact source history and geography. These signatures can be used to trace sources of infection. In addition, a common variant associated with a non-conservative aminoacid change in the S1 region of the spike protein, suggests that immunological pressures might be starting to influence the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations.

More specifically, we suggested that acceptance of technology post-COVID-19 may have influenced many technology-related individual factors such as computer efficacy, mastery experience, and self-regulated learning of users, while using technology that in turn may have affected beliefs of users about ease of using technology. Such an effect is ultimately reflected in the belief of technology usefulness and favorable post-COVID-19 attitude of users toward using technology.

631424,Treatment of Anti-GAD65 Autoimmune Encephalitis With Methylprednisolone,2021,"CONTEXT: Health systems have aspired to integrate palliative care (PC) into the emergency department (ED) in order to improve care quality for over a decade, yet there are very few examples of implemented models in the literature. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the volume of seriously ill patients in EDs and a consequent rapid increase in PC integration in many EDs. OBJECTIVE: To describe the new PC-ED delivery innovations that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this qualitative study of PC programs in EDs, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ED and PC clinicians between June 30, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Participants were asked about PC-ED integration before, during and after COVID. We conducted a two-phased rapid analysis (RA) using a RA template and consolidated matrix to identify innovations. RESULTS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we interviewed 31 participants, representing 52 hospitals. Several new innovations in care delivery were identified. These included elements of fully embedded PC, the use of PC extenders, technology both within the electronic medical record (EMR) and outside of it, and innovations in training emergency clinicians in primary palliative care skills to support care delivery. Most PC efforts focused on increasing goals of care conversations. Institutions that implemented these programs reported that they increased PC utilization in the ED, were well received by clinicians, and changed patient’s care trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Several new innovations in PC-ED care delivery emerged during COVID. Many innovations leveraged different types of clinicians to deliver care, an increased physical presence of PC in the ED, and used technology to enhance care delivery. These innovations may serve as a framework for institutions as they plan for evolving needs in the ED during and after COVID. Additional research is needed to evaluate the impact of these programs and to understand their applicability beyond the pandemic.","Aaronson, Emily Loving; Daubman, Bethany-Rose; Petrillo, Laura; Bowman, Jason; Ouchi, Kei; Gipps, Alexa; Traeger, Lara; Jackson, Vicki; Grudzen, Corita; Ritchie, Christine Seel",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.10.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420308642?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161031/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420308642,147
631435,Thymus Extracellular Matrix‐Derived Scaffolds Support Graft‐Resident Thymopoiesis and Long‐Term In Vitro Culture of Adult Thymic Epithelial Cells,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND: To suppress the COVID-19 outbreak, the Norwegian government closed all schools on March 13, 2020. The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. METHODS: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsø, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04–0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01–0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what has previously been estimated for influenza pandemics. CONCLUSION: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have closed schools, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Rypdal, Martin; Rypdal, Veronika; Jakobsen, Per Kristen; Ytterstad, Elinor; Løvsletten, Ola; Klingenberg, Claus; Rypdal, Kristoffer",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630842/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238268,147

Nevertheless, antiviral properties of BV have not well investigated. Hence, we identified the potential antiviral properties of BV and its component against a broad panel of viruses. Co-incubation of non-cytotoxic amounts of BV and MLT, the main component of BV, significantly inhibited the replication of enveloped viruses such as Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Additionally, BV and MLT also inhibited the replication of non-enveloped viruses such as Enterovirus-71 (EV-71) and Coxsackie Virus (H3). Such antiviral properties were mainly explained by virucidal mechanism. Moreover, MLT protected mice which were challenged with lethal doses of pathogenic influenza A H1N1 viruses. Therefore, these results provides the evidence that BV and MLT could be a potential source as a promising antiviral agent, especially to develop as a broad spectrum antiviral agent.","Uddin, Md Bashir; Lee, Byeong-Hoon; Nikapitiya, Chamilani; Kim, Jae-Hoon; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Lee, Hyun-Cheol; Kim, Choul Goo; Lee, Jong-Soo; Kim, Chul-Joong",J Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12275-016-6376-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27888461/,147
632085,Malaria epidemiology and anti-malarial drug efficacy in Guinea: a review of clinical and molecular studies,2021-06-16,"Understanding the mechanism for antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. We recently isolated a large number of monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Here we select the top three most potent yet variable neutralizing antibodies for in-depth structural and functional analyses. Crystal structural comparisons reveal differences in the angles of approach to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the size of the buried surface areas, and the key binding residues on the RBD of the viral spike glycoprotein. One antibody, P2C-1F11, most closely mimics binding of receptor ACE2, displays the most potent neutralizing activity in vitro and conferred strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice. It also occupies the largest binding surface and demonstrates the highest binding affinity to RBD. More interestingly, P2C-1F11 triggers rapid and extensive shedding of S1 from the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein, with only minimal such effect by the remaining two antibodies.

632678,The rocky road to recognizing interventional radiology as a full clinical speciality,2021-01-06,"Efficient and productive virus infection often requires viral countermeasures that block innate immunity. The interferon-inducible 2′,5-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, a 2H phosphoesterase superfamily member, is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2′,5′-oligoadenylates (2-5A) thereby preventing activation of RNase L (Zhao et al., Cell Host and Microbe 11:607–16, 2012). The PDE activity of ns2 is required for viral replication in macrophages and for hepatitis. Here, we will demonstrate that group A rotavirus, the primary cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children worldwide, encodes an homologous and similar PDE. The VP3 carboxy-terminal domain (VP3-CTD) shares sequence and predicted structural homology with ns2, including two catalytic His-x-Thr/Ser motifs. Recombinant VP3-CTD also demonstrated 2′,5′-PDE activity, which cleaved 2-5A in vitro. In addition, its expression in cells depleted 2-5A levels induced by OAS activation with poly (rI):poly (rC), preventing RNase L activation. In the context of recombinant chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2, the VP3-CTD restored the ability to replicate efficiently in macrophages or in the livers of infected mice, while chimeras expressing inactive VP3-CTD (H718A or H798R) were attenuated. Also, chimeric viruses expressing active ns2 or VP3, but not mutant ns2 or VP3, were able to protect ribosomal RNA from RNase L-mediated degradation. Thus, VP3-CTD is a 2′,5′-PDE able to functionally substitute for ns2 in the context of MHV infection. Remarkably, therefore, two disparate RNA viruses encode proteins with homologous 2′,5′-PDEs that antagonize innate immunity. In addition, based on sequence and predicted structural homology with MHV ns2 and rotavirus VP3, several other viruses have been identified that encode proteins with predicted 2′,5′-PDE activities.","Silverman, Robert H.; Zhang, Rong; Jha, Babal K.; Ogden, Kristen M.; Dong, Beihua; Elliott, Ruth; Zhao, Ling; Patton, John T.; Weiss, Susan R.",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466613005218; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466613005218,147

Whereas the majority of disease presents with mild symptoms that can be treated as outpatients, severely ill COVID-19 patients and patients presenting with similar symptoms cross their ways in the emergency department. Especially, the variety of symptoms is challenging with primary triage. Are there parameters to distinguish between proven COVID-19 and without before? How can a safe and efficient management of these inpatients be achieved? METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 314 consecutive inpatient patients who presented with possible symptoms of COVID-19 in a German emergency department between March and April 2020 and were tested with a SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical parameters, Manchester Triage System categories, and lab results were compared between patients with positive and negative test results for SARS-Cov-2. Furthermore, we present the existing COVID-19 workflow model of the university hospital in Essen which proved to be efficient during pandemia. RESULTS: Forty-three of the 314 patients (13.7%) were tested positive for COVID-19 by SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab. We did not find any laboratory parameter to distinguish safely between patients with COVID-19 and those with similar symptoms. Dysgeusia was the only clinical symptom that was significantly more frequent among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Dysgeusia seems to be a typical symptom for COVID-19, which occurred in 14% of our COVID-19 patients. However, no valid parameters could be found to distinguish clinically between COVID-19 and other diseases with similar symptoms. Therefore, early testing, a strict isolation policy, and proper personal protection are crucial to maintain workflow and safety of patients and ED staff for the months to come.

635520,The role of dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis,2020-10-16,"Antibodies that mediate non-neutralizing functions play an important role in the immune response to Ebola virus (EBOV) and are thought to impact disease outcome. EBOV has also been associated with long term sequelae in survivors, however, the extent to which antibodies that mediate non-neutralizing functions are associated with the development of these sequelae is unknown. Here, the presence of antibodies mediating different effector functions and how they relate to long-term sequelae two years after the 2007 Bundibugyo Ebola virus (BDBV) outbreak was investigated. The majority of survivors demonstrated robust antibody effector functional activity and demonstrated persistent polyfunctional antibody profiles to the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) two years after infection. These functions were strongly associated with the levels of GP-specific IgG1. The odds of developing hearing loss, one of the more common sequelae to BDBV was reduced when antibodies mediating antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), antibody dependent complement deposition (ADCD), or activating NK cells (ADNKA) were observed. In addition, hearing loss was associated with increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines were associated with lower ADCP. These results are indicating that a skewed antibody profile and persistent inflammation may contribute to long term outcome in survivors of BDBV infection","Paquin-Proulx, Dominic; Gunn, Bronwyn M.; Alrubayyi, Aljawharah; Clark, Danielle V.; Creegan, Matthew; Kim, Dohoon; Kibuuka, Hannah; Millard, Monica; Wakabi, Salim; Eller, Leigh Anne; Michael, Nelson L.; Schoepp, Randal J.; Hepburn, Matthew J.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Robb, Merlin L.; Alter, Galit; Eller, Michael A.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.682120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093585/,147

636881,Serological Diagnosis of Flavivirus-Associated Human Infections,2020-05-14,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Since January 2020, Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have risen exponentially in the United States. Accurate data on COVID-19 cases has been difficult to report due to lack of testing as well as the overload of the U.S. healthcare system. This study aims to evaluate whether a digital surveillance model using Google Trends is feasible, and whether accurate predictions can be made regarding new cases. METHODS Data on total and daily new cases in each U.S. state was collected and used in this study from late January to early April. Information regarding ten keywords was collected and correlation analyses were performed for individual states as well as for the United States overall. RESULTS Ten keywords were analyzed from Google Trends. “Face mask”, “Lysol”, and “COVID stimulus check” had the strongest correlations when looking at the United States as a whole, with R values of 0.88, 0.82 and 0.79 respectively. Lag and lead Pearson correlations were assessed for every state and all ten keywords from 16 days before the first case in each state to 16 days after the first case. Strong correlations were seen up to 16 days prior to the first reported cases in some states. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility of syndromic surveillance of internet search terms to monitor new infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This information could enable better preparation and planning of healthcare systems.","Kurian, Shyam J.; Bhatti, Atiq ur Rehman; Alvi, Mohammed Ali; Ting, Henry H.; Storlie, Curtis; Wilson, Patrick M.; Shah, Nilay D.; Liu, Hongfang; Bydon, Mohamad",Mayo Clin Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164756/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.08.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620309344?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620309344,147

Our focus is on trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases, rather than cumulative cases, as trajectories help us identify trends in how the pandemic naturally develops over time, and study the shapes of the curve in different states. Methods: We analyzed data on daily reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from January 21 to June 16, 2020 in 50 states, adjusted for the population size of each state. Cluster analysis for time-series data was used to split the states into clusters that have distinct trajectories of daily cases. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare access between clusters were tested. Adjusted models were used to determine if healthcare access is associated with reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Results: Two clusters of states were identified. One cluster had a high trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases, and comprised of 19 states, including New York and New Jersey. The other cluster of states (n=31) had a low trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases. There were significantly more Black residents (p=0.027) and more nursing facility residents (p=0.001) in states reporting high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. States reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases also had fewer uninsured persons (p=0.005), fewer persons who reported having to forgo medical care due to cost (p=0.016), more registered physicians (p=0.002) and more nurses (p=0.03), higher health spending per capita (p=0.01), fewer residents in Health Professional Shortage Areas per 100,000 population (p=0.027), and higher adoption of Medicaid Expansion (p=0.05). In adjusted models, a higher proportion of uninsured persons (OR: 0.51 [0.25-0.85]; p=0.032), higher proportion of patients who had to forgo medical care due to cost (OR: 0.55 [0.28-0.95]; p=0.048), and no adoption of Medicaid expansion (OR: 0.05 [0-0.59]; p=0.04), were associated with reporting a low trajectory of COVID-19 cases.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: During the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was significant concern of hospital acquired COVID-19 infections. Medical centers rapidly implemented systems to minimize perioperative transmission, including routine preoperative testing, patient isolation, and enhanced cleaning. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of all adult patients who underwent surgery at our quaternary, acute care hospital between March 15 and May 15, 2020 were reviewed. The risk of preoperatively negative patients developing symptomatic COVID-19 within 2–14 days postoperatively was determined. Surgical characteristics, outcomes, and complications were compared between those with and without acquired perioperative COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Among 501 negative patients undergoing index surgeries, 9 (1.8%) developed symptomatic COVID-19 in the postoperative period; all occurred before implementation of routine preoperative testing [9/243, 3.7% vs 0/258, 0%, odds ratio (OR): 0.048, P = 0.036]. No patient who was polymerase-chain-reaction negative on the day of surgery (n = 170) developed postoperative infection. Perioperative infection was associated with preoperative diabetes (OR: 3.70, P = 0.042), cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.69, P = 0.043), angiotensin receptor blocker use (OR: 6.58, P = 0.004), and transplant surgery (OR: 11.00, P = 0.002), and multiple complications, readmission (OR: 5.50, P = 0.029) and death (OR: 12.81, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was minimal risk of acquiring symptomatic perioperative COVID-19 infection, especially after the implementation of routine preoperative testing.

Understanding what influences the uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand and respiratory hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing could help to inform the development of effective public health advice messages. The aim of this synthesis was to explore public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory infections. METHODS: Five online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) were systematically searched. Reference lists of articles were also examined. We selected papers that used a qualitative research design to explore perceptions and beliefs about non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission of acute respiratory infections. We excluded papers that only explored how health professionals or children viewed non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. Three authors performed data extraction and assessment of study quality. Thematic analysis and components of meta-ethnography were adopted to synthesise findings. RESULTS: Seventeen articles from 16 studies in 9 countries were identified and reviewed. Seven key themes were identified: perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions, personal and cultural beliefs about infection transmission, diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections, perceived vulnerability to infection, anxiety about emerging respiratory infections and communications about emerging respiratory infections. The synthesis showed that some aspects of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control (particularly hand and respiratory hygiene) were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take. There was ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours in some contexts due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma. Common perceived barriers included beliefs about infection transmission, personal vulnerability to respiratory infection and concerns about self-diagnosis in emerging respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: People actively evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms of their perceived necessity, efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility. To enhance uptake, it will be necessary to address key barriers, such as beliefs about infection transmission, rejection of personal risk of infection and concern about the potential costs and stigma associated with some interventions.","Teasdale, Emma; Santer, Miriam; Geraghty, Adam W A; Little, Paul; Yardley, Lucy",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920395/,147

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly-diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, especially short and medium chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be incapable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and, as such, may have a compromised capacity to transport and deliver oxygen.","Thomas, T.; Stefanoni, D.; Dzieciatkowska, M.; Issaian, A.; Nemkov, T.; Hill, R.

We examined whether teachers unions were associated with mask mandates, using proprietary data on school district-level unionization and mask mandates from the Iowa State Education Association, the state's main teachers union. We found that a 1-standard-deviation increase in the teachers' unionization rate was associated with a 12.5 percent relative increase in the probability that a school district adopted a mask mandate.

Assessing the perceived risk and preventive behaviors and COVID-19-induced anxiety of every individual is crucial to be more effective in handling the outbreak. PURPOSE: This study intends to determine the status of perceived risk, preventive behavior, and induced anxiety regarding COVID-19 among urban residents in Ethiopia. METHODS: In this research a population-based, cross-sectional design was employed among 801 urban residents in West Shewa Zone, Ethiopia from June to October 2020. COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) was used, with CIAS score ≥80% taken as having anxiety. A Preventive Behavior towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) was used to measure the level of protective behavior. The data were gathered using CS Entry and analyzed with SPSS version 23.0. Basic descriptive analysis was conducted, and binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the predictors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: Most of the study population, 716 (89.4%), had moderate risk perception, and around 497 (62.0%) of them had moderate preventive behavior against the pandemic. The proportion of COVID-19-induced anxiety disorder was found to be 18.1%. The identified predictors associated with COVID-induced anxiety were: being widowed (AOR=3.5; 95% CI: 1.7–7.6), lacking formal education (AOR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.3–3.3), having history of psychoactive substance use (AOR=3.0; 95% CI: 1.6–5.8), high protective behavior (AOR=2.2; 95% CI:1.5–3.3), low perceived risk (OR=3.7; 95% CI: 1.5–12.4), and family history of mental illness (AOR=1.6; 95% CI:0.7–3.8). CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: COVID-19-induced anxiety prevalence was 18.1%. Risk perception regarding COVID was moderate. However, only 38.0% of the population had high preventive behavior against the pandemic. Hence, it is important to provide the continuous public health education necessary to promote preventive measures and minimize risky behaviors. Basic psychosocial help should be also provided for individuals suffering with COVID-19-induced anxiety.","Birhanu, Adamu; Tiki, Takele; Mekuria, Mulugeta; Yilma, Delelegn; Melese, Getu; Seifu, Benyam",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s298781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603511/,147

METHODS: Patient data was abstracted from medical records at Weill Cornell Medical Center. RESULTS: Four patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and PRES were identified. The patients' ages ranged from 64 to 74 years, and two were women. All four patients were admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. PRES was diagnosed after persistent confusion, lethargy, new focal neurological deficits, or seizures were noted, with evidence of seizures on electroencephalogram for two of the patients. Imaging confirmed the presence of cerebral vasogenic edema. All four patients had elevated blood pressure and renal injury in the days preceding PRES diagnosis, as well as evidence of systemic inflammation and systemic hypercoagulability. Symptoms of PRES improved with blood pressure control. CONCLUSIONS: Our four cases demonstrate the occurrence of PRES in critically-ill patients with COVID-19. PRES should be considered in the differential for acute neurological deficits and seizures in this setting.","Parauda, Sarah C.; Gao, Virginia; Gewirtz, Alexandra N.; Parikh, Neal S.; Merkler, Alexander E.; Lantos, Joshua; White, Halina; Leifer, Dana; Navi, Babak B.; Segal, Alan Z.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20303567?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20303567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32679347/,147

This may be due to respiratory infections, chronic granulomatous diseases, medications, and connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction. Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the evidence in support of the putative risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis in the disease and propose risk mitigation strategies. We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism. With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.","Ojo, Ademola S.; Balogun, Simon A.; Williams, Oyeronke T.; Ojo, Olusegun S.",Pulm Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6175964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850151/,147
641744,The potential involvement of P2X7 receptor in COVID‐19 pathogenesis: a new therapeutic target?,2020-08-14,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have a key role in immune responses because they bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. They mature upon recognition of pathogens and upregulate MHC molecules and costimulatory receptors to activate antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. It is now well established that DCs are not a homogeneous population but are composed of different subsets with specialized functions in immune responses to specific pathogens. Upon viral infections, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) rapidly produce large amounts of IFN-α, which has potent antiviral functions and activates several other immune cells. However, pDCs are not particularly potent APCs and induce the tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 in CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, myeloid DCs (mDCs) are very potent APCs and possess the unique capacity to prime naive T cells and consequently to initiate a primary adaptive immune response. Different subsets of mDCs with specialized functions have been identified. In mice, CD8α(+) mDCs capture antigenic material from necrotic cells, secrete high levels of IL-12, and prime Th1 and cytotoxic T-cell responses to control intracellular pathogens. Conversely, CD8α(−) mDCs preferentially prime CD4(+) T cells and promote Th2 or Th17 differentiation. BDCA-3(+) mDC2 are the human homologue of CD8α(+) mDCs, since they share the expression of several key molecules, the capacity to cross-present antigens to CD8(+) T-cells and to produce IFN-λ. However, although several features of the DC network are conserved between humans and mice, the expression of several toll-like receptors as well as the production of cytokines that regulate T-cell differentiation are different. Intriguingly, recent data suggest specific roles for human DC subsets in immune responses against individual pathogens. The biology of human DC subsets holds the promise to be exploitable in translational medicine, in particular for the development of vaccines against persistent infections or cancer.","Geginat, Jens; Nizzoli, Giulia; Paroni, Moira; Maglie, Stefano; Larghi, Paola; Pascolo, Steve; Abrignani, Sergio",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528289/,147

Data were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Based on the health concepts of the respondents, housing poverty negatively affected health in terms of “the occurrence and continuation of anxiety,” “the increase and continuation of lethargy,” “the difficulty in managing daily life and taking care of health,” “the lack of a dependable support person,” and “the difficulty in preventing and treating disease.” The majority of young people experienced difficulties responding to their situations, and their housing poverty was hard to overcome.

High incidence of acute gastroenteritis caused by rotaviruses calls for prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Although no vaccine is presently available, it seems likely that vaccines will be developed in the next few years. There are also several rotavirus enzymes useful as targets for antiviral drugs. However, no antiviral drugs have shown therapeutic effects against rotavirus infections. The newly discovered human retrovirus (HTLV) has not yet been investigated in such detail as to predict the usefulness of vaccine or antiviral drugs. Several compounds are known to inhibit other retrovirus enzymes but the implication of this for chemotherapy of HTLV infection is unknown at present. The possibility and need for vaccination or chemotherapy against Norwalk virus and related agents is unclear. Very little work has been carried out to date with human coronaviruses, either from the point of view of vaccine development or specific antivirals. Both approaches may be usefully investigated in the future. Genetic cloning may be particularly useful for development of inactivated vaccines because the virus itself would be difficult to replicate and purify in large quantities for conventional vaccines.",,Perspectives in Medical Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287581/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016870690870017X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016870690870017X; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(08)70017-x,147
643238,SARS CoV2 infection _The longevity study perspectives,2021-02-16,"Accidental or suicidal poisoning with yellow phosphorus or metal phosphides (YPMP) such as aluminum (AlP) zinc phosphide (Zn(3)P(2)) commonly cause acute liver failure (ALF) and cardiotoxicity. These are used as household, agricultural and industrial rodenticides and in production of ammunitions, firecrackers and fertilizers. In absence of a clinically available laboratory test for diagnosis or toxin measurement or an antidote, managing their poisoning is challenging even at a tertiary care center with a dedicated liver intensive care unit (LICU) and liver transplant facility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with YPMP related ALF were monitored using standardized clinical, hemodynamic, biochemical, metabolic, neurological, electrocardiography (ECG) and SOFA score and managed using uniform intensive care, treatment and transplant protocols in LICU. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and biochemical parameters and scores were summarized and compared between 3 groups i.e. spontaneous survivors, transplanted patients and non-survivors. Predictors of spontaneous survival and the need for liver transplant are also evaluated. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with YPMP related ALF were about 32 years old (63.2% females) and presented to us at a median of 3 (0 – 10) days after poisoning. YPMP related cardiotoxicity was rapidly progressive and fatal whereas liver transplant was therapeutic for ALF. Spontaneous survivors had lower dose ingestion (<17.5 grams), absence of cardiotoxicity, < grade 3 HE, lactate < 5.8, SOFA score < 14.5, and increase in SOFA score by < 5.5. Patients with renal failure need for CVVHDF and KCC positivity on account of PT-INR > 6.5 had higher mortality risk. Patients undergoing liver transplant and with spontaneous recovery required longer ICU and hospital stay. At median follow-up of 3.4 (2.6 – 5.5) years, all spontaneous survivors and transplanted patients are well with normal liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Early transfer to a specialized center, pre-emptive close monitoring, and intensive care and organ support with ventilation, CVVHDF, plasmapheresis and others may maximize their chances of spontaneous recovery, allow accurate prognostication and a timely liver transplant.","Mohanka, Ravi; Rao, Prashantha; Shah, Mitul; Gupte, Amit; Nikam, Vinayak; Vohra, Mihir; Kohli, Ruhi; Shrimal, Anurag; Golhar, Ankush; Panchwagh, Ameya; Kamath, Saurabh; Shukla, Akash; Patel, Priyesh; Chattopadhyay, Somnath; Chaubal, Gaurav; Shaikh, Yasmin; Dedhia, Vidhi; Sarmalkar, Shivali S.; Maghade, Ravikiran; Shinde, Kavita; Bhilare, Priyanka; Nalawade, Rohini; AS, Jacob; Shah, Samir",J Clin Exp Hepatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0973688320301493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052182/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973688320301493?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.09.010,147

The lack of Coronavirus post-mortem testing led the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences (INTCF) from Spain to verify the performance and utility of a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) clinical diagnosis protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection (TaqPath™ COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit), to shed light on the cause of death (COD) in potentially COVID-19 cases in judicial autopsies. Two different RNA extraction methods were also tested (EZ1® DSP Virus Kit on the EZ1® Advanced XL robot versus MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit) regarding extraction efficiency, precision and contamination. RT-qPCR was evaluated for precision, specificity, limit of detection and concordance. Both the automated and the manual RNA extraction procedures showed good efficiency, but the automated virus extraction by bio-robot produced more reproducible results than the manual extraction. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay showed high sensitivity with a detection limit up to 10 copies/reaction and high specificity, as no cross-reactivity was detected between any of the 12 different RNA viruses tested, including three types of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, NL63 and 229E).

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses assessed scale structure. Factor analysis stratified by depression was used to assess measurement invariance. Linear regression models examined COVID‐19‐related worry determinants. The CoV‐Wo scale exhibited good reliability (α = 0.80) and a two‐factor structure: health (α = 0.83) and resources (α = 0.71). The full scale and both subscales were higher among participants who stopped working due to COVID‐19 and those with depression. Perception of quality medical care if infected with COVID‐19 was associated with reduced worry.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 7000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious 2 weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance, which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission, and maternal−fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery, is addressed. In addition, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment, and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework that can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.","Dashraath, Pradip; Wong, Jing Lin Jeslyn; Lim, Mei Xian Karen; Lim, Li Min; Li, Sarah; Biswas, Arijit; Choolani, Mahesh; Mattar, Citra; Su, Lin Lin",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820303434?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217113/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820303434,147

648296,Feasibility of Reusing Surgical Mask Under Different Disinfection Treatments,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine adjuvants are compounds that significantly enhance/prolong the immune response to a co-administered antigen. The limitations of the use of aluminium salts that are unable to elicite cell responses against intracellular pathogens such as those causing malaria, tuberculosis, or AIDS, have driven the development of new alternative adjuvants such as QS-21, a triterpene saponin purified from Quillaja saponaria. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to attempt to clarify the mechanism of action of QS-21 through either receptors or signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo with special emphasis on the co-administration with other immunostimulants in new adjuvant formulations, called adjuvant systems (AS). Furthermore, the most relevant clinical applications will be presented. METHODS: A literature search covering the period 2014–2018 was performed using electronic databases from Sci finder, Science direct, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Google scholar. RESULTS: Insights into the mechanism of action of QS-21 can be summarized as follows: 1) in vivo stimulation of Th2 humoral and Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through action on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells, leading to release of Th1 cytokines participating in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. 2) activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse APCs with subsequent release of caspase-1 dependent cytokines, Il-1β and Il-18, important for Th1 responses. 3) synthesis of nearly 50 QS-21 analogs, allowing structure/activity relationships and mechanistic studies. 4) unique synergy mechanism between monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL A) and QS-21, formulated in a liposome (AS01) in the early IFN-γ response, promoting vaccine immunogenicity. The second part of the review is related to phase I-III clinical trials of QS-21, mostly formulated in ASs, to evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of adjuvanted prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, e.g. malaria, herpes zoster, tuberculosis, AIDS and therapeutic vaccines against cancer and Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: The most advanced phase III clinical applications led to the development of two vaccines containing QS-21 as part of the AS, the Herpes Zoster vaccine (HZ/su) (Shingrix™) which received a license in 2017 from the FDA and a marketing authorization in the EU in 2018 and the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix™) against malaria, which was approved by the EMA in 2015 for further implementation in Sub-Saharan countries for routine use.","Lacaille-Dubois, Marie-Aleth",Phytomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152905; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711319300753; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711319300753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182297/,147

Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. The present study measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic in a sample of 3746 participants. We investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. Notably, objectively and subjectively assessed knowledge about COVID-19 were not significantly correlated. Objectively assessed knowledge was associated with fewer false memories but more true memories, suggesting a true discrimination between true and fake news. In contrast, participants who merely believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for true stories, but showed no reduction in false memories. Similarly, individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 reported an increase in true (but not false) memories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer memories for both true and fabricated stories, suggesting a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data indicate that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individual’s knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.","Greene, Ciara M.; Murphy, Gillian",Cogn Res Princ Implic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275199/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00262-1,147

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. Methods Cross-sectional snapshot survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. Findings Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2.0% (23/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35.70 (IQR:32.42-37.57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 1.38-8.67; p=0.008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. Interpretation The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.","Brown, C.; Clare, K.; Chand, M.; Andrews, J.; Auckland, C.; Beshir, S.; Choudhry, S.; Davies, K.; Freeman, J.; Gallini, A.; Moores, R.; Patel, T.; Poznalska, G.; Rodger, A.; Roberts, S.; Rooney, C.; Wilcox, M.; Warren, S.; Ellis, J.; Gopal, R.; Dunning, J.; Zambon, M.; Hopkins, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.20128876; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.14.20128876v1?rss=1,147

650453,Global survey of transfusion medicine curricula in medical schools: Challenges and opportunities,2020-10-22,"Patients with schizophrenia represent a vulnerable population who have been understudied in COVID-19 research. We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with schizophrenia and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50,750 patients were included, of whom 823 were schizophrenia patients (1.6%). The schizophrenia patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25.6% vs. 21.7%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.30 [95% CI 1.08–1.56], p = 0.0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23.7% vs. 28.4%; aOR 0.75 [95% CI 0.62–0.91], p = 0.0062) compared to controls. Significant interactions between schizophrenia and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (p = 0.0006 and p < 0.0001). Schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7.89%). schizophrenia patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13.93%) and schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (−15.44% and −5.93%, respectively). Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between schizophrenia patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of schizophrenia patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during and after hospitalization for reducing health disparities in this vulnerable population.","Fond, Guillaume; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Lançon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Boyer, Laurent",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753948/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448721000743; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448721000743,147
651328,Apolipoprotein D in Lipid Metabolism and Its Functional Implication in Atherosclerosis and Aging,2008-12-12,"Background The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in implementation of public health measures worldwide to mitigate disease spread, including; travel restrictions, lockdowns, messaging on handwashing, use of face coverings and physical distancing. As the pandemic progresses, exceptional decreases in seasonal respiratory viruses are increasingly reported. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on circulation of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and other seasonal respiratory viruses in Canada. Methods Epidemiologic data were obtained from the Canadian Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System. Weekly data from the week ending 30th August 2014 until the week ending the 13th February 2021 were analysed. We compared trends in laboratory detection and test volumes during the 2020/2021 influenza season with baseline pre-pandemic seasons from 2014 to 2019. Findings We observed a dramatically lower percentage of tests positive for all seasonal respiratory viruses during 2020-2021 compared to baseline. For influenza A and B the percent positive decreased to 0.0017 and 0.0061 times that of baseline respectively and for RSV, the percent positive dropped to 0.0145 times that of baseline. Ongoing detection of enterovirus/rhinovirus occurred, with regional variation in the epidemic patterns and intensity. Interpretation We report an effective absence of the annual seasonal epidemic of most seasonal respiratory viruses in 2020/2021. This dramatic decrease is likely related to implementation of multi-layered public health measures during the pandemic. The impact of such measures may have relevance for public health practice in mitigating seasonal respiratory virus epidemics and for informing responses to future respiratory virus pandemics.","Groves, H.

651708,NSFC spurs significant basic research progress of respiratory medicine in China,2015-08-12,"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is best known for its ability to regulate host immune responses; however, its direct antiviral activity is less well studied. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically important swine enteric coronavirus and causes acute diarrhea in piglets. At present, little is known about the function of IFN-γ in the control of TGEV infection. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-γ inhibited TGEV infection directly in ST cells and intestine epithelial IPEC-J2 cells and that the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-γ was independent of IFN-α/β. Moreover, IFN-γ suppressed TGEV infection in ST cells more efficiently than did IFN-α, and the combination of IFN-γ and IFN-α displayed a synergistic effect against TGEV. Mechanistically, using overexpression and functional knockdown experiments, we demonstrated that porcine interferon regulatory factor 1 (poIRF1) elicited by IFN-γ primarily mediated IFN-γ signaling cascades and the inhibition of TGEV infection by IFN-γ. Importantly, we found that TGEV elevated the expression of poIRF1 and IFN-γ in infected small intestines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, IFN-γ plays a crucial role in curtailing enteric coronavirus infection and may serve as an effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent against TGEV infection.","Shan, Lingling; Fu, Fang; Xue, Mei; Zhu, Xiangdong; Li, Liang; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385116/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-019-04362-2,147

For this, the participation of tourism in the economy of certain countries prior to the coronavirus crisis was measured by analysing three groups of countries: the ten most tourist countries in the world according to their receipts; countries whose economies are most dependent on tourism; and the twelve South American countries, contextualized through the other two groups. Thus, multiple combinations of high, low and medium sensitivity and vulnerability were identified for South American and for the countries with the highest absolute receipts from tourism, but an alarming scenario for the most dependent countries on international tourism, many of them small island countries in development (SIDS). Additionally, the ideas of low apparent sensitivity and that of low sensitivity due to role inversion offer new ways to interpret a low sensitivity. Likewise, and with respect to vulnerability, three possible stages of recovery of international tourism activity were noted.","Navarro-Drazich, Diego; Lorenzo, Cristian",Research in Globalization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590051X21000071; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590051X21000071,147

This virus causes a respiratory tract infection, symptoms include dry cough, fever, tiredness and in more severe cases, breathing difficulty. SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious virus that is spreading rapidly all over the world and the scientific community is working tirelessly to find an effective treatment. This paper aims to determine the origin of this virus by comparing its nucleic acid sequence with all members of the coronaviridae family. This study uses a new approach based on the combination of three powerful techniques which are: Ngrams (For text categorization), Principal Component Analysis (For dimensionality reduction) and Random Forest algorithm (For supervised classification). The experimental results have shown that a large set of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, collected from different locations around the world, present significant similarities to those found in pangolins. This finding confirms some previous results obtained by other methods, which also suggest that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of the new coronavirus.","El Boujnouni, Hamoucha; Rahouti, Mohamed; El Boujnouni, Mohamed",Inform Med Unlocked,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898732/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821000678?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821000678; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100577,147

653245,Asymptomatic Bordetella pertussis infections in young African infants and their mothers identified within a longitudinal cohort,2020-11-19,"IMPORTANCE: Chest pain is among the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations. However, most patients are at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with low cardiac adverse outcomes rates. Biomarker testing with troponin levels is key in the initial assessment for ACS. Although serial troponin testing can improve the diagnosis of ACS in clinical practice, some patients deemed to be low risk are discharged after a single negative troponin test result. OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical outcomes of patients discharged after a single negative troponin test result compared with patients discharged after serial troponin measurements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective cohort study of ED encounters from May 5, 2016, to December 1, 2017, across 15 community EDs within an integrated health care system in southern California. The study cohort includes 27 918 adult ED encounters in which patients were evaluated for suspected ACS with a HEART (history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin) score and an initial conventional troponin-I measurement below the level of detection (<0.02 ng/mL). Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2019, to December 1, 2020. EXPOSURE: Single troponin test vs multiple troponin tests. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality; secondary outcomes included coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, invasive coronary angiography, and unstable angina within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the association between testing strategies and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 27 918 patient encounters (16 212 women [58.1%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [15.2] years) were included in the study. Of patients with an initial troponin measurement below the level of detection, 14 459 (51.8%) were discharged after a single troponin measurement, and 13 459 (48.2%) underwent serial troponin tests. After adjustment for cardiac risk factors and comorbidities, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality within 30 days between the 2 groups (single troponin, 56 [0.4%] vs serial troponin, 52 [0.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.96-2.07]). Patients discharged after a single troponin test had lower rates of coronary artery bypass graft (adjusted odds ratio, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11-0.48]) and invasive coronary angiography (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38-0.56]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that patients are routinely discharged from the ED after a single negative troponin test result, and when compared with serial troponin testing, a single troponin test appears safe based on current physician decision-making, with no difference in rates of 30-day cardiac mortality and acute myocardial infarction, which are low in both groups.","Wassie, Maereg; Lee, Ming-Sum; Sun, Benjamin C.; Wu, Yi-Lin; Baecker, Aileen S.; Redberg, Rita F.; Ferencik, Maros; Shen, Ernest; Musigdilok, Visanee; Sharp, Adam L.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620444/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37930,147

The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas® (Roche) and the RealStar® assay (Altona). METHODS: Assessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas® assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMérieux). RESULTS: Overall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76 %. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99 %. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas® minus RealStar®) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison, both RealStar® and Cobas® assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar® assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","Wirden, Marc; Feghoul, Linda; Bertine, Mélanie; Nere, Marie-Laure; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Abdi, Basma; Boutolleau, David; Ferre, Valentine Marie; Jary, Aude; Delaugerre, Constance; Marcelin, Anne-Genevieve; Descamps, Diane; Legoff, Jérôme; Visseaux, Benoit; Chaix, Marie-Laure",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220303152; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104573; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220303152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769025/,147

This provides a crude first estimate of HIT, with more elaborate modelling required to arrive at a more realistic value. Early estimates of HIT for Covid-19 were based on this simplistic homogeneous approach, yielding high HIT values that have since been revised downwards with more sophisticated network modelling taking account of R0 heterogeneity and with reference to the low HIT found from serological sampling in Stockholm County. The aim of this paper is to describe a simple model in which host susceptibility is directly linked to the heterogeneous R0 distribution, to shed further light on the mechanisms involved and to arrive at a bimodal R0 distribution consistent with the Covid-19 HIT observed in Stockholm County.","Brennan, P.

Therefore, the study aimed to analyse the effect of wearing face masks on self-perceived dry mouth and halitosis. A questionnaire addressing the daily wearing time of different face masks (community masks, surgical/medical masks and KN95-/N95-/FFP2-masks) and self-perceived dry mouth and halitosis was given to adults attending or working at a university hospital. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and multiple linear regression analysis (p < 0.05). 3750 participants (age: 50.4 ± 15.5 years; 60.0% female) were included. During the pandemic, face masks were used for 4.7 ± 3.8 h per day: community masks: 0.9 ± 2.0 h, medical/surgical masks: 1.9 ± 2.8 h and KN95-/N95-/FFP2-masks: 1.9 ± 2.5 h per day. The use of face masks significantly increased self-perceived dry mouth and halitosis (both p < 0.001). Self-perceived dry mouth and halitosis increased with increasing wearing time (community masks: dry mouth: p < 0.001, halitosis: p = 0.014; medical/surgical masks: both: p < 0.001; KN95-/N95-/FFP2-masks: dry mouth: p < 0.001, halitosis: p = 0.011).

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted from a random sample of 733 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) obtained from a total of 4356 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases who presented to the Emergency Department of Montefiore Medical Center between March–June 2020. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital severe outcomes of COVID-19. A secondary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among the 733 patients included in our final analysis, 438 patients (59.8%) presented with anemia. 105 patients (14.3%) had mild, and 333 patients (45.5%) had moderate-severe anemia. Overall, 437 patients (59.6%) had a composite endpoint of severe outcomes. On-admission anemia was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% CI [1.01–2.30], p = 0.046) but not for composite severe outcomes. However, moderate-severe anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) on admission was independently associated with both severe outcomes (OR1.53, 95% CI [1.05–2.23], p = 0.028) and mortality (OR 1.67, 95% CI [1.09–2.56], p = 0.019) during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Anemia on admission was independently associated with increased odds of all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Furthermore, moderate-severe anemia (Hb <11 g/dL) was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Moving forward, COVID-19 patient management and risk stratification may benefit from addressing anemia on admission.","Oh, Seung Mi; Skendelas, John P.; Macdonald, Eric; Bergamini, Michael; Goel, Swati; Choi, Jaeun; Segal, Kathryn R.; Vivek, Kumar; Nair, Singh; Leff, Jonathan",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.03.083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895645/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721002709?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721002709,147

En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L'objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes: Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats: Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, morts de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail, ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions: Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. ABSTRACT Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Lemogne, Cédric; Yrondi, Antoine; Brunault, Paul; Bienvenu, Thomas; Etain, Bruno; Paquet, Claire; Gohier, Bénédicte; Bennabi, Djamila; Birmes, Philippe; Sauvaget, Anne; Fakra, Eric; Prieto, Nathalie; Bulteau, Samuel; Vidailhet, Pierre; Jollant, Fabrice; Camus, Vincent; Leboyer, Marion; Krebs, Marie-Odile; Aouizerate, Bruno",Encephale,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370984/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300762?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,147

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 250 Iranian pregnant women. Data was collected through questionnaires including demographic and obstetric characteristics, fear of COVID-19 and quality of life. An adjusted general linear model was used to determine the relationship between variables. RESULTS: There was a negatively significant relationship between fear of COVID-19 and quality of life (P <0.001). Based on the adjusted general linear model, it was expected that if COVID-19 fear score increased, the quality of life score would decrease significantly (B=-0.21, 95%CI: -0.34 to -0.09, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: This study indicated a reverse correlation between fears of COVID-19 and quality of life. Therefore, developing appropriate interventions in order to overcome the fear caused by COVID-19 are recommended to improve pregnant women’s quality of life.","Naghizadeh, Somayyeh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176577/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883941721000728?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883941721000728,147
661913,The application of DNA nucleotide footprint plotting in coronavirus,2020-05-21,"Technologies play an essential role in monitoring, managing, and self-management of chronic diseases. Since chronic patients rely on life-long healthcare systems and the current COVID-19 pandemic has placed limits on hospital care, there is a need to explore disease monitoring and management technologies and examine their acceptance by chronic patients. We systematically examined the use of smartphone applications (apps) in chronic disease monitoring and management in databases, namely, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Proquest, published from 2010 to 2020. Results showed that app-based weight management programs had a significant effect on healthy eating and physical activity (p = 0.002), eating behaviours (p < 0.001) and dietary intake pattern (p < 0.001), decreased mean body weight (p = 0.008), mean Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.002) and mean waist circumference (p < 0.001). App intervention assisted in decreasing the stress levels (paired t-test = 3.18; p < 0.05). Among cancer patients, we observed a high acceptance of technology (76%) and a moderately positive correlation between non-invasive electronic monitoring data and questionnaire (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001). We found a significant relationship between app use and standard clinical evaluation and high acceptance of the use of apps to monitor the disease. Our findings provide insights into critical issues, including technology acceptance along with regulatory guidelines to be considered when designing, developing, and deploying smartphone solutions targeted for chronic patients.","Moses, Jeban Chandir; Adibi, Sasan; Shariful Islam, Sheikh Mohammed; Wickramasinghe, Nilmini; Nguyen, Lemai",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356267/,147

From transcription to decay, cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) associate with specific proteins in order to regulate their entire cycle, including mRNA localization, translation and degradation, among others. The best characterized of such RNA-protein complexes, today named membraneless organelles, are Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs) which are involved in RNA storage and RNA decay/storage, respectively. Given that SGs and PBs are generally associated with repression of gene expression, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to counteract their assembly or to use them in their favor to successfully replicate within the host environment. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about the viral regulation of SGs and PBs, which could be a potential novel target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.","Gaete-Argel, Aracelly; Márquez, Chantal L.; Barriga, Gonzalo P.; Soto-Rifo, Ricardo; Valiente-Echeverría, Fernando",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681621/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00336,147

This study aimed to quantify LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14 and haptoglobin in the lungs throughout a PRCV infection. LBP and CD14 recognize LPS and enhance its endotoxic activity, whereas haptoglobin dampens it. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRCV (n = 34) or saline (n = 5) and euthanized 1–15 days post inoculation (DPI). Virus was detected in the lungs from 1 to 9 DPI. Cell-associated CD14 in lung tissue increased up to 15 times throughout the infection, due to an increase in highly CD14(+) monocyte-macrophages from 1 to 12 DPI and CD14(+) type 2 pneumocytes from 7 to 9 DPI. LBP and soluble CD14 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were elevated from 1–12 DPI, with up to 35- and 4-fold increases, respectively. Haptoglobin levels increased significantly (×4.5) at 7 DPI. In addition, we found that PRCV could sensitize the lungs to LPS throughout the infection, but the response to LPS appeared less enhanced at the end of infection (7 DPI). The marked increases in LBP, CD14 and haptoglobin were not correlated with the extent of the LPS response.","Van Gucht, Steven; Atanasova, Kalina; Barbé, Filip; Cox, Eric; Pensaert, Maurice; Van Reeth, Kristien",Microbes Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906000785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16697680/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457906000785,147
666522,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids in COVID-19,2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters the cells through a mechanism dependent on its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein highly expressed in the lungs. The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

Objective:These evidence-based guidelinesof the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionalsin decisions aboutthe use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19-related critical illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. Methods:ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel, including three patient representatives,and applied strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews(up to March 5, 2021).The panel prioritized clinical questionsand outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approachto assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. This is an update on guidelines published in February 2021. Results:The panel agreed on one additional recommendation. The panel issued a conditional recommendation in favor of prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 related-critical illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. Conclusions: This recommendation was based on low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for further high-quality, randomized controlled trials comparing different intensities of anticoagulation in critically ill patients. Other key research priorities include better evidence on predictors of thrombosis and bleeding risk in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the impact of non-anticoagulant therapies (e.g., antiviral agents, corticosteroids) on thrombotic risk.","Cuker, Adam; Tseng, Eric K.; Nieuwlaat, Robby; Angchaisuksiri, Pantep; Blair, Clifton; Dane, Kathryn; Davila, Jennifer; DeSancho, Maria T.; Diuguid, David; Griffin, Daniel O.; Kahn, Susan R.; Klok, Frederikus A.; Lee, Alfred Ian; Neumann, Ignacio; Pai, Ashok; Righini, Marc; Sanfilippo, Kristen M.; Siegal, Deborah; Skara, Mike; Terrell, Deirdra R.; Touri, Kamshad; Akl, Elie A.; Akl, Imad Bou; Bognanni, Antonio; Boulos, Mary; Brignardello-Petersen, Romina; Charide, Rana; Chan, Matthew; Dearness, Karin; Darzi, Andrea J.; Kolb, Philipp; Colunga-Lozano, Luis E.; Mansour, Razan; Morgano, Gian Paolo; Morsi, Rami Z.; Muti-Schünemann, Giovanna; Noori, Atefeh; Philip, Binu A.; Piggott, Thomas; Qiu, Yuan; Roldan, Yetiani; Schünemann, Finn; Stevens, Adrienne; Solo, Karla; Wiercioch, Wojtek; Mustafa, Reem A.; Schünemann, Holger J.",Blood Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474482/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2473952921004808?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005493; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2473952921004808,147

Currently almost every country in the world has reported cases with moderate to high mortality rates. The European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) are the severely affected countries. Nevertheless, the WHO is very much concern about countries with weak health systems. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varies extensively, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe as well as critical pneumonia with high mortality rates in the elderly and patients with co-morbid medical illness. Convalescent Plasma Therapy (CPT) has been successfully used in treating various viral disease outbreaks such as 1918 influenza pneumonia pandemic, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, Machupo virus, Junin virus, Lassa virus, Ebola etc. High-titer specific antibodies maybe capable of binding to Coronavirus- 19 (CoV-19) and neutralize the viral particles, inhibit entry to uninfected cells, and trigger potent effector mechanisms such as complement activation as well as phagocytosis. Therefore, in most countries with very weak health systems with no Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or trained ICU physicians, early initiation of CPT for severely COVID- 19 patients may be rewarding. Therefore, solidarity control trials on CPT for COVID- 19 patients involving large number of patients are urgently needed.","Richard, Seidu A.; Kampo, Sylvanus; Esquijarosa Hechavarria, Maite",Hematol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324480/; https://doi.org/10.4081/hr.2020.8630,147

Patient–ventilator asynchrony (PVA) occurs when ventilatory support does not match the needs of the patient and is associated with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Deep learning methods have shown a strong discriminative ability for PVA detection, but they require a large number of annotated data for model training, which hampers their application to this task. We developed a transfer learning architecture based on pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and used it for PVA recognition based on small datasets. The one-dimensional signal was converted to a two-dimensional image, and features were extracted by the CNN using pretrained weights for classification. A partial dropping cross-validation technique was developed to evaluate model performance on small datasets. When using large datasets, the performance of the proposed method was similar to that of non-transfer learning methods. However, when the amount of data was reduced to 1%, the accuracy of transfer learning was approximately 90%, whereas the accuracy of the non-transfer learning was less than 80%. The findings suggest that the proposed transfer learning method can obtain satisfactory accuracies for PVA detection when using small datasets. Such a method can promote the application of deep learning to detect more types of PVA under various ventilation modes.","Pan, Qing; Jia, Mengzhe; Liu, Qijie; Zhang, Lingwei; Pan, Jie; Lu, Fei; Zhang, Zhongheng; Fang, Luping; Ge, Huiqing",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21124149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204238/,147

In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected. For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.","Amariles, Pedro; Granados, Johan; Ceballos, Mauricio; Montoya, Carlos Julio",Res Social Adm Pharm,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120302874; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120302874; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265115/,147

While mostly idiopathic (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis or IRF), RPF is frequently associated with certain drugs, infections, and malignancies. It is thought to be immune-mediated because of response to steroids and RPF is commonly seen with other autoimmune diseases, especially IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IRF is also a part of the chronic aortitis syndromes and the presence of aortic aneurysms is another characteristic of this disease. A 63-year old woman presented with left-sided flank pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed left hydronephrosis from compression of the ureter by a retroperitoneal mass. A thoracoabdominal aneurysm was also noted. A [(18)F]- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed hypermetabolism in the mass, with no abnormally increased activity noted elsewhere. Within four months, the mass enlarged to involve the right ureter as well, leading to right hydronephrosis. She required bilateral ureteral stents and aneurysm repair. Biopsy of the mass showed dense fibrosis with a mononuclear cell infiltrate. The histology of the aneurysm specimen showed chronic periaortic inflammation. Laboratory investigations were significant for elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. She was referred to the rheumatology clinic to receive steroid treatment for IRF. IRF commonly involves the ureters and is diagnosed on CT scans during a workup for obstructive uropathy. The treatment is high dose steroids, while in resistant cases, other immunosuppressants have been used. The presentation of a patient with IRF can commonly mimic that of urinary calculi and malignancy.

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1×109 vp and 1×1010 vp elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers which was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these pre-clinical data confirm efficacy of a 1-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.","van der Lubbe, Joan E.M.; Rosendahl Huber, Sietske K.; Vijayan, Aneesh; Dekking, Liesbeth; van Huizen, Ella; Vreugdenhil, Jessica; Choi, Ying; Baert, Miranda R.M.; Feddes-de Boer, Karin; Gil, Ana Izquierdo; van Heerden, Marjolein; Dalebout, Tim J.; Myeni, Sebenzile K.; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J.; de Waal, Leon; Stittelaar, Koert J.; Tolboom, Jeroen T.B.M.; Serroyen, Jan; Muchene, Leacky; van der Fits, Leslie; Rutten, Lucy; Langedijk, Johannes P.M.; Barouch, Dan H.; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Zahn, Roland C.; Wegmann, Frank",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.425915,147

However, we know little about funder collaborations and the impact of collaboratively funded projects. As an initial effort towards this, we examine the co-funding network, where a funder represents a node and an edge signifies collaboration. Our core data include all papers that cite and receive citations by the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, a prominent clinical review journal. We find that 65% of clinical papers have multiple funders and discover communities of funders that are formed by national boundaries and funding objectives. To quantify success in funding, we use a g-index metric that indicates efficiency of funders in supporting clinically relevant research. After controlling for authorship, we find that funders generally achieve higher success when collaborating than when solo-funding. We also find that as a funder, seeking multiple, direct connections with various disconnected funders may be more beneficial than being part of a densely interconnected network of co-funders. The results of this paper indicate that collaborations can potentially accelerate innovation, not only among authors but also funders.","Vasan, Kishore; West, Jevin D.",Royal Society open science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34457332/,147

To avoid possible effects of physical, technical and psychological detraining, coaches looked for home training alternatives. The objectives of the study were to know how rhythmic gymnastics training developed during the lockdown period (the conditions, type of training, performance monitoring means, and determinants of gymnasts’ participation) and to provide recommendations for a possible future lockdown. Three hundred and two RG coaches from twenty-six different countries throughout the five continents and four professional levels took part in the study: national team (28), international (26), national (172) and regional (75). The data collection tool was a questionnaire consisting of 39 closed questions structured in three dimensions: identification data of the coaches, training data during confinement and gymnast participation data. The independent variable was the gymnasts’ performance levels and the dependent variables organized in four categories: the technical media used to conduct and monitor the training sessions, the type of training done, the mechanisms for monitoring training performance and the aspects that determined participation. Most coaches kept their gymnasts training during confinement, although 76.5% confirm abandonment of any of their gymnasts. The main means used were real-time video conferencing, although at the lower practice levels the media stand out in deferred time. The contents of the training were mainly body technique, physical preparation and body difficulties. For performance monitoring, challenges, physical, and technical tests were predominant. The determinants for the development of training in the confinement vary depending on the level of the gymnasts, connectivity and electronic resources at the highest level, and the availability of spaces and social distancing at lower levels. For future lockdowns, it is necessary to review the content of the trainings, as well as the performance evaluation and the means necessary for it.","Bobo-Arce, Marta; Sierra-Palmeiro, Elena; Fernández-Villarino, María A.; Fink, Hardy",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897567/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.658872,147
672666,Strategies for laboratory professionals to drive laboratory stewardship,2021-07-24,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history in the prevention and treatment of pandemics. The TCM formula Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD), also known as Qing Fei Pai Du Decoction, has been demonstrated effective against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIM OF THE STUDY: This work aimed to elucidate the active ingredients, targets and pathway mechanism of LCDD related to suppression of inflammatory, immunity regulation and relaxation of airway smooth muscle for the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mining chemical ingredients reported in LCDD, 144 compounds covering all herbs were selected and screened against inflammatory-, immunity- and respiratory-related GPCRs including GPR35, H1, CB2, B2, M3 and β2-adrenoceptor receptor using a label-free integrative pharmacology method. Further, all active compounds were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and an herb-compound-target network based on potency and content of compounds was constructed to elucidate the multi-target and synergistic effect. RESULTS: Thirteen compounds were identified as GPR35 agonists, including licochalcone B, isoliquiritigenin, etc. Licochalcone B, isoliquiritigenin and alisol A exhibited bradykinin receptor B2 antagonism activities. Atractyline and shogaol showed as a cannabinoid receptor CB2 agonist and a histamine receptor H1 antagonist, respectively. Tectorigenin and aristofone acted as muscarinic receptor M3 antagonists, while synephrine, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were β2-adrenoceptor agonists. Pathway deconvolution assays suggested activation of GPR35 triggered PI3K, MEK, JNK pathways and EGFR transactivation, and the activation of β2-adrenoceptor mediated MEK and Ca(2+). The herb-compound-target network analysis found that some compounds such as licochalcone B acted on multiple targets, and multiple components interacted with the same target such as GPR35, reflecting the synergistic mechanism of Chinese medicine. At the same time, some low-abundance compounds displayed high target activity, meaning its important role in LCDD for anti-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the active ingredients, targets and pathways of LCDD. This is useful for elucidating multitarget synergistic action for its clinical therapeutic efficacy.","Xu, Fangfang; Hou, Tao; Shen, Aijin; Jin, Hongli; Xiao, Yuansheng; Yu, Wenyi; Li, Xiaonong; Wang, Jixia; Liu, Yanfang; Liang, Xinmiao",J Ethnopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358653/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114488; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874121007170; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874121007170?v=s5,147

However, a number of ongoing clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of the medicines which have already been registered and used for the treatment of other diseases, in the treatment of the coronavirus infection. The proposed combinations of these medicines could potentially present a safety risk, since most of these medicines have the potential to cause numerous side or toxic effects, even when used in monotherapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to review and evaluate the literature data on the toxicity of the selected individual drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and umifenovir) and the available clinical data concerning the possible adverse effects of the selected drug combinations (lopinavir/ritonavir+umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir+interferon β, chloroquine+remdesivir, and chloroquine+azithromycin).

It was found effective against an array of pathogens including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Here, we evaluated its antileishmanial activity and possible mechanism of action through different in vitro and in silico experiments. It inhibited the growth and proliferation of the parasites significantly with a IC50 value of 1.019 ± 0.116 mM in vitro. It also reduced the growth of intra-macrophagic amastigotes with a IC50 value of 0.2858 ± 0.01398 mM. It induced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in parasites in a dose-dependent manner. Through 2,7-dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) staining, it was observed that around 96.9% parasites were ROS positive at 2.0 mM concentration of hesperidin. The ROS generated led to the apoptosis of parasites in a dose-dependent manner as observed by annexin/PI staining. Molecular docking with one of the very important and unique drug-targets of Leishmania donovani sterol C-24 reductase resulted in its significant inhibition. Here, we for the first time showed that hesperidin induced the antileishmanial response through the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of sterol C-24 reductase.

However, a breakthrough was reported here by the authors, with the introduction of ‘Cognitive Demodulation’. This bypassed the thermal time constant constraints normally associated with both the thermal emitter and sensor; allowing step-change increases in both Range and Bit Rate with direct electronic modulation. This paper concentrates on advancements to the bit error rate (BER) performance. Here, separate techniques are introduced to the demodulation software that, when combined, result in enhanced Cognitive Demodulation. A factor of more than 100 improvement in BER was demonstrated within the laboratory and approximately a 60-fold improvement in a non-laboratory environment; both at the maximum Range and Bit Rate of 2 m and 125 bps, respectively, demonstrated recently. Moreover, demodulation speed is increased by almost a factor of 10,000; allowing for real-time demodulation while easing future computational hardware requirements. In addition to these software advancements, the paper demonstrates important improvements in hardware that has brought the technology out of the laboratory, with field trials being performed within an office corridor.","Ren, Hang; Shin, Sang-Hee; Lucyszyn, Stepan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219319/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77262-0,147
674088,Effects of ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor on the expression levels of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in mice with viral myocarditis,2019-08-14,"Publisher Summary This chapter describes virus replication. Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.",,Fenner's Veterinary Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012375158400002X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012375158400002X,147

675380,Analogies Between Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and Enveloped Viruses with an Emphasis on Human Breast Cancer,2016-08-27,"Recently, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China. Due to its high level of contagion, it has already reached most countries, quickly becoming a pandemic. Although the most common symptoms are related to breathing problems, SARS-CoV-2 infections also affect the gastrointestinal tract culminating in inflammation and diarrhea. However, the mechanisms related to these enteric manifestations are still not well understood. Evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in host cells as a viral invasion mechanism and can infect the lungs and the gut. Other viruses have already been linked to intestinal symptoms through binding to ACE2. In turn, this medical hypothesis article conjectures that the ACE2 downregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 internalization could lead to decreased activation of the mechanistic target of mTOR with increased autophagy and lead to intestinal dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. Besides that, dysbiosis can directly affect the respiratory system through the lungs. Although there are clues to other viruses that modulate the ACE2/gut/lungs axis, including the participation of autophagy and dysbiosis in the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is still no evidence of the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, we propose that the new coronavirus causes a change in the intestinal microbiota, which culminates in a diarrheal process through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway into enterocytes. Our assumption is supported by premises that unregulated intestinal microbiota increases the susceptibility to other diseases and extra-intestinal manifestations, which can even cause remote damage in lungs. These putative connections lead us to suggest and encourage future studies aiming at assessing the aforementioned hypothesis and regulating dysbiosis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to confirm the decrease in lung injuries and the improvement in the prognosis of the disease.","de Oliveira, Ana Patrícia; Lopes, André Luis Fernandes; Pacheco, Gabriella; de Sá Guimarães Nolêto, Isabela Ribeiro; Nicolau, Lucas Antonio Duarte; Medeiros, Jand Venes Rolim",Med Hypotheses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720311518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254549/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110243; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720311518?v=s5,147

To better understand the resistant mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of 26 antibodies to wild-type (WT) spike protein and to the protein harboring E484K mutation, respectively. The results showed that most antibodies (~85%) have weaker binding affinities to the E484K mutated spike protein than to the WT, indicating the high risk of immune evasion of the mutated virus from most of current antibodies. Binding free energy decomposition revealed that the residue E484 forms attraction with most antibodies, while the K484 has repulsion from most antibodies, which should be the main reason of the weaker binding affinities of E484K mutant to most antibodies. Impressively, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination was found to have much stronger binding affinity with E484K mutant than WT, which may work well against the mutated virus. Based on binding free energy decomposition, we predicted that the mutation of four more residues on receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, viz., F490, V483, G485 and S494, may have high risk of immune evasion, which we should pay close attention on during the development of new mAb therapeutics.","Wu, Leyun; Peng, Cheng; Yang, Yanqing; Shi, Yulong; Zhou, Liping; Xu, Zhijian; Zhu, Weiliang",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553217/,147

Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore. METHODS: Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.","Ho, Hanley J; Zhang, Zoe Xiaozhu; Huang, Zhilian; Aung, Aung Hein; Lim, Wei-Yen; Chow, Angela",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412416/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19437,147

It has brought in several new challenges to deal with surgical emergencies. Herein, we report two suspected cases of COVID-19 that were operated during this “lockdown” period and highlight the protocols we followed and lessons we learned from this situation. Result Two patients from “red zones” for COVID-19 pandemic presented with acute abdomen, one a 64-year male, who presented with perforation peritonitis and another, a 57-year male with acute intestinal obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus. They also had associated COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 test could not be done at the time of their presentation to the hospital. Patients underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy assuming them to be positive for the infection. Surgical team was donned with full coverall personal protective equipment. Sudden and uncontrolled egression intraperitoneal free gas was avoided, Echelon flex 60 staplers were used to resect the volvulus without allowing the gas from the volvulus to escape; mesocolon was divided using vascular reload of the stapler, no electrosurgical devices were used to avoid the aerosolization of viral particles. Colostomy was done in both the patients. Both the patients turned out to be negative for COVID-19 subsequently and discharged from hospital in stable condition.

OBJECTIVES: During the early weeks of the 2009–2010 flu pandemic, a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two French University hospitals in Paris and Tours. Aims were to investigate the different pathogens involved in ILI and describe the associated symptoms. METHODS: H1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis was performed with real time RT-PCR assay. Other viral aetiologies were investigated by the molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19®. Clinical data were collected prospectively by physicians using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: From week 35 to 44, endonasal swabs were collected in 413 patients. Overall, 68 samples (16.5%) were positive for H1N1v. In 13 of them, other respiratory pathogens were also detected. Among H1N1v negative samples, 213 (61.9%) were positive for various respiratory agents, 190 in single infections and 23 in mixed infections. The most prevalent viruses in H1N1v negative single infections were rhinovirus (62.6%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (24.2%) and adenovirus (5.3%). 70.6% of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years and none after 65 years. There was no difference between clinical symptoms observed in patients infected with H1N1v or with other pathogens. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the high frequency of non-influenza viruses involved in ILI during the pre-epidemic period of a flu alert and the lack of specific clinical signs associated with influenza infections. Rapid diagnostic screening of a large panel of respiratory pathogens may be critical to define and survey the epidemic situation and to provide critical information for patient management.","Schnepf, Nathalie; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Chaillon, Antoine; Scemla, Anne; Gras, Guillaume; Semoun, Oren; Taboulet, Pierre; Molina, Jean-Michel; Simon, François; Goudeau, Alain; LeGoff, Jérôme",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21858150/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023514,147

The ocular involvement in COVID-19, both in the anterior and posterior segments, is increasingly being recognized by ophthalmologists. We report the fundus photographic and systemic findings in 25 patients without recent-onset visual symptoms who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to an isolation ward/ICU in Mumbai, India during June-August 2020 underwent a comprehensive clinical and systemic evaluation. We performed a fundus evaluation using a handheld fundus camera during their admission period. We conducted a retrospective case record review and extracted demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and fundus photographs from each case record. Results We screened 25 non-consecutive patients, and they included 20 (80%) men and five (20%) women, with ages ranging from 31 to 79 years (mean: 56.3 years). Systemically, the spectrum of severity on admission varied from mild to moderate to severely ill. The majority of the patients had no complaints of recent visual loss. An analysis of fundus photographs of 50 eyes of 25 patients revealed no evidence of fundus lesions in as many as 48 photographs. Two photographs of two eyes of patients showed incidental lesions. Conclusions We found no evidence of vascular, inflammatory, or thromboembolic disease that could be linked to COVID-19 infection in any of the images we studied; however, fundus examination may be utilized in patients with co-infection.","Mehta, Salil; Prabhudesai, Prahlad",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354456/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11512,147

The SNRT are micro-unit of household data that contains information on preferences and behavior. Through both objective and subjective measurements of the Household Financial Vulnerability Index (FVI), we find that the financial vulnerability of Indonesian households is not only strongly influenced by income factors, but also by finance-related behavioral characteristics and several socio-economic factors. As a consistency and robustness check, we also estimate econometric models using the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) panel data for the periods 1993, 1997, 2000, 2007 and 2014. Our study then conclude that the level of household financial vulnerability decreased in 2017.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the emergency department of three different hospitals (two coronavirus disease‐19 hubs). Demographics and data on acute pyelonephritis, acute kidney injury, urinoma, hematuria, inpatient admission/discharge home, and type of treatment were gathered and compared with the same periods in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 516 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 62.4% were male. Their mean age was 58.86 ± 16.24 years. The number of admissions decreased significantly, by 51.25% (P = 0.003), during lockdown compared to 2019 (78 vs 160 admissions). The number of admissions in the reopening phase (May–June 2020) was in line with that in 2019 (n = 138). The number of hospitalizations (P = 0.005), acute obstructive pyelonephritis (P = 0.019), and complications (P = 0.02) was statistically significantly higher during lockdown compared to 2019. The increase in the rate of surgical procedures nearly reached significance (P = 0.059). The odds of having complications and being hospitalized were almost fivefold (odds ratio 4.68, 95% confidence interval 1.98–11.07) and twofold greater (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.29–4.43) compared to the same period in 2019. No difference was noted between May–June 2020 and 2019. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease‐19 lockdown period provoked a meaningful reduction in symptomatic ureteral lithiasis admission. Most patients presented with complicated disease, which required an increased rate of interventional procedures compared to the equivalent period in 2019. Admissions reverted to normal levels during the reopening phase.","Castellani, Daniele; Ragonese, Mauro; Di Rosa, Mirko; Marzio, Vittorio; Di Gianfrancesco, Luca; Bassi, Pierfrancesco; De Dominicis, Mauro; Dellabella, Marco; Antonucci, Michele",Int J Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34159635/; https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.14612,147

Similarly, it has also affected the performance and well-being of the medical staff working during the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on medical training and psychological well-being of resident doctors practicing in the Western region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a quantitative cross-sectional study that included a survey distributed to resident physicians working in the western region in Saudi Arabia. The survey included questions on demographic data and factors influencing the academic training, attitude, and daily habits of the residents during the pandemic. Psychological impact was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Data analysis was executed using IBM SPSS version 26. RESULTS: A total of 121 residents responded to this survey. Of all respondents, 71.1% were junior residents, 66.9% had a medical specialty; and 33% were family medicine physicians, followed by 17% from general surgery. In regard to work amid the pandemic, 36.1% were in contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 35.5% had to work overtime during the pandemic. There was a non-significant difference detected between the residents regarding the factors negatively affecting their psychological well-being. CONCLUSION: Residents working during the pandemic in the Western area of Saudi Arabia were significantly affected by the pandemic from both professional and psychological perspectives. Further research on how the pandemic is affecting physicians in other areas in Saudi Arabia is needed.","Alshareef, Reem; Al Zahrani, Abdullah; Alzhrani, Meshari; Suwaidi, Abdulaziz; Alamry, Bander",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2173_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568139/,147

However, research on positive psychology interventions (PPIs) to develop such is still in its infancy. In this brief position paper, we summarize the status of PPIs in one of the positive psychology’s most important virtues: temperance. Temperance refers to the capacity to manage habits and protect against excess and is composed of forgiveness, humility, and (we include) patience. Specifically, we examine the current state-of-the-science in the conceptualization of temperance, explore the efficacy of temperance interventions, and reflect upon what the future may hold in this research domain. In this paper, we first highlight the challenges and opportunities for expanding the theoretical conceptualization of temperance and reflect upon the challenges in temperance-related PPIs. For each aspect of temperance, we propose a specific research agenda. Second, we explore what is needed for PPIs to promote temperance and how growth in temperance intervention research can be fostered. Generally, while forgiveness interventions are well established, we recommended that both humility and patience interventions need more viable evidence-based research on existing and new interventions. Third, we advanced several recommendations regarding how to promote more research in new interventions. These recommendations included attracting more funders to the area, developing new interventions, and employing new technology. Because intervention research in temperance is in its infancy, the future looks rosy for PPI researchers as we move into a second generation of positive psychology research.","Worthington, Everett L.; van Zyl, Llewellyn E.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484063/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.707598,147

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on non-operating room (OR) intubations from February 1–April 23, 2020. All patients undergoing emergency intubation outside the OR were eligible for inclusion. Data were entered using an airway procedure note integrated within the electronic health record. Variables included level of training and specialty of the laryngoscopist, the patient’s indication for intubation, methods of intubation, induction and paralytic agents, grade of view, use of video laryngoscopy, number of attempts, and adverse events. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing intubations with an available positive COVID-19 test result with cases that had either a negative or unavailable test result. RESULTS: We obtained 406 independent procedure notes filed between February 1–April 23, 2020, and of these, 123 cases had a positive COVID-19 test result. Residents performed fewer tracheal intubations in COVID-19 cases when compared to nurse anesthetists (26.0% vs 37.4%). Video laryngoscopy was used significantly more in COVID-19 cases (91.1% vs 56.8%). No difference in first-pass success was observed between COVID-19 positive cases and controls (89.4% vs. 89.0%, p = 1.0). An increased rate of oxygen desaturation was observed in COVID-19 cases (20.3% vs. 9.9%) while there was no difference in the rate of other recorded complications and first-pass success. DISCUSSION: An average twofold increase in the rate of tracheal intubation was observed after March 24, 2020, corresponding with an influx of COVID-19 positive cases. We observed adherence to society guidelines regarding performance of tracheal intubation by an expert laryngoscopist and the use of video laryngoscopy.","Hawkins, Andrew; Stapleton, Stephanie; Rodriguez, Gerardo; Gonzalez, R.

PURPOSE: To provide evidence of serum potassium changes in individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) concomitantly with spironolactone compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies including exposure to both spironolactone and ACEI/ARB therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. The primary outcome was serum potassium change over time. Main effects were calculated to estimate average treatment effect using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q and I 2. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: From the total of 1,225 articles identified, 20 randomized controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The spironolactone plus ACEI/ARB group included 570 patients, while the ACEI/ARB group included 547 patients. Treatment with spironolactone and ACEI/ARB combination therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone increased the mean serum potassium concentration by 0.19 mEq/L (95% CI, 0.12-0.26 mEq/L), with intermediate heterogeneity across studies (Q statistic = 46.5, P = 0.004; I 2 = 59). Sensitivity analyses showed that the direction and magnitude of this outcome did not change with the exclusion of individual studies, indicating a high level of reliability. Reporting risk of bias was low for 16 studies (80%), unclear for 3 studies (15%) and high for 1 study (5%). CONCLUSION: Treatment with spironolactone in combination with ACEI/ARB therapy increases the mean serum potassium concentration by less than 0.20 mEq/L compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. However, serum potassium and renal function must be monitored in patients starting combination therapy to avoid changes in serum potassium that could lead to hyperkalemia.","Villa-Zapata, Lorenzo; Carhart, Briggs S; Horn, John R; Hansten, Philip D; Subbian, Vignesh; Gephart, Sheila; Tan, Malinda; Romero, Andrew; Malone, Daniel C",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013341/,147

Visible cytopathic effects (CPE) could only be observed on days 3–5 post-infection in HrT-18G cell line inoculated with bear tissue extracts. The observed CPE in HrT-18G cells included syncytia, intranuclear inclusions, and cell detachments seen in herpesvirus infection in vitro. Herpesvirus-like particles were observed in viral culture supernatant under the electron microscope, however, capsids ranging from 60 nm to 100 nm in size were often observed in viral cultures within the first two passages of propagation. Herpesvirus infection in the bear tissues and tissue cultures were detected by PCR using degenerate primers specific to the DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) and glycoprotein B gene (gB). DNA sequencing of the amplicon revealed that the detected herpesvirus has 94–95% identity to Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 (UrHV-1) DNA sequences of DPOL. Phylogenetic analysis of DPOL sequences indicates that black bear herpesviruses and UrHV-1 are closely related and have small distances to members of Rhadinovirus. Interestingly, black bear herpesvirus infections were also found in bears without neurological signs. The DPOL DNA sequence of black bear herpesviruses detected in neurological bears were similar to the those detected in the non-neurological bears. However, the gB DNA sequence detected from the neurological bear is different from non-neurological bear and has only 64.5%–70% identity to each other.

Thus, in this study, we intend to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 in hematologic cancer patients and compare their outcomes with COVID-19 patients with solid cancers. The data of 926 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 463 hematologic cancer patients and an age-gender paired cohort of 463 solid cancer patients, were investigated retrospectively. The frequencies of severe and critical disease, hospital and ICU admission, MV assistance were significantly higher in hematologic cancer patients compared with the solid cancer patients (p = 0.001, p = 0.045, p = 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). The hospital stay was longer in patients with hematologic cancers (p = 0.001); however, the median ICU stay was 6 days in both groups. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 14.9% in patients with hematologic cancers, and it was 4.8% in patients with solid cancers, and there was a statistically significant difference regarding CFR between groups (p = 0.001). Our study revealed that COVID-19 patients with hematologic cancers have a more aggressive course of COVID-19 and have higher CFR compared to COVID-19 patients with solid cancers and support the increased susceptibility of patients with hematologic cancers during the outbreak.","Başcı, Semih; Ata, Naim; Altuntaş, Fevzi; Yiğenoğlu, Tuğçe Nur; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Korkmaz, Serdal; Namdaroğlu, Sinem; Baştürk, Abdülkadir; Hacıbekiroğlu, Tuba; Doğu, Mehmet Hilmi; Berber, İlhami; Dal, Kürşat; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Turgut, Burhan; Çelik, Osman; Ülgü, Mustafa Mahir; Birinci, Şuayip",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02784-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110562/,147

Similarly, long-term management practices for patients with CeD are also unknown in this region. AIMS: This study aimed to explore the perceptions and practices of Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists in diagnosing and managing patients with CeD. METHODS: Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists and trainees were invited to complete an anonymous online survey over a 3-week period. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 28 respondents, 24 from Australia and four from New Zealand. Tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA was the most frequently ordered initial serologic test. Fifteen (54%) respondents relied on duodenal biopsies for the confirmation of CeD, six (21%) followed the ESPGHAN guidelines and the remaining seven offered either biopsy confirmation or no-biopsy diagnosis according to the parents' wishes. Following diagnosis, five (18%) respondents discharged patients from care, three (11%) discharged patients after one follow-up visit, one (4%) reviewed patients for 12 months, six (21%) reviewed patients until celiac antibodies normalized and children were clinically asymptomatic, and 13 (46%) reviewed patients until transition to adult care. CONCLUSION: Tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA was the most common initial serologic test ordered by this group of Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists. Half of these physicians rely solely on duodenal biopsy for the confirmation of CeD diagnosis: a minority routinely use the ESPGHAN guidelines. Physicians reported a wide range of CeD follow-up practices. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10620-021-06988-2.","Ho, Shaun S.

687429,Educational Resource Review: Antibiotic resistance: people will die when antibiotics fail,2021-09-13,"During the last two decades, researchers have developed robust systems for recombinant subunit vaccine production in plants. Stably and transiently transformed plants have particular advantages that enable immunization of humans and animals via mucosal delivery. The initial goal to immunize orally by ingestion of plant-derived antigens has proven difficult to attain, although many studies have demonstrated antibody production in both humans and animals, and in a few cases, protection against pathogen challenge. Substantial hurdles for this strategy are low-antigen content in crudely processed plant material and limited antigen stability in the gut. An alternative is intranasal delivery of purified plant-derived antigens expressed with robust viral vectors, especially virus-like particles. The use of pattern recognition receptor agonists as adjuvants for mucosal delivery of plant-derived antigens can substantially enhance serum and mucosal antibody responses. In this chapter, we briefly review the methods for recombinant protein expression in plants, and describe progress with human and animal vaccines that use mucosal delivery routes. We do not attempt to compile a comprehensive list, but focus on studies that progressed to clinical trials or those that showed strong indications of efficacy in animals. Finally, we discuss some regulatory concerns regarding plant-based vaccines.","Mason, H. S.; Herbst-Kralovetz, M.

689017,Towards Building a Quantitative Proteomics Toolbox in Precision Medicine: A Mini-Review,2021-08-26,"The use of growth promoting and therapeutic antibiotics in piglet feed has been a concerning subject over the last few decades because of the risk of generating antimicrobial resistance that could be transferred to humans. As a result, many products have been proposed as potential alternatives to the use of antibiotics, and among these, spray dried plasma is considered one of the most promising. However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of spray dried plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of spray dried plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of spray dried animal plasma. Particular attention is given to studies in which spray dried plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products. Several studies on the possible modes of action for spray dried plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed. Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of spray dried plasma from porcine origin. Overall, spray dried plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase. Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial spray dried porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs.","Pérez-Bosque, Anna; Polo, Javier; Torrallardona, David",Porcine Health Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405442/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-016-0034-1,147
689760,Navigating sociocultural disparities in relation to infection and antibiotic resistance—the need for an intersectional approach,2021-10-01,"Given vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two critical issues arise: How timing of delivery of the second dose will affect infection dynamics and how it will affect prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a buildup of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose as compared with natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but that longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose and to ramp up vaccination efforts globally.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M.; Morris, Sinead E.; Metcalf, C.

Second, can it be attributed to other family members by measuring the health climate in one person? METHOD: In total, 261 female students and 196 mothers completed the FHC-Scale. The study instrument was a Persian version of the FHC-Scale prepared through a translation and back-translation process. RESULTS: The results showed that the Persian version of the FHC-Scale is acceptable. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for FHC-PA in female students and their mothers, respectively, was 0.88 and 0.86 for the whole scale. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for FHC-NU in female students and their mothers, respectively, was 0.83 and 0.92 for the whole scale. The CVI values for all the items were equal to or above 0.8, and the CVR value for the total scale was 0.90. CONCLUSION: The Persian version of the FHC-Scale is therefore an effective tool for evaluating the different dimensions of family health climate in the Iranian population.","Ostovarfar, Jeyran; Kaveh, Mohammad Hossein; Ghahramani, Leila; Karimi, Masoud; Asadollahi, Abdolrahim; Zare, Razie",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33628821/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8845716,147
690346,Enabling One Health solutions through genomics,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: The emergence in China in late 2019 and subsequent progression of a pandemic of a respiratory disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was highly facilitated by international travel. We present 5 cases of probable in-flight transmission in Greece. METHODS: We studied international passengers arriving to or departing from Greece from February 26 through March 9, 2020. Contact tracing extended up to 4 days before the onset of symptoms and focused on close contacts. Close contacts were defined as persons sitting within a distance of < 2 meters for > 15 minutes, including passengers seated two seats around the index case and all crew members and persons who had close contact with the index case. RESULTS: We investigated 18 international flights with 2224 passengers and 110 crew members. Main countries of departure included Northern Italy, Israel and the United Kingdom. In accordance with the national surveillance investigation, in these flights there were 21 index cases and 891 contact traced cases. Six index cases were symptomatic during the flight. Of the 891 contact traced cases, 4 passengers and 1 crew member developed laboratory-confirmed infection (3 with COVID-19 and 2 with asymptomatic infection); they travelled on the same flight with two COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Air travel has played a central role in the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are scarce data about in-flight transmission. Our extensive investigation showed five cases of probable in-flight transmission. Efforts should be placed in order to ensure the prompt implementation of appropriate infection control measures on board.","A, Pavli; P, Smeti; S, Hadjianastasiou; K, Theodoridou; A, Spilioti; K, Papadima; A, Andreopoulou; K, Gkolfinopoulou; S, Sapounas; N, Spanakis; A, Tsakris; HC, Maltezou",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949700/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101882; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920303781?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920303781,147
