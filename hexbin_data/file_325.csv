1898,Mechanical ventilation with heliox in an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome,2014-02-06,"BACKGROUND: Heliox has a lower density and higher diffusion capacity compared to oxygen-in-air. We hypothesized that heliox ventilation allows for a reduction in minute volume ventilation and inspiratory pressures needed for adequate gas exchange in an animal model of an acute lung injury. METHODS: After intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg), adult rats were randomized to ventilation with either a gas mixture of helium/oxygen (50:50%) or oxygen/air (50:50%). They were mechanically ventilated according to the ARDSnet recommendations with tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg and monitored with a pneumotachometer. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for markers of lung injury, and embedded lung sections were histologically scored for lung injury. RESULTS: Heliox limited the increase in driving pressures needed to achieve preset tidal volumes, with a concomitant decrease in loss of compliance. Heliox did neither allow for reduced minute volume ventilation in this model nor improve gas exchange. Also, heliox did not reduce lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Heliox modestly improved respiratory mechanics but did not improve lung injury in this rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Beurskens, Charlotte J; Aslami, Hamid; de Beer, Friso M; Roelofs, Joris JTH; Vroom, Margreeth B; Juffermans, Nicole P",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4513042/,325
4298,Risk modifiers of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis: a retrospective analysis of the FORECAST study,2020-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016–March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06–3.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06–0.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04–5.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05–1.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.","Iriyama, Hiroki; Abe, Toshikazu; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Fujishima, Seitaro; Ogura, Hiroshi; Shiraishi, Atsushi; Saitoh, Daizoh; Mayumi, Toshihiko; Naito, Toshio; Komori, Akira; Hifumi, Toru; Shiino, Yasukazu; Nakada, Taka-aki; Tarui, Takehiko; Otomo, Yasuhiro; Okamoto, Kohji; Umemura, Yutaka; Kotani, Joji; Sakamoto, Yuichiro; Sasaki, Junichi; Shiraishi, Shin-ichiro; Takuma, Kiyotsugu; Tsuruta, Ryosuke; Hagiwara, Akiyoshi; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Masuno, Tomohiko; Takeyama, Naoshi; Yamashita, Norio; Ikeda, Hiroto; Ueyama, Masashi; Fujimi, Satoshi; Gando, Satoshi",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954566/,325

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 159 consecutive adult patients with SARI admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital. A standard form was filled out in order to record demographic information, clinical parameters, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings of the patients. CURB-65, PSI, SIRS, qSOFA, SOFA and APACHE II scores were compared between the survivor and nonsurvivor groups. RESULTS: Of 159 patients included in the study, 38.4% were positive for respiratory viruses and 28.3% were positive for influenza viruses. 35.8% of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality rate was 36.5%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CURB-65, PSI, SIRS criteria, qSOFA, SOFA and APACHE II scores were 0.717, 0.712, 0.607, 0.683, 0.755, and 0.748, respectively in predicting mortality and 0.759, 0.744, 0.583, 0.728, 0.741, and 0.731, respectively in predicting ICU admission. CONCLUSION: SOFA and APACHE II were more accurate than SIRS in predicting the 28-day mortality among adults with SARI. There was no significant difference among these scores in terms of other multivariate comparisons.","AYDIN, Hakan; DOĞAN, Halil; ÖZÜÇELİK, Doğaç Niyazi; KOÇAK, Mehmet; GÜL, Osman Avşar",Turk J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7018304/,325
4521,Validation of neuromuscular blocking agent use in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized trials,2020-02-17,"In the present study, a new hepatic tissue‐origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L‐15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast‐like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15–32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune‐related molecules interferon regulatory factor‐7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.","Zheng, Zaiyu; Yang, Jinxian; Ge, Junqing; Chi, Hongshu; Chen, Bin; Fang, Qinmei; Gong, Hui",Cell Biol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7028054/,325
11014,Residual Neuromuscular Blockade and Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: What Does the Recent Evidence Demonstrate?,2020-03-27,"PURPOSE: To determine the mechanisms of injury associated with occupational injuries (OI) to genitourinary (GU) organs and compare GU OIs with GU non-OIs. METHODS: A single institution, retrospective study was conducted at a level 1 trauma center between 2010 and 2016 of all patients with GU injuries. OI was defined as any traumatic event that occurred in the workplace requiring hospital admission. Types of occupations were recorded in addition to the location of injury, mechanisms of injury, concomitant injuries, operative interventions, total cost, and mortality. GU OI patients were then compared to GU non-OI patients. RESULTS: 623 patients suffered a GU injury, of which 39 (6.3%) had a GU OI. Fall (43%) was the most common mechanism of injury; followed by motor vehicle collision/motorcycle crash (31%), crush injury (18%), and pedestrian struck (8%). The adrenal gland (38%) and kidney (38%) were the most commonly injured organs. There was no difference in mortality (13% GU OI vs. 15% GU non-OI, p = 0.70) or total direct cost ($21,192 ± 28,543 GU OI vs. $28,215 ± 32,332 GU non-OI, p = 0.45). Total costs were decreased with mortality from a GU injury (odds ratio (OR) 0.3, CI 0.26–0.59; p = < 0.001) and increased with higher injury severity scores (OR 1.1, CI 1.09–1.2; p = < 0.0001). Total costs were not affected by OI status. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational GU trauma presents with similar patterns of injury, hospital course, and direct cost as GU trauma that occurs in non-occupational settings.","Wenzel, Jessica L.; Dixon, Ashley N.; Patel, Anish B.; Webb, Jack C.; Satarasinghe, Praveen N.; Ali, Sadia; Brown, Carlos V.

11505,Acute respiratory distress syndrome-attributable mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis,2020-03-23,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. specific IgG antibodies in serum samples from precolostral lambs to determine the occurrence of transplacental transmission of Sarcocystis spp. in sheep. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 80 ewes and their respective lambs, immediately after lambing and before colostrum ingestion, respectively. The presence of anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was evaluated in serum samples using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Positive samples of the lambs were submitted to titration and IFAT to detect anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum specific IgG. RESULTS: Anti-Sarcocystis spp. IgG was detected in 62.5% of the ewes (50/80) and in 4% of the lambs of the seropositive ewes (2/50). None of the lambs from seronegative ewes were positive. The final titers of the positive lambs were 80. No cross reaction was detected among the positive samples to anti-Sarcocystis spp., anti-N. caninum, and anti-T. gondii IgG. The detection of anti-Sarcocystis spp. antibodies in serum samples of lambs deprived of colostrum suggests transplacental transmission of infection. Thus, the vertical transmission may be an alternative route of infection of Sarcocystis spp. also in sheep. Further studies are warranted to confirm transplacental transmission in sheep and to explain the importance of this infection pathway.","Minuzzi, Camila Encarnação; de Souza Rodrigues, Fernando; Marques, Camila Balconi; Gallina, Tiago; dos Santos, Thiago Cardoso; Portella, Luiza Pires; Bräunig, Patricia; Döhler, Alisson Rodrigues; Sangioni, Luis Antonio; Vogel, Fernanda Silveira Flores",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224054/,325

METHODS: We developed an individual-based transmission model to evaluate the impact of hand hygiene (HH) improvement and reduction in antibiotic use on the within-household transmission of ESBL-EC. We used data from the literature and incorporated key elements of ESBL-EC transmission such as the frequency and nature of contacts among household members, antibiotic use in the community and hand hygiene behaviour. We introduced in a household a single ESBL-EC colonised person and simulated the transmission dynamics of ESBL-EC over a one-year time horizon. RESULTS: The probability of ESBL-EC transmission depended on the household composition and the profile of the initial carrier. In the two-person household, the probability of ESBL-EC transmission was 5.3% (95% CI 5.0–5.6) or 6.6% (6.3–6.9) when the index person was a woman or a man, respectively. In a four-person household, the probability of transmission varied from 61.4% (60.9–62.0) to 68.8% (68.3–69.3) and was the highest when the index patient was the baby. Improving HH by 50% reduced the probability of transmission by 33–62%. Antibiotic restriction by 50% reduced the transmission by 2–6%. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of ESBL-EC is frequent in households and especially those with a baby. Antibiotic reduction had little impact on ESBL-EC. Improvement of hygiene in the community could help prevent transmission of ESBL-EC.","Kardaś-Słoma, Lidia; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Perozziello, Anne; Zahar, Jean-Ralph; Lescure, François-Xavier; Cousien, Anthony; Lucet, Jean-Christophe",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441222/,325

31822,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Resources,2020-04-11,"The term surveillance, derived from the French word meaning “to watch over,” may be defined as a system providing close observation of all aspects of the occurrence and distribution of a given disease through the systematic collection, tabulation, analysis, and dissemination of all relevant data pertaining to that disease.(1) The preferred term is public health surveillance, which emphasizes the focus of surveillance as discussed in this chapter to develop data that results in a public health preventive act ion. This distinguishes public health surveillance from other types of surveillance.(2) Although the methodology of surveillance is basically descriptive, its function is more than merely collective and archival.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This prospective, single-center study consisted of patients with solitary massive intermediate (stage B) HCC treated by RFA combined with TACE from October 1999 to December 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The survival rate of the patients for 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, and safety of the RFA treatment in the interim, total RFA for each case, and number of TACE cycles were evaluated. RESULTS Ninety-three patients (aged 54.4 ± 8.0 years) underwent RFA combined with TACE as a combined therapy, and they were analyzed and followed up until December 2013. The mean time for the initial ablation was 1.5-3 h, and, on average, each patient received 1.39 RFA and 1.43 TACE therapies. Overall, complete ablation was achieved in nine patients, and the majority of ablation was seen in 84 patients. The longest survival time was 102 months and, among the survivors the 1, 3, 5, and 7 year survival rate was 94.4%, 52.3%, 26.1%, and 14.1%, respectively. The median survival time was 36 months (95% confidence interval = 32.7-39.3). Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels showed significant correlation with tumor size in patients with HCC (r = 0.323, p = 0.0001). There were no major complications related to this therapy. CONCLUSION This was the first study that performed RFA combined with TACE in Chinese patients with intermediate (stage B) HCC. RFA combined with TACE, as a combined therapy for intermediate (stage B) HCC, seems to be a promising regimen that showed a satisfactory clinical effect, which may become a new therapy mode for HCC. However, a larger cohort and control group(s) reflecting usual standards of care are needed to assess the external validity of these results in a wider population.","Xu, Ruo-Cai; Liu, Han-Chun; Li, Jian-Liang; Li, Ke; Ou, Shuang-Yan; Yu, Zhi-Yuan; Kong, Yi; Ma, Guo-An; Shao, Wei-Shu",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2015.1058249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067770/,325

METHODS Eight trained volunteers cycled in 19 °C/1.8 kPa (COOL), 25 °C/1.2 kPa (NORM), and 34 °C/1.6 kPa (HOT), while maintaining an RPE of 16. Potential differences in S following the onset of exercise were assessed by comparing rates of esophageal temperature change (ΔT es/Δt); and estimated S values using a traditional two-compartment thermometric model (S therm) of changes in rectal (T re) and skin (T sk) temperature, and partitional calorimetry (S cal). RESULTS After 15 min of exercise, workload decreased more in HOT vs. COOL (P = 0.03), resulting in a shorter time (HOT: 40.7 ± 14.9 min; COOL: 53.5 ± 18.7 min; P = 0.04) to 70 % of initial workload. However, there were no preceding differences in ΔT es/Δt between conditions (P = 0.18). S therm values were different between HOT and COOL during the first 5 min of exercise (P < 0.05), primarily due to negative S therm values (-32 ± 15 kJ min(-1)) in COOL, which according to partitional calorimetric measurements, required improbably high (~56 kJ min(-1)) rates of evaporation when no sweating on the back and thigh was observed until after 7.6 ± 1.5 min and 4.8 ± 1.7 min of exercise, respectively. S cal values in the first 5 min of exercise confirmed S was actually positive in COOL (+21 ± 8 kJ min(-1)) and not negative. Different S therm values following the onset of exercise at different environmental temperatures are simply due to transient differences in the rate of change in T sk. CONCLUSION Reductions in self-paced exercise intensity in the heat are not mediated by early differences in S following the onset of exercise.","Ravanelli, Nicholas M; Cramer, Matthew N; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Carlsen, Anthony N; Jay, Ollie",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-014-2958-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091853/,325

Interestingly, many recent studies show that they can be efficiently used as drug delivery systems or as adjuvants to enhance vaccine efficacy. Our work focuses on the molecular mechanisms involved during the nanoprecipitation of PLA NPs from concentrated solutions of lactic acid polymeric chains, and their specific interactions with biologically relevant molecules. In this study, we evaluated the ability of a PLA-based nanoparticle drug carrier to vectorize either vitamin E or the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists Pam1CSK4 and Pam3CSK4, which are potent activators of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. We used dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to simulate large systems mimicking the nanoprecipitation process for a complete NP. Our results evidenced that after the NP formation, Pam1CSK4 and Pam3CSK4 molecules end up located on the surface of the particle, interacting with the PLA chains via their fatty acid chains, whereas vitamin E molecules are buried deeper in the core of the particle. Our results allow for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of the PLA NPs and their interactions with biological molecules located either on their surfaces or encapsulated within them. This work should allow for a rapid development of better biodegradable and safe vectorization systems with new drugs in the near future.","Megy, Simon; Aguero, Stephanie; Da Costa, David; Lamrayah, Myriam; Berthet, Morgane; Primard, Charlotte; Verrier, Bernard; Terreux, Raphael",Nanomaterials,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10112209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167538/,325
64884,Factors Associated With Death in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the US.,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND Critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation require frequent suctioning of airway secretion. Closed suction permits suctioning without disconnection from ventilator; so it might decrease hypoxemia and infection rate. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the effect of closed tracheal suction system (CTSS) versus open tracheal suction system (OTSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a prospective randomized study, which was carried on 100 patients in surgical Intensive Care Unit requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours from June 2012 to November 2013. In two groups, suction was performed based on the patients' need as well as physician's or nurses' decision on tracheal secretions. Patients randomly allocated into two groups (50 patients each): CTSS group and OTSS group. Patients were monitored for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during the study. Throat samples were taken on admission and two times per week from each patient. Tracheal samples were performed during endotracheal intubation, two times per week during mechanical ventilation and during extubation. RESULTS Drainage of subglottic secretions decreased the incidence of VAP (P < 0.05). Also type of the pharmacologic medicine for stress ulcer prophylaxis has significant effect on VAP incidence. Among the patients in OTSS and CTSS groups, 20% and 12% developed VAP, respectively. Use of CTSS compared with OTSS did not show statistically significant effect on VAP incidence in multivariate analysis; however, OR (odds ratio) tended to identify OTSS as an exposure factor for the development of VAP (OR = 1.92; CI = 0.45-8.30; = 0.38) compared with the CTSS. Higher levels of APACHE II score, sinusitis and tracheostomy put the patients at the risk of VAP. However, using heat and moisture exchanger (HME) instead of humidifier decreased this risk. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results obtained from our study, impact of suctioning is similar between CTSS and OTSS regarding the occurrence of VAP. It seems that physicians must consider many factors such as duration of mechanical ventilation, comorbidities, oxygenation parameters, number of required suctioning, and the cost prior to using each type of tracheal suction system.","Hamishekar, Hadi; Shadvar, Kamran; Taghizadeh, Majid; Golzari, Samad Ej; Mojtahedzadeh, Mojtaba; Soleimanpour, Hassan; Mahmoodpoor, Ata",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.5812/aapm.21649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25729677/,325

Immune correlates, used to predict vaccine efficacy, have proved difficult to find for IBV-vaccine-induced protection. To find correlates of IBV-vaccine-induced protection, hence, we employed a flow cytometric assay to quantify peripheral leucocyte subsets and expression of cell surface markers of six different non-vaccinated and vaccinated Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes. Non-vaccinated and vaccinated MHC haplotypes presented differential leucocyte composition and IBV viral load. A strong effect of MHC-B, but not vaccination, on several leucocyte subsets resulted in positive correlations with IBV viral load based on MHC haplotype ranking. In addition, a strong effect of MHC-B and vaccination on monocyte MHC-II expression showed that animals with highest monocyte MHC-II expression had weakest vaccine-induced protection. In conclusion, we found several interesting MHC-B related immune correlates of protection and that flow cytometric analysis can be employed to study correlates of IBV-vaccine-induced protection.","Larsen, Frederik T; Bed'Hom, Bertrand; Naghizadeh, Mohammad; Kjærup, Rikke B; Zohari, Siamak; Dalgaard, Tina S",Developmental and comparative immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2019.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763593/,325

Low porosity, high metal coverage, and high pore density are the main properties of FD stents. These properties induce hemodynamic changes redirecting the blood flow away from the aneurysm and into the parent artery leading to gradual thrombosis of the aneurysm. FD stents also provide scaffolding for subsequent neoendothelial proliferation, and vessel wall remodeling. This is considered as a paradigm shift compared to prior endovascular methods, which predominantly aimed at providing treatment inside the aneurysmal sac. This paper describes in detail the first released FD stent, the Silk flow-diverter stent (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), its mechanism of action and deployment technique. It reviews the pertinent literature regarding safety, efficacy and potential risks and complications associated with the use of this stent.","Alghamdi, Faisal; Morais, Ricardo; Scillia, Pietro; Lubicz, Boris",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1586/17434440.2015.1093413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415045/,325

71380,Countries with High Registered Nurse (RN) Concentrations Observe Reduced Mortality Rates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2020-04-09,"PURPOSE Lacunar infarcts are thought to result from occlusion of small penetrating arteries due to microatheroma and lipohyalinosis, pathognomonic for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Concurrent embolic ischemic lesions indicate a different stroke mechanism. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic infarcts on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). METHODS All patients screened for the WAKE-UP trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01525290) were reviewed for acute lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic lesions on baseline DWI. Clinical characteristics and outcome were compared between lacunar infarct patients with and without concurrent embolic lesions. RESULTS Of 244 patients with an acute lacunar infarct, 20 (8.2%) had concurrent acute embolic infarcts. Compared to patients with a lacunar infarct only, patients with concurrent embolic infarcts were older (mean age 69 years vs. 63 years; p = 0.031), more severely affected (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 5 vs. 4; p = 0.046), and-among those randomized-had worse functional outcome at 90 days (median modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3 vs. 1; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION Approximately 8% of lacunar infarct patients show concurrent embolic lesions suggesting a stroke etiology other than CSVD. These patients are more severely affected and have a worse functional outcome illustrating the need for a thorough diagnostic work-up of possible embolic sources even in patients with an imaging-defined diagnosis of lacunar infarcts.","Barow, Ewgenia; Boutitie, Florent; Cheng, Bastian; Cho, Tae-Hee; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Ford, Ian; Galinovic, Ivana; Nickel, Alina; Puig, Josep; Roy, Pascal; Wouters, Anke; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin; Muir, Keith W; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Pedraza, Salvador; Simonsen, Claus Z; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00800-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161343/,325

Metals are present either as impurities or added intentionally in creams and may have toxic effects on users. The present study was carried out to determine the content of metals such as mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) in fifteen skin-whitening creams marketed at local shops in Islamabad, Pakistan. The concentrations of metals were analyzed by inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) after digestion with a mixture of HNO3, HCl, and H2O2. The skin-whitening creams were found to have metal concentrations in parts per million (ppm) in the following range: Hg (1.0-18,210 ppm), Co (0.1992-1.9931 ppm), Cr (1.0453-2.7455 ppm), Cu (0.6987-0.1997 ppm), Fe (8.8868-28.6213 ppm), Ni (0.7487-1.5958 ppm), Pb (0.2997-4.7287 ppm), and Zn (7819.2-39,696.7 ppm). As and Cd were not detected in any of the fifteen skin-whitening creams. Only one cream (L'Oréal Paris White Perfect) was found in safe limits defined by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetics.

However, the instability caused by chemical degradation of its surface has posed a severe challenge for its further applications. A focused BP/polymer strategy has more recently been developed and implemented to hurdle this issue, so at present BP/polymers have been developed that exhibit enhanced stability, as well as outstanding optical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. This has promoted researchers to further explore the potential applications of black phosphorous. In this review, the preparation processes and the key properties of BP/polymers are reviewed, followed by a detailed account of their diversified applications, including areas like optoelectronics, bio-medicine, and energy storage.

In Experiment 1, eggs were collected from day 1 to day 13 post-inoculation (p.i.) from unvaccinated laying hens challenged with IBV wild strains T and N1/88 and from a negative control group of hens. In Experiment 2, eggs were collected from 2 to 22 days p.i. from unvaccinated and vaccinated laying hens challenged with either a wild or a vaccine strain of IBV. In Experiment 1, there was a significant effect (P < 0.05) of day p.i. and of viral strain on shell reflectivity, L* and protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) in eggshells, with and without cuticle. The mean PP IX/g of shell with and without cuticle was significantly higher on day 1 p.i. compared to day 7, after which PP IX increased with day p.i. In Experiment 2, shell reflectivity and L* increased and PP IX decreased with increased day p.i. until day 12. Shell reflectivity and L* decreased slightly after day 12 and increased again towards day 22. Shell reflectivity, L* and PP IX were not significantly different for eggshells from unvaccinated and vaccinated laying hens in the intact eggshell, but were significantly different in shells from which cuticle had been removed.

There are limited published data regarding the specific epidemiology, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of diarrhea after SOT in children. Pediatric SOT recipients have an increased risk of developing diarrhea because of a generalized immunosuppressed state, epidemiologic exposures, and polypharmacy. There is a need to standardize the diagnostic evaluation of diarrhea in children after SOT to facilitate an accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. Herein, we review the available published data and propose a systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation of diarrhea in this high-risk population, focusing on timely diagnosis of both infectious and non-infectious causes, in order to provide focused management. Prospective studies are needed to better assess the true prevalence, risk factors for, etiologies, and complications of diarrhea in pediatric SOT patients that will guide optimal management.

Astragali Radix (AR) and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR) are widely used as traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine, but the systemic mechanism is not well understood. Therefore, a strategy based on network pharmacology and molecular docking was designed to explore the systemic mechanism of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. After a series of bioinformatics assays, seven kernel targets were obtained, including TNF, IL6, IFNG, IL1B, IL10, IL4, and TLR9. And seven key compounds were identified as the synergy components of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia, the four key compounds belonging to AR were (3R)-3-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-chromanol, formononetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, the three key compounds belonging to AMR were atractylone, 14-acetyl-12-senecioyl-2E, 8E, 10E-atractylentriol, and α-Amyrin. The crucial pathways were mainly related to three modules, including immune diseases, infectious disease, and organismal systems. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms of AR-AMR regulating pneumonia were closely related to the correlation between inflammation and immune response. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Astragali radix and Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma can be used as ""medicine-food homology"" for dietary supplement. AR and AMR are widely used as a traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine. The AR-AMR herb pairs are used for compatibility many times in the recommended prescriptions in COVID-19 develop pneumonia in China.

METHODS A single colostrum sample was collected, by complete udder evacuation, from each of 20 cows from 29 dairy herds in the Waikato region of New Zealand during the 2016 spring calving period. Vaccination pre-partum with a calf diarrhoea vaccine was used in 15 herds. Each colostrum sample was tested using a digital Brix refractometer. The body condition score of each cow was recorded at the time of sample collection and farmers provided records of clinical mastitis and facial eczema from the previous 12 months, as well as the age and breed of cows. Associations between cow-level variables in non-vaccinated herds and Brix were examined using a multivariable linear mixed model and estimated marginal means obtained for different categories. RESULTS Mean Brix of 281 samples from cows in non-vaccinated herds was 18.7 (SD 0.26)%; 63/281 (22.4%) samples had Brix ≥22% and 152/281 (54.1%) had Brix ≥18%. Mean Brix of colostrum samples from cows aged ≥6 years (20.2 (95% CI=19.1-21.2)%) was higher than for samples from 2-year-old cows (18.6 (95% CI=17.3-19.9)%) (p=0.005). Colostrum that was collected at the first milking on the day of calving had higher Brix (20.0 (95% CI=19.1-20.9)%) than colostrum collected from cows that calved the previous day (17.5 (95% CI=16.5-18.4)%) (p<0.001). Mean Brix of colostrum samples from cows which produced ≥8 L (18.2 (95% CI=17.1-19.2)%) tended to be lower than from cows which produced <8 L first-milking colostrum (19.1 (95% CI=18.3-20.0)%) (p=0.08). Among vaccinating herds, 9/15 (60%) had ≥60% colostrum samples with Brix ≥18% compared with 4/14 (29%) of non-vaccinating herds (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Colostrum quality, as measured by Brix, was associated with the total volume of first-milking colostrum, interval from calving to colostrum collection and cow age. Vaccination against calf diarrhoea was associated with a higher proportion of colostrum samples with adequate Brix. Careful selection of colostrum donor cows should ensure newborn calves are fed adequate quality colostrum which should be beneficial in preventing failure of passive transfer of IgG. Testing of colostrum from individual cows with a Brix refractometer is advocated for the selection of colostrum for feeding newborn calves.","Denholm, K S; McDougall, S; Chambers, G; Clough, W",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2017.1418684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29268053/,325

METHODS Between December 2004 and July 2008, 76 patients undergoing a LVHR were randomized between mesh fixation using a double row of spiral tackers (DC) (n = 33) and mesh fixation with transfascial sutures combined with one row of spiral tackers (S&T) (n = 43), in the WoW trial (with or without sutures). Patients were clinically examined and evaluated using a visual analog scale for pain (VAS) in rest and after coughing 4 h post-operatively, after 4 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Primary endpoint of the study was abdominal wall pain, defined as a VAS score of at least 1.0 cm, at 3 months post-operative. Quality of life was quantified with the SF-36 questionnaire preoperatively and after 3 months. Secondary endpoint was the recurrence rate at 24-month follow-up. RESULTS The DC and S&T group were comparable in age, gender, ASA score, BMI, indication, hernia, and mesh variables. The DC group had a significant shorter operating time compared with the S&T group (74 vs 96 min; p = 0.014) and a significant lower mean VAS score 4 h post-operatively (in rest; p = 0.028/coughing; p = 0.013). At 3 months, there were significant more patients in the S&T group with VAS score ≥1.0 cm (31.4 vs 8.3 %; p = 0.036). Clinical follow-up at 24 months was obtained in 63 patients (82.9 %). The recurrence rate at 24 months was 7.9 % overall (5/63). There were more recurrences in the S&T group (4/36) than in the DC group (1/27), but this difference was not significant (11.1 vs 3.7 %; p = 0.381). CONCLUSION We found that double-crown fixation of intra-peritoneal mesh during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair was quicker, was less painful immediately post-operative and after 3 months, and did not increase the recurrence rate at 24 months. In hernias at a distance from the bony borders of the abdomen, transfascial sutures can be omitted if a double crown of tackers is placed.","Muysoms, F; Vander Mijnsbrugge, G; Pletinckx, P; Boldo, E; Jacobs, I; Michiels, M; Ceulemans, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-013-1084-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23546864/,325

We examined the causal role of urinary sodium in these CVDs and risk factors using Mendelian randomization. METHODS We identified strong, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of urinary sodium from the most up to date genome wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 446,237) and applied them to GWAS of stroke and its subtypes (40,585 cases and 406,111 non-cases), atrial fibrillation (60,620 cases and 970,216 non-cases) and heart failure (47,309 cases and 930,014 non-case). We assessed the impact of sodium on these diseases and associated risk factors using inverse variance weighting. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median, contamination mixture method, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. RESULTS Higher log transformed urinary sodium was associated with higher risk of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.08), ischemic stroke (OR 1.60 95% CI 1.12 to 2.30), heart failure (OR 1.77 95% CI 1.19 to 2.62), and type 2 diabetes (OR 4.17 95% CI 1.53 to 11.35).

Recently, global diagnosis companies have developed new dPCR equipment. In line with the development, the Lab On An Array (LOAA) dPCR analyzer (Optolane) was launched last year. The LOAA dPCR is a semiconductor chip-based separation PCR type equipment. The LOAA dPCR includes Micro Electro Mechanical System that can be injected by partitioning the target gene into 56 to 20,000 wells. The amount of target gene per wells is digitized to 0 or 1 as the number of well gradually increases to 20,000 wells because its principle follows Poisson distribution, which allows the LOAA dPCR to perform precise absolute quantification. LOAA determined region of interest first prior to dPCR operation. To exclude invalid wells for the quantification, the LOAA dPCR has applied various filtering methods using brightness, slope, baseline, and noise filters. As the coronavirus disease 2019 has now spread around the world, needs for diagnostic equipment of point of care testing (POCT) are increasing. The LOAA dPCR is expected to be suitable for POCT diagnosis due to its compact size and high accuracy.

While selected series have indicated feasibility, we prospectively examined its usefulness for resectional surgery in routine practice. METHOD All patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection over a 12-month period were considered for a single-access approach by a single surgical team in a university hospital. This utilized a 'glove' port via a 3-5 cm periumbilical or stomal site incision, with standard rigid laparoscopic instruments then being used. RESULTS Of 76 planned laparoscopic colorectal resections, 35 (47%) were performed by this single-incision laparoscopic modality without disruption of theatre list efficiency or surgical training obligations. The mean (range) age and body mass index of these 25 consecutive right-sided resections, eight total colectomies (seven urgent operations) and two anterior resections was 58 (22-82) years and 23.9 (18.6-36.2) kg/m(2) , respectively. The modal postoperative day of discharge was 4. For right-sided resections, the mean (range) postoperative stay in those undergoing surgery for benign disease was 4.0 days, while for those undergoing operation for neoplasia (n=18, mean age 71 years) it was 5.8 days and the average lymph node harvest was 13. Use of the glove port reduced trocar cost by 58% (€60/£53) by allowing the use of trocar sleeves alone without obturators. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is an effective option for abdominal surgery and seems especially suited for laparoscopic-assisted right-sided colonic resections. The glove port technique facilitates procedural frequency and familiarity and proves economically favourable.","Baig, M N; Moftah, M; Deasy, J; McNamara, D A; Cahill, R A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.02966.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22309248/,325

If negative, a unilateral TEP groin hernia repair was performed (UNIH). Carolina's comfort scales (CCS) and visual analogue scores (VAS) were recorded at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, while a modified CCS (MCCS) was recorded for all patients preoperatively. RESULTS Bilateral TEP repair resulted in higher VAS scores than unilateral repair at 2 weeks but not 6 weeks. CCS were worse in the USBH group than UNIH group at 2 weeks but were similar by 6 weeks. Complications' rates were similar amongst all 3 groups. Factors contributing to worse scores were: smaller hernia, complications, worse preoperative MCCS results, recurrent hernia and bilateral rather than unilateral repair. CONCLUSION Bilateral TEP for the clinically unilateral groin hernia with an occult contralateral groin hernia can be performed without increased morbidity, accepting a minor and very temporary impairment of QoL.","Malouf, Phillip A; Descallar, Joseph; Berney, Christophe R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5771-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28791478/,325

The minuscule yield strain and similarly small Brownian particle displacement of solid emulsions close to this transition suggests that this catastrophic failure corresponds to a plastic-entropic instability: the solid becomes too soft and weak to resist the thermal agitation of the droplets that compose it and fails. We propose a modified Lindemann stability criterion to describe this transition and derive a scaling law for the critical osmotic pressure that agrees quantitatively with experimental observations.","Guerra, Rodrigo E",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.218001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530672/,325
103162,Experience of an acute old age psychiatric ward in the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the UK.,2020-08-31,"OBJECTIVE Endovascular abdominal aortic repair requires an adequate sealing zone. The chimney graft (CG) technique may be the only option for urgent high-risk patients who are unfit for open repair and have no adequate sealing zone. This single-center experience provides long-term results of CGs with endovascular repair for urgent and complex aortic lesions. METHODS Between July 2006 and October 2012, 51 patients (16 women) with a median age of 77 years (interquartile range, 72-81 years), were treated urgently (within 24 hours [61%]) or semiurgently (within 3 days [39%]) with endovascular aortic repair and visceral CGs (n = 73). Median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 0.8-5.0 years) for the whole cohort, 3 years for 30-day survivors, and 4.8 years for patients who are still alive. RESULTS Five patients (10%) died within 30 days. All of them had a sacrificed kidney. All-cause mortality was 57% (n = 29), but the chimney- and procedure-related mortality was 6% (n = 3) and 16% (n = 8), respectively. Chimney-related death was due to bleeding, infection, renal failure, and multiple organ failure. There were two postoperative ruptures; both were fatal although not related to the treated disease. The primary and secondary long-term CG patencies were 89% (65 of 73) and 93% (68 of 73), respectively. Primary type I endoleak (EL-I) occurred in 10% (5 of 51) of the patients, and only one patient had recurrent EL-I (2%; 1 of 51). No secondary endoleak was observed. Chimney-related reintervention was required in 16% (8 of 51) of the patients because of EL-I (n = 3), visceral ischemia (n = 4), and bleeding (n = 2). The reinterventions included stenting (n = 5), embolization (n = 3), and laparotomy (n = 2). Thirty-one visceral branches were sacrificed (9 celiac trunks, 9 right, and 13 left renal arteries). Among the 30-day survivors, 8 of 17 patients (47%) with a sacrificed kidney required permanent dialysis; of these, seven underwent an urgent index operation. The aneurysm sac shrank in 63% (29 of 46) of cases. CONCLUSIONS The 6% chimney-related mortality and 93% long-term patency seem promising in urgent, complex aortic lesions of a high-risk population and may justify a continued yet restrictive applicability of this technique. Most endoleaks could be sealed endovascularly. However, sacrifice of a kidney in this elderly cohort was associated with permanent dialysis in 47% of patients.","Bin Jabr, Adel; Lindblad, Bengt; Kristmundsson, Thorarinn; Dias, Nuno; Resch, Timothy; Malina, Martin",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.09.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527423/,325

A primer for intensivists.,2020-08-04,"PURPOSE We examined the hypothesis that 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane and sevoflurane provides different depth of anesthesia. METHODS One hundred and twenty young (20-30 years), middle-aged (31-65 years), and elderly (66-80 years) patients were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane or sevoflurane (n = 20, each group). General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg bolus and remifentanil 0.25 µg/kg/min, which was stopped after tracheal intubation. Maintenance of anesthesia was started with an end-tidal concentration of desflurane or sevoflurane at age-adjusted 1 MAC and maintained for 10 min, followed by 1-min assessment of bispectral index (BIS), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and amplitude of the electroencephalogram taken at 10-s intervals. RESULTS BIS and SEF95 in patients receiving 1 MAC desflurane were significantly lower than those receiving 1 MAC sevoflurane including all age groups [35 (29, 39) vs. 41 (38, 49); 12.53 (10.99, 13.95) Hz vs. 14.42 (12.99, 17.17) Hz median (25, 75 percentile), respectively, P < 0.001 for both]. Both BIS and SEF95 in young patients were lower than in middle-aged and elderly patients receiving either desflurane or sevoflurane (P < 0.001 for both). There were no differences in amplitude between patients receiving desflurane and sevoflurane. CONCLUSIONS BIS as well as SEF95 were lower in patients receiving 1 MAC desflurane than those receiving 1 MAC sevoflurane, suggesting that desflurane provides higher depth of anesthesia than sevoflurane at 1 MAC.","Kanazawa, Shinya; Oda, Yutaka; Maeda, Chika; Okutani, Ryu",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-017-2391-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28791477/,325

For competing risks data, the corresponding quantities of interest are cause-specific hazard ratios (cHRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs). However, they both have some limitations related to model assumptions and clinical interpretation. Therefore, we recommend restricted mean time lost (RMTL) as an alternative that is easy to interpret in a competing risks framework. Based on the difference in restricted mean time lost (RMTLd), we propose a new estimator, hypothetical test and sample size formula. The simulation results show that the estimation of the RMTLd is accurate and that the RMTLd test has robust statistical performance (both type I error and power). The results of three example analyses also verify the performance of the RMTLd test. From the perspectives of clinical interpretation, application conditions and statistical performance, we recommend that the RMTLd be reported with the HR in the analysis of competing risks data and that the RMTLd even be regarded as the primary outcome when the proportional hazard assumption fails.","Wu, Hongji; Yuan, Hao; Yang, Zijing; Hou, Yawen; Chen, Zheng",American journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550319/,325

120199,The role of cardiologists in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,2020-08-25,"INTRODUCTION Rectoceles are frequently associated with feelings of pelvic discomfort and symptoms of obstructed defaecation (OD). Repair by a transvaginal or transanal approach might result in de novo dyspareunia in up to approximately 40% of the cases. This study was designed to investigate whether anterolateral rectopexy provides an adequate rectocele repair without dyspareunia as a side effect. METHOD A consecutive series of 33 women (median age 55 years; range: 37-73) with a symptomatic rectocele (depth > 3 cm) underwent anterolateral rectopexy. Before the operation, all patients underwent evacuation proctography (EP), which was repeated 6 months after the repair in all but three patients. A standardized questionnaire concerning pelvic discomfort, OD and dyspareunia was used to assess the long-term effect of rectocele repair. The response rate was 91%. RESULTS Six months after the procedure, EP revealed a recurrent or persistent rectocele in six patients (20%). However, in four of these six patients, the depth of the rectocele was < 3 cm. The median duration of follow-up was 74 months (range: 2-96). Among the patients with an adequate repair, signs of OD persisted in 55%. None of the patients encountered de novo dyspareunia after the procedure. CONCLUSION Anterolateral rectopexy provides an effective tool for anatomical correction of rectoceles and does not result in dyspareunia as a side effect. However, despite adequate repair, OD persist in the majority of patients.","Oom, D M J; Gosselink, M P; van Wijk, J J; van Dijl, V R M; Schouten, W R",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2008.01538.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18462222/,325
120823,Lung volume assessment in acute respiratory distress syndrome.,2015,"Overdose deaths are often viewed as the leading edge of the opioid epidemic which has gripped the United States over the past two decades (Skolnick, 2018a). This emphasis is perhaps unsurprising because opioid overdose is both the number-one cause of death for individuals between 25 and 64 years old (Dezfulian et al., 2021) and a significant contributor to the decline in average lifespan (Dowell et al., 2017). Exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic, it was estimated there were 93,400 drug overdose deaths in the United States during the 12 months ending December 2020, with more than 69,000 (that is, >74%) of these fatalities attributed to opioid overdose (Ahmad et al., 2021). However, the focus on mortality statistics (Ahmad et al., 2021; Shover et al., 2020) tends to obscure the broader medical impact of nonfatal opioid overdose. Analyses of multiple databases indicate that for each opioid-induced fatality, there are between 6.4 and 8.4 non-fatal overdoses, exacting a significant burden on both the individual and society. Over the past 7-8 years, there has been an alarming increase in the misuse of synthetic opioids (""synthetics""), primarily fentanyl and related piperidine-based analogs. Within the past 2-3 years, a structurally unrelated class of high potency synthetics, benzimidazoles exemplified by etonitazene and isotonitazene (""iso""), have also appeared in illicit drug markets (Thompson, 2020; Ujvary et al. 2021). In 2020, it was estimated that over 80% of fatal opioid overdoses in the United States now involve synthetics (Ahmad et al., 2021). The unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of synthetics described in this review are responsible for both the morbidity and mortality associated with their misuse as well as their widespread availability. This dramatic increase in the misuse of synthetics is often referred to as the ""3rd wave"" (Pardo et al., 2019; Volkow and Blanco, 2020) of the opioid epidemic. Among the consequences resulting from misuse of these potent opioids is the need for higher doses of the competitive antagonist, naloxone, to reverse an overdose. The development of more effective reversal agents such as those described in this review is an essential component of a tripartite strategy (Volkow and Collins, 2017) to reduce the biopsychosocial impact of opioid misuse in the ""synthetic era"".","Skolnick, Phil",Pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.108019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637841/,325

We hypothesized that the previously reported rates of ED may have improved with the advent of modern technology. The purpose of this project was to evaluate modern external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy techniques to determine the incidence of radiotherapy (RT) induced ED. METHODS A systematic review of the literature published between January 2002 and December 2018 was performed to obtain patient reported rates of ED after definitive external beam radiotherapy, ultrafractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, and brachytherapy (BT) to the prostate in men who were potent prior to RT. Univariate and multivariate analyses of radiation dose, treatment strategy, and length of follow-up were analyzed to ascertain their relationship with RT-induced ED. RESULTS Of 890 articles reviewed, 24 met inclusion criteria, providing data from 2714 patients. Diminished erectile function status post RT was common and similar across all studies. The median increase in men reporting ED was 17%, 26%, 23%, and 23%, 3DCRT, IMRT, low dose rate BT, and SBRT, respectively, at 2-year median follow-up. CONCLUSION ED is a common side effect of RT. Risk of post-RT ED is similar for both LDR brachytherapy and external beam RT with advanced prostate targeting and penile-bulb sparing techniques utilized in modern RT techniques.","Hunt, Anastasia A; Choudhury, Kingshuk Roy; Nukala, Varun; Nolan, Michael W; Ahmad, Alina; Ashcraft, Kathleen A; Koontz, Bridget F",Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41391-020-0247-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647352/,325

However, these variants may account for a limited proportion of phenotype variability attributable to the genome. Using genome-wide common variation, we measured the narrow-sense heritability [ h SNP 2 ] of 7 pharmacodynamic and 5 pharmacokinetic phenotypes across 3 cardiovascular drugs, 2 antibiotics, and 3 immunosuppressants. We used a Bayesian Hierarchical Mixed Model, BayesR, to model the distribution of genome-wide variant effect sizes for each drug phenotype as a mixture of 4 normal distributions of fixed variance (0, 0.01%, 0.1% and 1% of the total additive genetic variance). This model allowed us to parse h SNP 2 into bins representing contributions of no-, small-, moderate- and large-effect size variants respectively. For the 12 phenotypes, a median of 969 (range 235-6,304) unique individuals of European ancestry and a median of 1,201,626 (range 777,427-1,514,275) variants were included in our analyses. The number of variants contributing to h SNP 2 ranged from 2,791 to 5,356 (median 3,347). Estimates for h SNP 2 ranged from 0.05 (ACE-inhibitor induced cough) to 0.59 (gentamicin concentration). Small- and moderate-effect variants contributed a majority to h SNP 2 for every phenotype (range 61-95%). We conclude that drug outcome phenotypes are highly polygenic. Thus, larger genome-wide association studies of drug phenotypes are needed both to discover novel variants and to determine how genome-wide approaches may improve clinical prediction of drug outcomes.","Muhammad, Ayesha; Aka, Ida T; Birdwell, Kelly A; Gordon, Adam S; Roden, Dan M; Wei, Wei-Qi; Mosley, Jonathan D; Van Driest, Sara L",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151428/,325
126532,Rescue Treatment With High-Dose Gaseous Nitric Oxide in Spontaneously Breathing Patients With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019.,2020-11-01,"SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as CoV-19, is an RNA virus which can cause severe acute respiratory diseases (COVID-19), with serious infection of the lower respiratory tract followed by bronchitis, pneumonia and fibrosis. The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths. Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities. To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission. In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals. At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death. One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. In addition, germicidal UV radiation ""breaks down"" the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19. We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.","Conti, P; Gallenga, C E; Tetè, G; Caraffa, Al; Ronconi, G; Younes, A; Toniato, E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/editorial-conti-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228825/,325

Reliable individualized preoperative prediction of adverse discharge can facilitate advanced care planning and shared decision making. METHODS Using hospital registry data from previously home-dwelling adults undergoing inpatient surgery, we retrospectively developed and externally validated a score predicting adverse discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and bootstrapping were used to develop the score. Adverse discharge was defined as in-hospital mortality or discharge to a skilled nursing facility. The model was subsequently externally validated in a cohort of patients from an independent hospital. RESULTS 106,164 patients in the development cohort and 92,962 patients in the validation cohort were included, of which 16,624 (15.7%) and 7,717 (8.3%) patients experienced adverse discharge, respectively. The model was predictive of adverse discharge with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.88) in the development cohort and an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.86-0.87) in the validation cohort.

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: sham (sham surgery), I/R (middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAO] for 100 min, then reperfusion), IpostC (MCAO for 100 min, reperfusion for 10 min, MCAO for 10 min, then reperfusion), IpostC+3MA (3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor, administered 30 min before first reperfusion), and IpostC+Veh (vehicle control for IpostC+3MA group). Infarct volume was measured using cresyl violet staining. Autophagy-related proteins were detected by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Autophagosomes, autophagolysosomes, and mitochondrial damage were identified by transmission electron microscopy. Cortical cell apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL assay. Neurologic function was assessed using the modified Neurologic Severity Score. IpostC improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume after I/R (P < 0.05). These effects of IpostC were inhibited by 3MA (P < 0.05). Autophagosome formation was increased in the I/R and IpostC+Veh groups (P < 0.05), but not in the IpostC+3MA group. The I/R group showed enhanced LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, p62, and Cathepsin B levels and decreased LAMP-2 level (all P < 0.05 vs. sham), indicating dysfunction of autophagic clearance. IpostC reduced p62 and Cathepsin B levels and increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (all P < 0.05); these effects of IpostC were reversed by 3MA, suggesting IpostC enhanced autophagic flux. Furthermore, IpostC attenuated I/R-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax and mitochondrial cytochrome-c release (all P < 0.05); 3MA inhibited these effects of IpostC (P < 0.05). In conclusion, IpostC may alleviate cerebral I/R injury by activating autophagy during early reperfusion.","Sun, Yameng; Zhang, Ting; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jinfeng; Jin, Lei; Sun, Yinyi; Shi, Nan; Liu, Kangyong; Sun, Xiaojiang",Neurochemical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-018-2599-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046966/,325

RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 20.4 years (range 1-56 years). Laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty was carried out on the right in nine cases and on the left in 17 cases. The operative time was 246 ± 68 min. Regarding the 14 pediatric patients, the mean age was 7.1 years (range 1-14 years). The operative time was 243 ± 49 min. As for the 12 adult patients, the mean age was 35.8 years (range 16-56 years). The operative time was 248 ± 86 min. The mean operative time of the control group in age-matched laparoscopic pyeloplasty was 239 ± 51 min. Times were 229 ± 54 min for the pediatric patients and 253 ± 45 min for the adult patients. There was no significant difference in the operative time between the control group and the laparoendoscopic single-site group for both adults and children. Blood loss was minimal, and no intraoperative and postoperative complications were observed in the 26 laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty cases. CONCLUSION The present findings suggest that laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty can be used in both pediatric and adult patients, offering a superior cosmetic outcome than conventional laparoscopic pyeloplasty, and a lower degree of postoperative pain. A large-scale prospective, randomized study is required to confirm these findings, and to define the future role of laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty.","Naitoh, Yasuyuki; Kawauchi, Akihiro; Yamada, Yasuhiro; Fujihara, Atsuko; Hongo, Fumiya; Kamoi, Kazumi; Okihara, Koji; Miki, Tsuneharu",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665832/,325

By screening our microbial extract library against the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the notorious ESKAPE pathogens, an active fraction was identified and purified, leading to an initial isolation of adipostatins A (1) and B (2). In order to diversify the chemical structures of adipostatins toward enhanced biological activities, a type III polyketide synthase was identified from the native producer, Streptomyces davawensis DSM101723, and was subsequently expressed in an E. coli host, resulting in the isolation of nine additional adipostatins 3-11, including two new analogs (9 and 11). The structures of 1-11 were established by HRMS, NMR, and chemical derivatization, including using a microgram-scale meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid epoxidation-MS/MS analysis to unambiguously determine the double bond position in the alkyl chain. The present study discovered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitory activity for the class of adipostatins for the first time. Several of the adipostatins isolated also exhibited antimicrobial activity against selected ESKAPE pathogens.","Hou, Lukuan; Li, Ying; Wu, Qihao; Li, Miyang; Older, Ethan A; Tang, Xiaoyu; Nagarkatti, Prakash; Nagarkatti, Mitzi; Liu, Yuan; Li, Lingjun; Fan, Daping; Bugni, Tim S; Shang, Zhuo; Li, Jie",Bioorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022708/,325
135223,Convalescent Plasma and Coronavirus Disease 2019: Time for Reassessment.,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), especially in preterm infants. Other viruses, co-detected with RSV, may play a role in the severity of respiratory outcomes. METHODS This prospective epidemiologic study of severe LRTI incidence among children born ≤35 weeks gestational age at 3 sites in Brazil (2008-2010) followed a birth cohort for 1 year post-enrollment. Nasal washes from subjects with LRTI were tested for respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe LRTI requiring hospitalization associated with RSV infection. Secondary outcomes included identification of viruses associated with LRTI, alone or coinfections, and risk factors associated with severe LRTI. RESULTS Among 303 subjects, 176 (58.1%) experienced LRTI. Among these subjects, 162 had samples tested using polymerase chain reaction; 27.8% (45/162) experienced severe LRTI. More subjects with severe LRTI were infected with RSV (30/45, 66.7%) than with other viruses. RSV was present in 33.1% (143/432) of LRTI events tested, 57.3% (82/143) were coinfections. RSV was the virus most frequently associated with severe LRTIs (34/56 events, 60.7%); 50% (17/34 events) single and 50% coinfections. Significantly longer hospital stays were associated with LRTI events involving RSV coinfections compared with RSV single infections (P = 0.012). Infants with severe LRTIs had significantly lower mean RSV-IgG levels at study entry compared with those with nonsevere or no LRTIs (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the association of RSV alone or as a coinfection with severe LRTI and reinforces the importance of providing adequate prophylaxis for susceptible infants.","Arruda, Eurico; Jones, Marcus H; Escremim de Paula, Flavia; Chong, Debora; Bugarin, Gabriela; Notario, Gerard; Matsuno, Alessandra K; Pitrez, Paulo M; Vo, Pamela; Suzuki, Claudia; Rosario Filho, Nelson; Stein, Renato T",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361184/,325
135591,"Origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",2020-06-20,"INTRODUCTION Erosive tooth wear has a multifactorial origin, where multiple risks contribute to its initiation and subsequent progression. The prevalence of tooth wear varies among countries; therefore, national studies are needed to examine the prevalence of this condition and its associated determinants. MATERIALS AND METHODS A sample of this national study included a total of 1,397 adults (response rate of 52%). Severity and number of teeth with erosive tooth wear, caries experience (D3MFS), and fluorosis were assessed clinically. A self-reported questionnaire inquired about sociodemographics, oral health behavior, diet, and general health. Fluoride levels in drinking water at the recruitment areas were also recorded. Data were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS The prevalence of erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin combined was 59% among 35- to 44-year-old, 75% among 45- to 54-year-old, 70% among 55- to 64-year-old, and 66% among 65- to 74-year-old males. The prevalence among females in the respective age groups was 44, 60, 63, and 59%. Erosive tooth wear in enamel was associated with a lower fluoride level (≤1 ppm) in the drinking water (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2). Erosive tooth wear in dentin was positively associated with male gender (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), periurban/rural residency (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), older age (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9), presence of reflux (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0-10.9), and negatively with higher D3MFS scores (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin was relatively high in Lithuania; the erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin combined was 52% among 35- to 44-year-olds, 68% among 45- to 54-year-olds, 67% among 55- to 64-year-olds, and 63% among 65- to 74-year-olds. Lower fluoride level in drinking water was associated with erosive tooth wear in enamel. Male gender, residency in periurban/rural areas, older age, and presence of acid reflux were associated with higher odds, while higher D3MFS scores were associated with lower odds for erosive tooth wear in dentin. These results can be used to plan dental public health prevention.","Stangvaltaite-Mouhat, Lina; Pūrienė, Alina; Stankeviciene, Indre; Aleksejūnienė, Jolanta",Caries research,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937621/,325

There is a necessity for expanding and improving the available information on these factors in order to make better dose models for specific scenarios. This paper describes the results of a field experiment with broiler chickens on the transfer factor (Ff) and concentration ratio (CR) for the long-term intake of 241Am and 137Cs with grass meal and soil. The broilers were divided into two groups, each group had nine subgroups and each subgroup had three broilers. The radionuclide concentrations in the feed and the thigh muscle, thigh bone, and liver of 54 broilers divided between the grass meal and soil groups were evaluated by gamma spectrometry for 241Am and 137Cs. The duration of feeding with ""contaminated"" sources ranged between 1-70 days. The equilibrium stage of 241Am in muscle and bone occurs on the 1st and 40th day, respectively; for 137Cs in muscle- 30th days of intake and for liver and bone- 7th days. For 241Am, the liver did not reach equilibrium stage during the 70 days of intake. Ff of 137Cs in the ""forage-muscle"" and ""soil-muscle"" systems were determined as 1.9±0.3 and 0.18±0.05; Ff of 241Am in the ""soil-muscle"" system was-7.5×10-5.","Mamyrbayeva, Ainur S; Baigazinov, Zhanat A; Lukashenko, Sergey N; Panitskiy, Andrey V; Karatayev, Seil S; Shatrov, Anton N; Baigazy, Symbat A; Bazarbayeva, Assem B; Hegedűs, M; Tóth-Bodrogi, E; Kovács, T",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609724/,325

The technique facilitates bronchoscopic sampling of peripheral pulmonary nodules as well as mediastinal lymph nodes, although wide availability and expertise in endobronchial ultrasonography has limited its application in routine clinical practice to the former. ENB in this setting is quite versatile and may be considered an established alternative to more invasive techniques, especially in selected patients with underlying pulmonary disease or comorbidities at high risk for complications from computer topography-guided fine needle aspiration or surgical resection. Nodule sampling may be performed with a variety of instruments, including forceps, cytology brushes, and transbronchial needles.

Reconnect is an initiative in NHS Grampian in Scotland which offered a variety of shared activities, including learning, to both groups of medical practitioners. One learning activity was of Practice-Based Small Group Learning (PBSGL) which has proved popular with primary care clinicians. Groups drawn from both health care sectors were started and met over a five month pilot period. A qualitative research method was chosen to identify the perceptions and experiences of participants. They were interviewed in one-to-one telephone interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using grounded theory methods. Two PBSGL groups were formed with a total of 13 members. One group met twice in the pilot period and the other group met only once. Nine participants were interviewed and four main themes emerged from analysis of the data. Reasons for participation were often related to a desire to improve working relationships between the two sectors and to increase understanding. Practitioners learned about how working conditions and team working affected the working lives of the other sector. Participants found the logistics of arranging further meetings challenging and considered they had a lack of shared learning time together. Considerations to the future of the project were positive but this contrasted with the few meetings that had taken place.","Stewart, Linsey; Cunningham, David","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",https://doi.org/10.1080/14739879.2020.1850213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252032/,325

METHODS The validation, in addition to the evaluation of precision and accuracy, included the analysis of the effects of the main procedures that are currently being used for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in saliva and a pilot study to evaluate the possible changes in salivary tADA and isoenzymes in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The automated assay proved to be accurate and precise, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation below 8.2%, linearity under dilution linear regression with R2 close to 1, and recovery percentage between 80 and 120% in all cases. This assay was affected when the sample is treated with heat or SDS for virus inactivation but tolerated Triton X-100 and NP-40. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=71) and who recovered from infection (n=11) had higher mean values of activity of tADA and its isoenzymes than healthy individuals (n=35). CONCLUSIONS tADA and its isoenzymes ADA1 and ADA2 can be measured accurately and precisely in saliva samples in a rapid, economical, and reproducible way and can be analyzed after chemical inactivation with Triton X-100 and NP-40. Besides, the changes observed in tADA and isoenzymes in individuals with COVID-19 open the possibility of their potential use as non-invasive biomarkers in this disease.","Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Tecles, Fernando; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Bernal, Enrique; San Lázaro, Indra; Alcaraz, María José; Vicente-Romero, María R; Lamy, Elsa; Sánchez-Resalt, Cristina; Rubio, Camila P; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Cerón, José J",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908223/,325

In the past years, coronaviruses have been a threat to humanity, causing severe epidemics of respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and presently the SARS-CoV2 is causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have demonstrated that surface contamination play a significant role in the spreading of viruses. These studies demonstrated that the production of highly reactive species by copper alloys contributes to rapid elimination of viruses. Nanostructured materials such as semiconductors TiO2, Co3O4 CuO, NiO, and TiO2, and silver nanoparticles can decrease the virus viability on the surfaces when associated with polymers and textiles, especially in conditions of light exposure. In addition, graphene oxide is rising as a promising material for inactivation of viruses due to its capacity of destroying the viral envelope and capsid. The virucidal property of these materials can be enhanced by increasing their functionalization with photosensitizers. The present mini-review brings subsidies for the development of new advanced self-disinfectant materials that can be used in the manufacture of gloves, masks, and a variety of other devices.","Toledo, Gabriel G DE; Toledo, Victor H; Lanfredi, Alexandre J C; Escote, Marcia; Champi, Ana; Silva, Maria Cristina C DA; Nantes-Cardoso, Iseli L",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,https://doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202020200718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206792/,325

Authors' reply.,2020-08-25,"The high cost of protein A resins drives the biopharmaceutical industry to maximize its lifetime, which is limited by several processes, usually referred to as resin aging. In this work, two model based strategies are presented, aiming to control and improve the resin lifetime. The first approach, purely statistical, enables qualitative monitoring of the column state and prediction of column performance indicators (e.g. yield, purity and dynamic binding capacity) from chromatographic on-line data (e.g. UV signal). The second one, referred to as hybrid modeling, is based on a lumped kinetic model, which includes two aging parameters fitted on several resin cycling experimental campaigns with varying cleaning procedures (CP). The first aging parameter accounts for binding capacity deterioration (caused by ligand degradation, leaching, and pore occlusion), while the second accounts for a decreased mass transfer rate (mainly caused by fouling). The hybrid model provides important insights into the prevailing aging mechanism as a function of the different CPs. In addition, it can be applied to model based CP optimization and yield forecasting with the capability of state estimation corrections based on on-line process information. Both approaches show promising results, which could help to significantly extend the resin lifetime. This comes along with increased understanding, reduced experimental effort, decreased cost of goods, and improved process robustness.","Feidl, Fabian; Luna, Martin F; Podobnik, Matevz; Vogg, Sebastian; Angelo, James; Potter, Kevin; Wiggin, Elenore; Xu, Xuankuo; Ghose, Sanchayita; Li, Zheng Jian; Morbidelli, Massimo; Butté, Alessandro",Journal of chromatography.

The oxyhalide-induced oxidation of Cr(III) in frozen solution showed a different trend from that in aqueous solution. Cr(VI) production was higher in frozen than aqueous solution with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and bromate (BrO3-) but suppressed in frozen solution with hypobromous acid (HOBr) and periodate (IO4-). In particular, bromate markedly enhanced Cr(VI) production in frozen solution, whereas it had a negligible activity in aqueous solution. On the contrary, periodate produced Cr(VI) significantly in aqueous solution but greatly suppressed it in frozen solution. Bromate was found to be much more concentrated in the ice grain boundary than periodate according to both chemical and Raman spectral analyses. The oxidative transformation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) was accompanied by the concurrent and stoichiometric reduction of oxyhalide species. Dissolved O2 had little effect on the oxidative dissolution, but dissolved organic matter retarded the oxidation of Cr2O3 in both aqueous and frozen conditions. This study proposes that the oxyhalide-induced oxidation of Cr(III) (particularly by bromate) in frozen conditions might have a significant effect on the generation of Cr(VI) in the frozen environment.","Min, Dae Wi; Kim, Kitae; Kim, Bomi; Lee, Giehyeon; Choi, Wonyong",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c04851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140955/,325

CT (Computed Tomography) scanners and RT-PCR testing are not available in most medical centers and hence in many cases CXR images become the most time/cost effective tool for assisting clinicians in making decisions. Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for building COVID-19 triage systems and detecting COVID-19 patients, especially patients with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases do not allow building such systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards severe cases.

As is true of most human pathogens, the genetic path to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the role that the immune system plays in modulating AMR during disease are poorly understood. Here we reproduced several routes to fluoroquinolone resistance, performing evolution experiments using sequential lung infections in mice that are replete or depleted of neutrophils, providing two key insights into the evolution of drug resistance. First, neutropenic hosts were demonstrated to act as reservoirs for the accumulation of drug resistance. Selection for variants with altered drug sensitivity profiles arose readily in the absence of neutrophils, while immunocompetent animals restricted the appearance of these variants. Secondly, antibiotic treatment failure was shown to occur without clinically defined resistance, an unexpected result that provides a model for how antibiotic failure occurs clinically in the absence of AMR. The genetic mechanism underlying both these results is initiated by mutations activating the drug egress pump regulator AdeL, which drives persistence in the presence of the antibiotic. Therefore, antibiotic persistence mutations are demonstrated to present a two-pronged risk during disease, causing drug treatment failure in the immunocompromised host while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of high-level AMR acquisition.","Huo, Wenwen; Busch, Lindsay M.; Hamami, Efrat; Hernandez-Bird, Juan; Marshall, Christopher W.; Geisinger, Edward; Cooper, Vaughn S.; van Opijnen, Tim; Rosch, Jason W.; Isberg, Ralph R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.438861,325

At that time in the context of the state of alarm the Spanish Government regulated the presence of the announcements of the bookmakers on the radio, until then the most common in sports broadcasts. The study combines quantitative and qualitative content analysis and reveals that the presence of advertisers was reduced substantially in this context and that, in addition, the brands that decided to continue advertising did so from a very different perspective than the one used before the outbreak of the health crisis. The ads were, during the pandemic, shorter, less diverse and less creative, and prompted changes in the sports program itself.

In some scenarios, it may be useful to share such data with other parties in order to improve collaboration, or to address situations such as cyber-security incidents that may affect multiple organizations. However, in doing so, serious privacy concerns emerge. One can uncover a lot of sensitive information when analyzing an organization's network logs, ranging from confidential business interests to personal details of individual employees (e.g., medical conditions, political orientation, etc). Our objective is to enable organizations to share information about their network logs, while at the same time preserving data privacy. Specifically, we focus on enabling encrypted search at network flow granularity. We consider several state-of-the-art searchable encryption flavors for this purpose (including hidden vector encryption and inner product encryption), and we propose several customized encoding techniques for network flow information in order to reduce the overhead of applying state-of-the-art searchable encryption techniques, which are notoriously expensive. © 2021 IEEE.","Florea, I.

Considering that influenza is vaccine preventable, international guidelines recommend high-risk populations with CVD receive an influenza vaccine every year, but there are various classifications of recommendations and levels of evidence. Previous systematic reviews concluded uncertain evidence on influenza vaccine efficacy for preventing cardiovascular events in the general population or in populations with pre-existing CVD. Limited safety data of influenza vaccines were reported for populations with pre-existing CVD. Randomized control trials with larger sample sizes relative to previous studies are emerging, the findings of these trials are likely to be highly influential on summary efficacy estimates. Methods and analysis We aim to perform a living systematic review and a prospective meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccines compared to no vaccines or placebo for preventing mortality or cardiovascular disease events in the general population and in populations with pre-existing CVD.","Liu, R.; Patel, A.; Du, X.; Liu, H.; Liu, B.; Wang, C.; Di Tanna, G.

183956,Long-term outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): an observational study.,2006,"The Complete Calibration of the Color-Redshift Relation (C3R2) survey is obtaining spectroscopic redshifts in order to map the relation between galaxy color and redshift to a depth of i ~ 24.5 (AB). The primary goal is to enable sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts for Stage IV dark energy projects, particularly Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope, which are designed to constrain cosmological parameters through weak lensing. We present 676 new high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts obtained by the C3R2 survey in the 2017B-2019B semesters using the DEIMOS, LRIS, and MOSFIRE multi-object spectrographs on the Keck telescopes. Combined with the 4454 redshifts previously published by this project, the C3R2 survey has now obtained and published 5130 high-quality galaxy spectra and redshifts. If we restrict consideration to only the 0.2<z(phot)<2.6 range of interest for the Euclid cosmological goals, then with the current data release C3R2 has increased the spectroscopic redshift coverage of the Euclid color space from 51% (as reported by Masters et al. 2015) to the current 91%. Once completed and combined with extensive data collected by other spectroscopic surveys, C3R2 should provide the spectroscopic calibration set needed to enable photometric redshifts to meet the cosmology requirements for Euclid, and make significant headway toward solving the problem for Roman.","Stanford, S.

190653,Adult respiratory distress syndrome.,2004,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize challenges and benefits to the use of tele-medicine for the treatment of pediatric orthopedic patients during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A novel survey was sent to all faculty members at an academic pediatric orthopedic practice in New York City regarding their use of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Faculty members performed 227 unique tele-health visits with pediatric orthopedic patients over a 7-week period in early 2020, and this formed the basis for responses to the survey. The results of the faculty survey suggest that telemedicine has substantial clinical benefits for pediatric orthopedic surgeons and our patients that extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers recognize the limits of conducting physical exams over telemedicine and should always use clinical judgment when evaluating patients, par-ticularly trauma patients who may require prompt referral for additional care. CONCLUSIONS The ability to provide pediatric orthopedic care through telemedicine has allowed us to safely evaluate and treat pediatric patients with musculoskeletal problems in New York City and its environs despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficient evaluation of both new and exist-ing pediatric orthopedic patients via telehealth is viable. Physical examination is the most challenging aspect of the physician-patient encounter to replicate virtually. Targeted educational efforts for patients and their families before the visit about what to expect and how to prepare improves efficiency with virtual pediatric orthopedic visits. Efforts to limit disparities in access to telemedicine will be needed to allow all pediatric orthopedic patients to participate in telemedicine equitably.","Carter, Cordelia; Herrero, Christina; Bloom, David; Karamitopoulos, Mara; Castañeda, Pablo",Bulletin of the Hospital for Joint Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207144/,325

DATA We review the strong evidence supporting the use of noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure to prevent intubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in immunocompromised patients, as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require initial intubation. Weaker evidence supports consideration of noninvasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with postoperative or postextubation respiratory failure; patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome; during bronchoscopy; or as a means of preoxygenation before intubation in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia. CONCLUSION Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in managing patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of noninvasive ventilation failure and promptly intubated before a crisis develops. The application of noninvasive ventilation by a trained and experienced intensive care unit team, with careful patient selection, should optimize patient outcomes.","Hill, Nicholas S; Brennan, John; Garpestad, Erik; Nava, Stefano",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17717495/,325
196495,Double Peripheral Venous and Arterial Cannulation for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Combined Septic and Cardiogenic Shock.,2017,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome encodes two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2). These glycoproteins interact to formin a noncovalent heterodimeric complex which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify whether E1 and/or E2 contains an ER-targeting signal potentially involved in ER retention of the E1-E2 complex, these proteins were expressed alone and their intracellular localization was studied. Due to misfolding of E1 in the absence of E2, no conclusion on the localization of its native form could be drawn from the expression of E1 alone. E2 expressed in the absence of E1 was shown to be retained in the ER similarly to E1-E2 complex. Chimeric proteins in which E2 domains were exchanged with corresponding domains of a protein normally transported to the plasma membrane (CD4) were constructed to identify the sequence responsible for its ER retention. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of E2 (C-terminal 29 amino acids) was shown to be sufficient for retention of the ectodomain of CD4 in the ER compartment. Replacement of the E2 TMD by the anchor signal of CD4 or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety led to its expression on the cell surface. In addition, replacement of the E2 TMD by the anchor signal of CD4 or a GPI moiety abolished the formation of E1-E2 complexes. Together, these results suggest that, besides having a role as a membrane anchor, the TMD of E2 is involved in both complex formation and intracellular localization.","Cocquerel, L; Meunier, J C; Pillez, A; Wychowski, C; Dubuisson, J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9499075/,325
199191,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), MERS and SARS: Similarity and difference",2020,"OBJECTIVE Highlighting gender inequalities during the pandemic and its relationship with other axes of social inequality will be decisive for its adequate monitoring. The aim of this study was to assess the differences between men and women in the main measures of infection and mortality by COVID-19, considering its temporal evolution, raising awareness about the weaknesses and contradictions between sources of information. METHODS Cross-sectional analysis based on the microdata on COVID cases notified by the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), the Death Statistics of the National Statistical Institute (INE) and the estimates of excess mortality from the INE and the Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo) microdata. Standardized rates, prevalences and and ratios by sex were calculated for each indicator. The percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis in each sex was calculated. Male/female ratios for symptoms and risk factors of COVID-19 were also calculated. RESULTS The rate of infection by COVID-19 was higher in women in the three waves of the pandemic, reaching 65% of infections during April and May 2020. Complications were between 1.5 and 2.5 times higher in men, especially in ICU admissions, which were 2.5 times more frequent than in women. Although mortality rates and excess mortality were also higher in men (around 1.8 times), the percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis was higher in women (44% in men vs. 52% in women the first wave). With regard to the symptoms of COVID-19, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were more frequent in men (20%, 10% and 19% more, respectively) compared to sore throat, vomiting or diarrhea that were more prevalent in women (90%, 40% and 10% more, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The analysis disaggregated by sex has made it possible to identify differences between men and women in the diagnosis, presentation and severity of the COVID-19 that can help a better clinical and epidemiological approach to the disease. However, official sources present important gaps when presenting information disaggregated by sex. It is therefore necessary to advance in the inclusion of a gender perspective in the statistics on COVID-19, starting with a necessary but not sufficient condition such as the disaggregation by sex of the data.","Martín, Unai; Bacigalupe, Amaia; Jiménez Carrillo, Marta",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927179/,325
199902,Commentary: Cardiac care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: Competing constraints,2021,"It has been suggested that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects host cells through a pH-dependent internalization mechanism, but the steps leading from virus attachment to the fusion of viral and cellular membranes remain uncharacterized. Here we studied the mechanism underlying the HCV fusion process in vitro using liposomes and our recently described HCV pseudoparticles (pp) bearing functional E1E2 envelope glycoproteins. The fusion of HCVpp with liposomes was monitored with fluorescent probes incorporated into either the HCVpp or the liposomes. To validate these assays, pseudoparticles bearing either the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus or the amphotropic glycoprotein of murine leukemia virus were used as models for pH-dependent and pH-independent entry, respectively. The use of assays based either on fusion-induced dequenching of fluorescent probes or on reporter systems, which produce fluorescence when the virus and liposome contents are mixed, allowed us to demonstrate that HCVpp mediated a complete fusion process, leading to the merging of both membrane leaflets and to the mixing of the internal contents of pseudoparticle and liposome. This HCVpp-mediated fusion was dependent on low pH, with a threshold of 6.3 and an optimum at about 5.5. Fusion was temperature-dependent and did not require any protein or receptor at the surface of the target liposomes. Most interestingly, fusion was facilitated by the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane. These findings clearly indicate that HCV infection is mediated by a pH-dependent membrane fusion process. This paves the way for future studies of the mechanisms underlying HCV membrane fusion.","Lavillette, Dimitri; Bartosch, Birke; Nourrisson, Delphine; Verney, Géraldine; Cosset, François-Loïc; Penin, François; Pécheur, Eve-Isabelle",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16356932/,325

Here we show that the envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (Ebo-GP) is proteolytically processed into two subunits, GP1 and GP2, that are likely covalently associated through a disulfide linkage. Murine leukemia virions pseudotyped with Ebo-GP contain almost exclusively processed glycoprotein, indicating that this is the mature form of Ebo-GP. Mutational analysis identified a dibasic motif, reminiscent of furin-like protease processing sites, as the Ebo-GP cleavage site. However, analysis of Ebo-GP processing in LoVo cells that lack the proprotein convertase furin demonstrated that furin is not required for processing of Ebo-GP. In sharp contrast to other viral systems, we found that an uncleaved mutant of Ebo-GP was able to mediate infection of various cell lines as efficiently as the wild-type, proteolytically cleaved glycoprotein, indicating that cleavage is not required for the activation of Ebo-GP despite the conservation of a dibasic cleavage site in all filoviral envelope glycoproteins.","Wool-Lewis, R J; Bates, P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882347/,325

METHODS: In this case-control study, n = 36 patients with a preoperative mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) &#8805; 15° who underwent TKA between December 2002 and December 2012 were included. The control group (mTFA < 15°) of n = 60 patients was created using case matching. Radiological [mechanical tibiofemoral angle (mTFA) and ankle joint orientation to the ground (G-AJLO)] and clinical parameters [Foot Function Index (FFI), Knee Society Score, Forgotten Joint Score, and Range of Motion (ROM)] were analysed. The mean follow-up time was 59 months (IQR [56, 62]). RESULTS: The degree of correcting the mTFA by TKA significantly correlated with the postoperative FFI (R = 0.95, p < 0.05), although the knee and ankle joint lines were corrected to neutral orientations. A cut-off value of 16.5° [AUC 0.912 (0.85-0.975 95% CI), sensitivity = 0.8, specificity = 0.895] was calculated, above which the odds ratio (OR) for developing ankle symptoms increased vastly [OR 34.0 (9.10-127.02 95% CI)]. ROM restrictions of the subtalar joint displayed a strong significant correlation with the FFI (R = 0.74, p < 0.05), demonstrating that decreased ROM of the subtalar joint was associated with aggravated outcomes of the ankle joint. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, higher degrees of leg axis correction in TKA were associated with increased postoperative ankle symptoms. When TKA is performed in excessive valgus knee osteoarthritis, surgeons should be aware that this might trigger the onset or progression of ankle symptoms, particularly in cases of a stiff subtalar joint.

This study investigated the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor, luseogliflozin, on arterial properties and home blood pressure (BP) in patients with T2DM. This multicenter, single-arm study enrolled adults with T2DM, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5%-8.9% in the previous 4 weeks, and an indication for new/additional antidiabetic therapy. Luseogliflozin 2.5 mg/d was given for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was change in cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12. Home and office BP, BP variability, and metabolic parameters were secondary endpoints. Forty-seven patients (mean age 63.5 ± 10.7 years) treated with luseogliflozin were included in the full analysis set. CAVI did not change significantly from baseline (mean [95% confidence interval] 8.67 [8.37-8.97]) to Week 12 (8.64 [8.38-8.91]; P = .750), but there were significant reductions from baseline in morning home BP, HbA1c, body weight, body mass index, and serum uric acid levels during luseogliflozin therapy. The reduction in morning home systolic BP was &#8805; 5 mm Hg and was independent of baseline BP and BP control status.

Signaling by Gq-protein-coupled receptors triggers PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are well known to modulate vascular ion channel activity. Often overlooked, however, is the role PIP2 itself plays in this regulation. Although numerous reports have demonstrated that PIP2 is critical for ion channel regulation, how it impacts vascular function has received scant attention. In this review, we focus on PIP2 as a regulator of ion channels in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells-the two major classes of vascular cells. We further address the concerted effects of such regulation on vascular function and blood flow control. We close with a consideration of current knowledge regarding disruption of PIP2 regulation of vascular ion channels in disease.","Harraz, Osama F; Hill-Eubanks, David; Nelson, Mark T",Proc. Natl.

Purinergic signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of several viral infections which makes the purinergic system a potential target of investigation in COVID-19. During viral infections, the ATP release initiates a cascade that activates purinergic receptors. This receptor activation enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and performs the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils, generating an association between the immune and the purinergic systems. This review was designed to cover the possible functions of purinergic signaling in COVID-19, focusing on the possible role of purinergic receptors such as P2X7 which contributes to cytokine storm and inflammasome NLRP3 activation and P2Y1 that activates the blood coagulation pathway. The possible role of ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, which have the function of dephosphorylating ATP in an immunosuppressive component, adenosine, are also covered in detail.

209516,A Review of Telemedicine Applications in Otorhinolaryngology: Considerations During the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Egypt started in 2000 at 8 sentinel sites geographically distributed all over the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 °C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment.

209517,A Review of Telemedicine Applications in Otorhinolaryngology: Considerations During the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Egypt started in 2000 at 8 sentinel sites geographically distributed all over the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 °C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","Fahim, Manal; Ghonim, Hanaa Abu El Sood; Roshdy, Wael H; Naguib, Amel; Elguindy, Nancy; AbdelFatah, Mohamad; Hassany, Mohamed; Mohsen, Amira; Afifi, Salma; Eid, Alaa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,325

212806,Disruption of Arthroplasty Practice in an Orthopedic Center in Northern Italy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05438v2.pdf,325
213352,Identify. Quantify. Predict. Why Immunologists Should Widely Use Molecular Imaging for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"Italy was the first European nation to be massively infected by SARS-CoV-2. Up to the end of May 2020, more than 33,000 deaths had been recorded in Italy, with a large prevalence among males, those over 75 years of age, and in association with co-morbidities. We describe the lung pathological and immunohistochemical post-mortem findings at the autopsy of nine patients who died of SARS-CoV-2-associated disease. We found in the lung tissues of all patients histological changes consistent with diffuse alveolar damage in various evolution phases ranging from acute exudative to acute proliferative to fibrotic phase. Alveolar damage was associated with prominent involvement of the vascular component in both the interstitial capillaries and the mid-size vessels, with capillary fibrin micro-thrombi, as well as organized thrombi even in medium-sized arteries, in most cases not related to sources of embolism. Eosinophilic infiltrate was also seen, probably reactive to pharmacological treatment. Viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected from the lung tissues of all the nine patients. Immunohistochemistry for the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and its priming activator TMPRSS2 revealed that both proteins co-localize in airway cells. In particular, the ACE2 protein was expressed in both endothelial cells and alveolar type I and II pneumocytes in the areas of histological diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Pneumocytes, but not endothelial cells, also expressed TMPRSS2. There are no distinctive histological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection with respect to SARS-CoV-1 and other DAD with different aetiology. The identification of the cause of death in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely multi-factorial. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

214014,Routine laboratory tests alterations in relation with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant stressor worldwide and reports of psychological distress, depression, sedentary lifestyles, and overall decreased wellbeing are increasing. Yoga practices have been found to improve mental and physical health. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare Isha yoga practitioners to controls on perceived stress, resilience, wellbeing, and protection and recovery from COVID-19. Trial Design. In this prospective randomized control trial, the effects of yoga practices are being compared between seasoned yoga practitioners with two controls who are age (±3 years), gender matched, and living in the same neighborhood. Methods Participants will be asked to complete a series of web-based surveys at baseline, six weeks, and 12 weeks. These surveys include validated scales and objective questions on COVID-19 infection and medical history. The validated questionnaires assess stress, mood states, resilience, and overall wellbeing. Questionnaires, weekly activity diaries, and medical history, will be collected using REDCap. Results We hypothesize that routine yoga practice during the COVID-19 pandemic will reduce stress, enhance well-being, and provide protective effects against COVID-19. Conclusion With the growing concern about the physical and mental impacts of COVID-19 and increased interest in alternative practices such as yogic practices, this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence about the safety and efficacy of yoga for emotional, mental, and physical health conditions.","Upadhyay, P.; Narayanan, S.; Khera, T.; Kelly, L.; Mathur, P.

214061,"Oculoplastic, Orbital, and Lacrimal Care in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Shared Experience From Melbourne",2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) - costs. FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5-198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84-4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from -£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

214579,Global interim guidance on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy and puerperium from FIGO and allied partners: Information for healthcare professionals,2020,"Deep learning (DL) has drawn tremendous attention in object localization and recognition for both natural and medical images. U-Net segmentation models have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional hand-crafted feature-based methods. Medical image modality-specific DL models are better at transferring domain knowledge to a relevant target task than those that are pretrained on stock photography images. This helps improve model adaptation, generalization, and class-specific region of interest (ROI) localization. In this study, we train chest X-ray (CXR) modality-specific U-Nets and other state-of-the-art U-Net models for semantic segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent findings. Automated segmentation of such manifestations could help radiologists reduce errors and supplement decision-making while improving patient care and productivity. Our approach uses the publicly available TBX11K CXR dataset with weak TB annotations, typically provided as bounding boxes, to train a set of U-Net models. Next, we improve the results by augmenting the training data with weak localizations, post-processed into an ROI mask, from a DL classifier that is trained to classify CXRs as showing normal lungs or suspected TB manifestations. Test data are individually derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and other cross-institutional collections including the Shenzhen TB and Montgomery TB CXR datasets. We observe that our augmented training strategy helped the CXR modality-specific U-Net models achieve superior performance with test data derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution as well as from cross-institutional collections (p<0.05).","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Folio, Les; Dimperio, Jane; Alderson, Philip; Antani, Sameer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10607v2.pdf,325

Coagulation cascade and platelet functions have not been well studied in the COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 178 patients enrolled in Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital were included for the study. Blood platelets and coagulation functions were analyzed in COVID-19 patients with non-severe and severe subgroups. Other biochemical laboratory parameters were also analyzed. Results: Forty-nine (27.5%) out of 178 patients were diagnosed with severe disease in this study, and 129 patients with non-severe disease. Severe disease group had significant lower platelet count 186.00 (103.50-249.00) ×109/L than 251.00 (202.00-317.00) ×109/L of non-severe group, p = 0.000. Severe group also had significantly abnormal coagulation parameters than non-severe group: prothrombin time (PT) 14.55 (13.40-16.53) s vs. 12.70 (12.15-13.59) s, p = 0.000; international normalized ratio (INR) 1.21 (1.13-1.36) vs. 1.06 (1.01-1.13), p = 0.000; thrombin time (TT) 16.35 (15.69-17.47) s vs. 15.68 (14.79-16.69) s, p = 0.011; D-Dimer 1.05 (0.68-5.90) mg/L vs. 0.42 (0.28-0.79) mg/L, p = 0.000; While the liver function parameter alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) didn't show significance between two groups, ALT 30.80 (19.00-58.30) IU/L vs. 28.80 (15.75-50.15) IU/L, p = 0.487; AST 27.80 (19.30-40.55) IU/L vs. 22.6 (16.7-32.03) IU/L, p = 0.102. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rate was 6.1% in severe group while 0% in non-severe group. Survival rate of severe disease group was worse than non-severe group, 85.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.000. Thrombocytopenia correlated with coagulation function, DIC rate and survival. Six out of 7 death case had thrombocytopenia during hospitalization, and platelet count decreased subsequently until death. Thrombocytopenia occurred within 1 week after admission in 6 recovered patients. And increased platelet levels followed by positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and negative coronavirus nucleic acid tested in 8 recovered patients. Conclusions: Low platelet count is associated with abnormal coagulation function and increased risk of DIC, severe disease manifestation and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Bao, Changqian; Tao, Xiandong; Cui, Wei; Yi, Bin; Pan, Tiewen; Young, Ken H.; Qian, Wenbin",Exp.

220510,French Pediatric Societies Call for School to Stay Open amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread to nearly every country in the world. The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS: A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS: When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 µM are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A meta-analysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions). CONCLUSION: It can plausibly be assumed that consistent use of masks covering the mouth and nose can play an important role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Hufert, Frank; Siewert, Stefan; Reisinger, Emil",Dtsch.

229858,Considerations for Laboratory Biosafety and Biosecurity During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Applying the ISO 35001:2019 Standard and High-Reliability Organizations Principles,2021,"Background/aim: A SARS-Cov2 infection which was first arised from Wuhan in December 2019 and named as COVID-19. Still there lacks either a specific treatment or a vaccine to treat COVID-19. Convalescent plasma (CP) was previously used successfully to treat SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections. Health authority in Turkey has published a guideline to integrate this promising option in the treatment process of patients who are prone to high risk of developing severe COVID 19. Materials and Methods: Forty consecutive patients who had received CP at our center were included in the study. Demographics, COVID-19 specific parameters, biomarkers to detect the severity of COVID-19 infection and outcome variables were collected retrospectively. The correlation between outcome variables and the independent predictors of the outcome were reported. Results: Median age of the patients was 57.5 and 72.5% were male. At least one COVID-19 PCR test was confirmed to be positive in 75% of patients. Remaining 25% had a Chest-CT which was reported to be compatible with an ongoing COVID-19. All patients (100%) were classified as having severe COVID-19 infection. Over a half of the patients harbored an oxygen saturation of less than 90 despite of a continuous 5 L/min support of O2. 82.5% of the patients had a need for mechanical ventilation and 45.5% had a need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Nine out of 10 patients who have received CP outside ICU have totally recovered from COVID-19 at a median of 9 days, and a half of the patients who needed invasive mechanical ventilation were successfully free of mechanical ventilation support and managed to recover from COVID-19. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, CP is an efficient conjunct to conventional therapy against COVID-19 with a favorable safety profile.","Gemici, Aliihsan; Bilgen, Hülya; Erdogan, Cem; Kansu, Abdullah; Olmusçelik, Oktay; Beköz, Hüseyin Saffet; Çakmak, Rumeysa; Mert, Ali; Sevindik, Ömür Gökmen",Turk J Med Sci,,325
230812,Transient Brugada-like ECG pattern in a patient with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: The follow-up of recovered COVID-19 patients is still limited. We aimed to evaluate the changes in quality-of-life (QOL) and spirometric alterations in the convalescent phase of 115 patients with at least 30 days post-COVID-19. METHODS: We included patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, available past medical records and at least 30 days after the onset of symptoms. All patients were asked to rate their general health condition before and after COVID-19 using the EQ-5D-5L standardized questionary and perform a spirometry at evaluation. RESULTS: In this study, that included 70%(81/115) of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19; there was a severe decrease in QOL up to 56%(64/115). Alterations in usual activities and anxiety/depression were present in 59% of patients with a severe decrease in QOL. The persistence of symptoms was present in 63%(72/115). Restrictive lung impairment was the most common spirometric alteration in 17%(20/115), of whom 65%(13/20) had mild COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Spirometric alterations are presented even in mild COVID-19, and more remarkably, there is a high rate of alterations in quality of life after the recovery of this disease.","Ordinola Navarro, Alberto; Cervantes-Bojalil, Javier; Cobos Quevedo, Orestes de Jesús; Avila Martínez, Andrea; Hernández-Jiménez, Carlos Alberto; Pérez Álvarez, Esperanza; González Gil, Andrea; Peralta Amaro, Ana Lilia; Vera-Lastra, Olga; Lopez Luis, Bruno Ali",Respir Med,,325

237752,Clinical Characteristics of Patients Who Died of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,2020,"The heterogeneity associated with glycosylation of the 66 N-glycan sites on the protein trimer making up the spike (S) region of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been assessed by charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS). CDMS allows simultaneous measurement of the mass-to-charge ratio and charge of individual ions, so that mass distributions can be determined for highly heterogeneous proteins such as the heavily glycosylated S protein trimer. The CDMS results are compared to recent glycoproteomics studies of the structure and abundance of glycans at specific sites. Interestingly, average glycan masses determined by ""top-down"" CDMS measurements are 35-47% larger than those obtained from the ""bottom-up"" glycoproteomics studies, suggesting that the glycoproteomic measurements underestimated the abundances of larger, more-complex glycans. Moreover, the distribution of glycan masses determined by CDMS is much broader than the distribution expected from the glycoproteomics studies, assuming that glycan processing on each trimer is not correlated. The breadth of the glycan mass distribution therefore indicates heterogeneity in the extent of glycan processing of the S protein trimers, with some trimers being much more heavily processed than others. This heterogeneity may have evolved as a way of further confounding the host's immune system.","Miller, Lohra M; Barnes, Lauren F; Raab, Shannon A; Draper, Benjamin E; El-Baba, Tarick J; Lutomski, Corinne A; Robinson, Carol V; Clemmer, David E; Jarrold, Martin F",J Am Chem Soc,,325

The present meta-analysis was conducted to gain clarity regarding AKI incidence and renal replacement therapy (RRT) use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases were systematically searched for COVID-19-related case reports published through 25 July 2020. Pooled analyses were conducted using R. RESULTS: The pooled incidence of AKI in 51 studies including 21,531 patients was 12.3% (95% CI 9.5-15.6%), with higher rates of 38.9% in 290 transplant patients (95% CI 27.3-51.9%), 39.0% in 565 ICU patients (95% CI 23.2-57.6%) and 42.0% among 1745 deceased patients (95% CI 30.3-54.7%). RRT usage was reported in 39 studies of 17,664 patients, with an overall pooled use of 5.4% (95% CI 4.0-7.1%), with higher rates of 15.6% in 117 transplant patients (95%CI 9.9-23.8%) and 16.3% in 776 ICU patients (95% CI 11.1-23.3%). CONCLUSION: AKI and RRT use among COVID-19 patients represent a major public health concern, and early and appropriate intervention should be called upon to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from AKI.","Yang, Xiaopeng; Tian, Shasha; Guo, Hui",Int Immunopharmacol,,325

Here, we show a hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945;-dependent microRNA (miR)-210 up-regulation in monocytes and macrophages upon pathogen interaction. MiR-210 knockout in the hematopoietic lineage or in monocytes/macrophages mitigated the symptoms of endotoxemia, bacteremia, sepsis, and parasitosis, limiting the cytokine storm, organ damage/dysfunction, pathogen spreading, and lethality. Similarly, pharmacologic miR-210 inhibition improved the survival of septic mice. Mechanistically, miR-210 induction in activated macrophages supported a switch toward a proinflammatory state by lessening mitochondria respiration in favor of glycolysis, partly achieved by downmodulating the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU. In humans, augmented miR-210 levels in circulating monocytes correlated with the incidence of sepsis, while serum levels of monocyte/macrophage-derived miR-210 were associated with sepsis mortality. Together, our data identify miR-210 as a fine-tuning regulator of macrophage metabolism and inflammatory responses, suggesting miR-210-based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.","Virga, Federico; Cappellesso, Federica; Stijlemans, Benoit; Henze, Anne-Theres; Trotta, Rosa; Van Audenaerde, Jonas; Mirchandani, Ananda S; Sanchez-Garcia, Manuel A; Vandewalle, Jolien; Orso, Francesca; Riera-Domingo, Carla; Griffa, Alberto; Ivan, Cristina; Smits, Evelien; Laoui, Damya; Martelli, Fabio; Langouche, Lies; Van den Berghe, Greet; Feron, Olivier; Ghesquière, Bart; Prenen, Hans; Libert, Claude; Walmsley, Sarah R; Corbet, Cyril; Van Ginderachter, Jo A; Ivan, Mircea; Taverna, Daniela; Mazzone, Massimiliano",Sci.

Biology and biotechnology have changed dramatically during the last ten years or so. Their reliance on digitization, automation, and their cyber-overlaps have created new vulnerabilities for unintended consequences and potentials for intended exploitation that are largely under-appreciated. Herein, I summarize and elaborate on these new cyberbiosecurity challenges, (1) in terms of comprehending the evolving threat landscape and determining new risk potentials, (2) in developing adequate safeguarding measures, their validation and implementation, and (3) specific critical dangers and consequences, many of them unique to the life-sciences. Drawing upon expertise shared by others as well as my previous work, this article aims to summarize and critically interpret the current situation of our bioeconomy. Herein, the goal is not to attribute causative aspects of past biosafety or biosecurity events, but to highlight the fact that the bioeconomy harbors unique features that have to be more critically assessed for their potential to unintentionally cause harm to human health or environment, or to be re-tasked with an intention to cause harm. I conclude with recommendations that will need to be taken into consideration to help ensure converging and emerging biorisk challenges, in order to minimize vulnerabilities to the life-science enterprise, public health, and national security.","Mueller, Siguna",,,325

Although many studies have focused on the consequences at the macroeconomic level, especially in terms of forecasts and long-term repercussions, few have investigated the effects on entrepreneurship. The impact of lockdown on the economy represents a novel field of research, which has yet to be addressed in depth in the entrepreneurship literature. Our focus is on Italy, which experienced a strong decrease in the number of startups during the two months of lockdown. This paper aims to test whether there has been a geographical effect of covid-19 on the decline of startups through an econometric analysis at the provincial level. Controlling for several local socio-economic features, we found a high significant effect of the spread of covid-19 on the decrease in startups, but not on the level of firms closures. Moreover, the results show also that the reduction in startup activity occurred especially in the more competitive provinces, in terms of R&D expenditure and economic growth before the outbreak of the pandemic. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.","Cecchetto, Cinzia; Aiello, Marilena; Gentili, Claudio; Ionta, Silvio; Osimo, Sofia Adelaide",Appetite,,325

Yet, knowledge about the impact of 'music-making' on the well-being of community-dwelling people with dementia is limited. Much of the existing evidence about the benefits of music is focused on care home settings where initiatives can be readily applied as part of a weekly schedule of activities. Therefore, this initiative aimed to provide opportunities to participate in music-making, to increase social interaction and ultimately well-being in a community environment. Ten music-making session were scheduled for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners, once a month between September 2019 and March 2020. Three sessions did not take place due to Covid19. Eighteen participants consented to take part including seven people living with dementia, five care-partners and six former care-partners. Baseline semi-structured interviews explored the lived experience of music and expectations of the upcoming music-making cafes. Self-report questionnaires captured 'in the moment' experiences of each music-making cafe. Follow-up semi-structured interviews explored the impact of music-making on participants' self-reported well-being. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The findings demonstrate that participating in the music-making café benefitted the self-reported well-being of participants in three ways: first, a sense of camaraderie that enabled the facilitation of connections with others; second, creating opportunities to 'level the playing field' by always assuming a person's strengths and abilities; and third, group participation in music-making meets a need for meaningful musical experiences. We conclude that participating in music-making is a powerful medium to promote well-being for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners.","Smith, Sarah K; Innes, Anthea; Bushell, Sophie",Heal. soc. care community,,325

Infected individuals with suspected (clinical diagnosis) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited. Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms, and smell and taste disorders. A total of 294 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough, and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; P < .001). Smell disorders occurred before the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Interestingly, our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference, either for general symptoms or otorhinolaryngological features, between the clinical diagnosis group and the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction) group. The structural equation model confirmed significant standardized paths (P < .05) between general symptoms, comorbidities, and general otorhinolaryngological complaints in the absence of a significant correlation between these elements and smell and taste alterations. The prevalence of smell and taste disorders in mild-to-moderate Italian COVID-19 patients is significant both in suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases and reveals a strong correlation between these clinical signs regardless of the presence of general or otorhinolaryngological symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea.","Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Bastiani, Luca; Lechien, Jerome R; Mannelli, Giuditta; Molteni, Gabriele; Cantarella, Giovanna; Coppola, Nicola; Costa, Giuseppe; Trecca, Eleonora M C; Grillo, Calogero; La Mantia, Ignazio; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Vicini, Claudio; Saussez, Sven; Nacci, Andrea; Cammaroto, Giovanni",J Med Virol,,325

This study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on Ghana's construction industry and assess how construction companies are contributing to the fight against COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with nine key professionals working with D1K1 firms currently working on projects of almost similar sizes within the confines of a reputable tertiary institution in Ghana were conducted over a span of three weeks. Thematic analysis was conducted with Nvivo 12 Pro Application software. Findings From the findings, the major impact includes: a decrease in work rate, delays in payments and an increase in the cost of materials arising from border closure. On the measures by construction companies in contributing to the fight against the pandemic, findings indicated: educating the workforce on the virus, the provision of PPEs, regular and effective checks on entry and exit from the site. Practical implications The study is significant, as knowledge of the impact posed by the pandemic will provide some idea of the measures to put in place to ensure the gradual to full recovery of the industry.

With the absence of effective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing and travel reduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to control the spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and mobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is known, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebook co-location data for all counties in the United States from March to early May 2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel reduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social distancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, and subsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that the mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new cases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found among different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases. The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable, and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group co-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large number of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could have important practical implications for local governments to inform their intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as well as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting, and epidemic modeling need to account for population co-location patterns in evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.","Fan, Chao; Lee, Sanghyeon; Yang, Yang; Oztekin, Bora; Li, Qingchun; Mostafavi, Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01054v1.pdf,325

A case report",2021,"Nigella sativa or black seed is used as a medicinal plant around the globe. Oil and seeds have a long tradition of folklore use in various medicinal and food systems. The conventional therapeutic use of Nigella sativa, in different ways, has been reported in several studies to treat different diseases including influenza, headache, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, eczema, fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and fever. Based on previously reported potential therapeutic uses of N. sativa compounds, and keeping in mind the dire need of time for the development of potent antiviral, a combined docking, ADMET properties calculation, molecular dynamics, and MM-PBSA approaches were applied in the current study to check the therapeutic potentials of N. sativa chief constituents against COVID-19. Among the studied compounds, we found that dithymoquinone (DTQ), with binding affinity of -8.6 kcal/mol compared to a positive control (chloroquine, -7.2 kcal/mol) , has the high potential of binding at SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface and thus could be predicted as a plausible inhibitor to disrupt viral-host interactions. Molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns well complemented binding affinity of the compound and revealed strong stability of DTQ at the docked site. Additionally, MM-PBSA also affirms the docking results. Compound DTQ of the present study, if validated in wet lab experiments, could be used to treat COVID-19 and could serve as a lead in the future for development of more effective natural antivirals against COVID-19.

The characteristics of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF)-&#945;, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and procalcitonin (PCT), and lymphocyte subsets of these patients were retrospectively compared before and after treatment. Before treatment, there was no significant difference in most inflammatory factors (IL-1ß, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CRP, and serum ferritin) between male and female patients. Levels of IL-2R, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and CRP decreased significantly after treatment, followed by IL-8, IL-10, and PCT. Serum ferritin was increased in all patients before treatment but did not decrease significantly after treatment. IL-1ß was normal in most patients before treatment. Lymphopenia was common among these patients with severe COVID-19. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed that CD4+ and particularly CD8+ T lymphocytes increased significantly after treatment. However, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells showed no significant changes after treatment. A pro-inflammatory response and decreased level of T lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19.","Ni, Ming; Tian, Fang-Bing; Xiang, Dan-Dan; Yu, Bing",J. med. virol,,325

265391,Ocular involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a clinical and molecular analysis,2020,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused by SARS-CoV-2, the question of the origin of this virus has been a highly debated issue. Debates have been, and are still, very disputed and often violent between the two main hypotheses: a natural origin through the “spillover” model or a laboratory-leak origin. Tenants of these two options are building arguments often based on the discrepancies of the other theory. The main problem is that it is the initial question of the origin itself which is biased. Charles Darwin demonstrated in 1859 that all species are appearing through a process of evolution, adaptation and selection. There is no determined origin to any animal or plant species, simply an evolutionary and selective process in which chance and environment play a key role. The very same is true for viruses. There is no determined origin to viruses, simply also an evolutionary and selective process in which chance and environment play a key role. However, in the case of viruses the process is slightly more complex because the “environment” is another living organism. Pandemic viruses already circulate in humans prior to the emergence of a disease. They are simply not capable of triggering an epidemic yet. They must evolve in-host, i.e. in-humans, for that. The evolutionary process which gave rise to SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing with regular emergence of novel variants more adapted than the previous ones. The real relevant question is how these viruses can emerge as pandemic viruses and what the society can do to prevent the future emergence of pandemic viruses.","Frutos, Roger Pliez Olivier Gavotte Laurent Devaux Christian A.",Environmental research,,325

The paper presents active compounds found for the first time in the inflorescence of this species. The flavonoids, simple phenolic compounds and natural steroids have been isolated for the first time in the genus Stizolophus. The MTT assay was employed to study in vitro cytotoxic effects of the taxifolin against human fibroblasts. We also evaluate the possible biological properties/cosmetic effects of Stizolophus balsamita extract and taxifolin on the human skin. Sixty healthy Caucasian adult females with no dermatological diseases were investigated. We evaluate the effects of S. balsamita extract and taxifolin on skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). It was revealed that S. balsamita extract might decrease TEWL level and fixed the barrier function of the epidermis. The presence of bioactive phytochemical constituents in S. balsamita inflorescences makes them a valuable and safe source for creating new cosmetics and medicines.","Nawrot, Joanna; Budzianowski, Jaromir; Nowak, Gerard; Micek, Iwona; Budzianowska, Anna; Gornowicz-Porowska, Justyna",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: The clinical course and viral RNA shedding pattern of 267 consecutive symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median duration of viral RNA shedding was 12 days (interquartile range 8-16 days) after the onset of illness. Of the 267 patients included in this study, 65.2% had viral RNA clearance within 14 days, 88.8% within 21 days, and 94.4% within 28 days. Older age (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.00; p = 0.04), time lag from illness onset to hospital admission (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94; p < 0.001), diarrhea (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.96; p = 0.036), corticosteroid treatment (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39-0.94; p = 0.024), and lopinavir/ritonavir use (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.94; p = 0.014) were significantly and independently associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection and timely hospital admission may be warranted for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially for older patients and patients with diarrhea. Corticosteroid treatment is associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding and should be used with caution. Lopinavir/ritonavir use may be associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding in non-severe patients; further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this finding.","Chen, Xudan; Zhu, Baoyi; Hong, Wenxin; Zeng, Jianwen; He, Xi; Chen, Jingfeng; Zheng, Haipeng; Qiu, Shuang; Deng, Ying; Chan, Juliana C N; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Yuying",Int J Infect Dis,,325
268964,The Role of Dysbiosis in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women may be especially susceptible to negative events (i.e. adversity) related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and negative affective responses to these events (i.e. stress). We examined the latent structure of stress and adversity related to the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women, potential antecedents of COVID-19-related stress and adversity in this population, and associations with prenatal depressive symptoms. METHOD: We surveyed 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk. We compared their self-reported depressive symptoms to women matched on demographic factors and history of mental health difficulties who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were nearly twice as likely to have possible depression than were matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Individual- and community-level factors tied to socioeconomic inequality were associated with latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Beyond objective adversity, subjective stress responses were strongly associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Highlighting the role of subjective responses in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform the allocation of resources to support recovery from this pandemic and future disease outbreaks. In addition to policies that mitigate disruptions to the environment due to the pandemic, treatments that focus on cognitions about the self and the environment may help to alleviate depressive symptoms in pregnant women.","King, Lucy S; Feddoes, Daisy E; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S; Humphreys, Kathryn L; Gotlib, Ian H",Psychol Med,,325

271385,Acute ischemic stroke as complication in covid-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome in intensive care unit: A review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ie, COVID-19) has given rise to a global pandemic affecting 215 countries and over 40 million people as of October 2020. Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. METHODS: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. RESULTS: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R0 of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is ""unhealthy"" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.","Wang, Hanyin; Li, Yikuan; Hutch, Meghan; Naidech, Andrew; Luo, Yuan",J Med Internet Res,,325
274250,The role of computerized tomography scan in diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Background: Understanding the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required given its policy implications in relation to the reopening of schools and intergenerational contacts. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of studies that investigated the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for four categories: 1) studies reporting documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by infected children; 2) studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) children; 3) studies reporting cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools; 4) studies estimating the proportions of children infected by SARS-CoV-2, and reported results narratively. Results: A total of 16 unique studies were included for narrative synthesis. There is limited evidence detailing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected children. We found two studies that reported a 3-month-old whose parents developed symptomatic COVID-19 seven days after caring for the infant and two children who may have contracted COVID-19 from the initial cases at a school in New South Wales. In addition, we identified six studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children, three of which found prolonged virus shedding in stools. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We identified only two studies reporting outbreaks of COVID-19 in school settings and one case report of a child attending classes but not infecting any other pupils or staff. Lastly, we identified six studies estimating the proportion of children infected; data from population-based studies in Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, California and a hospital-based study in the UK suggest children may be less likely to be infected. Conclusions: Preliminary results from population-based and school-based studies suggest that children may be less frequently infected or infect others, however current evidence is limited. Prolonged faecal shedding observed in studies highlights the potentially increased risk of faeco-oral transmission in children. Further seroprevalence studies (powered adequately for the paediatric population) are urgently required to establish whether children are in fact less likely to be infected compared to adults. Note: We plan to update this rapid review as new data becomes available. These updates are available at https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/uncover/completed-uncover-reviews.","Li, Xue; Xu, Wei; Dozier, Marshall; He, Yazhou; Kirolos, Amir; Theodoratou, Evropi",J Glob Health,,325

We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection. Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with higher viral load and younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth and size of 614G phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of this variant.","Volz, Erik; Hill, Verity; McCrone, John T; Price, Anna; Jorgensen, David; O039,; Toole, Áine; Southgate, Joel; Johnson, Robert; Jackson, Ben; Nascimento, Fabricia F; Rey, Sara M; Nicholls, Samuel M; Colquhoun, Rachel M; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Shepherd, James; Pascall, David J; Shah, Rajiv; Jesudason, Natasha; Li, Kathy; Jarrett, Ruth; Pacchiarini, Nicole; Bull, Matthew; Geidelberg, Lily; Siveroni, Igor; Goodfellow, Ian; Loman, Nicholas J; Pybus, Oliver G; Robertson, David L; Thomson, Emma C; Rambaut, Andrew; Connor, Thomas R",Cell,,325

What accounts for this failure? The dismantling of the country's public health infrastructure has crippled contact tracing and exacerbated inequality as a disproportionate number of poor people and people of color have fallen ill with Covid-19. Inadequate regulation of the private for-profit sector has adversely affected the efficiency and quality of testing for the virus, and the prescription of costly drugs whose benefit and safety in treating infected patients have not been established. More stringent regulation of the commercial sector has led to the development of efficacious vaccines in a remarkably short time.

Such high-throughput repurposing screens have already identified several existing drugs with potential to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, moving these hits forward for possible development into drugs specifically against this pathogen requires unambiguous identification of their corresponding targets, something the high-throughput screens are not typically designed to reveal. We present here a new computational inverse-docking protocol that uses all-atom protein structures and a combination of docking methods to rank-order targets for each of several existing drugs for which a plurality of recent high-throughput screens detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We demonstrate validation of this method with known drug-target pairs. We subjected 152 distinct drugs potentially suitable for repurposing to the inverse docking procedure. Detailed structural analysis revealed important insights and could potentially lead to more rational design of new drugs against these targets.","Ribone, Sergio P.; Paz, S.

278019,Lung transplantation during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has been a global public health crisis, which has not only endangered the lives of patients, but also resulted in increased psychological issues to medical professionals, especially front-line health care workers (HCWs). As the crisis caused by the pandemic shifts from acute to protracted, attention should be paid to the devastating impacts on HCWs' mental health and social well-being. Digital technologies are being harnessed to support the responses to the pandemic, which provide opportunities to advance mental health and psychological support for HCWs. OBJECTIVE: To develop a framework to describe and organize the mental health and psychological issues that HCWs are facing during the pandemic. Based on the framework, this study also proposed interventions from digital health perspectives, which HCWs could leverage during and after the pandemic. METHODS: The psychological problems and mental health issues that HCWs have been encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed and analyzed based on the proposed MEET (Mental health, Environment, Event, and Technology) framework, which also demonstrated the interactions of the mental health, digital interventions, and social support. RESULTS: HCWs are facing increased risks of mental health issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, including burnout, fear, worry, distress, pressure, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotional stressors may cause psychological problems for HCWs and affect their physical and mental health. Digital technologies and platforms are playing pivotal roles in mitigating psychological issues and providing effective support. The proposed MEET framework could provide structured guidelines for further studies on how technology interacts with mental and psychological health for different populations. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges due to prolonged uncertainty, immediate threat to patient safety, and evolving professional demands. It is urgent to protect the mental health and strengthen the psychological resilience of HCWs. Given the pandemic will exist for a long time, caring for mental health has been a new normal, which needs a strengthened multi-sector collaboration to facilitate the support and reduce health disparities. The proposed framework could enable a better understanding of how to mitigate the psychological effects during the pandemic, recover from associated experiences, and provide comprehensive institutional and societal infrastructures for HCWs' well-being.","Ye, Jiancheng",,,325

METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Catoire, Pierre; Tellier, Eric; de la Rivière, Caroline; Beauvieux, Marie-Christine; Valdenaire, Guillaume; Galinski, Michel; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Gil-Jardiné, Cédric",Am J Emerg Med,,325

Among them, the food supply chain has experienced disruption due to government policies such as the closure of several road accesses and WFH activities as a form of handling COVID-19. This paper aims to analyze disruption and find coping strategies in food supply chain activities. By using the SWOT analysis method. Based on the IFAS-EFAS calculation, it is known that several disturbances that occur in the food supply chain, such as limited transportation access, inadequate production, a decline in value inventory turnover and needs space increased. The output of this research is a coping strategy, namely online marketing and maintaining the stability of food commodity prices, providing innovative rules regarding agricultural land, maintaining product quality and efficient use, increasing the scale of production and distribution as needed, and creating farmer empowerment programs.","Nasution, A.; Azmi, N.

The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and it has rapidly progressed to the form of a pandemic. The presentation is mild in about 80 percent of the cases but the disease can also progress to a severe form of respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failure, especially in people with other co-morbidities. Pregnant women also appear to be at a greater risk of acquiring a severe infection due to physiological changes during pregnancy. Many drugs with in vitro activity against the virus or an immunomodulatory effect have been considered for repurposing or have been tried as off-label drugs. The safety data regarding the use of newly approved or off-label or investigational drugs in pregnant women is limited and this poses a great challenge for clinicians. Therefore, it is important to know the utility and safety of the medications to avoid untoward adverse effects on pregnant women and fetuses. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the approved, off-label, unlicensed, new and some promising pharmacological options for their use in the treatment of COVID-19 and the safety profile in pregnancy in an Indian scenario.","Manchanda, Kavita; Singh, Jasbir; Bhagat, Ranjeev; Tiwana, Ilmjot Kaur; Singh, Harmanjit",Int J Risk Saf Med,,325

A large body of evidence suggests that mentalizing is a beneficial transtheoretical and transdiagnostic concept not only for understanding vulnerability to psychopathology but also in its treatment (for review, see Luyten, Campbell, Allison, & Fonagy, 2020).

The versatility of molecular biology allows it to be effective in several medical fields that include reproduction, immunogenetics, and virology. Implementation of molecular and sequencing technology in reproductive medicine can add another layer of understanding to better define the causes behind infertility and recurrent reproductive loss. In the following, we examine current molecular methods for probing factors behind reproductive pregnancy loss including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and next generation sequencing (NGS). We review several current and potential genetic (DNA) and transcriptional (RNA)-based parameters in women with infertility that can be significant in diagnosis and treatment. These molecular factors can be inferred either from genomic DNA or RNA locally within the endometrium. Furthermore, we consider infection-based abnormalities such as human herpesvirus-6 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Finally, we present future directions as well as data demonstrating the potential role of human endogenous retroviruses in pregnancy loss. We hope these discussions will assist the clinician in delineating some of the intricate molecular factors that can contribute to infertility and recurrent reproductive failures.","Bilal, Mahmood Y; Katara, Gajendra; Dambaeva, Svetlana; Kwak-Kim, Joanne; Gilman-Sachs, Alice; Beaman, Kenneth D",Am J Reprod Immunol,,325

As a matter of fact, timely testing enhances the life-saving judgments on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 infected individuals at possible earliest stage which ultimately suppresses spread of infectious diseases. Many government and private research institutes and manufacturing companies are striving to develop reliable tests for prompt quantification of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarize existing diagnostic methods as manual laboratory-based nucleic acid assays for COVID-19 and their limitations. Moreover, vitality of rapid and point of care serological tests together with emerging biosensing technologies has been discussed in details. Point of care tests with characteristics of rapidity, accurateness, portability, low cost and requiring non-specific devices possess great suitability in COVID-19 diagnosis and detection. Besides, this review also sheds light on several preventive measures to track and manage disease spread in current and future outbreaks of diseases.","Asif, M.; Xu, Y.; Xiao, F.; Sun, Y.",Chemical Engineering Journal,,325

COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by interleukin (IL)-1 and is a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, to date, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations of the population. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulates the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at present, the government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK. It has been noted that the spreading rate of the British variant could be greater than 70% of cases compared to the normal SARS-CoV-2 virus, with an R index growth of 0.4.

We explored the association between Hispanic ethnicity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients in Long Island, New York. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,039 Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 7 and May 23, 2020, at a large suburban academic tertiary care hospital near New York City. We explored the association of ethnicity with need for intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. RESULTS: Of all patients, 1,079 (53%) were non-Hispanic Caucasians and 960 (47%) were Hispanic. Hispanic patients presented in higher numbers than expected for our catchment area. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics were younger (45 years vs. 59 years), had fewer comorbidities (66% with no comorbidities vs. 40%), were less likely to have commercial insurance (35% vs. 59%), or were less likely to come from a nursing home (2% vs. 10%). In univariate comparisons, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (37% vs. 59%) or to die (3% vs. 10%). Age, shortness of breath, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypoxemia, and presentation from nursing homes were associated with admission. Male sex and hypoxemia were associated with ICU admission. Male sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypoxemia were associated with IMV. Male sex, CHF, CAD, and hypoxemia were associated with mortality. After other factors were adjusted for, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.52 to 0.92) but Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with ICU admission, IMV, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics presented at higher rates than average for our population but outcomes among Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were similar to those of Caucasian patients.","Valenzuela, Rolando G; Michelen, Yamil; Bracey, Alexander; Cruz, Priscilla; Fombonne, Benjamin; Fries, Bettina C; Mallon, William K; Fernandes, Rafael; Thode, Henry C; Singer, Adam J",Acad. emerg. med,,325

Therefore, Tfh cells are critical for potent humoral immune responses against various pathogens and their dysregulation has been linked to autoimmunity and cancer. Tfh cell differentiation is a multistep process, in which cognate interactions with different APC types, costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways, as well as cytokines are involved. However, it is still not fully understood how a subset of activated CD4+ T cells begins to express the Tfh cell-defining chemokine receptor CXCR5 during the early stage of the immune response, how some CXCR5+ pre-Tfh cells enter the B-cell follicles and mature further into GC Tfh cells, and how Tfh cells are maintained in the memory compartment. In this review, we discuss recent advances on how antigen and cognate interactions are important for Tfh cell differentiation and long-term persistence of Tfh cell memory, and how this is relevant to the current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Baumjohann, Dirk; Fazilleau, Nicolas",Eur. j. immunol,,325

Infection Prevention worked with the Anesthesia Pre-Op Clinic to test all team members identified over a 3-day period (approximately 5-7 days post-exposure). CONCLUSIONS: Out of the 109 team members who were tested post-exposure, there were zero conversions. The department attributes this to the consistency in PPE training, support and collaboration between Anesthesia and Infection Prevention led to successful care for COVID patients with a limited provider infection rate as evidenced by our low sero-positivity rate amongst healthcare providers when multiple team members tested positive and unknowingly exposed other team members in the department.","Holdsworth, Jill; Sanford, Dr Jay",Am. j. infect. control,,325

This study aimed to measure donor attendance and blood demand in order to help find efficient ways of managing blood supply and demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public emergencies in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from donor attendance, mobile blood drives and blood inventory records were retrospectively obtained for the period between 1 September 2019 and 1 May 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on donor attendance and the management of blood supply and demand in King Abdullah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia. Data were analysed using SPSSStatistics, version 25.0. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: After imported cases of COVID-19 were reported in Saudi Arabia, donor attendance and blood supply at blood bank-based collections showed a drop of 39.5%. On the other hand, blood demand during the same period was reduced by 21.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on donor attendance and blood supply and adversely affected blood transfusion services. Guidelines that prioritize blood transfusion should prepare at the beginning of emergencies similar to this pandemic. Close monitoring of blood needs and blood supply and appropriate response is essential for avoiding sudden blood shortage. An evidence-based emergency blood management plan and flexible regulatory policy should be ready to deal with any disaster and to respond quickly in the case of blood shortage.","Yahia, Amar Ibrahim Omer",Transfus Apher Sci,,325

In the last decade, theranostic nanoparticles were reported as promising tool for efficiently and selectively deliver therapeutic moieties (i.e. drugs, vaccines, siRNA, peptide) to target sites of infection. In addition, they allow monitoring infectious sides and treatment responses using noninvasive imaging modalities. While intranasal delivery was proposed as the preferred administration route for therapeutic agents against viral pulmonary diseases, NP-based delivery systems offer numerous benefits to overcome challenges associated with mucosal administration, and ensure that these agents achieve a concentration that is many times higher than expected in the targeted sites of infection while limiting side effects on normal cells.

In this study, computational screening is performed by molecular docking of 1615 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising approved drugs, including Simeprevir, Ergotamine, Bromocriptine and Tadalafil, stand out as the best candidates based on their binding energy, fitting score and noncovalent interactions at the binding sites of the receptor. All selected drugs interact with the key active site residues, including His41 and Cys145. Various noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, pi-sulfur and pi-pi interactions appear to be dominant in drug-Mpro complexes. MD simulations are applied for the most promising drugs. Structural stability and compactness are observed for the drug-Mpro complexes. The protein shows low flexibility in both apo and holo form during MD simulations. The MM/PBSA binding free energies are also measured for the selected drugs. For pattern recognition, structural similarity and binding energy prediction, multiple linear regression (MLR) models are used for the quantitative structural-activity relationship. The binding energy predicted by MLR model shows an 82% accuracy with the binding energy determined by molecular docking.

302516,"Attitudes and Psychological Factors Associated With News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors Among US Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic",2020,"BACKGROUND: Working memory deficit is one of the most critical complex cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy, but not still unsatisfactory. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which has recently been used in clinical practice, may have faster and stronger effects comparing the traditional model (10-Hz high-frequency rTMS). A large number of studies have showed that rTMS, especially iTBS, can enhance the neural plasticity of the brain, and cognitive training can improve the cognitive function of schizophrenia. Is there any facilitation effect of iTBS add on cognitive training (such as working memory training, WMT) on cognitive function enhancement in schizophrenia is still unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is designed of a double-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will include 200 schizophrenia patients between 18 and 45 years of age. The patients will be randomized to four groups, i.e., the study group (iTBS+WMT), WMS control group (iTBS+ Simple Response Training (SRT)), iTBS control group (sham iTBS+WMT), and placebo control (sham iTBS+SRT). The patients will receive 3 min 20 s of real or sham stimulation, followed by a short 1-2-min rest and 40 min of WMT training or SRT immediately. Neuropsychological and clinical symptom assessments, with functional and structural MRI, will be performed on baseline, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up periods. The primary outcome is cognitive function measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The secondary outcomes are changes in neuroplasticity, as measured by MRI and other behavioral assessments. DISCUSSION: The aim of our study is to explore the facilitation effects of iTBS added on WMT in improving cognitive function of schizophrenia. That means, patients with schizophrenia will benefit more in cognitive function improvement from the combination training mode of ""preheating (iTBS stimulation changes the neural activity of working memory-related brain regions) and ironning (working memory training)."" And the long-term effects of this combined training model will be assessed at a 6-month follow-up period. In case of a significant improvement of working memory with a prolonged effect, the iTBS combined with WMT protocol could be considered as a first-line clinical protocol in schizophrenia treatment.

To address the resulting challenges faced by students interested in emergency medicine (EM), we proposed and held a peer-led, online learning course for rising fourth-year medical students. METHODS: A total of 61 medical students participated in an eight-lecture EM course. Students were evaluated through pre- and post-course assessments designed to ascertain perceived comfort with learning objectives and overall course feedback. Pre- and post-lecture assignments were also used to increase student learning. RESULTS: Mean confidence improved in every learning objective after the course. Favored participation methods were three-person call-outs, polling, and using the ""chat"" function. Resident participation was valued for ""real-life"" examples and clinical pearls. CONCLUSION: This interactive model for online EM education can be an effective format for dissemination when in-person education may not be available.","Rosenthal, Hailey B; Sikka, Neha; Lieber, Adam C; Sanky, Charles; Cayon, Christian; Newman, Daniel; Marquez, Denisse R; Ziff, Jacob; Blum, James R; Dai, Jennifer B; Groden, Phillip; Pasik, Sara; Pour, Trevor",West J Emerg Med,,325

However, these cells are vulnerable to lysis by allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells due to their lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule expression. Here, constitutive expression of mutant B2M-HLA-E (mBE) and B2M-HLA-G (mBG) fusion proteins in anti-CD19 UCAR T (UCAR T-19) cells was conducted to protect against allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. The ability of cells expressing mBE or mBG to resist NK cell-mediated lysis was observed in gene-edited Jurkat CAR19 cells. UCAR T-19 cells constitutively expressing the mBE and mBG fusion proteins were manufactured and showed effective and specific anti-tumor activity. Constitutive expression of the mBE and mBG fusion proteins in UCAR T-19 cells prevented allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. In addition, these cells were not recognizable by allogeneic T cells. Additional experiments, including those in animal models and clinical trials, are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCAR T-19 cells that constitutively express mBE and mBG.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrative literature review to examine the barriers and facilitators to mentoring in health-related research, particularly for three categories: new investigators (NI), early-stage investigators (ESI) and underrepresented minority faculty (UMF). PsychINFO, CINAHL and PubMed were searched for papers published in English from 2010 to 2020, and 46 papers were reviewed. Most papers recommended having multiple mentors and many recommended assessing baseline research skills. Barriers and facilitators were both individual and institutional. Individual barriers mentioned most frequently were a lack of time and finding work-life balance. UMF mentioned barriers related to bias, discrimination and isolation. Institutional barriers included lack of mentors, lack of access to resources, and heavy teaching and service loads. UMF experienced institutional barriers such as devaluation of experience or expertise. Individual facilitators were subdivided and included writing and synthesis as technical skills, networking and collaborating as interpersonal skills, and accountability, leadership, time management, and resilience/grit as personal skills. Institutional facilitators included access to mentoring, professional development opportunities, and workload assigned to research. Advocacy for diversity and cultural humility were included as unique interpersonal and institutional facilitators for UMF. Several overlapping and unique barriers and facilitators to mentoring for research success for NI, ESI and UMF in the health-related disciplines are presented.","Ransdell, Lynda B; Lane, Taylor S; Schwartz, Anna L; Wayment, Heidi A; Baldwin, Julie A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,325

The outbreak of virus infection has aroused great concern of the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is highly infectious and has a high infection rate. So far, no specific drug has been found to cure it. China as one of the first countries attacked by epidemic has shown outstanding in fighting against the COVID-19. The contribution of traditional Chinese medicine can not be ignored. As a kind of representative of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese patent medicine injection has significant effect in reducing the clinical symptoms of patients and preventing the deterioration of the disease. However, there is no systematic review of its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: All randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicine injection for COVID-19 will be included. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature database and some clinical trial registration websites. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts, full texts, and extract data, then assess the bias risk of each study. We will conduct meta-analyses to assess all the available evidence of the efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Systematic review of current evidence will be provided from the indexes of efficacy and safety.

Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. In addition, structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes.","Guardia, Carlos M; Tan, Xiao-Feng; Lian, Tengfei; Rana, Mitra S; Zhou, Wenchang; Christenson, Eric T; Lowry, Augustus J; Faraldo-Gómez, José D; Bonifacino, Juan S; Jiang, Jiansen; Banerjee, Anirban",Cell Rep,,325
318360,Preventing the clinical manifestations and disease progression of coronavirus disease using clinically proven protease inhibitors,2020,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the new coronavirus causing an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in China in December, 2019. This disease, currently named COVID-19, has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6, 2020. Here we characterize an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the pandemic recovered in April, 2020. Objective: To describe the isolation and characterization of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate from the epidemic in Colombia. Materials and methods: A nasopharyngeal specimen from a COVID-19 positive patient was inoculated on different cell lines. To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on cultures we used qRT-PCR, indirect immunofluorescence assay, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and next-generation sequencing. Results: We determined the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells by the appearance of the cytopathic effect three days post-infection and confirmed it by the positive results in the qRT-PCR and the immunofluorescence with convalescent serum. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy images obtained from infected cells showed the presence of structures compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a complete genome sequence obtained by next-generation sequencing allowed classifying the isolate as B.1.5 lineage. Conclusion: The evidence presented in this article confirms the first isolation of SARSCoV-2 in Colombia. In addition, it shows that this strain behaves in cell culture in a similar way to that reported in the literature for other isolates and that its genetic composition is consistent with the predominant variant in the world. Finally, points out the importance of viral isolation for the detection of neutralizing antibodies, for the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the strain and for testing compounds with antiviral potential.","Díaz, Francisco J; Aguilar-Jiménez, Wbeimar; Flórez-Álvarez, Lizdany; Valencia, Gladys; Laiton-Donato, Katherine; Franco-Muñoz, Carlos; Álvarez-Díaz, Diego; Mercado-Reyes, Marcela; Rugeles, María Teresa",Biomedica,,325

Vaccine hesitancy has increased during recent years, and more research is needed on its situational determinants. This paper reports a preregistered experiment (N = 654) that examined whether communicating descriptive social norms - information about what most people do - is an effective way of influencing young people's intentions and reducing their hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found weak support for our main hypothesis that conveying strong (compared to weak) norms leads to reduced hesitancy and stronger intentions. Furthermore, norms did not produce significantly different effects compared to standard vaccine information from the authorities. Moreover, no support was found for the hypothesis that young people are more strongly influenced by norms when the norm reference group consists of other young individuals rather than people in general. These findings suggest that the practical usefulness of signaling descriptive norms is rather limited, and may not be more effective than standard appeals in the quest of encouraging young adults to trust and accept a new vaccine.","Sinclair, Samantha; Agerström, Jens",Health Commun,,325

The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread. METHODS: Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, annual routine infant BCG vaccine coverage (represented by the number of BCG vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The BCG vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no COVID-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with BCG vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20-34 and 40-54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that routine infant BCG vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local COVID-19 spread in Japan.","Kinoshita, Masako; Tanaka, Masami",J Infect,,325

While the therapist usually controls the frame through how they arrange their office, internet glitches can come from either the therapist’s or the patient’s side. These glitches can be thought of as either purely technological or as an unconscious enactment, more like a parapraxis. Both kinds of glitches can offer the opportunity to uncover meaning in the relationship. Exploration might help elucidate either the patient’s reaction to the technological glitch or the unconscious meaning behind a parapraxis glitch.

It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions.","Hulme, Philip E",Emerg Top Life Sci,,325

Moreover, emerging mutated virus strains present an even greater challenge for existing vaccines and medications. One possible solution is to design drugs based on the properties of virus epigenome, which are more common among coronaviruses. Here, we reported an FDA-approved drug for myelodysplastic syndrome, azacytidine (5Aza), limited virus infection and protected mice against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that this antiviral effect is related to 5Aza incorporation into viral RNA, which disrupt m5C RNA methylation modification profile. This work suggests that targeting viral epigenomes is a viable therapeutic strategy, potentially opening new pathways for treating COVID-19.","Lin, Xian; Ke, Xianliang; Lin, Xia; Zhang, Tianying; Xiong, Hualong; Zhao, Binghai; Liu, Wen; Chen, Quanjiao; Tang, Chong",,,325

336802,The prognostic role of hyperglycemia and glucose variability in covid-related acute respiratory distress Syndrome,2021,"Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, knowledge transfer from pretrained models showed outstanding performance in medical image classification. However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this article, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, which we called self-supervised super sample decomposition for transfer learning (4S-DT) model. The 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabeled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition (CD) layer to simplify the local structure of the data. The 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream CD mechanism. We used 50000 unlabeled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. The 4S-DT has achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% on the larger of the two datasets used in the experimental study and an accuracy of 97.54% on the smaller dataset, which was enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed M; Gaber, Mohamed Medhat",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,,325

338835,Neurologic Emergencies during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2021,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms can not manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.","Yang, Guang; Ye, Qinghao; Xia, Jun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01998v1.pdf,325

However, the efficacy of vaccines has not yet been demonstrated in combination with commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens. We sought to determine how common pharmaceutical drugs used in autoimmune disorders can alter immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination. We treated mice with five immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil), each with various mechanisms of action prior to and following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We assessed the functionality of antibody responses to spike protein and compared immune cell populations in mice that received no treatment with those that received continuous or temporarily suspended immune suppressive therapy. All tested immunosuppressants significantly reduced the antibody titers in serum and functional antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in immunized mice. Temporarily halting selected immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone and methotrexate, but not cyclophosphamide) improved antibody responses significantly. Through proof-of-principle experiments utilizing a mouse model, we demonstrated that immune suppression in autoimmune disorders through pharmaceutical treatments may impair vaccine response to SARS-CoV-2, and temporary suspension of immunosuppressant treatment may be necessary to mount an effective antibody vaccine response. This work provides feasibility for future clinical assessment of the impact of immunosuppressants on vaccine efficacy in humans. Significance StatementImmunosuppressant regimens are widely used as therapies for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, and cancer. However, immunosuppressants can impair critical immune responses to vaccination. The impact of standard immunosuppressant use on the critical, developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies has not been well-described. In this study, we use a mouse model to determine how different immunosuppressant drugs that act through different mechanisms can impair the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and how modulating these drug regimens may restore antibody levels and function.","Paschall, Amy V; Ozdilek, Ahmet; Briner, Sydney L; Brindley, Melinda A; Avci, Fikri",,,325

Knowledge can influence healthcare professionals through adoption of the correct attitudes and practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by a questionnaire, the perceptions of physicians about their level of knowledge as well as conditions in their workplaces for dealing with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Angolan physicians took place from 11 May to 23 June 2020. A questionnaire was electronically shared across social media and via email. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 637 valid questionnaires; 53% of respondents were female, 41% were aged 31-40 y and 79% were from Luanda province. About 51% of physicians perceived that they had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 and 64% used personal protective equipment. These figures were higher among specialists from the province of Luanda. About 81% stated that their health units lacked the technical capacity to diagnose COVID-19. Only 35% of health units have chest tomography equipment; 44% are prepared for the care and/or isolation of patients. Only 33% of units are running intensive care units. The main concerns of physicians were training opportunities and limited access to personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: The results show that it is necessary to strengthen physicians' knowledge about COVID-19, as well as to improve the conditions of the health units, so as to promote safe practices.","Arrais, Margarete; Dias, Welwitschia; Gama, Jorge M R; Brito, Miguel",International health (Online),,325

Investigating the mechanical properties of glass is challenging because any global deformation that may result in shear rejuvenation requires an astronomical relaxation time. Moreover, it is well known that a glass is heterogeneous and a global perturbation cannot explore local mechanical/transport properties. However, an investigation based on a local probe, i.e. microrheology, may overcome these problems. Here, we establish active microrheology of a bulk metallic glass: a probe particle driven into host medium glass. This is a technique amenable for experimental investigations. We show that upon cooling the microscopic friction exhibits a second-order phase transition; this sheds light on the origin of friction in heterogeneous materials. Further, we provide distinct evidence to demonstrate that a strong relationship exists between the microscopic dynamics of the probe particle and the macroscopic properties of the host medium glass. These findings establish active microrheology as a promising technique for investigating the local properties of bulk metallic glass.","Yu, Ji Woong; Rahbari, S. H.

Multiple therapeutic options have been explored, including corticosteroids. Preliminary results of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are encouraging; however, the role of corticosteroids remains controversial. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the impact of corticosteroids in mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on corticosteroids and COVID-19 in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) of published literature through July 22, 2020, that report outcomes of interest in COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroids with a comparative group. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 patients were identified. Corticosteroid use was reported widely in mechanically ventilated patients (35.3%), ICU patients (51.3%), and severe COVID-19 patients (40%). Corticosteroids showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P = .0006); however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted among high-dose or low-dose corticosteroid regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose corticosteroids do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids regimens. INTERPRETATION: Our results showed evidence of mortality benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. STUDY DESIGN: Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). RESULTS: Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.","Xia, Xiao-Ying; Wu, Jing; Liu, He-Lei; Xia, Hong; Jia, Bei; Huang, Wen-Xiang",J Clin Virol,,325

We examine this question based on a sample of 41 countries for which data are available. Results reveal that a high level of trust in government predicts better crisis management in terms of relatively low levels of cases and deaths.

For droplet radii in the range 100 nm<R<60 {\mu}m, evaporation can be described in the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion limited. Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate, the time-dependent droplet size and the sedimentation time, including the significant effect of evaporation cooling. Evaporation makes the time for large droplets to sediment much longer and thus significantly increases the viral air load. Using recent estimates for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sputum and droplet production rates while speaking, a single infected person that constantly speaks without a mouth cover produces a total air load of more than 10^4 virions. In a mid-size closed room, this leads to a viral inhalation frequency of at least 2.5 per minute. Low relative humidity, as encountered inside buildings in winter and in airliners, speeds evaporation and thus keeps initially larger droplets suspended in air.","Netz, Roland R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12584v2.pdf,325

Searches on sight loss and hearing loss, which are not considered as COVID-19 symptoms, were used as control. Google Trends results per region in Italy or state in the US were compared to COVID-19 incidence in the corresponding geographical areas. The COVID-19 incidence did not correlate with searches for non-symptoms, but in some weeks had high correlation with taste and smell loss searches, which also correlated with each other. Correlation of the sensory symptoms with new COVID-19 cases for each country as a whole was high at some time points, but decreased (Italy) or dramatically fluctuated over time (US). Smell loss searches correlated with the incidence of media reports in the US. Our results show that popularity of symptom searches is not reliable for pandemic monitoring.

379159,Maternal-fetal surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"Medicine and public health have traditionally separated the prevention and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this paradigm, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a 10-fold higher case-fatality rate compared with the general population. Although the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19. Louisiana is ranked within the bottom 5 states for cardiovascular health, and it is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally. Herein, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, LA, a city holding a sobering yet resilient history with previous public health disasters. In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to health care, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities. Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.","Razavi, Alexander C; Kelly, Tanika N; He, Jiang; Fernandez, Camilo; Whelton, Paul K; Krousel-Wood, Marie; Bazzano, Lydia A",J Am Heart Assoc,,325

384294,Thyroid complications of SARS and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, transmissible both person-to-person and from contaminated surfaces. Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9-April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fifty-nine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10-3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50-4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature &#8805; 37.5°C (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95-6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04-3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95-17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8-99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays.","Lan, Fan-Yun; Filler, Robert; Mathew, Soni; Buley, Jane; Iliaki, Eirini; Bruno-Murtha, Lou Ann; Osgood, Rebecca; Christophi, Costas A; Fernandez-Montero, Alejandro; Kales, Stefanos N",PLoS One,,325

390843,Cardiac injury is independently associated with mortality irrespective of comorbidity in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense disease burden. Although public health countermeasures effectively controlled the epidemic in China, non-pharmaceutical interventions can neither be maintained indefinitely nor conveniently implemented globally. Vaccination is mainly used to prevent COVID-19, and most current antiviral treatment evaluations focus on clinical efficacy. Therefore, we conducted population-based simulations to assess antiviral treatment effectiveness among different age groups based on its clinical efficacy. METHODS: We collected COVID-19 data of Wuhan City from published literature and established a database (from 2 December 2019 to 16 March 2020). We developed an age-specific model to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19. Efficacy was divided into three types: (1) viral activity reduction, reflected as transmission rate decrease [reduction was set as v (0-0.8) to simulate hypothetical antiviral treatments]; (2) reduction in the duration time from symptom onset to patient recovery/removal, reflected as a 1/Î³ decrease (reduction was set as 1-3 days to simulate hypothetical or real-life antiviral treatments, and the time of asymptomatic was reduced by the same proportion); (3) fatality rate reduction in severely ill patients (fc) [reduction (z) was set as 0.3 to simulate real-life antiviral treatments]. The population was divided into four age groups (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4), which included those aged &#8804; 14; 15-44; 45-64; and &#8805; 65 years, respectively. Evaluation indices were based on outbreak duration, cumulative number of cases, total attack rate (TAR), peak date, number of peak cases, and case fatality rate (f). RESULTS: Comparing the simulation results of combination and single medication therapy s, all four age groups showed better results with combination medication. When 1/Î³ = 2 and v = 0.4, age group 2 had the highest TAR reduction rate (98.48%, 56.01-0.85%). When 1/Î³ = 2, z = 0.3, and v = 0.1, age group 1 had the highest reduction rate of f (83.08%, 0.71-0.12%). CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatments are more effective in COVID-19 transmission control than in mortality reduction. Overall, antiviral treatments were more effective in younger age groups, while older age groups showed higher COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to prevention of viral spread and patients deaths when providing antiviral treatments to patients of older age groups.","Lin, Sheng-Nan; Rui, Jia; Chen, Qiu-Ping; Zhao, Bin; Yu, Shan-Shan; Li, Zhuo-Yang; Zhao, Ze-Yu; Wang, Yao; Zhu, Yuan-Zhao; Xu, Jing-Wen; Yang, Meng; Liu, Xing-Chun; Yang, Tian-Long; Luo, Li; Deng, Bin; Huang, Jie-Feng; Liu, Chan; Li, Pei-Hua; Liu, Wei-Kang; Xie, Fang; Chen, Yong; Su, Yan-Hua; Zhao, Ben-Hua; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Chen, Tian-Mu",Infect Dis Poverty,,325

OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 33 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received painless fiberoptic bronchoscopy in Wuhan First Hospital. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including age, gender, and ASA classification were collected. The patients received intravenous anesthesia with topical airway anesthesia with lidocaine. The changes in the vital signs of the patients were recorded before, during and after the procedure. The cough intensity of the patients during bronchoscopy were evaluated, and the adverse reactions within 24 h after the procedure were observed. The health status of the medical staff carrying out the procedure was also monitored. OBJECTIVE: The 33 patients with ASA class â ¡ to â £ included 19 male and 14 female patients with an average age of 63.58±11.85 years. The lowest SpO2 of the patients during bronchoscopy was (94.8±4.3)%, which was significantly lower than that before the procedure [(99.1±1.3)%, P < 0.05] but was restored to more than 95% after such treatment as holding the jaw to open the airway or face mask positive-pressure ventilation. Bronchoscopy was completed successfully in all the patients, and 28 patients (84.85%) had mild cough during the procedure. None of the patients had obvious complications related to anesthesia. While performing the procedure, all the medical staff used third-level protection and facial protection with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), and the patients' face were covered with single-use sterile medical plastic curtains that were originally intended for collecting flushing fluid during arthroscopic procedures. No medical personnel was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of the study.

396711,Preparing for the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in the African region,2020,"Efforts to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic include the screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be repurposed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) often show decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer (unmodified Calu-1 and A549) cells. The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9-amino-acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6-cultured viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) receptor blocking, and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependence on ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma, but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of NUCs. Among the tested NUCs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir, and, to a limited extent, galidesivir showed antiviral effects across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.","Ramirez, Santseharay; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Galli, Andrea; Underwood, Alexander; Pham, Long V; Ryberg, Line A; Feng, Shan; Pedersen, Martin S; Mikkelsen, Lotte S; Belouzard, Sandrine; Dubuisson, Jean; Sølund, Christina; Weis, Nina; Gottwein, Judith M; Fahnøe, Ulrik; Bukh, Jens",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,,325
397837,The Central Role of Clinical Nutrition in COVID-19 Patients During and After Hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit,2020,"COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health crisis since the first report of infection in December of 2019. However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and proteins of their hosts. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. We developed a machine learning-based method to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2 and 19 highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins in the innate immune pathway.","Du, Hangyu; Chen, Feng; Liu, Hongfu; Hong, Pengyu",Patterns (N Y),,325

However, the accompanying neurocognitive changes remain poorly understood. RECENT FINDINGS: We synthetize the current knowledge of viral (SARS-CoV-2) induced inflammation, mechanisms to viral entry into the central nervous system and altered neurotransmitter systems to provide an informed neurobiological explanation for the rise of neurocognitive disorders (defined as per the DSM-5 criteria). SUMMARY: The mild and major neurocognitive disorder symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic provide a unique opportunity to address the early changes underlying neurocognitive impairment at both clinical and molecular level. We discuss the utilization of the available evidence for their management and future novel therapeutic opportunities.","Mukaetova-Ladinska, Elizabeta B; Kronenberg, Golo; Raha-Chowdhury, Ruma",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,325

The WHO announced this new disease was to be known as ""COVID-19."" When looking for new antiviral compounds, knowledge of the main viral proteins is fundamental. The major druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 include 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike (S) protein. Quercetin inhibits 3CLpro and PLpro with a docking binding energy corresponding to -6.25 and -4.62 kcal/mol, respectively. Quercetin has a theoretical, but significant, capability to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication, with the results showing this to be the fifth best compound out of 18 candidates. On the basis of the clinical COVID-19 manifestations, the multifaceted aspect of quercetin as both antiinflammatory and thrombin-inhibitory actions, should be taken into consideration.","Derosa, Giuseppe; Maffioli, Pamela; D039,; Angelo, Angela; Di Pierro, Francesco",Phytother Res,,325

While taste perception in the laboratory has been widely studied, it has rarely been taken into account when exploring dietary patterns in a population (3). The aim of this work is to identify consumers' taste perceptions for a list of foods. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme year 9 was used to generate a list of foods consumed by adolescents (10-19 years old). 1748 different foods were grouped by type/food group, and/or sugar/salt contents into 7 main and 23 subgroups. A pilot test identified foods with high agreement to further limit the list. The shortened food list was included in an online survey which was distributed to Facebook groups and Twitter. Food-taste classification questions asked participants to allocate one main taste to each food: sweet, salty, sour, bitter and savoury/umami;neutral and never tried. To minimize participant burden, the food list was divided into 3 and participants were asked to complete one part with an option to complete the rest. Foods were allocated to taste categories based on agreement by ≥ 50% of respondents. If there was a &lt; 50% agreement, foods were classified by allocation to two+ taste categories based on the highest scoring taste combinations The pilot questionnaire was completed by 19 participants. 15/19 rated 55 foods as the same taste and these were removed from the final questionnaire. The final food list contained 184 items. The main online questionnaire obtained 209 responses from 162 females, 44 males, (3 not known). The age range was from 18-70+ years with the majority between 40-59 years old. Seven reported having COVID-19, but only 3 were tested positive (none experienced a taste loss). Food items were classified as 29% neutral, 22% sweet, 11% savoury/umami, 9% salty, 7% bitter, and 5% sour. Six mixed tastes categories were identified: savoury/umami-salty (11%), sweet-sour (3%), sweet-bitter (2%), sour-bitter (1%), salty-bitter (0.5%) and savoury/umami-bitter (1%). In the next step of the study, taste categories will be applied to the remaining foods consumed by adolescents reported in the NDNS to generate taste patterns allowing us to explore links with nutrition and anthropometry. We have characterised major tastes for all foods consumed in the most recent NDNS. This will allow us to create a UK food-taste database and explore dietary-taste patterns in the NDNS.","Bawajeeh, A.

As the burden of the disease escalates, routine elective surgeries are being cancelled. The aim of this paper was to provide a guideline for management of endocrine surgical disorders during a pandemic. METHODS: We used Delphi method with a nine-scale Likert scale on two rounds of voting involving 64 experienced eminent surgeons and endocrinologists who had the necessary experience to provide insight on endocrine disorder management. All voting was done by email using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 37 recommendations were voted on. In two rounds, all recommendations reached an agreement and were either endorsed or rejected. Endorsed statements include dietary change in primary hyperparathyroidism, Cinacalcet treatment in secondary hyperparathyroidism, alpha-blocker administration for pheochromocytoma, methimazole ± ß-blocker combination for Graves' disease, and follow-up for fine-needle aspiration results of thyroid nodules indicated as Bethesda 3-4 cytological results and papillary microcarcinoma. CONCLUSION: This survey summarizes expert opinion for the management of endocrine surgical conditions during unprecedented times when access to surgical treatment is severely disrupted. The statements are not applicable in circumstances in which surgical treatment is possible.","Agcaoglu, Orhan; Sezer, Atakan; Makay, Ozer; Erdogan, Murat Faik; Bayram, Fahri; Guldiken, Sibel; Raffaelli, Marco; Sonmez, Yusuf Alper; Lee, Yong-Sang; Vamvakidis, Kyriakos; Mihai, Radu; Duh, Quan-Yang; Akinci, Baris; Alagol, Faruk; Almquist, Martin; Barczynski, Marcin; Bayraktaroglu, Taner; Berber, Eren; Bukey, Yusuf; Cakmak, Guldeniz Karadeniz; Canturk, Nuh Zafer; Canturk, Zeynep; Celik, Mehmet; Celik, Ozlem; Ceyhan, Banu Ozturk; Cherenko, Sergii; Clerici, Thomas; Coombes, David Scott; Demircan, Orhan; Deyneli, Oguzhan; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Emre, Ali Ugur; Erbil, Yesim; Filiz, Ali Ilker; Gozu, Hulya Iliksu; Gurdal, Sibel Ozkan; Gurleyik, Gunay; Haciyanli, Mehmet; Kebudi, Abut; Kim, Seokmo; Koutelidakis, Giannis; Kuru, Bekir; Mert, Meral; Oruk, Guzide Gonca; Ozbas, Serdar; Palazzo, Fausto; Pandev, Rumen; Riss, Phillip; Sabuncu, Tevfik; Sahin, Ibrahim",Updates surg.

We performed histopathological analyses and quantitative (q)RT-PCR-testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on retinal tissues and vitreous of COVID-19 postmortem donors. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Included in this study were 10 eyes of 5 deceased COVID-19 patients. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via pharyngeal swabs and broncho-alveolar fluids. The highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) and measures was employed during fluid-tissue procurement and preparation. Histopathological examinations and qRT-PCR-testing were carried out for all retinal tissues and vitreous fluids. RESULTS: The histopathological examinations revealed no signs of morphologically identifiable retinal inflammation or vessel occlusions based on hematoxylin and eosin stains. By qRT-PCRs, we detected no significant level of viral RNA in human retina and vitreous. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no significant level of SARS-CoV-2-RNA was detected in the human retinal and vitreous fluid samples of deceased COVID-19 patients. Histopathological examinations confirmed no morphological sign of damage to retinal vasculature or tissues.

This sudden explosion and uncontrolled worldwide spread of COVID-19 has revealed the limitations of existing healthcare systems regarding handling public health emergencies. As governments seek to effectively re-establish their economies, open workplaces, ensure safe travels and progressively return to normal life, there is an urgent need for technologies that may alleviate the severity of the losses. This article explores a promising solution for secure Digital Health Certificate, called NovidChain, a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving platform for COVID-19 test/vaccine certificates issuing and verifying. More precisely, NovidChain incorporates several emergent concepts: (i) Blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and immutability, (ii) self-sovereign identity to allow users to have complete control over their data, (iii) encryption of Personally Identifiable Information to enhance privacy, (iv) W3C verifiable credentials standard to facilitate instant verification of COVID-19 proof, and (v) selective disclosure concept to permit user to share selected pieces of information with trusted parties. Therefore, NovidChain is designed to meet a high level of protection of personal data, in compliant with the GDPR and KYC requirements, and guarantees the user's self-sovereignty, while ensuring both the safety of populations and the user's right to privacy. To prove the security and efficiency of the proposed NovidChain platform, this article also provides a detailed technical description, a proof-of-concept implementation, different experiments, and a comparative evaluation. The evaluation shows that NovidChain provides better financial cost and scalability results compared to other solutions. More precisely, we note a high difference in time between operations (i.e., between 46% and 56%). Furthermore, the evaluation confirms that NovidChain ensures security properties, particularly data integrity, forge, binding, uniqueness, peer-indistinguishability, and revocation.","Abid, Amal; Cheikhrouhou, Saoussen; Kallel, Slim; Jmaiel, Mohamed",,,325

429630,Navigating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) in Physiatry: A CAN Report for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities,2020,"The purpose of this study is to observe the potential of lung ultrasound in evaluating the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Lung ultrasound was performed in ten zones of the patients' chest walls. The features of the ultrasound images were observed, and a lung ultrasound score (LUS) was recorded. The ultrasound features and scores were compared between the refractory group (PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 100 mm Hg or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and the non-refractory group. The prediction value of the LUS was studied by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In total, 7 patients were enrolled in the refractory group and 28 in the non-refractory group. B-line patterns and shred signs were the most common signs in all patients. Patients in the refractory group had significantly more ground-glass signs (median 6 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.5-6.5] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-3]), consolidation signs (median 1 [IQR, 1-1.5] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-3]) and pleural effusions (median 5 [IQR, 1.5-6] vs. median 0 [IQR, 0-0.25]). The LUS was significantly higher in the refractory group (33.00 [IQR 27.50-34.00] vs. 25.50 [IQR 22.75-30.00]). The ROC of the LUS showed a cutoff score of 32 with a specificity of 0.893 and a sensitivity of 0.571 in diagnosing refractory respiratory failure among patients. In COVID-19 patients, lung ultrasound is a promising diagnostic tool in diagnosing patients with refractory pneumonia.","Zhao, Lina; Yu, Kanglong; Zhao, Qi; Tian, Rui; Xie, Hui; Xie, Lijun; Deng, Puyu; Xie, Guogang; Bao, Aihua; Du, Jiang",Ultrasound Med Biol,,325

Furthermore, the most appropriate corticosteroid and dose in the treatment of COVID-19 have remained uncertain. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from August to November 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day; intervention group) or dexamethasone (6 mg/day; control group). Data were assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups on admission. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, p = 0.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, p = 0.001) of admission. There was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, p = 0.004). The mean length of hospital stay was 7.43 ± 3.64 and 10.52 ± 5.47 days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.015). The need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized hypoxic COVID-19 patients, methylprednisolone demonstrated better results compared to dexamethasone.

The high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) make it a significant threat to global public health. Elucidating its pathogenesis is essential to finding effective therapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 71 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on cytokines, T lymphocytes, and other clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from patients with variable disease severity. The effects of cytokines on the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients were analyzed. The critically severe and severe patients had higher infection indexes and significant multiple organ function abnormalities than the mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critically severe patients than in the severe and mild patients (P < 0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were closely associated with white blood cells, neutrophils, T lymphocyte subsets, D-D dimer, blood urea nitrogen, complement C1q, procalcitonin C-reactive protein. Moreover, the IL-6 and IL-10 levels were closely correlated to dyspnea and dizziness (P < 0.05). The patients with higher IL-10 levels had shorter OS than the group with lower levels (P < 0.05). The older patients with higher levels of single IL-6 or IL-10 tended to have shorter EFS (P < 0.05), while the patients who had more elevated IL-6 and IL-10 had shorter OS (P < 0.05). The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that IL-6 was the independent factor affecting EFS. IL-6 and IL-10 play crucial roles in COVID-19 prognosis.","Tang, Yueting; Sun, Jiayu; Pan, Huaqin; Yao, Fen; Yuan, Yumeng; Zeng, Mi; Ye, Guangming; Yang, Gui; Zheng, Bokun; Fan, Junli; Pan, Yunbao; Zhao, Ziwu; Guo, Shuang; Liu, Yinjuan; Liao, Fanlu; Duan, Yongwei; Jiao, Xiaoyang; Li, Yirong",Cytokine,,325

The rapid pace of emerging scientific information has prompted this activity to discover research/knowledge gaps. This methodology adhered with recommendations from the Joanna Briggs Institute. There were 2301 citations imported. Of these, there were 439 articles fully abstracted, with 23 main topic areas identified across 24 article types and sourced across 61 countries and 51 specialties in 8 settings and among 14 populations. Epidemiological/mechanistic relationships between nutrition and COVID-19 were reviewed and results mapped to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Time (PICO-T) questions. The aggregated data were analyzed by clinical stage: pre-COVID-19, acute COVID-19, and chronic/post-COVID-19. Research gaps were discovered for all PICO-T questions. Nutrition topics meriting urgent research included food insecurity/societal infrastructure and transcultural factors (pre-COVID-19); cardiometabolic-based chronic disease, pediatrics, nutrition support, and hospital infrastructure (acute COVID-19); registered dietitian nutritionist counseling (chronic/post-COVID-19); and malnutrition and management (all stages). The paucity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was particularly glaring. Knowledge gaps were discovered for PICO-T questions on pediatrics, micronutrients, bariatric surgery, and transcultural factors (pre-COVID-19); enteral nutrition, protein-energy requirements, and glycemic control with nutrition (acute COVID-19); and home enteral and parenteral nutrition support (chronic/post-COVID-19).

OBJECTIVES: CD146 + circulating endothelial cells (CD146 + CECs) and their progenitors (CEPs) are increased in cardiovascular, thrombotic, infectious, and cancer diseases. The present study was designed to investigate their kinetics in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We used a validated flow cytometry procedure to enumerate viable and apoptotic CD146 + CECs and CEPs in COVID-19 patients during the course of the disease and in patients who recovered. RESULTS: Viable CEPs per milliliter were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls. Regarding mature CD146 + CECs, in COVID-19 patients, their absolute number was similar to those observed in healthy controls, but the viable/apoptotic CD146 + CEC ratio was significantly different. Both mild and severe COVID-19 patients had significantly less apoptotic CD146 + CECs compared with healthy controls. Patients who recovered had significantly less CD146 + CECs per milliliter when compared with controls as well as to mild and severe COVID-19 patients. A positive correlation was found between the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cellular fraction and apoptotic CEPs per milliliter in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD146 + CECs and CEPs might be investigated as candidate biomarkers of endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients.","Mancuso, Patrizia; Gidaro, Antonio; Gregato, Giuliana; Raveane, Alessandro; Cremonesi, Paola; Quarna, Jessica; Caccia, Sonia; Gusso, Luca; Rusconi, Stefano; Giacomelli, Andrea; Cogliati, Chiara; Bertolini, Francesco",J. thromb. haemost,,325

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of VTE in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched up to 24th June 2020 for studies that evaluated the incidence of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI) were calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: 3487 patients from 30 studies were included. Based on very low-quality evidence due to heterogeneity and risk of bias, the incidence of VTE was 26% (95% PI, 6%-66%). PE with or without DVT occurred in 12% of patients (95% PI, 2%-46%) and DVT alone in 14% (95% PI, 1%-75%). Studies using standard algorithms for clinically suspected VTE reported PE in 13% of patients (95% PI, 2%-57%) and DVT in 6% (95% PI, 0%-60%), compared to 11% (95% PI, 2%-46%) and 24% (95% PI, 2%-85%) in studies using other diagnostic strategies or patient sampling. In patients admitted to intensive care units, VTE occurred in 24% (95% PI, 5%-66%), PE in 19% (95% PI, 6%-47%), and DVT alone in 7% (95% PI, 0%-69%). Corresponding values in general wards were respectively 9% (95% PI, 0%-94%), 4% (95% PI, 0%-100%), and 7% (95% CI, 1%-49%). CONCLUSIONS: VTE represents a frequent complication in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and often occurs as PE. The threshold for clinical suspicion should be low to trigger prompt diagnostic testing.","Porfidia, Angelo; Valeriani, Emanuele; Pola, Roberto; Porreca, Ettore; Rutjes, Anne W S; Di Nisio, Marcello",Thromb Res,,325

To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19-related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15-44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.","Ellington, Sascha; Strid, Penelope; Tong, Van T; Woodworth, Kate; Galang, Romeo R; Zambrano, Laura D; Nahabedian, John; Anderson, Kayla; Gilboa, Suzanne M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,325

METHODS: Clinical information of 20 COVID-19 pneumonia patients with CKD history diagnosed between January 20th and March 1st, 2020 were collected in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. We listed the clinical baseline data, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) changes and processed a short period of follow-up of these 20 patients. RESULTS: Based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on admission, 6 patients were classified as stage 2 of CKD, 5 were as 3a, 2 were as 3b, 3 were as 4 and 4 were as 5, respectively. COVID-19 patients with CKD history were elder and hypertension was the most common comorbidity. Cough and fever accounted for more than 80% of the infectious cases. Lymphopenia, increased D-dimer and elevated infectious indications such as hypersensitive C response protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) were also common among these patients. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation were the major manifestations in CT scans. 4 patients died and 7 patients underwent acute kidney injury (AKI) during observation. Among 16 discharged patients, 12 were with stable renal function and 4 had deteriorating renal function compared with that of admission. CONCLUSION: Compared to general population infected with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 patients with CKD history had a preference to develop to severity with higher fatality rate.","Xu, Chuou; Zhang, Tianjing; Zhu, Na; Han, Min",Int. urol. nephrol,,325
464762,"Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Asymptomatic vs Symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: The antifungal drug itraconazole exerts in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero and human Caco-2 cells. Preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate if itraconazole is effective for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: Due to the initial absence of preclinical models, the effect of itraconazole was explored in a clinical, proof-of-concept, open-label, single-center study, in which hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care with or without itraconazole. Primary outcome was the cumulative score of the clinical status until day 15 based on the 7-point ordinal scale of the World Health Organization. In parallel, itraconazole was evaluated in a newly established hamster model of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as soon as the model was validated. FINDINGS: In the hamster acute infection model, itraconazole did not reduce viral load in lungs, stools or ileum, despite adequate plasma and lung drug concentrations. In the transmission model, itraconazole failed to prevent viral transmission. The clinical trial was prematurely discontinued after evaluation of the preclinical studies and because an interim analysis showed no signal for a more favorable outcome with itraconazole: mean cumulative score of the clinical status 49 vs 47, ratio of geometric means 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.19) for itraconazole vs standard of care. INTERPRETATION: Despite in vitro activity, itraconazole was not effective in a preclinical COVID-19 hamster model. This prompted the premature termination of the proof-of-concept clinical study.

465149,Identification of Distinct Immunophenotypes in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2020,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has reached global pandemic status as announced by the World Health Organization, which currently recommends reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the standard diagnostic tool. However, although the RT-PCR test results may be found negative, there are cases that are found positive for COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scan. CT is also useful in assessing the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. When clinicians desire a CT scan of a patient with COVID-19 to monitor treatment response, a safe method for patient transport is necessary. To address the engagement of medical resources necessary to transport a patient with COVID-19, our institution has implemented the use of mobile CT. Therefore, we report two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia evaluated by using mobile cone-beam CT. Although mobile cone-beam CT had some limitations regarding its image quality such as scatter noise, motion and streak artifacts, and limited field of view compared with conventional multi-detector CT, both cases had acceptable image quality to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. We report the usefulness of mobile cone-beam CT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Rho, Ji Young; Yoon, Kwon Ha; Jeong, Sooyeon; Lee, Jae Hoon; Park, Chul; Kim, Hye Won",Korean J Radiol,,325

479869,Safety and outcomes of percutaneous tracheostomy in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation,2020,"PURPOSE: Many commonly used mask designs are secured by elastic straps looping around the posterior auricular region. This constant pressure and friction against the skin may contribute to increased wearer pain, irritation, and discomfort. The purpose of this work is to report a modified 3D printed mask extender to alleviate discomfort and increase mask wearability by relieving posterior auricular pressure from isolation masks. METHODS: Our institutional review board designated this project as non-human research and exempt. As part of resourcing 3D printing laboratories along with individual 3D printers to provide resources to healthcare workers, mask extenders were printed to relieve posterior auricular pressure from individuals wearing isolation masks. The authors modifed an existing mask extender, increasing its length with accompanying peripheral rungs for isolation mask securement. 3D printing was performed with Ultimaker S5 (Ultimaker B.V.; Geldermalsen, Netherlands) and CR-10 (Creality3D; Shenzhen, China) 3D printers using polylactic acid filaments. The author's modified extended mask extenders were printed and freely delivered to healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, technologists, and other personnel) at the authors' institution. RESULTS: The final mask extender design was printed with the two 3D printers with a maximum 7 straps printed simultaneously on each 3D printer. Mean print times ranges from 105 min for the Ultimaker S5 printer and 150 min for the CR-10. Four hundred seventy-five mask extenders were delivered to healthcare workers at the authors' institution, with the demand far exceeding the available supply. CONCLUSION: We offer a modification of a 3D printed mask extender design that decreases discomfort and increases the wearability of isolation mask designs with ear loops thought to relieve posterior auricular skin pressure and ability to control strap tension. The design is simple, produced with inexpensive material (polylactic acid), and have been well-received by healthcare providers at our institution.","O039,; Connor, Zachary; Huellewig, Daniel; Sithiyopasakul, Peeti; Morris, Jason A; Gan, Connie; Ballard, David H",3D Print Med,,325

The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between child sedentary behavior, physical activity, mental and physical health, and parental distress in a sample of Lithuanian children aged 6–14 years during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in March–June 2020. Parents of 306 children (52.9% female) completed an online survey in May–June 2020 and reported on their children’s screen time for educational and recreational (leisure) purposes, the level of physical activity and time outdoors, somatic symptoms, and emotional well-being and behavior. Parents also reported on stressful life events in the family and personal distress. The results revealed that 57.5% of children exceeded the recommended maximum of 2 h of recreational screen time per day, and 33.6% of the children did not meet the recommended guidelines of 60 min of physical activity per day. Longer screen time for educational purposes and parental distress significantly predicted a higher prevalence of somatic symptoms in children and parental distress also served as a significant predictor of children’s decreased emotional well-being and behavior. These results highlight the importance of psychosocial support interventions for parents who experience distress when raising children at a stressful time, such as during a pandemic.","Breidokienė, Rima Jusienė Roma Urbonas Vaidotas Praninskienė Rūta Girdzijauskienė Sigita",Healthcare,,325

The majority of the post-vaccine infections here reported, showed pauci/asymptomatic clinical course, confirming the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 disease. Most cases (78%) showed infection in presence of neutralizing antibodies at the time of infection diagnosis, presumably attributable to vaccination, due to the concomitant absence of anti-N IgG in most cases. The proportion of post-vaccine infections attributed either to Alpha and Gamma VOCs was similar to the proportion observed in the contemporary unvaccinated population in Lazio region. In addition, mutational analysis did not suggest enrichment of a defined set of Spike protein substitutions depending on the vaccination status. Characterization of host and virus factors associated with vaccine breakthrough, coupled with intensive and continuous monitoring of involved viral strains, is crucial to adopt informed vaccination strategies.","Colavita, Francesca; Meschi, Silvia; Gruber, Cesare Ernesto Maria; Rueca, Martina; Vairo, Francesco; Matusali, Giulia; Lapa, Daniele; Giombini, Emanuela; Carli, Gabriella De; Spaziante, Martina; Messina, Francesco; Bonfiglio, Giulia; Carletti, Fabrizio; Lalle, Eleonora; Fabeni, Lavinia; Berno, Giulia; Puro, Vincenzo; Caro, Antonino Di; Bartolini, Barbara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta; team, - INMI Covid-19 laboratory surveillance",,,325
482046,Screen Time for Children and Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public restrictions pose a psychological burden for humans worldwide and may be particularly detrimental for individuals with mental disorders. Therefore, the current study explored effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorder (ED) symptoms and other psychological aspects in former inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN). METHOD: One-hundred and fifty-nine patients with AN-discharged from inpatient treatment in 2019-completed an online survey on contact history with COVID-19, changes in ED symptoms and other psychological aspects, health care utilization, and strategies patients employed to cope during the pandemic. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of patients reported that eating, shape and weight concerns, drive for physical activity, loneliness, sadness, and inner restlessness increased during the pandemic. Access to in-person psychotherapies and visits at the general practitioner (including weight checks) decreased by 37% and 46%, respectively. Videoconference therapy was used by 26% and telephone contacts by 35% of patients. Patients experienced daily routines, day planning and enjoyable activities as the most helpful among the most used coping strategies. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses great challenges to patients with AN. ED-related thoughts and behaviors may be used as dysfunctional coping mechanisms to regain control over the current circumstances. E-mental health interventions appear to be promising for supporting AN patients during these hard times. Furthermore, interventions addressing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as intolerance of uncertainty might help them manage their ED symptoms.","Schlegl, Sandra; Maier, Julia; Meule, Adrian; Voderholzer, Ulrich",Int J Eat Disord,,325

482235,COVID-19: Guidelines for Communicating about Coronavirus Disease 2019 A Guide for Leaders,2020,"Face coverings have been shown to slow the spread of COVID-19, yet their use is not universal and remains controversial in the United States. Designing effective nudges for widespread adoption is important when federal mandates are politically or legally infeasible. We report the results from a survey experiment in which subjects were exposed to one of three video messages from President Trump, and then indicated their preference for wearing a mask. In the first video, the President simply recited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In the second, the President additionally emphasized that wearing a mask is optional. In the third video, the President added that he will not personally wear a mask. We find that exposure to presidential messages can increase the stated likelihood of wearing a mask-particularly among the President's supporters. We also explore experiential effects of COVID-19, and find that people (especially supporters of the President) are more likely to support wearing a mask if they know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. These results offer guidance to policy makers and practitioners interested in understanding the factors that influence viral risk mitigation strategies.","Cherry, Todd L; James, Alexander G; Murphy, James",Journal of economic behavior and organization,,325

Although it has been described more than 100 years ago, the literature is limited to small retrospective studies. This study aimed to follow patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that developed PM during hospitalization and describe their clinical and radiological evolution. METHODS: A prospective cohort was developed with patients with PM, excluding those with aerodigestive trauma, inside a hospital COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Clinical variables including onset of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, associated complications, the need of interventions, and disease course were all recorded. Also, radiological findings such as the presence of the Macklin effect, extension of lung involvement by COVID-19, and characteristics of the PM were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with non-traumatic PM were followed, resulting in an overall incidence of 0.5% during the study period. Seven (33%) patients had associated pneumothorax and malignant/tension PM was observed in three (14%) cases. The Macklin effect could be found in 11 patients (52%) and the majority of them had more than 50% of lung involvement due to COVID-19. The mortality rate was 49%; however, no deaths were directly related to the PM. CONCLUSIONS: PM incidence is probably increased in the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, especially in those with greater involvement of the lungs, and the Macklin effect may be an important underlying mechanism of this complication. Usually, PM has a benign course, but complications like tension/malignant PM may occur requiring prompt detection and intervention.","Brito, João; Gregório, Paulo; Mariani, Alessandro; D039,; ambrosio, Paula; Filho, Mauro; Ferreira, Lorena; Sawamura, Marcio; Pêgo-Fernandes, Paulo Manuel",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,,325

We also assessed risk factors for transmission of COVID-19 infection post-endoscopy. Methods Patients who had endoscopic procedures in our unit from 23/3/2020 to 31/5/2020 were included. During thisperiod, only emergency and urgent procedures were undertaken. Follow up calls were made subsequently to all patients toenquire about COVID-19 symptoms, hospital admissions and COVID-19 testing within 14 days of their procedures. Toidentify risk factors for COVID-19 transmission post-endoscopy, we performed binominal logistic regression. Results 391 endoscopies were included (table). 1.5 % (6/391) patients developed COVID-19 symptoms post-endoscopy.Median age is 80 (mean 75.8) with female to male ratio 2:1. The most common symptoms were fever, cough andbreathlessness 83.3 % (5/6). The percentage of the confirmed cases by COVID-19 PCR swab test was 1.3 % (5/391). Themedian days that those 5 patients developed confirmed COVID-19 post-endoscopy was 7 (range 3-13). 0.8 % (3/391) diedfrom COVID-19-related complications within 30 days after endoscopic procedure. One had gastroscopy, one flexiblesigmoidoscopy and one ERCP, these procedures were performed on different dates and by different teams. The unadjusted30-days all-cause mortality rate post-endoscopy was 3.6 % (14/391), all of them were inpatients. On univariate binominal logistic regression, age as a continuous variable (OR 1.122;95 % CI [1.021-1.234];p = 0.017), lessthan 10 day hospital stay (OR 0.057;95 % CI [0.008-0.400];p = 0.004) and hospital stay between 11-20 days (OR 0.067;95 % CI [0.005-0.842];p = 0.036) were associated with COVID-19 transmission. Combining the above factors into amultivariable regression model, no factor achieved statistical significance. Conclusions The risk of transmission of clinical COVID-19 seems to be low for patients in the context of endoscopyprocedures when the appropriate personal protective measures are in place. No risk factor reached statistical significance.","Al-Rifaie, A.; Gawn, A.; Woodun, H.; Gariballa, M.; Ghodeif, A.; Sreh, A.; Tariq, Z.; Di-Marco, N.; Tunbridge, A.; Thoufeeq, M.",Endoscopy,,325
485795,Current understanding of epidemiology and clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),2020,"Global health authorities are trying to work out the current status of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission to healthy individuals. In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms. It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve. Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster. Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv. In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses. Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.","Ghadimi-Moghadam, A.; Haghani, M.; Bevelacqua, J.

Phytochemicals present in essential oils are promising candidates which have been known to possess wide range of therapeutic activities. In this study, major components of several essential oils which are known for their antimicrobial properties have been docked against the S1 receptor binding domain of the spike (S) glycoprotein, which is the key target for novel antiviral drugs, to ascertain their inhibitory effects based on their binding affinities. It has been found that some monoterpenes, terpenoid phenols and phenyl propanoids such as anethole, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, geraniol, cinnamyl acetate, L-4-terpineol, thymol and pulegone from essential oils extracted from plants belonging to families such as Lamiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Apiaceae, Geraniaceae and Fabaceae are effective antiviral agents that have potential to inhibit the viral spikeprotein.","Kulkarni, Seema A; Nagarajan, Santhosh Kumar; Ramesh, Veena; Palaniyandi, Velusamy; Selvam, S Periyar; Madhavan, Thirumurthy",J Mol Struct,,325

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. METHODS: Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. RESULTS: We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","Crocamo, Cristina; Viviani, Marco; Famiglini, Lorenzo; Bartoli, Francesco; Pasi, Gabriella; Carrà, Giuseppe",Eur Psychiatry,,325

However, there is a significant variability across cancer types in the extent of disease burden and modalities of cancer treatment that may impact morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Therefore, we evaluated COVID-19 outcomes in patients with a differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) history. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a history of DTC and SARS-CoV2 infection from 2 academic Los Angeles healthcare systems. Demographic, thyroid cancer, and treatment data were analyzed for associations with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Of 21 patients with DTC and COVID-19, 8 (38.1%) were hospitalized and 2 (9.5%) died from COVID-19. Thyroid cancer initial disease burden and extent, treatment, or current response to therapy (eg, excellent vs incomplete) were not associated with COVID-19 severity in DTC patients. However, older age and the presence of a comorbidity other than DTC were significantly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization (P = .047 and P = .024, respectively). COVID-19-attributed hospitalization and mortality in DTC patients was lower than that previously reported in cancer patients, although similar to patients with nonthyroid malignancies in these centers. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that among patients with DTC, advanced age and comorbid conditions are significant contributors to the risk of hospitalization from SARS-CoV2 infection, rather than factors associated with thyroid cancer diagnosis, treatment, or disease burden. This multicenter report of clinical outcomes provides additional data to providers to inform DTC patients regarding their risk of COVID-19.","Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita; Mosaferi, Tina; Xie, Mindy; Antrim, Lauren; Angell, Trevor E; In, Gino K; Su, Maureen A; Lechner, Melissa G",Endocr Pract,,325

502454,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Dependent COVID19 Hospital Transfers,2021,"On March 16, 2020, the day that national social distancing guidelines were released (1), the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) was notified of two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a rural county of approximately 25,000 persons; these cases were the first identified in this county. The two cases occurred in a husband and wife; the husband is the pastor at a local church (church A). The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband). Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11. Including the index cases, 35 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred among 92 (38%) persons who attended events held at church A during March 6-11; three patients died. The age-specific attack rates among persons aged &#8804;18 years, 19-64 years, and &#8805;65 years were 6.3%, 59.4%, and 50.0%, respectively. During contact tracing, at least 26 additional persons with confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among community members who reported contact with church A attendees and likely were infected by them; one of the additional persons was hospitalized and subsequently died. This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at group gatherings during church events and within the broader community. These findings underscore the opportunity for faith-based organizations to prevent COVID-19 by following local authorities' guidance and the U.S. Government's Guidelines: Opening Up America Again (2) regarding modification of activities to prevent virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.","James, Allison; Eagle, Lesli; Phillips, Cassandra; Hedges, D Stephen; Bodenhamer, Cathie; Brown, Robin; Wheeler, J Gary; Kirking, Hannah",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,325

502675,Characteristics of Cardiac Injury in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation has been considered a suitable alternative healthcare delivery system during the COVID-19 outbreak, and many studies have promoted its feasibility in delivering physical care to patients who live with pain and disability. Physiotherapists' perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. AIM: To investigate physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. METHODS: The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. DATA ANALYSIS: In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. RESULTS: Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. CONCLUSION: In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients' access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.","Albahrouh, Sarah Ibraheem; Buabbas, Ali Jasem",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,325
502787,The treatment of extracorporeal organ support for critical ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A brief perspective from the front line,2020,"Background: A request for consumer health information training for public librarians led to the development of a specialized consumer health reference and health literacy training program by professional consumer health librarians from an academic medical center. Professional consumer health librarians created an interactive presentation aimed at improving public librarians' ability to respond to consumer health questions and provide vetted health resources. Case Presentation: Building on professional expertise, librarians at Weill Cornell Medicine developed a live class demonstration accompanied by a representative subject LibGuide to support public librarians who assist patrons with health questions. Skills involved in effectively communicating with patrons who are seeking consumer health information include conducting reference interviews, matching patrons' needs with appropriate resources, teaching useful Internet search methods, assessing health information, and understanding health literacy issues. Originally envisioned as two in-person live demonstrations, the team proactively adapted the program to respond to the stay-at-home social-distancing order put in place in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusions: The team successfully led an in-person live training session followed by an adapted online training experience, the latter designed to complete the curricula while complying with city and state orders.","DeRosa, Antonio P; Jedlicka, Caroline; Mages, Keith C; Stribling, Judy Carol",J Med Libr Assoc,,325

505262,Care of critically ill pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a case series,2020,"Objective: Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 is mostly symptomatic, but a wide range of medications are under investigation against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they seem effective in nonpregnant patients and even under compassionate use. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for coronavirus disease 2019. Results: Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, because they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. Thus, they may be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 may differ from conventional use. These include HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir that have low placental transfer, interferon that does not cross the placental barrier, and hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine that has high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir, azithromycin, and some monoclonal antibodies. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy because of known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab, other interleukin 6 inhibitors, umifenovir, and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: In life-threatening cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. Although preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.","Louchet, Margaux; Sibiude, Jeanne; Peytavin, Gilles; Picone, Olivier; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Mandelbrot, Laurent",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,325

506725,All That Glitters Isn't Gold: Critical Care in the Time of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Since April 2020, the U.S. Center for Disease Control has asked for people to wear face masks in public to curb the spread of COVID-19. This shift has given rise to a mass movement of cloth mask making. Artists have leapt into action to produce masks for healthcare and frontline workers or as an alternative economy for lost income, while others customize masks to communicate identity, beliefs, or concerns. Mask making has also raised questions about the future of fashion with regards to health and sustainability. Through a series of conversations, experts from the arts, fashion, sustainability, and medical fields were invited to talk about the variety of issues, and questions this moment of mask making and wearing have produced. In May 2019, Kate Kretz skyrocketed into the international media when she was banned from Facebook for her now infamous MAGA Hat series. 1 (Figures 1 and 2) Kretz’s artwork draws direct parallels between known symbols of fascism, oppression, and racism, and former President Trump’s branding, specifically his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.” Using counterfeit MAGA hats, Kretz deconstructs and reconfigures this widely popularized consumer merchandise to “function as corrective physical manifestations of the truth.” 2 In her most recent addition to the series, Kretz has created Social Murder, a critique of the Trump administrations management of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Kipp, C.; Kretz, K.",Journal of Modern Craft,,325

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of perceived stress in the general adult population of Cyprus during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. This was an internet-based cross-sectional study conducted between 6 April and 20 June 2020, one to two and a half months after the introduction of and the first mandatory lockdown on its entire territory imposed by the government of the Republic of Cyprus on 24 March 2020. Data collection was done using a self-administered questionnaire that included information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, physical activity, smoking habits, and stress level. A total of 1,485 adults participated in the study. The median perceived stress score was 10 (q1 = 6, q3 = 15). Linear regression models showed that having a medium monthly income (501-1,500) and being a current smoker was positively associated with the perceived stress score, while being male and physically active was negatively associated with the perceived stress score (all p <0.05). People with medium average salary and current smokers were at a higher risk for perceived stress. Psychological interventions and/or psychological services provided in certain vulnerable groups would be beneficial in future lockdowns due to either COVID-19 or a new pandemic.","Kyprianidou, Maria; Christophi, Costas A; Giannakou, Konstantinos",Front Public Health,,325

512277,Respiratory Mechanics of COVID-19- versus Non-COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020,"Patients with end-stage kidney disease are at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, severe COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboses. In this report, we describe the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed an otherwise-unexplained thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula during a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Despite prompt treatment with three technically successful thrombectomies along with systemic intravenous heparin and two rounds of catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, the fistula rapidly re-thrombosed each time and he required tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He subsequently required admission for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimately developed a catheter-related blood stream infection that likely contributed to his death. As the fistula had been previously well functioning and no angiographic explanation for the thrombosis was found, we speculate in this case the recurrent thromboses were related to the hypercoagulable state characteristic of severe COVID-19. Interventionalists performing hemodialysis access procedures should be aware of the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19 and should consider it when deliberating how to best plan and approach access interventions in patients with symptomatic COVID-19.","Teixeira, Joao Pedro; Combs, Sara A; Owen, Jonathan G",J Vasc Access,,325
512278,Respiratory Mechanics of COVID-19- versus Non-COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,2020,"BACKGROUND: New SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7, first detected in England or B.1.351, first detected in South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and high-throughput detection methods at hand. METHODS: A set of RT-qPCR assays was modified for a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay including detection of the del-HV69/70 and N501Y mutations on the cobas6800 platform. Analytical sensitivity was assessed for both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. For clinical performance, a total of 176 clinical samples were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay and next generation sequencing as gold standard. RESULTS: The multiplex assay was highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, with an LoD of 6.16 cp/ml (CI: 4.00-8.31). LoDs were slightly higher for detection of the HV69/70 deletion (85.92, CI: 61-194.41) and the N501Y SNP (105.99 cp/ml, CI: 81.59 - 183.66). A total of 176 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 50 samples containing SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage, one containing B.1.351 and 85 non-B.1.1.7/B.1.351 lineage, of which three also harbored a HV69/70 deletion. All were correctly identified by the multiplex assay. CONCLUSION: We describe here a highly sensitive, fully automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of the del-HV69/70 and N501Y mutations that can distinguish between B.1.1.7 and other lineages. The assay allows for high-throughput screening for currently relevant variants in clinical samples prior to sequencing.","Nörz, Dominik; Grunwald, Moritz; Olearo, Flaminia; Fischer, Nicole; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,,325

520481,Carboxyhemoglobinemia in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"Insular populations have traditionally drawn a lot of attention from epidemiologists as they provide important insights regarding transmission of infectious diseases and propagation of epidemics. There are numerous historical instances where isolated populations showed high morbidity once a new virus entered the population. Building upon that and recent findings that the activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS) depends both upon one's vulnerability and environmental context, we predicted that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, place of residence (island vs. mainland) explains a significant proportion of variance in preferred interpersonal distances, animosity toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. With 48 populated islands, Croatia provides a fruitful testing ground for this prediction. We also opted to explore relations among BIS-related variables (pathogen disgust, germ aversion, and perceived infectability) and social cognitions in a more natural context than has previously been done. The study was conducted online, on Croatian residents, during April and May 2020. As expected, the BIS variables contributed significantly to preferred interpersonal distances, negative emotions toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, our results showed that geographical location explained a significant amount of variance in preferred social (but not personal and intimate) distances and negative emotions toward foreigners. As Croatian islands are extremely frequent travel destinations, these differences between mainlanders and islanders cannot be explained by the lack of exposure to foreigners. Additionally, we found that scores on preferred interpersonal distances, pathogen disgust, and germ aversion were significantly higher compared to those obtained in Croatian samples before the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, men scored higher in perceived infectability than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and women did not, which reflects the objectively higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 for men than for women. Taken together, our results support the notion that BIS is a highly adaptive and context-dependent response system, likely more reactive in more susceptible individuals.","Hromatko, I.; Grus, A.; Kolderaj, G.",Frontiers in Psychology,,325
521016,Can we predict the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 with a routine blood test?,2020,"The rapid transmission of the highly contagious novel coronavirus has been represented through several data-guided approaches across targeted geographies, in an attempt to understand when the pandemic will be under control and imposed lockdown measures can be relaxed. However, these epidemiological models predominantly based on training data employing number of cases and fatalities are limited in that they do not account for the spatiotemporal population dynamics that principally contributes to the disease spread. Here, a stochastic cellular automata enabled predictive model is presented that is able to accurate describe the effect of demography-dependent population dynamics on disease transmission. Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form, for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions, robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before they transform into an epidemic.","Munshi, Joydeep; Roy, Indranil; Balasubramanian, Ganesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01001v1.pdf,325
521088,Anticoagulation Management in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation,2020,"There is a high interest on gut health in poultry with special focus on consequences of the intestinal diseases, such as coccidiosis and C. perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis (NE). We developed a custom gene expression panel, which could provide a snapshot of gene expression variation under challenging conditions. Ileum gene expression studies were performed through high throughput reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A deep review on the bibliography was done and genes related to intestinal health were selected for barrier function, immune response, oxidation, digestive hormones, nutrient transport, and metabolism. The panel was firstly tested by using a nutritional/Clostridium perfringens model of intestinal barrier failure (induced using commercial reused litter and wheat-based diets without exogenous supplementation of enzymes) and the consistency of results was evaluated by another experiment under a coccidiosis challenge (orally gavaged with a commercial coccidiosis vaccine, 90× vaccine dose). Growth traits and intestinal morphological analysis were performed to check the gut barrier failure occurrence. Results of ileum gene expression showed a higher expression in genes involved in barrier function and nutrient transport in chickens raised in healthy conditions, while genes involved in immune response presented higher expression in C.perfringens-challenged birds. On the other hand, the Eimeria challenge also altered the expression of genes related to barrier function and metabolism, and increased the expression of genes related to immune response and oxidative stress. The panel developed in the current study gives us an overview of genes and pathways involved in broiler response to pathogen challenge. It also allows us to deep into the study of differences in gene expression pattern and magnitude of responses under either a coccidial vaccine or a NE.","Criado-Mesas, L; Abdelli, N; Noce, A; Farré, M; Pérez, J F; Solà-Oriol, D; Martin-Venegas, R; Forouzandeh, A; González-Solé, F; Folch, J M",Sci Rep,,325

METHODS: Secondary data were collected from different government organizations, 120 primary surveys were conducted for calculating weights, and results were validated through 12 key people's interviews. Pairwise comparison matrixes were calculated for 9 factors and subfactors. The analytic hierarchy process used for calculating the susceptibility index and map was prepared based on the results. RESULTS: According to the results, multiple causal factors might be responsible for COVID-19 spreading in Bangladesh. Dhaka might be vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a higher population, population density, and international collaboration. According to the pairwise comparison matrix, the consistency ratio for subfactors and factors was in the permissible limit (ie, less than 0.10). The highest factor weight of 0.2907 was found for the factors type of port. The maximum value for the susceptibility index was 0.435219362 for Chittagong, and the minimum value was 0.076174 for Naogaon.

We quantified the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in adults and children (<13 years of age) with RT-PCR confirmed asymptomatic and symptomatic infection for long-term memory, phenotype and polyfunctional cytokines. Acute and memory CD4(+) T cell responses to structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins significantly increased with age, whilst CD8(+) T cell responses increased with time post infection. Infected children had significantly lower CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural and ORF1ab proteins compared to infected adults. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cell responses were comparable in magnitude to uninfected negative adult controls. In infected adults CD4(+) T cell specificity was skewed towards structural peptides, whilst children had increased contribution of ORF1ab responses. This may reflect differing T cell compartmentalisation for antigen processing during antigen exposure or lower recruitment of memory populations. T cell polyfunctional cytokine production was comparable between children and adults, but children had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD4(+) T cell effector memory. Compared to adults, children had significantly lower levels of antibodies to β-coronaviruses, indicating differing baseline immunity. Total T follicular helper responses was increased in children during acute infection indicating rapid co-ordination of the T and B cell responses. However total monocyte responses were reduced in children which may be reflective of differing levels of inflammation between children and adults. Therefore, reduced prior β-coronavirus immunity and reduced activation and recruitment of de novo responses in children may drive milder COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Cohen, Carolyn A; Li, Athena PY; Hachim, Asmaa; Hui, David SC; Kwan, Mike YW; Tsang, Owen TY; Chiu, Susan S; Chan, Wai Hung; Yau, Yat Sun; Kavian, Niloufar; Ma, Fionn NL; Lau, Eric HY; Cheng, Samuel MS; Poon, Leo LM; Peiris, JS Malik; Valkenburg, Sophie A",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.02.21250988; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250988v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564773/,325
592848,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and psychological distress in China: Does neighbourhood matter?,2021-03-10,"Exercise likely has numerous benefits for brain and cognition. However, those benefits and their causes remain imprecisely defined. If the brain does benefit from exercise it does so primarily through cumulative brief, “acute” exposures over a lifetime. The Dementia Risk and Dynamic Response to Exercise (DYNAMIC) clinical trial seeks to characterize the acute exercise response in cerebral perfusion, and circulating neurotrophic factors in older adults with and without the apolipoprotein e4 genotype (APOE4), the strongest genetic predictor of sporadic, late onset Alzheimer’s disease. DYNAMIC will enroll 60 older adults into a single moderate intensity bout of exercise intervention, measuring pre- and post-exercise cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling, and neurotrophic factors. We expect that APOE4 carriers will have poor CBF regulation, i.e. slower return to baseline perfusion after exercise, and will demonstrate blunted neurotrophic response to exercise, with concentrations of neurotrophic factors positively correlating with CBF regulation. Preliminary findings on 7 older adults and 9 younger adults demonstrate that the experimental method can capture CBF and neurotrophic response over a time course. This methodology will provide important insight into acute exercise response and potential directions for clinical trial outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: We set-up a multicenter Italian collaboration to investigate the relationship between HCQ therapy and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 3,451 unselected patients hospitalized in 33 clinical centers in Italy, from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were analyzed. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received HCQ with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores, with the addition of subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Out of 3,451 COVID-19 patients, 76.3% received HCQ. Death rates (per 1,000 person-days) for patients receiving or not HCQ were 8.9 and 15.7, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found 30% lower risk of death in patients receiving HCQ (HR=0.70; 95%CI: 0.59 to 0.84; E-value=1.67). Secondary analyses yielded similar results. The inverse association of HCQ with inpatient mortality was particularly evident in patients having elevated C-reactive protein at entry. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ use was associated with a 30% lower risk of death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Within the limits of an observational study and awaiting results from randomized controlled trials, these data do not discourage the use of HCQ in inpatients with COVID-19.","Castelnuovo, Augusto Di; Costanzo, Simona; Antinori, Andrea; Berselli, Nausicaa; Blandi, Lorenzo; Bruno, Raffaele; Cauda, Roberto; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Menicanti, Lorenzo; My, Ilaria; Parruti, Giustino; Patti, Giuseppe; Perlini, Stefano; Santilli, Francesca; Signorelli, Carlo; Spinoni, Enrico; Stefanini, Giulio G.; Vergori, Alessandra; Ageno, Walter; Agodi, Antonella; Aiello, Luca; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Moghazi, Samir Al; Astuto, Marinella; Aucella, Filippo; Barbieri, Greta; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Bonaccio, Marialaura; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cacciatore, Francesco; Caiano, Lucia; Cannata, Francesco; Carrozzi, Laura; Cascio, Antonio; Ciccullo, Arturo; Cingolani, Antonella; Cipollone, Francesco; Colomba, Claudia; Crosta, Francesca; Pra, Chiara Dal; Danzi, Gian Battista; D'Ardes, Damiano; Donati, Katleen de Gaetano; Giacomo, Paola Del; Gennaro, Francesco Di; Tano, Giuseppe Di; D'Offizi, Giampiero; Filippini, Tommaso; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Gentile, Ivan; Gialluisi, Alessandro; Gini, Giancarlo; Grandone, Elvira; Grisafi, Leonardo; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Lamonica, Silvia; Landi, Francesco; Leone, Armando; Maccagni, Gloria; Maccarella, Sandro; Madaro, Andrea; Mapelli, Massimo; Maragna, Riccardo; Marra, Lorenzo; Maresca, Giulio; Marotta, Claudia; Mastroianni, Franco; Mazzitelli, Maria; Mengozzi, Alessandro; Menichetti, Francesco; Meschiari, Marianna; Minutolo, Filippo; Montineri, Arturo; Mussinelli, Roberta; Mussini, Cristina; Musso, Maria; Odone, Anna; Olivieri, Marco; Pasi, Emanuela; Petri, Francesco; Pinchera, Biagio; Pivato, Carlo A.; Poletti, Venerino; Ravaglia, Claudia; Rinaldi, Massimo; Rognoni, Andrea; Rossato, Marco; Rossi, Ilaria; Rossi, Marianna; Sabena, Anna; Salinaro, Francesco; Sangiovanni, Vincenzo; Sanrocco, Carlo; Scorzolini, Laura; Sgariglia, Raffaella; Simeone, Paola Giustina; Spinicci, Michele; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Venezia, Amedeo; Veronesi, Giovanni; Vettor, Roberto; Vianello, Andrea; Vinceti, Marco; Vocciante, Laura; De Caterina, Raffaele; Iacoviello, Licia",Eur J Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859477/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520303356; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520303356; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.08.019,325

These have ranged from the establishment of open-source platforms for review of article preprints to the elimination of journal paywalls for COVID-19-related publications. In addition, informal efforts that rely on various modern media platforms that promote, repackage, and synthesize information have played substantial adjunctive roles, many of which did not exist during the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic of 2003. Although these latter efforts have greatly bolstered the speed of knowledge dissemination, their unregulated nature subjects them to risk for facilitating the spread of misinformation. In our opinion, the role of modern media in influencing clinical knowledge dissemination was not adequately examined even before the pandemic and therefore remains largely unchecked. In this article, we examine the spread of information in the field of COVID-19 and neurologic disorders, develop a simple model that maps various modern media tools on to the dissemination pipeline, and critically examine its components. Through this exercise, we identify opportunities for the scientific community to regulate and safeguard the clinical knowledge dissemination process, with implications both for the pandemic and beyond.","Lau, K.

In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 disease spread and control by applying the modified SIR model of epidemic outbreak to explain the Covid spread from February-July 2020 in various countries. Two approaches are evident from the disease progression; one focused on disease eradication and inhibition, and the other is less restrictive dynamic response. Both the approaches are analytically modeled to determine the parameters that characterize the effectiveness of dealing with the disease progression. The model successfully explains the Covid-19 evolution and control of various countries over a vast span of four-five months. The study is highly beneficial to simply analytically and numerically model this complex problem of epidemic proliferation. It assists to easily determine the mathematical parameters for the Covid-19 control measures, helps in predicting the end of the epidemic, and most importantly conceiving the judicious way of unlock process to restore communication between cities, states and countries.","Chakravarty, U.; Chaturvedi, D.; Joshi, M.

609101,Letter to the Editor Re: Coronavirus disease 2019: The harms of exaggerated information and nonevidence‐based measures,2020-05-02,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, several cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODS: Consecutive patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as clinical and radiological characteristics of CVST, were reported from three teaching hospitals in the South West, North West, and the center of Iran between June and July 2020. We also searched the abstract archives until the end of August 2020 and gathered 28 reported cases. The diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection were determined according to SARS-CoV-2 detection in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal samples in clinically suspected patients. Demographics, prominent COVID-19 symptoms, confirmatory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis, the interval between the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and CVST, clinical and radiological features of CVST, therapeutic strategies, CVST outcomes, rate of hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality rate were investigated. RESULTS: Six patients (31–62 years-old) with confirmed CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our centers. Four patients had no respiratory symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five patients developed the clinical manifestations of CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection simultaneously. Three patients had known predisposing factors for CVST. Despite receiving CVST and SARS-CoV-2 infection treatments, four patients died. SARS-COV-2 associated CVST patients were older (49.26 vs. 37.77 years-old), had lower female/male ratio (1.42 vs. 2.19), and higher mortality rate (35.29% vs. 6.07%) than CVST not associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The role of SARS-CoV-2 as a “cause” versus an “additive contributor” remains to be elucidated. Practitioners should be aware of the possibility of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess how counts of criminal charges have been affected by COVID-19 social distancing measures and related policy changes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This study used publicly available court filings pertaining to child abuse and neglect from Jan 1, 2010 to June 30, 2020. METHODS: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms were constructed with case data from January 2010 to January 2020 to forecast trends in criminal charges for February to June 2020. These forecasted values were then compared to actual charges filed for this time period. RESULTS: Criminal cases filed between February and June 2020, had an overall 25.7 percent lower average than forecasted. All individual months had progressively lower cases than forecasted with the exception of March. June had the largest deviation from forecasted with 60.1 percent fewer cases than predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Although risk factors for child abuse have increased due to COVID-19, these findings demonstrate a declining trend in child abuse charges. Rather than a decreasing incidence of child abuse and neglect, it is more likely that less cases are being reported.

Therefore, it is important to make effective policy decisions to minimize losses associated with typhoons. METHODS: In this study, the GeoDetector method was used to quantify the determinant powers of natural and socioeconomic factors, and their interactions, on the population casualty rate of super typhoon Lekima. The local indicator of spatial association (LISA) method was followed to explore the spatial pattern of the population casualty rate under the influence of the identified dominant factors. RESULTS: Both natural and socioeconomic factors were found to have significantly impacted the population casualty rate due to super typhoon Lekima. Among the selected factors, maximum precipitation was dominant factor (q = 0.56), followed by maximum wind speed (q = 0.45). In addition, number of health technicians (q = 0.35) and number of health beds (q = 0.27) have a strong influence on the population casualty rate. Among the interactive effects of 12 influencing factors, the combined effects of maximum precipitation and ratio of brick-wood houses, the maximum precipitation and ratio of steel-concrete houses, maximum precipitation and number of health technicians were highest (q = 0.72). Furthermore, high-risk areas with very high casualty rates were concentrated in the southeastern part of Zhejiang and northern Shandong Provinces, while lower-risk areas were mainly distributed in northern Liaoning and eastern Jiangsu provinces.

AIM: To examine a group of patients diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 pneumonia whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by RT-PCR but then serological immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G (IgM/IgG) antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. METHODS: Eighty possible COVID-19 patients who had at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 RT-PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: The specific serological total IgM/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in twenty-two patients. The mean age of this patient group was 63.2± 13.1-years-old with a male/female ratio of 11/11. Cough was the most common symptom (90.9%). The most common presenting chest computed tomography findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.1%). The mean duration of time from appearance of first symptoms to hospital admission, to hospital admission, to treatment duration and to serological positivity were 8.6 d, 11.2 d, 7.9 d, and 24 d, respectively. Compared with reference laboratory values, serologically positive patients have shown increased levels of acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin and higher inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and fibrin end-products, such as D-dimer.

Previous works analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, finds stability by striking a certain balance between relative humidity and temperature, which indicates the possibility of surface contact transmission. The question remains whether seasonal changes associated with climatic fluctuations might actively influence virus survival. Correlations between climatic variables and infectivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 were applied by the use of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing LOESS nonparametric model. Tropical climates allow for more frequent outdoor human interaction, making such areas ideal for studies on the natural transmission of the virus. Outcomes revealed an inverse relationship between subtropical and tropical climates for the spread of the novel coronavirus and temperature, suggesting a sensitivity behavior to climates zones. Each 1 °C rise of the daily temperature mean correlated with a −11.76% (t = −5.71, p < 0.0001) decrease and a 5.66% (t = 5.68, p < 0.0001) increase in the incidence of COVID-19 for subtropical and tropical climates, respectively.","Prata, David; Rodrigues, Waldecy; De Souza Bermejo, Paulo Henrique; Moreira, Marina; Camargo, Wainesten; Lisboa, Marcelo; Rossone Reis, Geovane; de Araujo, Humberto Xavier",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680577/,325

AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess thyroid function tests in hospitalized patients of COVID-19. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Sixty (60) patients with COVID-19 detected by RT-PCR admitted in General Medicine isolation ward and COVID block of a tertiary care teaching hospital were selected by semi-purposive sampling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: These patients were assessed for thyroid function tests, including total T3, free T3, total T4, free T4, TSH and anti-TPO antibody along with other baseline investigations. Patients with pre-existing thyroid–related ailments, those on levothyroxine or anti-thyroid drugs or other drugs known to interfere with the results were excluded. RESULTS: There were 43.3% patients in mild, 26.7% in moderate, and 30% in severe category, according to local COVID-19 severity classification protocol. 35% patients had one or more abnormality in the thyroid function, low TSH being the most common (18.33%). 9.1% patients had characteristic pattern of thyroiditis. In most of the others thyroid function did not match any typical pattern. There was no significant difference in any of the parameters of the thyroid function test between mild, moderate, and severe groups. CONCLUSION: Thyroid function may be abnormal in all categories of patients during COVID-19 infection, even in absence of pre-existing thyroid ailments. Although low TSH is the commonest abnormality and typical pattern of thyroiditis can be seen in a subsection of patients, in majority of the patients, thyroid function abnormality does not follow any characteristic pattern and likely represents a combination of thyroiditis and sick euthyroid syndrome in different points of its spectrum.","Sen, Kaushik; Sinha, Arijit; Sen, Sirsendu; Chakraborty, Sandip; Alam, Md Sayeef",Indian J Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijem.ijem_779_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643870/,325

Chez les patients recevant des antiinfectieux et présentant ces symptômes compatibles avec des réactions d’hypersensibilités retardées (HSR), le diagnostic de toxidermie est systématiquement évoqué. Méthodes À partir de la cohorte bicentrique des patients présentant des manifestations cutanéo-muqueuses au cours du COVID-19 nous décrirons la démarche collaborative entre les services de médecine et la pharmacie hospitalière et l’étude de faisabilité des préparations magistrales de patch tests, prick-tests et tests IDR. Résultats Parmi la cohorte de 59 patients hospitalisés pour une pneumonie COVID-19 en mars 2020, 68 % avait des atteintes cutanées (exanthèmes dans 80 %) ; 23 des 40 patients présentant des manifestations cutanées (58 %) avaient reçu au moins un antiinfectieux (hydroxychloroquine [HCQ], azithromycine [AZT], spiramycine [SPR], amoxicilline [AMX] et/ou ceftriaxone [CFX]). Une revue complète de la littérature a été réalisée et les PUI réalisant ce type de tests ont été contactées pour déterminer les concentrations non irritantes, dilutions optimales, nature des diluants, vérification de la texture, choix des contrôles positifs et négatifs, conditionnement le plus approprié et évaluation des moyens humains et matériels nécessaires. Quinze fiches de fabrication ont été rédigées. La pharmacie a élaboré des tests épicutanés dosés à 30 % dans de la vaseline à partir des formes orales (HCQ, AZT) ; 10 % (lyophilistas) ou 30 % (solutions) dans vaseline pour les solutions injectables (AMX, CFX et SPR). Les prick-tests et les tests IDR en seringues ont été préparés en conditions stériles, à partir des formes injectables (AMX, CFX et SPR). Les tests cutanés seront réalisés à 1 an de l’épisode (mars 2021) : résultats à venir. Conclusion Ce travail a favorisé le travail pluridisciplinaire entre les services.

Rats were divided into 6 groups and 7 rats included each group. Groups: (i) Control group: Standard diet; (ii) RJ (royal jelly) group: Standard diet + royal jelly; (iii) F50 group: Standard diet + 50 mg/kg fluoride; (iv): F100 group: Standard diet + 100 mg/kg fluoride; (v) F50+RJ group: Standard diet + 50 mg/kg fluoride + royal jelly; (vi): F100+RJ group: Standard diet + 100 mg/kg fluoride + royal jelly. After 8 weeks, the rats were decapitated, and their muscle tissues were removed. Expression levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-6, Bax, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 alpha (IL1-α) and Bcl-2 proteins in muscle tissue were determined by western blotting method. Histopathological analyses were also performed on the muscle tissue. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) analyses were determined by a spectrophotometer. According to the obtained results, Bcl-2, TNF-α and IL1-α protein expression was increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while Caspase-3, Caspase-6 and Bax protein expression levels decreased in damage groups. MDA level increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while CAT and GSH levels increased with royal jelly application in royal jelly-given group in comparison to the flouride-exposed group. According to histopathological analysis results, edema and inflammatory cell formations were found in the injury groups, a tendency to decrease in these injuries was observed in the treatment groups. Based on these results, we can say that royal jelly has protective effects on muscle tissue against fluoride damage.

Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.","Miorin, Lisa; Kehrer, Thomas; Sanchez-Aparicio, Maria Teresa; Zhang, Ke; Cohen, Phillip; Patel, Roosheel S.; Cupic, Anastasija; Makio, Tadashi; Mei, Menghan; Moreno, Elena; Danziger, Oded; White, Kris M.; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Uccellini, Melissa; Gao, Shengyan; Aydillo, Teresa; Mena, Ignacio; Yin, Xin; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Krogan, Nevan J.; Chanda, Sumit K.; Schotsaert, Michael; Wozniak, Richard W.; Ren, Yi; Rosenberg, Brad R.; Fontoura, Beatriz M.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and has been applied to different specimen types. Understanding the virus load and virus detection frequency in different specimen types is important to improve diagnosis and estimate the duration of potential infectivity. We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study on hospitalized and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the frequency of virus detection, virus load, and duration of the virus excretion in upper and lower respiratory specimens as well as stool and plasma. We found that the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the virus load, and duration of virus excretion was higher in lower respiratory tract (LRT) than in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens. The duration of virus excretion was longer in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In conclusion, LRT specimens are the most appropriate specimen type for the detection and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As sources of nutrients (C, N, P) they are widely used in intensive farming where large supplementation of organic matter to maintain fertility and enhance crop yields is needed. However, according to the report of European Commission published in 2010, only 39% of produced sewage sludge is recycled into agriculture in the European Union. This situation occurs mainly due to the fact, that the sewage sludge may contain a dangerous volume of different contaminants. For over decades, a great deal of attention has been focused on total concentration of few heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The Sewage Sludge Directive (86/278/EEC) regulates the allowable limits of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg and pathogens and allows for recovery of sludge on land under defined sanitary and environmentally sound conditions. In this paper, a review on quality of sewage sludge based on the publications after 2010 has been presented.

METHODS: Information was gathered prospectively on flexible nasoendoscopy procedures performed between March and June 2020. Patients and healthcare workers were followed up to assess for coronavirus disease 2019 development. One-sided 97.5 per cent Poisson confidence intervals were calculated for upper limits of risk where zero events were observed. RESULTS: A total of 286 patients were recruited. The most common indication for flexible nasoendoscopy was investigation of ‘red flag’ symptoms (67 per cent). Forty-seven patients (16 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 13–21 per cent) had suspicious findings on flexible nasoendoscopy requiring further investigation. Twenty patients (7.1 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 4.4–11 per cent) had new cancer diagnoses. Zero coronavirus disease 2019 infections were recorded in the 273 patients. No. 27 endoscopists (the doctors and nurses who carried out the procedures) were followed up.The risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 after flexible nasoendoscopy was determined to be 0–1.3 per cent.

RECENT FINDINGS: Among adults, food insecurity is cross-sectionally associated with higher levels of overall ED pathology, binge eating, compensatory behaviors, binge-eating disorder, and bulimia nervosa. Evidence for similar relationships among adolescents has been less robust; however, compared to studies of adults, there have been substantially fewer studies conducted in adolescents to date. SUMMARY: Emerging evidence consistently indicates that food insecurity is cross-sectionally associated with bulimic-spectrum ED pathology among adults. Findings emphasize the need for ED research to include marginalized populations who have historically been overlooked in the ED field. Much more research is needed to better understand the relationship between food insecurity and ED pathology and to determine effective ways to intervene.","Hazzard, Vivienne M.; Loth, Katie A.; Hooper, Laura; Becker, Carolyn Black",Curr Psychiatry Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125614/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01200-0,325

We previously developed the DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 encoding chicken type II collagen (CCII) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we characterized its dynamic profile, biodistribution, and potential for genomic DNA integration in normal vaccinated rodent. RESULTS: A real-time quantitative PCR analysis (RT-qPCR) of animals administered a single dose of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 (300 μg/kg by intramuscular injection) showed that CCOL2A1 mRNA level in the blood peaked between 2 and 6 h post-immunization and then rapidly declined, and was undetectable between day 1–42. CCOL2A1 transcript was detected at the muscle injection site on days 3–14 post-immunization. Starting from day 14, the transcript was detected in the heart, liver, lung, and kidney but not in the spleen or thymus, and was expressed only in the lung on day 28. There was no CCOL2A1 mRNA present in the testes or ovaries at any time point. Non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging revealed CCII protein expression from 2 h up to day 10 and from 2 h up to day 35 after administration of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 via the intravenous and intramuscular routes, respectively; the protein had disappeared by day 42. Importantly, CCOL2A1 was not integrated into the host genome. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that pcDNA-CCOL2A1 vaccine is rapidly cleared within a short period of time and is therefore safe, and merits further development as a therapeutic vaccine for RA treatment.","Zhao, Xiao; Long, Juan; Liang, Fei; Liu, Nan; Sun, Yuying; Xi, Yongzhi",J Nanobiotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-019-0528-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492169/,325

637799,Telemedicine in epilepsy management during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: To face the current COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic tools are essential. It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (i) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (ii) to guide patient care and management and (iii) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. SOURCES: A research of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. CONTENT: The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. IMPLICATIONS: Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (i) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (ii) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays, and (iii) for epidemiological purposes.","Caruana, Giorgia; Croxatto, Antony; Coste, Alix T.; Opota, Onya; Lamoth, Frederic; Jaton, Katia; Greub, Gilbert",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593741/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20303633?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20303633,325

This approach allows researchers to capture more robust baselines and derive novel phenotypes for improved precision in diagnosis and accuracy in outcomes. The process for developing these tools however is complex because data need to be collected at a frequency that is meaningful but not burdensome for the participant or patient. Furthermore, traditional techniques, which rely on fixed conditions to validate assessments, may be inappropriate for validating tools that are designed to capture data under flexible conditions. This paper discusses the process for determining whether a digital assessment is suitable for remote research and offers suggestions on how to validate these novel tools.","Ferrar, Jennifer; Griffith, Gareth J; Skirrow, Caroline; Cashdollar, Nathan; Taptiklis, Nick; Dobson, James; Cree, Fiona; Cormack, Francesca K; Barnett, Jennifer H; Munafò, Marcus R",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/26004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142972/,325

Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from healthcare-associated transmission. Methods In this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection. Findings We investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%). Interpretation Infection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive. Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines.","Braun, K. M.; Moreno, G.

PCR remains the standard benchmark for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, while advances in immunological profiling are guiding clinical treatment. The SARS-Cov-2 virus has undergone multiple mutations since its emergence in 2019, resulting in changes in virulence that have impacted on disease severity globally. The emergence of more virulent variants of SARS-Cov-2 remains challenging for effective disease control during this pandemic. Major variants identified to date include B.1.1.7, B.1.351; P.1; B.1.617.2; B.1.427; P.2; P.3; B.1.525; and C.37. Globally, large unvaccinated populations increase the risk of more and more variants arising. With successive waves of COVID-19 emerging, strategies that mitigate against community transmission need to be implemented, including increased vaccination coverage. For treatment, convalescent plasma therapy, successfully deployed during recent Ebola outbreaks and for H1N1 influenza, can increase survival rates and improve host responses to viral challenge. Convalescent plasma is rich with cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-8), CCL2, and TNFα, neutralizing antibodies, and clotting factors essential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials can inform and guide treatment policy, leading to mainstream adoption of convalescent therapy. This review examines the limited number of clinical trials published, to date that have deployed this therapy and explores clinical trials in progress for the treatment of COVID-19.","Moubarak, Mohamed; Kasozi, Keneth Iceland; Hetta, Helal F.; Shaheen, Hazem M.; Rauf, Abdur; Al-kuraishy, Hayder M.; Qusti, Safaa; Alshammari, Eida M.; Ayikobua, Emmanuel Tiyo; Ssempijja, Fred; Afodun, Adam Moyosore; Kenganzi, Ritah; Usman, Ibe Michael; Ochieng, Juma John; Osuwat, Lawrence Obado; Matama, Kevin; Al-Gareeb, Ali I.; Kairania, Emmanuel; Musenero, Monica; Welburn, Susan Christina; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",Life (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/life11080734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440478/,325

645806,Acceptance of the coronavirus disease-2019 vaccine among medical students in Uganda,2021-05-13,"SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are raging worldwide. Unfortunately, the global vaccination is not efficient enough to attain a vaccine-based herd-immunity and yet no special and effective drug is developed to contain the spread of the disease. Previously we have identified CD147 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrated that CD147 antibody effectively inhibits infection and cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants. In CD147KO VeroE6 cells, infections of SARS-CoV-2, its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351) and pseudovirus mutants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.526 (S477N), B.1.526 (E484K), P.1, P.2, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2) were decreased. Meanwhile, CD147 antibody effectively blocked the entry of variants and pseudomutants in VeroE6 cells, and inhibited the expression of cytokines. A model of SARS-CoV-2-infected hCD147 transgenic mice was constructed, which recapitulated the features of exudative diffuse alveolar damage and dynamic immune responses of COVID-19. CD147 antibody could effectively clear the virus and alveolar exudation, resolving the pneumonia. We found the elevated level of cyclophilin A (CyPA) in plasma of severe/critical cases, and identified CyPA as the most important proinflammatory intermediate causing cytokine storm. Mechanistically, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to CD147 and initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which induced expression of CyPA. CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147, triggered MAPK pathway and consequently mediated the expression of cytokine and chemokine. In conclusion, CD147 is a critical target for SARS-CoV-2 variants and CD147 antibody is a promising drug to control the new wave of COVID-19 epidemic.","Geng, Jiejie; Chen, Liang; Yuan, Yufeng; Chen, Ruo; Wang, Ke; Deng, Yongqiang; Du, Peng; Liu, Jiangning; Wu, Guizhen; Wang, Youchun; Xu, Ke; Sun, Xiuxuan; Guo, Ting; Yang, Xu; Wu, Jiao; Jiang, Jianli; Li, Ling; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Kui; Zhu, Hua; Zheng, Zhaohui; Fu, Xianghui; Yang, Fengfan; Chen, Xiaochun; Tang, Hao; Zhang, Zheng; Wei, Ding; Zhang, Yang; Shi, Ying; Zhu, Yumeng; Pei, Zhuo; Huo, Fei; Chen, Shirui; Wang, Qingyi; Xie, Wen; Li, Yirong; Shi, Mingyan; Bian, Huijie; Zhu, Ping; Chen, Zhi-Nan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444111,325

The disease outbreak started in China in late December 2019 and quickly spread to the rest of the world, resulting in a pandemic. The incidence of cases is increasing every day, affecting millions of people around the globe and resulting in a public health emergency. Furthermore, disease management has been challenging for the clinicians and other medical personnel in terms of treatment options and availability of personal protective equipment. The off-label use of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and emergency use authorization of remdesivir can hopefully help the clinicians while treating critically ill patients.

METHODS: Observational study to evaluate diagnostic tests. Non-hospitalized patients with indication for diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The diagnostic test to be evaluated was the determination of Ag and as a reference standard to determine the presence of viral RNA the RT-PCR was used. RESULTS: A total of 494 patients were included. Of these 71.5% (353/494) had symptoms and 28.5% (141/494) were asymptomatic (presurgery screening (35/494) and confirmed case-contact (106/494). The overall sensitivity of the Ag test was 61.1% and the specificity was 99.7%. The sensitivity and specificity in the asymptomatic group were 40% and 100% respectively, and in the symptomatic group 63.5% and 99.6% respectively. In turn, the sensitivity and specificity in the group of symptomatic patients varied according to the time of symptom evolution: in patients with recent symptoms, they were 71.4% and 99.6% respectively, while in patients with symptoms of more than 5 days of evolution, they were 26.7% and 100% respectively. In all groups studied, the presence of antigen is associated with a high viral load (Ct<30 cycles).

However, most of these reports are single-center studies with a limited number of patients. To better assess the outcomes of this new infection in this subgroup of susceptible patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on cancer patients. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies that reported the risk of infection and complications of COVID-19 in cancer patients. The literature search retrieved 22 studies (1018 cancer patients). The analysis showed that the frequency of cancer among COVID-19 confirmed patients was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.3%, 3%) in the overall cohort. These patients had a mortality of 21.1% (95% CI: 14.7%, 27.6%), severe/critical disease rate of 45.4% (95% CI: 37.4%, 53.3%), ICU admission rate of 14.5% (95% CI: 8.5%, 20.4%), and mechanical ventilation rate of 11.7% (95% CI: 5.5%, 18%). The double-arm analysis showed that cancer patients had higher risk of mortality (OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.71, 6.13), severe/critical disease (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.70, 5.67), ICU admission (OR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.85, 5.17), and mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.27, 18.65), compared to non-cancer patients. Further, cancer patients had significantly lower platelet levels and a significantly higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and prothrombin time.

By contrast, the opponents believed it was necessary to contain the spread and ensure a safe environment for recovery. Anatomy into the battle is of importance to address public concerns, beliefs, and values, thereby enabling policymakers to determine the appropriate solutions to implement reopening policy. To this end, we investigated over 1.5 million related Twitter postings from April 17 to May 30, 2020. With the aid of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers, we classified each tweet into either a “supporting” or “opposing” class and then investigated the public perception from temporal and spatial perspectives. From the temporal dimension, we found that both political and scientific news that were extensively discussed on Twitter led to the perception of opposing reopening. Further, being the first mover with full reopen adversely affected the public reaction to reopening policy, while being the follower or late mover resulted in positive responses. From the spatial dimension, the correlation and regression analyses suggest that the state-level perception was very likely to be associated with political affiliation and health value.","Li, Lingyao; Erfani, Abdolmajid; Wang, Yu; Cui, Qingbin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255783/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254359,325

The extent to which this process termed antigenic drift affects coronaviruses remains unknown. Alike the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV) likely emerged from animal reservoirs as new human pathogens in the past. We therefore analyzed the long-term evolutionary dynamics of the ubiquitous HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in comparison with human influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H3N2. We focus on viral glycoprotein genes that mediate viral entry into cells and are major targets of host neutralizing antibody responses. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies of publicly available gene datasets representing about three decades of HCoV and IAV evolution showed that all viruses had similar ladder-like tree shapes compatible with antigenic drift, supported by different tree shape statistics. Evolutionary rates inferred in a Bayesian framework were 6.5 × 10(−4) (95% highest posterior density (HPD), 5.4–7.5 × 10(−4)) substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for HCoV-229E spike (S) genes and 5.7 × 10(−4) (95% HPD, 5–6.5 × 10(−4)) s/s/y for HCoV-OC43 S genes, which were about fourfold lower than the 2.5 × 10(−3) (95% HPD, 2.3–2.7 × 10(−3)) s/s/y rate for IAV hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Coronavirus S genes accumulated about threefold less (P < 0.001) non-synonymous mutations (dN) over time than IAV HA genes. In both IAV and HCoV, the average rate of dN within the receptor binding domains (RBD) was about fivefold higher (P < 0.0001) than in other glycoprotein gene regions. Similarly, most sites showing evidence for positive selection occurred within the RBD (HCoV-229E, 6/14 sites, P < 0.05; HCoV-OC43, 23/38 sites, P < 0.01; IAV, 13/15 sites, P = 0.08). In sum, the evolutionary dynamics of HCoV and IAV showed several similarities, yet amino acid changes potentially representing antigenic drift occurred on a lower scale in endemic HCoV compared to IAV. It seems likely that pandemic SARS-CoV-2 evolution will bear similarities with IAV evolution including accumulation of adaptive changes in the RBD, requiring vaccines to be updated regularly, whereas higher SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary stability resembling endemic HCoV can be expected in the post-pandemic stage.","Jo, Wendy K; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",Virus Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veab020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768964/,325

669144,Ophthalmology Practice During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: The University of Pittsburgh Experience in Promoting Clinic Safety and Embracing Video Visits,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been studied in several countries since the beginning of the pandemic. So far, there is no complete survey of older patients in a German district that includes both outpatients and inpatients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we aimed to investigate risk factors, mortality, and functional outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 aged 70 and older living in the district of Tübingen in the southwest of Germany. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all 256 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in one of the earliest affected German districts during the first wave of the disease from February to April 2020. To ensure inclusion of all infected patients, we analysed reported data from the public health department as well as the results of a comprehensive screening intervention in all nursing homes of the district (n = 1169). Furthermore, we examined clinical data of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109). RESULTS: The all-cause mortality was 18%. Screening in nursing homes showed a point-prevalence of 4.6%. 39% of residents showed no COVID-specific symptoms according to the official definition at that time. The most important predictors of mortality were the need for inpatient treatment (odds ratio (OR): 3.95 [95%-confidence interval (CI): 2.00–7.86], p<0.001) and care needs before infection (non-hospitalized patients: OR: 3.79 [95%-CI: 1.01–14.27], p = 0.037, hospitalized patients: OR: 2.89 [95%-CI 1.21–6.92], p = 0.015). Newly emerged care needs were a relevant complication of COVID-19: 27% of previously self-sufficient patients who survived the disease were not able to return to their home environment after discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the importance of a differentiated view of risk groups and long-term effects within the older population. These findings should be included in the political and social debate during the ongoing pandemic to evaluate the true effect of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and individual functional status.","Herrmann, Matthias L.; Hahn, Johannes-Martin; Walter-Frank, Birgit; Bollinger, Desiree M.; Schmauder, Kristina; Schnauder, Günter; Bitzer, Michael; Malek, Nisar P.; Eschweiler, Gerhard W.; Göpel, Siri",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143823/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253154,325
671101,Clinical Characteristics of Patients Who Died of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China,2020-04-10,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high mortality. The most urgent thing is to find effective treatments. Objective: To determine whether hydroxychloroquine application may be associated with a decreased risk of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients and what is potential mechanism. Design, Setting and Patients: This retrospective study included all 568 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by pathogen laboratory tests despite antiviral treatment and had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, PAO2/FIO2 <300 with need of mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, between February 1 of 2020 to April 8 of 2020. All 568 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them additionally received oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days). Primary endpoint is mortality of patients, and inflammatory cytokines levels were compared between hydroxychloroquine and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital death and hospital stay time (day) were obtained, level of inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) was measured and compared between HCQ and NHCQ treatments. RESULTS: The median age of 568 critically ill patients is 68 (57, 76) years old with 37.0% being female. Mortalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group and 45.8% (238/520) in NHCQ group (p<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4 - 14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (p<0.05). The level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly lowered from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg/mL at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg/ml (p<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with a decreased mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine should be prescribed for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients to save lives.","Yu, B.; Wang, D.

Emerging viral threats exemplify the extent to which humans evolved into a global species, with a pervasive and irreversible impact on the planetary ecosystem. To effectively address these disruptive threats, an attitude of preparedness seems called for, not only on the viroscientific, but also on bioethical, regulatory and governance levels. This paper analyses the global bioethical challenges of emerging viral threats from a dialectical materialist (Marxist) perspective, focussing on three collisions: (1) the collision of expanding networks of globalisation with local husbandry practices; (2) the collision of global networks of mobility with disrupted ecosystems; and (3) the collision of viroscience as a globalised research field with existing regulatory frameworks. These collisions emerge in a force field defined by the simultaneity of the non-simultaneous. Evidence-based health policies invoke discontent as they reflect the normative logic of a globalised knowledge regime. The development of a global bioethics or macro-ethics requires us to envision these collisions not primarily as issues of benefits and risks, but first and foremost as normative tensions closely entangled with broader socio-economic and socio-cultural developments.","Zwart, Hub",Med Health Care Philos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737743/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-020-09970-3,325

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR) by comparison with RT-PCR in a public setting. Method: Individuals aged 18 years or older who had booked an appointment for a RT-PCR test on December 26-31, 2020 at a public test center in Copenhagen, Denmark, were invited to participate. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR analysis, immediately followed by a nasopharyngeal swab examined by the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag test (SD BIOSENSOR). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated with test results from RT-PCR as reference. Results: Overall, 4697 individuals were included (female n=2456, 53.3%; mean age: 44.7 years, SD: 16.9 years); 196 individuals were tested twice or more. Among 4811 paired conclusive test results from the RT-PCR and antigen tests, 221 (4.6%) RT-PCR tests were positive. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen test were 69.7% and 99.5%, the positive and negative predictive values were 87.0% and 98.5%. Ct values were significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen tests compared to true positives. Conclusion: The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values found indicate that the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag is a good supplement to RT-PCR testing.","Kronberg Jakobsen, K.; Schmidt Jensen, J.; Todsen, T.; Lippert, F.; Jean-Marie Martel, C.; Klokker, M.; von Buchwald, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.22.21250042; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.22.21250042v1?rss=1,325

Here, by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on dominant wild small animal species in 4 provinces in China, we obtained a complete sequence of BeiV strain from Rattus norvegicus in Guangdong, neighboring HongKong, China. We then made an expanded epidemiological investigation in 11 provinces to obtain the geographic distribution and genetic features of this virus. Altogether 7168 samples from 2005 animals (1903 rodents, 100 shrews, 2 mustelidaes) that belonged to 33 species of Cricetidae, Muridae, Sciuridae and Dipodidae family of Rodentia, 3 species of Soricidae family of Soricomorpha, 2 species of Mustelidae family of Carnivora were examined by RT-PCR and sequencing. A positive rate of 3.7% (266/7168) was obtained that was detected from 22 animal species, including 5 species of Cricetidae family, 12 species of Muridae family, 2 species of Sciuridae family and 3 species of Soricidae family.

However, there are challenges associated with the use of viral delivery vectors. The advent of nanomedicine represents a quantum leap in the application of gene therapy. Recent advances in stimulus‐responsive nonviral nanocarriers indicate that they are efficient delivery systems for loading and unloading of therapeutic nucleic acids. Some nanocarriers are responsive to cues derived from the internal environment, such as changes in pH, redox potential, enzyme activity, reactive oxygen species, adenosine triphosphate, and hypoxia. Others are responsive to external stimulations, including temperature gradients, light irradiation, ultrasonic energy, and magnetic field. Multiple stimuli‐responsive strategies have also been investigated recently for experimental gene therapy.","Yu, Cheng; Li, Long; Hu, Pei; Yang, Yan; Wei, Wei; Deng, Xin; Wang, Lu; Tay, Franklin R.; Ma, Jingzhi",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306980/,325

Its objective is to map changes at individual consumer level and identify the influence of different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in individual food consumption. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,680 residents of Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), and Slovenia (SI) using quota sampling for gender, age and regional distribution. Data on consumption frequencies before and during the pandemic were collected with a food frequency questionnaire in the spring of 2020 (during the first lockdown period) for important types of fresh food and non-perishable food. Our results showed that, depending on the type of food, 15–42% of study participants changed their consumption frequency during the pandemic, compared to before. In all the study countries, the food categories with the highest rates of change were frozen food, canned food, and cake and biscuits; among the food categories with lower rates of change were bread, alcoholic drinks, and dairy products. People across all three countries shopped less frequently during lockdown and there was an overall reduction in the consumption of fresh foods, but an increase in the consumption of food with a longer shelf life in Denmark and Germany. Interestingly though, we observed diverging trends in all food categories analyzed, with some people decreasing and others increasing their consumption frequencies, demonstrating that the pandemic had different impacts on people's lifestyles and food consumption patterns. Using the method of multinomial regression analysis, we identified factors significantly (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.1) related to increases and decrease in individuals' consumption frequencies in different food categories. The factors include restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic (i.e., closure of physical workplaces, canteens, cafés and restaurants, schools, and childcare institutions), changes in households' grocery shopping frequency, individuals' perceived risk of COVID-19, income losses due to the pandemic, and socio-demographic factors. Interesting differences between the countries were detected, allowing insights into the different food cultures.

Identifying phenotypes of ARDS and integrating this information into patient selection for clinical trials may increase the chance for efficacy with new treatments. In this review, we focus on classifying ARDS by the associated clinical disorders, physiological data, and radiographic imaging. We consider biologic phenotypes, including plasma protein biomarkers, gene expression, and common causative microbiologic pathogens. We will also discuss the issue of focusing clinical trials on the patient’s phase of lung injury, including prevention, administration of therapy during early acute lung injury, and treatment of established ARDS.
