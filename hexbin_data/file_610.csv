In an effort to combat such an alarmingly high mortality rate, various treatment therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation strategies, corticosteroid therapy, and use of nitric oxide (NO) have been attempted in the management of patients with ARDS. Three cases which were admitted to the ICU and confirmed to have ARDS were unable to be weaned from ventilatory support, and nitric oxide therapy was initiated. It improved patients' oxygenation for short periods of time but did not affect the mortality. The patients could not be weaned from the ventilator and expired.","Akmal, A.

As a vital platform for growth factor-linked adaptive signaling, caveolae were evaluated for epithelial modulation of the insulted gut. Patients under ulcerative insult displayed enhanced expression of caveolin-1, the main structural component of caveolae, which was positively associated with expression of protein kinase R (PKR), the ribosomal stress-responsive eIF2α kinase. PKR-linked biological responses were simulated in experimental gut models of ribosome-inactivating stress using mice and Caenorhabditis elegans. Caveolar activation counteracted the expression of wound-protective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its target genes, such as chemokines that were pivotal for epithelial integrity in the ribosome-inactivated gut. Mechanistic findings regarding ribosomal inactivation-associated disorders in the gut barrier provide crucial molecular evidence for detrimental caveolar actions against EGFR-mediated epithelial protection in patients with IBD.","Park, Seong-Hwan; Kim, Juil; Moon, Yuseok",Commun Biol,610,16

Tracheal tubes (TT) 6.5, 7.5 and 8.0 were connected to a test lung simulating the respiratory system resistive (R = 5, 20, 50 cmH(2)O/L/s) and elastic (C = 10, 20, and 50 mL/cmH(2)O) loads. The model was ventilated by HFPV with a pulse inspiratory peak pressure (work pressure P(work)) augmented in 5-cmH(2)O steps from 20 to 45 cmH(2)O, yielding 6 diverse airflows. The percussive frequency (f) was set to 300, 500 and 700 cycles/min, respectively. Pressure (Paw and Ptr) and flow (V’) measurements were performed for all 162 possible combinations of loads, frequencies, and work pressures for each TT size, thus yielding 486 determinations. For each respiratory cycle ΔP(TT) was calculated by subtracting each peak Ptr from its corresponding peak Paw. A non-linear model was constructed to assess the relationships between single parameters. Performance of the produced model was measured in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (r(2)). ΔP(TT) was predicted by P(work) (exponential Gaussian relationship), resistance (quadratic and linear terms), frequency (quadratic and linear terms) and tube diameter (linear term), but not by compliance. RMSE of the model on the testing dataset was 1.17 cmH(2)O, r(2) was 0.79 and estimation error was lower than 1 cmH(2)O in 68% of cases. As a result, even without a flow value, the physician would be able to evaluate ΔP(TT) pressure. If the present results of our bench study could be clinically confirmed, the use of a nonconventional ventilatory strategy as HFPV, would be safer and easier.","Lucangelo, Umberto; Ajčević, Miloš; Lena, Enrico; Ferluga, Massimo; Comuzzi, Lucia; Accardo, Agostino; Zin, Walter A.",J Clin Monit Comput,610,29

Despite the recommendation by WHO and OIE to use the direct immunofluorescence test as standard method, molecular diagnostic assays like reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) are increasing as a confirmatory method. However, both technologies are inaccessible in resource-limited settings. Moreover, the available point-of-need molecular assay is of poor detection limit for African strains. Herein, we developed a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay as potential point-of-need diagnostic tool for rapid detection of various strains of rabies virus including locally isolated African strains. The sensitivity and specificity of the method was evaluated using a molecular RNA standard and different Rabies-related viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridea family, respectively. The RABV-RPA performances were evaluated on isolates representative of the existing diversity and viral dilutions spiked in non-neural clinical specimen. The results were compared with RT-qPCR as a gold standard. The RABV-RPA detected down to 4 RNA molecules per reaction in 95% of the cases in less than 10 min. The RABV-RPA assay is highly specific as various RABV isolates were identified, but no amplification was observed for other member of the Rhabdoviridea family. The sample background did not affect the performance of the RABV-RPA as down to 11 RNA molecules were identified, which is similar to the RT-qPCR results. Our developed assay is suitable for use in low-resource settings as a promising alternative tool for ante-mortem rabies diagnosis in humans for facilitating timely control decisions.","Faye, Martin; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Faye, Oumar; Kissenkötter, Jonas; Hoffmann, Bernd; Sall, Amadou Alpha; Faye, Ousmane",Sci Rep,610,22

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data and diagnosis and treatment of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation that were diagnosed in the Oncology Department of People’s hospital of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture from July 2014 to July 2019. RESULT: All 8 patients were from epidemic paragonimiasis areas and had a confirmed history of consuming uncooked freshwater crabs. The clinical manifestations were mainly fever, dry cough, and chest pain. The disease durations were long, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were elevated. The cases had been misdiagnosed as pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis. After years of anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatment, the symptoms had not improved significantly. Patients eventually sought treatment from the oncology department for hemoptysis. Chest computed tomography showed patchy consolidation in the lungs, with nodules, lung masses, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease. Early clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results are nonspecific. The parasite most often invades the lungs, and the resulting disease is often misdiagnosed as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, or lung cancer (Acta Trop 199: 05074, 2019). To avoid misdiagnosis, clinicians should inquire, in detail, about residence history and history of unclean food and exposure to infected water and make an early diagnosis based on the inquired information and imaging examination results. For patients who have been diagnosed with pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis and whose symptoms do not improve significantly after anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatments, their epidemiological history should be traced to further conduct differential diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis.","Shu, Qiu-Hong; Yang, Yang; Li, Shu-De; Zhao, Jun-Sheng; Li, Sheng-Hao; Wang, Miao-Miao; Wang, Wei-Qun; Tian, Ming; He, Shu-Mei-Qi; Ma, Zhi-Qiang; Zhu, Min; Wang, Wen-Lin",J Cardiothorac Surg,610,33

They function in epigenetic regulation as subunits of multiple chromatin-related complexes and have been implicated in numerous cancers. Due to their overlapping functions, our understanding of RBBP4 and 7, particularly outside of Opisthokonts, has remained limited. Here, we report that in the ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila a single orthologue of human RBBP4 and 7 proteins, RebL1, physically interacts with histone H4 and functions in multiple epigenetic regulatory pathways. Functional proteomics identified conserved functional links for Tetrahymena RebL1 protein as well as human RBBP4 and 7. We found that putative subunits of multiple chromatin-related complexes including CAF1, Hat1, Rpd3, and MuvB, co-purified with RebL1 during Tetrahymena growth and conjugation. Iterative proteomics analyses revealed that the cell cycle regulatory MuvB-complex in Tetrahymena is composed of at least five subunits including evolutionarily conserved Lin54, Lin9 and RebL1 proteins. Genome-wide analyses indicated that RebL1 and Lin54 (Anqa1) bind within genic and intergenic regions. Moreover, Anqa1 targets primarily promoter regions suggesting a role for Tetrahymena MuvB in transcription regulation. RebL1 depletion inhibited cellular growth and reduced the expression levels of Anqa1 and Lin9. Consistent with observations in glioblastoma tumors, RebL1 depletion suppressed DNA repair protein Rad51 in Tetrahymena, thus underscoring the evolutionarily conserved functions of RBBP4/7 proteins. Our results suggest the essentiality of RebL1 functions in multiple epigenetic regulatory complexes in which it impacts transcription regulation and cellular viability.","Nabeel-Shah, Syed; Garg, Jyoti; Saettone, Alejandro; Ashraf, Kanwal; Lee, Hyunmin; Wahab, Suzanne; Ahmed, Nujhat; Fine, Jacob; Derynck, Joanna; Pu, Shuye; Ponce, Marcelo; Marcon, Edyta; Zhang, Zhaolei; Greenblatt, Jack F; Pearlman, Ronald E; Lambert, Jean-Philippe; Fillingham, Jeffrey",Nucleic Acids Res,610,1

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in three NICUs from 2016 to 2020. Infants without congenital anomalies, less than 1500 grams at birth, who were ventilated and received an extubation attempt were included. Primary exposure was OE (7:00 pm–6:59 am) and outcome was extubation success defined as no mechanical ventilation for at least 7 days after extubation. RESULTS: A total of 76/379 (20%) infants received OE. Infants extubated during the daytime were older and had higher illness severity markers. Extubation success rates did not differ for overnight (57/76, 75%) versus daytime extubations (231/303, 76%) after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.82–1.11). CONCLUSION: Though infants in our cohort undergoing daytime and OE were dissimilar, extubation success rates did not differ.

METHODS: Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into a normal group and a high salt group. These groups were then fed with normal or sodium-rich chow (containing 6% NaCl) for 6 weeks. Liver injury was evaluated, and the influences of a high-salt diet on the liver were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing at the end of week 6. RESULTS: We found that although no liver parenchymal injury could be found after high-salt feeding, many metabolic abnormalities had formed based on transcriptome sequencing results. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes revealed that at least 15 enzymatic activities and the metabolism of multiple substances were affected by a high-salt diet. Moreover, a variety of signaling and metabolic pathways, as well as numerous biological functions, were involved in liver dysfunction due to a high-salt diet. This included some known pathways and many novel ones, such as retinol metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: A high-salt diet can induce serious abnormal liver metabolic activities in mice at the transcriptional level, although substantial physical damage may not yet be visible. This study, to our knowledge, was the first to reveal the impact of a high-salt diet on the liver at the omics level, and provides theoretical support for potential clinical risk evaluation, pathogenic mechanisms, and drug design for combating liver dysfunction. This study also provides a serious candidate direction for further research on the physiological impacts of high-salt diets.

Due to the incompleteness of even large and well engineered KBs, such methods suffer from low recall when applied in real-world use cases. To address this, we designed a reasoning framework that combines logic-based subsumption with statistical methods for on-the-fly knowledge extraction. Statistical methods extract additional (missing) axioms for the compared entities with the goal of tackling the incompleteness of KBs and thus improving recall. Although this can be beneficial, it can also introduce noise (false positives or false negatives). Hence, our framework uses heuristics to assess whether knowledge extraction is likely to be advantageous and only activates the statistical components if this is the case. We instantiate our framework by combining lightweight logic-based reasoning implemented on top of existing triple-stores with an axiom extraction method that is based on the labels of concepts. Our work was motivated by industrial use cases over which we evaluate our instantiated framework, showing that it outperforms approaches that are only based on textual information. Besides the best combination of precision and recall, our implementation is also scalable and is currently used in an industrial production environment.","Stoilos, Giorgos; Juric, Damir; Wartak, Szymon; Schulz, Claudia; Khodadadi, Mohammad",The Semantic Web,610,16

This high prevalence of simulation practices in nursing programs has led to opportunities to research this topic from various angles, including its impact on students’ skill performance, self-efficacy, self-confidence, self-satisfaction, and clinical knowledge acquisition. Design and Methods: Participants in this qualitative study included 54 senior female undergraduates enrolled in a critical care nursing course in Saudi Arabia. Recordings were made of six authentic, acute care simulation sessions. One of these sessions was examined in depth using discourse analysis approaches to gain insights into communication in simulation sessions, examining the way students linguistically managed this critical communication, exhibiting their logical, reflective, decision-making, problem-solving, and collaborative work skills and use of communicative strategies. Results: The analyses revealed various training and communication issues including the lack of harmony among the team members (e.g., regarding understanding and performing their assigned roles as well as delegating and conducting delegated tasks) and the students’ inability to effectively communicate with the patient as a valuable source of information and to make appropriate and timely clinical decisions regarding patient assessment. Conclusions: Simulation sessions have been shown to be a promising instructional tool to support nursing education, allowing students to practice in a safe and controlled environment. However, for more effective sessions and to avoid poor simulation sessions, students need to be thoroughly briefed regarding the sessions prior to implementation.","Mohammad, Abeer",J Public Health Res,610,16

In this study, we explore the relationship between affective sequences that have been previously explored in the literature and the activities students may engage in when interacting with Reasoning Mind, a blended learning system for elementary mathematics. The strongest correlations are found for students who shift from engaged concentration to frustration, making fewer actions in the system.

However, most of these apps target the first stages of learning a new language and are limited in the type of feedback that can be provided to users’ spontaneous spoken responses. The English Language Artificial Intelligence (ELAi) app was developed to address this gap by providing users with a variety of prompts for spontaneous speech and adaptive, targeted feedback based on the automatic evaluation of spoken responses. Feedback in the ELAi app was presented across multiple pages such that users could choose the amount and depth of feedback that they wanted to receive. The present work evaluates how 94 English language learners interacted with the app. We focused on participants’ use of the feedback pages and whether or not performance on spontaneous speech improved over the course of using the app. The findings revealed that users were most likely to access the most shallow feedback page, but use of the feedback pages differed based on the total number of sessions that users completed with the app. Users showed improvement in their response performance over the course of using the app, which suggests that the design of repeated practice and adaptive, targeted feedback in the ELAi app is promising. Patterns of feedback page use are discussed further as well as potential design modifications that could increase the use of feedback and maximize improvement in English language spontaneous speech.","Lehman, Blair; Gu, Lin; Zhao, Jing; Tsuprun, Eugene; Kurzum, Christopher; Schiano, Michael; Liu, Yulin; Tanner Jackson, G.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,610,16

It is generally accepted that in order to be effective, gamification should be tailored to users. Currently, most systems adapt by assigning different game elements based on a single learner profile (e.g. dominant player type, personality or gender). However, there is no study yet that analyse the effect of combining several profiles. In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners’ motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used in this context. We also show that tailoring to initial motivation to learn mathematics can improve intrinsic motivation. Finally, we show that tailoring to both player type and motivation profiles can improve intrinsic motivation, and decrease amotivation, compared to a single adaptation only based on learner motivation. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding the choice of a learner model for tailoring gamification in educational environments.","Hallifax, Stuart; Lavoué, Elise; Serna, Audrey",Artificial Intelligence in Education,610,16

Because neural networks are opaque, certifying their correctness is a significant challenge. To address this issue, several neural network verification approaches have recently been proposed. However, these approaches afford limited scalability, and applying them to large networks can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enhance neural network verification techniques by using over-approximation to reduce the size of the network—thus making it more amenable to verification. We perform the approximation such that if the property holds for the smaller (abstract) network, it holds for the original as well. The over-approximation may be too coarse, in which case the underlying verification tool might return a spurious counterexample. Under such conditions, we perform counterexample-guided refinement to adjust the approximation, and then repeat the process. Our approach is orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing verification techniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with the recently proposed Marabou framework, and observe a significant improvement in Marabou’s performance. Our experiments demonstrate the great potential of our approach for verifying larger neural networks.","Elboher, Yizhak Yisrael; Gottschlich, Justin; Katz, Guy",Computer Aided Verification,610,16

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. We evaluated a total of 287 paired ETCO(2) and PaCO(2) values as well as VTs obtained from 22 VLBW infants with ventilation. Deming regression, quadratic discriminant analysis, and Bland–Altman analysis were performed. RESULT: ETCO(2) and PaCO(2) were correlated (r(2) = 0.5897, p < 0.0001). A quadratic discrimination analysis of the VT and the percentage of leak yielded 70.4% [95%CI, 65.1 to 75.7] discrimination for the agreement between ETCO(2) and PaCO(2). ETCO(2) was strongly correlated with PaCO(2) in the discriminant function Z > 0 group (r(2) = 0.7234, p < 0.0001).

RESULTS: Eight patients from six unrelated families were enrolled. The patients had a median age of 7 years (4–32 years). All patients presented with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive in early life. Less common features were skin abscesses, conjunctivitis, global developmental delay, optic nerve atrophy, vitiligo, multinodular goiter, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like symptoms. All patients had intermittent neutropenia and 87% of the patients had recurrent thrombocytopenia. Anemia was found in 62%. All patients had hypogammaglobinemia and one had a persistent high IgM level. All patients had impaired function of T cells. The same homozygous missense mutation c.58T>C:p.Y20H, in the TFRC gene, was detected in all patients. Stem cell transplantation from matched donors was successful in two patients.

Other diseases and spray damage can result in fire blight-like symptoms that can lead to misdiagnosis and affect disease management strategies. Accurate and timely detection of the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, is extremely important to deploy appropriate and timely measures to reduce fire blight epidemics in commercial apple orchards. We tested two commercial lateral flow immunoassays (AgriStrip®, and Pocket Diagnostics kit), Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to diagnose E. amylovora infected samples in lab and field settings. The AgriStrip® and Pocket Diagnostics kits were able to detect actively growing bacteria up to ×10(6) cfu/ml bacterial concentration. Pocket Diagnostics kit had less specificity and showed positive tests for E. pyrifolia in addition to E. amylovora. The LAMP assay showed high specificity for E. amylovora and was able to detect up to ×10(3) cfu/ml bacterial concentrations. The qPCR assay was also able to detect bacterial cells up to ×10(−3) cfu/ml bacterial concentration with highly specific E. amylovora detection. Grower surveys and comparative cost-benefit analysis indicated that immunoassay kits are less expensive, easier to use, and require less technical expertise for on-site fire blight diagnosis than LAMP and qPCR. However, the choice of a specific diagnostic assay depends on the time, sensitivity, and specificity required for the detection of fire blight and its management.

Genetic data from three mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene were used. Mitochondrial genes separated Clepticus into three well supported clades corresponding to the three recognized allopatric morpho-species. All analyses provided consistent support for an initial separation (~9.68 to 1.86 mya; 4.84% sequence divergence) of the Caribbean and South Atlantic lineages, followed by a much more recent divergence (~ 0.60 to 0.12 mya; 0.3% sequence divergence) of the Brazilian and African sister morpho-species. Both these phylogenetic events occurred well after the formation of the two barriers that currently separate those three allopatric populations. The planktonic larval duration of these species (35–49 days) and coastal pelagic habits may have facilitated dispersal by this genus across those dispersal barriers after they formed.","Beldade, Ricardo; Heiser, J.

Severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B is closely related to continuous HBV replication. Therefore, inhibiting HBV replication to reduce viral load may block disease progression and improve the quality of life of these patients. ETV or TDF has been recommend first-line drug for the treatment of AECHB. 2. A hyperactive immune response due to continuous HBV replication is the main mechanism for development of severe hepatitis B. In addition to comprehensive treatment, early administration of potent nucleoside analogs can rapidly reduce HBV DNA concentration, relieve immune injury induced by HBV, and reduce liver inflammation and patient mortality. Antiviral agents have become important in the treatment of severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B. 3. Long-term antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogs can delay or reverse the progress of liver cirrhosis. Virologic response, viral resistance and adverse drug reactions should be closely monitored during treatment. The treatment should be optimized for maximum effect based on each patient’s responses. 4. Effective antiviral therapy can suppress HBV replication and reduce the incidence of HBV-related HCC. Patients with HBV-related HCC should receive individualized and optimal multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment. Anti-viral drugs with high efficacy, low resistance and low adverse drug reactions should be selected to improve the patient’s quality of life and prolong survival time. 5. Methods to prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation include passive immunization (HBIG), antiviral treatment (nucleoside analogs) and active immunization (hepatitis B vaccine). 6. Clinical trials involving sequential combination therapy with NUC and Peg-IFN have shown statistically significant decline in HBsAg levels on treatment and high rates of sustained post-treatment serologic response. Combination therapy with novel DAA and immunotherapeutic approach may hold promise to overcome both cccDNA persistence and immune escape, representing a critical step towards HBV cure.","Ning, Qin; Wu, Ting; Su, Hai-Bin; Ma, Ke; Qi, Jun-Ying; Ni, Ming; Wu, Di",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,610,16

The previous coronavirus epidemic, SARS in 2002, showed that countries responded largely individually to this emerging threat. EU wide, joint responses were not taken. SARS epidemic showed that strengthening of the common EU efforts was needed. Many actions were taken, and since 2013 the European Commission Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health has provided a framework to improve preparedness and to strengthen the response capacities in Europe to health threats. SHARP Joint Action is a 3-year collaborative action of 26 countries and 61 partners, co-funded by the EC and coordinated by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland, and co-coordinated by Robert Koch Institute, Germany and National Institute of Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani, Italy. SHARP started it's actions in June 2019, and it aims to strengthen implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the Decision 1082/2013/EU. SHARP consists of ten work packages covering core public health capacities, including: IHR core capacity strengthening and assessment, preparedness and response planning, training, laboratory preparedness and responsiveness, chemical safety and threats, and case management, infection prevention and control preparedness. Through this cross-sectoral approach, SHARP supports the Member States and partner countries in strengthening their capacities. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, SHARP has also supported the EC and the Member States, and especially work packages for laboratory preparedness and responsiveness (WP7) and for case management and infection prevention and control preparedness (WP10) were activated.

The urgent need for such diagnostic systems is recommended by experts in order to achieve the mass and targeted SARS-CoV-2 detection required to manage the COVID-19 pandemic through the understanding of infection progression and timely therapy decisions. To achieve these tasks, there is a scope for developing smart sensors to rapidly and selectively detect SARS-CoV-2 protein at the picomolar level. COVID-19 infection, due to human-to-human transmission, demands diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC) without the need of experienced labor and sophisticated laboratories. Keeping the above-mentioned considerations, we propose to explore the compartmentalization approach by designing and developing nanoenabled miniaturized electrochemical biosensors to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at the site of the epidemic as the best way to manage the pandemic. Such COVID-19 diagnostics approach based on a POC sensing technology can be interfaced with the Internet of things and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (such as machine learning and deep learning for diagnostics) for investigating useful informatics via data storage, sharing, and analytics. Keeping COVID-19 management related challenges and aspects under consideration, our work in this review presents a collective approach involving electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 biosensing supported by AI to generate the bioinformatics needed for early stage COVID-19 diagnosis, correlation of viral load with pathogenesis, understanding of pandemic progression, therapy optimization, POC diagnostics, and diseases management in a personalized manner.","Kaushik, Ajeet Kumar; Dhau, Jaspreet Singh; Gohel, Hardik; Mishra, Yogendra Kumar; Kateb, Babak; Kim, Nam-Young; Goswami, Dharendra Yogi",ACS Appl Bio Mater,610,0

The control group will be treated according to the current guidelines on standard hemodynamic care. The interventional group will be treated according to an algorithm based on the RER. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one complication in the 7 days following surgery. The secondary outcomes will be the length of hospital stay, the total number of complications per patient, the 30-day mortality, the total intraoperative volume of fluids administered, and the Sequential [sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and laboratory data measured on postoperative days 1, 2, and 7. A total of 350 patients will be included. DISCUSSION: In the operating theater, the RER is potentially a continuously available, easy-to-read, indirect marker of tissue hypoperfusion and postoperative complications. If the RER does predict the occurrence of tissue hypoperfusion, it will help the physician to provide personalized hemodynamic management and limit the side effects associated with excessive hemodynamic optimization (volume overload, vasoconstriction, etc.).

Focused on the needs of people who are frail, living with advanced illness, and their caregivers, including the needs of people who are bereaved, HELP Ottawa strives to, 1)strengthen informal and community social networks, organizational cultures and linkages across local health and social care services; 2)create a community culture that supports people to build social care networks to be able to ask for and accept help, and, 3)mobilize and prepare community members to be confident and capable of offering and providing help to people in their communities. Unfolding within the context of COVID-19, each HELP Ottawa site has found ways to mobilize, adapt and respond to lockdowns, quarantines, increased isolation and altered needs and services. Drawing on 89 initial consultations, followed by 111 interviews and 16 focus group participants (n=164), qualitative findings speak to the heightened grief and fear experienced within each site during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the multiple costs of severed ‘essential’ links. Critically highlighted is the need to build and sustain social supports and connection through everyday and local means while also integrating technology and online communication. Further apparent are the critical questions that need to be asked about how compassionate communities, and communities at large, can prepare for and respond to current and future waves of COVID-19.","Grassau, Pamela; Miloff, Hayley; Davison, Emily; Stinchcombe, Arne; Wright, David Kenneth; Thomas, Roanne",Innov Aging,610,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who had pES to determine whether results led to clinical management changes. RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 8 (40%) received a definitive diagnosis. Seven patients (35%) had medical management changes based on the pES results, including alterations to their delivery plan and neonatal management (such as use of targeted medications, subspecialty referrals, additional imaging and/or procedures). All patients who received a definitive diagnosis and one who received a likely pathogenic variant (n = 9; 45%) received specific counseling about recurrence risk and the medical/developmental prognosis for the baby. In five (25%) cases, the result facilitated a diagnosis in parents and/or siblings. CONCLUSION: pES results can have significant impacts on clinical management, some of which would not be possible if testing is deferred until after birth. To maximize the clinical utility, pES should be prioritized in cases where multiple care options are available and the imaging findings alone are not sufficient to guide parental decision-making, or where postnatal testing will not be feasible.","Tolusso, Leandra K.; Hazelton, Paige; Wong, Beatrix; Swarr, Daniel T.",Genet Med,610,1

The different disciplines of science, poetry, and ancient music are applied to the same sites, producing emotional experiences where the encounter and interplay between different representations, and combinations of representations, become an expression of a place. The research introduces three geosites from the Marche Region, central Italy: I Sassi Simone e Simoncello, La Grotta della Beata Vergine di Frasassi, and the Infernaccio Gorge, in order to propose our multidisciplinary approach to the international public. These have been chosen for their value and charm, for their different processes of genesis and evolution, and for the cultural context and feelings they evoke. In a new approach to science communication, our study uses art in the form of music and poetry to encourage people to learn about landscapes. The paper explains the genesis and evolution of the three places, suggests trekking itineraries, includes a poem written specifically for each site, and describes a piece of ancient music and video and cultural offerings relating to each location. Our goal is to educate by fashioning a new perception of landscapes, starting with their physical beauty, and then building on scientific research in co-operation with arts, to improve what we know about their problems and weaknesses, but also about their culture and other strengths.","Valentini, Laura; Nesci, Olivia",Arab J Geosci,610,21

Here, we characterized the impact of pathogen-derived TLR2/4 ligands (peptidoglycan (PGN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) on the immune crosstalk of sperm with the bovine endometrial epithelium. The real-time PCR analysis showed that the presence of low levels of PGN, but not LPS, blocked the sperm-induced inflammatory responses in bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEECs) in vitro. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that PGN prevented the sperm-induced phosphorylation of JNK in BEECs. Activation or blockade of the TLR2 system in the endometrial epithelium verified that TLR2 signaling acts as a commonly-shared pathway for PGN and sperm recognition. The impairment of endometrial sperm recognition, induced by PGN, subsequently inhibited sperm phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Moreover, using an ex vivo endometrial explant that more closely resembles those in vivo conditions, showed that sperm provoked a mild and reversible endometrial tissue injury and triggered PMN recruitment into uterine glands, while PGN inhibited these events. Of note, PGN markedly increased the sperm attachment to uterine glands, and relatively so in the surface epithelium. However, addition of the anti-CD44 antibody into a PGN-sperm-explant co-culture completely blocked sperm attachment into glands and surface epithelia, indicating that the CD44 adhesion molecule is involved in the PGN-triggered sperm attachment to the endometrial epithelium. Together, these findings demonstrate that, the presence of PGN residues disrupts sperm immune recognition and prevents the physiological inflammation induced by sperm in the endometrial epithelium via the MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR2 signaling, possibly leading to impairment of uterine clearance and subsequent embryo receptivity.","Elesh, Ibrahim Fouad; Marey, Mohamed Ali; Zinnah, Mohammed Ali; Akthar, Ihshan; Kawai, Tomoko; Naim, Fayrouz; Goda, Wael; Rawash, Abdel Rahman A.; Sasaki, Motoki; Shimada, Masayuki; Miyamoto, Akio",Front Immunol,610,16

Thus, platelets present a high potential to be used as peripheral biomarkers to reflect neuronal pathologies. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts as a neuronal growth factor involved in learning and memory through the binding of two receptors, the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and the 75 kDa pan-neurotrophic receptor (p75(NTR)). In addition to its expression in the central nervous system, BDNF is found in much greater quantities in blood circulation, where it is largely stored within platelets. Levels 100- to 1,000-fold those of neurons make platelets the most important peripheral reservoir of BDNF. This led us to hypothesize that platelets would express canonical BDNF receptors, i.e., TrkB and p75(NTR), and that the receptors on platelets would bear significant resemblance to the ones found in the brain. However, herein we report discrepancies regarding detection of these receptors using antibody-based assays, with antibodies displaying important tissue-specificity. The currently available antibodies raised against TrkB and p75(NTR) should therefore be used with caution to study platelets as models for neurological disorders. Rigorous characterization of antibodies and bioassays appears critical to understand the interplay between platelet and neuronal biology of BDNF.","Fleury, Samuel; Boukhatem, Imane; Le Blanc, Jessica; Welman, Mélanie; Lordkipanidzé, Marie",Front Immunol,610,16

However, the definitions of URC vary greatly. Five definitions had been commonly used to define URC: 1) >10 cm from the anal verge by MRI; 2) >12 cm from the anal verge by MRI; 3) >10 cm from the anal verge by colonoscopy; 4) >12 cm from the anal verge by colonoscopy; 5) above the anterior peritoneal reflection (APR). We hypothesized that the fifth definition is optimal to identify patients with rectal cancer to avoid adjuvant radiation. METHODS: The data of stage II/III rectal cancer patients who underwent radical surgery without preoperative chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. The height of the APR was measured, and compared with the tumor height measured by digital rectal examination (DRE), MRI and colonoscopy. The five definitions were compared in terms of prediction of local recurrence, survival, and percentages of patients requiring radiation. RESULTS: A total of 576 patients were included, with the intraoperative location of 222 and 354 tumors being above and straddle/below the APR, respectively. The median distance of the APR from anal verge (height of APR) as measured by MRI was 8.7 (range: 4.5–14.3) cm. The height of APR positively correlated with body height (r=0.862, P<0.001). The accuracy of the MRI in determining the tumor location with respect to the APR was 92.1%. Rectal cancer above the APR had a significantly lower incidence of local recurrence than those straddle/below the APR (P=0.042). For those above the APR, there was no significant difference in local recurrence between the radiation and no-radiation group. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor location regarding APR was an independent risk factor for LRFS. Tumor height as measured by DRE, MRI and colonoscopy were not related with survival outcomes. Fewer rectal cancer patients required adjuvant radiation using the definition by the APR, compared with other four definitions based on a numerical tumor height measured by MRI and colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of URC as rectal tumor above the APR, might be the optimal definition to select patients with stage II/III rectal cancer to avoid postoperative adjuvant radiation.","Gao, Xian Hua; Zhai, Bai Zhi; Li, Juan; Kabemba, Jean Luc Tshibangu; Gong, Hai Feng; Bai, Chen Guang; Liu, Ming Lu; Zhang, Shao Ting; Shen, Fu; Liu, Lian Jie; Zhang, Wei",Front Oncol,610,17

However, in the aerospace industry, it is necessary to detect molecular traces of contaminants with extreme sensitivity, as even concentrations as low as part-per-billion (ppb) can be critical during long missions. The high sensitivity of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) detection within the air can be a challenge because of the poor affinity of VOC’s to the metal surface of the sensor substrate. In this work, we present a surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy technique as a highly sensitive and selective molecular sensor for gas trace detection not sensitive to molecules adsorbtion on sensing element. The developed hybrid SERS platform for molecular trace detection is supported by the hybrid nanoplasmonic porous silicon membrane in conjunction with micropump to achieve the trace level detection of VOCs in the environment. The combination of silicon membrane, made by electrochemical etching of the microchannels in the silicon chip, with chemical deposition of the silver nanoparticles inside the channels, produce a porous Ag nanoparticles membrane with a high density of plasmonic nanostructures (“hot spots”). The micropump integrated with the SERS sensor, pump the air with VOC’s molecules through the plasmonic membrane “hot spots” to increase the probability of interaction of VOC’s molecules with SERS substrate and to increase the enhancement factor. The sensor chip structure was designed, gas flow in the sensor was simulated, and the sensor was fabricated using 3D printing. The limit of detection of hydrazine with concentration level 10(–12) M from solution and the vapor phase 0.1 ppm was demonstrated. The anisole vapors with concentration 0.5 ppb spectra in the air were recorded.

In the online learning environment, much of the learning is self-directed and there are generally less opportunities to receive help in real time. The uses of email and discussion boards are the most common method of seeking help in these environments. The current study explored students’ perceptions of the use of live chat technology for online academic help-seeking within higher education, with a focus on comparing online and blended learners’ perspectives. Participants were 246 students who were studying psychology online (n = 91) or in blended learning (n = 155) environments. The live chat technology was well received by both groups, especially for its ability to provide instant, real-time, and convenient help. Live chat was particularly well received by online learners, who were more satisfied, felt more cared about by the teaching team, and would be more likely to recommend it to others than blended learners. Further, online learners reported that live chat gave them better access to staff, and felt that this feature was a good approximation for more traditional face-to-face conversations. As an online, synchronous, private help-seeking tool between student and teacher, these findings provide a strong endorsement for the use of live chat in higher education, particularly for online learners.","Broadbent, Jaclyn; Lodge, Jason",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,610,24

A total of 1785 potential HIV-1 IN inhibitors were collected from the databases of ChEMBL, Binding Database, DrugBank, and PubMed, as well as from 40 references. The database was divided into the training set and test set by random sampling. By exploring the correlation between molecular descriptors and inhibitory activity, it is found that the classification and specific activity data of inhibitors can be more accurately predicted by the combination of molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints. The calculation of molecular fingerprint descriptor provides the additional substructure information to improve the prediction ability. Based on the training set, two machine learning methods, the recursive partition (RP) and naive Bayes (NB) models, were used to build the classifiers of HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Through the test set verification, the RP technique accurately predicted 82.5% inhibitors and 86.3% noninhibitors. The NB model predicted 88.3% inhibitors and 87.2% noninhibitors with correlation coefficient of 85.2%. The results show that the prediction performance of NB model is slightly better than that of RP, and the key molecular segments are also obtained. Additionally, CoMFA and CoMSIA models with good activity prediction ability both were constructed by exploring the structure-activity relationship, which is helpful for the design and optimization of HIV-1 IN inhibitors.","Zhou, Junlin; Hao, Juan; Peng, Lianxin; Duan, Huaichuan; Luo, Qing; Yan, Hailian; Wan, Hua; Hu, Yichen; Liang, Li; Xie, Zhenjian; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Gang; Hu, Jianping",Comput Math Methods Med,610,30

In een verkennend onderzoek keken we naar bevorderende en belemmerende factoren voor gebruik van de M@ZL-app, en naar mogelijkheden voor doorontwikkeling. Methode: We organiseerden online focusgroepgesprekken met jongeren en met jeugdgezondheidszorg (JGZ)-professionals die ervaring hebben met ziekteverzuimconsulten op het voortgezet onderwijs. Resultaten: Dertien jongeren en achttien JGZ-professionals deden mee aan ons onderzoek. Bijna alle deelnemers zien potentie in de M@ZL-app als aanvulling op ziekteverzuimconsulten.

It was proposed as a generalization of picture hesitant fuzzy sets and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy sets in order to deal with uncertainty and fuzziness information. Technique of Aggregation is one of the beneficial tools to aggregate the information. It has many crucial application areas such as decision-making, data mining, medical diagnosis, and pattern recognition. Keeping in view the importance of logarithmic function and aggregation operators, we proposed a novel algorithm to tackle the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. First, novel logarithmic operational laws are developed based on the logarithmic, t-norm, and t-conorm functions. Using these operational laws, we developed a list of logarithmic spherical hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging/geometric aggregation operators to aggregate the spherical hesitant fuzzy information. Furthermore, we developed the spherical hesitant fuzzy entropy to determine the unknown attribute weight information. Finally, the design principles for the spherical hesitant fuzzy decision-making have been developed, and a practical case study of hotel recommendation based on the online consumer reviews has been taken to illustrate the validity and superiority of presented approach. Besides this, a validity test is conducted to reveal the advantages and effectiveness of developed approach. Results indicate that the proposed method is suitable and effective for the decision process to evaluate their best alternative.","Khan, Aziz; Abosuliman, Shougi S.; Abdullah, Saleem; Ayaz, Muhammad",Entropy (Basel),610,16

We construct portfolios based on Sloan’s (Account Rev 71(3):289–315, 1996) total accruals (TA) measure and individual asset-level VaR, which reflects the dynamic behavior of the asset distribution. We document that VaR is in congruence with portfolio-level accruals and that there is a significant positive relationship between VaR and the cross-section of portfolio returns. Allowing a double-sort involving VaR and TA further suggests that the spread between low- and high-TA portfolios is significantly attenuated after controlling for VaR. We also conduct a firm-level cross-sectional regression analysis and demonstrate that the TA- and VaR-based characteristics—but not the factor-mimicking portfolios—are compensated with higher expected returns, and that VaR neither subsumes nor is subsumed by TA. Finally, our cross-sectional decomposition analysis suggests that the firm-level VaR captures at least 7% of the accrual premium even in the presence of size and book-to-market. These findings lend support for the mispricing explanation of the accrual anomaly.","Simlai, Prodosh",Rev Quant Finan Acc,610,24

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has traditionally been the standard practice for ECLS but has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the perioperative period, increased transfusion requirements, prolonged postoperative intubation, and possibly primary graft dysfunction. More recently, because of the flexibility of using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in bridging to transplantation and during postoperative recovery, its use has increased. CPB and ECMO each has advantages and disadvantages; however, because comparisons of CPB and ECMO have been limited to small retrospective observational and single-institution studies, more research is required to determine the superiority of one modality.

Reliance upon digital computational methods restricts the value of natural experience reportable by patients, often considered subjective. In the course of modeling phosphate metabolism in the context of clinical practice it has become evident that use of categories based on normality, as definition of health, is inconsistent with the experience of patients. Given the opportunity, patients can provide detailed observations upon their experience of heat as the principle component of metabolism. It seems logical that heat should also be the foundational principal component of models developed for the translation of data to clinical care. This strategy has been applied to modeling the role of ACE(2) in the expression of variable phenotypes of COVID 19. Attempts to engage massive data and super-computing to the modeling of COVID 19 supported the assumption that ACE(2) is a critical component causing disease. The finding is attributed to an influence, not on heat, but instead suggested bradykinin that has long been a proposed explanation for ACE inhibition on chronic cough. Our modeling would posit that the ACE system engages aldosterone and subsequent influence on heat and acid/base balance as the mediators of variance in the expression of individual phenotypes. This clarification has been useful for addressing complexity in the presentation of metabolic disorders including thyroid disease, Diabetes, bone health, sleep disorders, vascular disease and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It appears that the risk of developing ARDS shares a predisposition to chronic kidney disease mediated by excessive FGF(23) effects, while the asymptomatic spreaders are more Klotho dependent. The vitamin D system is also complex and involved in the modulation of heat and phosphate. These and other components can be extended to understanding bone and the hematopoietic marrow niche governing immune responses and includes a role for modulation of the microbiome influences by ACE(2). It is concluded that SARS-CoV-2 has helped to clarify the complexity of biology and has exposed the limitations of modeling strategies that do not include the application of case-based practice that can be described as “model-dependent realism” (1) as a means to discover the principle components of nature. The models are the valued product of the research that is mandated by the Helsinki accords when outcomes do not meet expectations. These models can facilitate the organization of all data in the appropriate translation to clinical care. 1 Hawking S., Mlodinow L.

However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of GXSTC in CBVDs remain largely unknown. In this study, a combination of systems pharmacology and experimental assessment approach was used to investigate the bioactive components, core targets, and possible mechanisms of GXSTC in the treatment of CBVDs. A total of 15 main components within GXSTC were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and a literature research. Fifty-five common genes were obtained by matching 252 potential genes of GXSTC with 462 CBVD-related genes. Seven core components in GXSTC and 12 core genes of GXSTC on CBVDs were further determined using the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results predicted that the molecular mechanisms of GXSTC on CBVDs were mainly associated with the regulation of the vascular endothelial function, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis. Molecular docking results suggested that almost all of core component-targets have an excellent binding activity (affinity < −5 kcal/mol). More importantly, in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) -injured rats, GXSTC significantly improved the neurological function, reduced the infarct volume, and decreased the percentage of impaired neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting results indicated that GXSTC markedly upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), while downregulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun) in MCAO-injured rats. These findings confirmed our prediction that GXSTC exerts a multi-target synergetic mechanism in CBVDs by maintaining vascular endothelial function, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory processes. The results of this study may provide a theoretical basis for GXSTC research and the clinical application of GXSTC in CBVDs.","Zhang, Juanli; Zhao, Jiaxin; Ma, Yang; Wang, Wenjun; Huang, Shaojie; Guo, Chao; Wang, Kai; Zhang, Xiaomei; Zhang, Wei; Wen, Aidong; Shi, Ming; Ding, Yi",Front Pharmacol,610,16

It usually combines with statistics, machine learning algorithms, or artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to explore the semantic relationship between lexical units, and beneficial when applied to language learning, information processing, translation, and so forth. In the face of a novel disease, like, COVID‐19, establishing medical‐specific corpus will enhance frontline medical personnel's information acquisition efficiency, guiding them on the right approaches to respond to and prevent the novel disease. To effectively retrieve critical messages from the corpus, appropriately handling word‐ranking issues is quite crucial. However, traditional frequency‐based approaches may cause bias in handling word‐ranking issues because they neither optimize the corpus nor integrally take words' frequency dispersion and concentration criteria into consideration. Thus, this paper develops a novel corpus‐based approach that combines a corpus software and Hirsch index (H‐index) algorithm to handle the aforementioned issues simultaneously, making word‐ranking processes more accurate. This paper compiled 100 COVID‐19‐related research articles as an empirical example of the target corpus. To verify the proposed approach, this study compared the results of two traditional frequency‐based approaches and the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can refine corpus and simultaneously compute words' frequency dispersion and concentration criteria in handling word‐ranking issues.","Chen, Liang‐Ching; Chang, Kuei‐Hu",,610,1

Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 ctp mutant, namely MR14, is known to cause cell wall defects and autolysis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ctp mutation–driven autolysis in regulating biofilms in A. baumannii and to evaluate the vesiculation caused by cell wall defects. We found that in A. baumannii, Ctp is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane, and loss of Ctp function enhances the biofilm-forming ability of A. baumannii. Quantification of the matrix components revealed that extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins were the chief constituents of MR14 biofilm, and the transmission electron microscopy further indicated the presence of numerous dead cells compared with ATCC 17978. The large number of MR14 dead cells is potentially the result of compromised outer membrane integrity, as demonstrated by its high sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). MR14 also exhibited the hypervesiculation phenotype, producing outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) of large mean size. The MR14 OMVs were more cytotoxic toward A549 cells than ATCC 17978 OMVs.

Pre‐existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension have a higher risk for severe illness, cardiac damage, and death. Therefore, strategies for cardiovascular protection in COVID‐19 are urgently needed, in addition to the development of vaccines against COVID‐19. Previously, it has been reported that several SARS‐CoV‐1 genes including encoded Envelope (E) protein, open reading frame (ORF) 3a, are capable of forming viral channels in mammalian cells and damaging the cells via activation of apoptotic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐1 patients are found to possess antibodies against ORF3a, indicating that this protein was expressed at the surface of the host cells. Moreover, a recent clinical report confirmed that SARS‐CoV‐2 can directly infect cardiomyocytes. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the linkage between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and cardiac risk are unclear. HYPOTHESIS: SARS‐CoV‐2 genes including ORF3a can be expressed in cardiomyocytes after virus infection, and subsequently dysregulate cardiac functions. METHODS: HEK293T cells and H9c2 cardiac myoblasts were transfected with ORF3a and utilized for biochemical, cell biological, and electrophysiological assays. Numerical model of rabbit ventricular action potential was used to evaluate the role of ORF3a on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia. RESULTS: Although ORF3a sequences from SARS‐CoV‐1 and ‐CoV‐2 have 72% similarity, ORF3a from SARS‐CoV‐2 maintains high homology with SARS‐CoV‐1 in the protein sequences of the transmembrane domains and the pore, which are critical for forming ion channels. We found that SARS‐CoV‐2‐ORF3a is expressed at plasma membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane as assessed by protein fractionation, mitochondrial digestion, and live‐cell imaging. Whole cell patch clamp revealed that ORF3a can form K(+)‐permeable channels at the plasma membrane with similar channel properties as the endogenous transient outward K(+) current (I(to)). Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that increased I(to) amplitude (mimicking increase of ORF3a expression) may dysregulate Ca(2+) transient and increase the risk for early afterdepolarization in response to increased heart rate. Lastly, we found that ORF3a promotes apoptotic signaling activation, but not ER stress signaling, assessed by caspase activity and the expression of major ER chaperones, respectively. CONCLUSION: ORF3a from SARS‐CoV‐2 forms K(+)‐permeable channels at the plasma membrane and dysregulates cardiac Ca(2+) handling and electrophysiology. ORF3a can also be expressed at the mitochondria and activate oxidative stress signaling, which exacerbates the risk of arrhythmia. Targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 viroporins including ORF3a may reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiac damage in COVID‐19 patients with pre‐existing CVDs.","Polina, Iuliia; Guo, Yugene; Jhun, Bong Sook; Tolkacheva, Elena; O‐Uchi, Jin",FASEB J,610,16

This contribution is possible through the multiactor value co-creation in the place. The aim of the article is to analyse the links between processes of co-creation of agricultural and gastronomic value through the integration of systems of production and gastronomy. Evidence is provided that food and agriculture are moving towards a holistic service logic integrating sector subsystems into broader inter-industrial ecosystems. The paradigm of Service-Dominant Logic offers a framework for analysing interactions between multiactor engagement processes, and food/gastronomy service linked to places and their cultural milieux. These complex processes of co-creation are mapped, then applied to the case of agriculture and gastronomy in the Basque Country in Spain. The Basque gastronomic co-creation brings together the rural context of smallholders, fishermen, or farmers, service providers, and the urban context of cities, with their circles of social interaction and events, where service users are largely concentrated. Crucial role in the system—as institutional innovators—is played by the Basque chefs who integrate the different aspects of food production and consumption.","Muñiz-Martinez, Norberto; Florek, Magdalena",Place Brand Public Dipl,610,21

Situational and dispositional factors were perceived to have similar impact as causes of overindebtedness, but non-overindebted consumers showed stronger agreement with those causes than overindebted consumers. Regarding attitudes, non-overindebted consumers tended to blame overindebted people for their situation rather than perceiving them as victims, whereas overindebted consumers showed the opposite pattern. Study 2 used a sample of (non-overindebted) consumers to assess the impact of perceived causes of overindebtedness, attitudes toward the overindebted, and political orientation on public support of government policies for aiding overindebted people.

The high unique advantage of the proposed sensor is based on the performance of the stable covalent immobilization of the AuNPs and enzymatically reduced half-IgG collagen I antibodies, which ensured their appropriate orientation onto the sensor’s surface, good stability, and sensitivity properties. The detection of collagen type I was performed in a concentration range from 1 to 5 pg/mL. Moreover, SPR was utilized to confirm the immobilization of the monoclonal half-antibodies and sensing of collagen I versus time. Furthermore, EIS experiments revealed a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.38 pg/mL. The selectivity of the performed immunosensor was confirmed by negligible responses for BSA. The performed approach of the immunosensor is a novel, innovative attempt that enables the detection of collagen I with very high sensitivity in the range of pg/mL, which is significantly lower than the commonly used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).","Gwiazda, Marcin; Bhardwaj, Sheetal K.; Kijeńska-Gawrońska, Ewa; Swieszkowski, Wojciech; Sivasankaran, Unni; Kaushik, Ajeet",Biosensors (Basel),610,1

Islands of the same archipelago have faced various challenges in terms of tourism growth and related impact. Primarily, tourism has been characterised by seasonality (the strong spatio-temporal concentration of tourists in a destination) especially in the most peripheral islands. In other cases, tourism has grown considerably resulting in overemphasis on mass tourism throughout part of the year. This is largely experienced due to Sand, Sun and Sea (3S) tourism. Fieldwork, including interviews with key stakeholders and ecotours off-season, was conducted in the Aegadian Archipelago, off the west coast of Sicily. Findings revealed that ecotourism not only is the preferred alternative form of tourism among stakeholders but is also possible and ideal as confirmed through the ecotours. This is because different ecotourism activities can be practised all year round, thus mitigating seasonality. In return, this can help ease the financial, social and environmental challenges associated with current tourism models improving the well-being of local communities. Marine ecotourism is considered as a means to give more value to marine protected areas and to make existing tourism activity in the peak season more sustainable.","Agius, Karl; Briguglio, Michael",Maritime Studies,610,22

However, not all students welcomed the emergency delivery of online courses. Consequently, some learners have been developing resistant practices to technology-driven learning, including being on mute and turning off cameras, but these silences, gaps and evasions are difficult to grasp through normative perspectives. Meanwhile, big tech continues to profit significantly from its encroachment on pedagogy. Conversely, we need alternate conceptions of learners’ varying responses to technologies. To develop a novel perspective, the study considers the Middle East’s traditional mashrabiyya windows, which are carved through an elaborate wooden latticework screen of geometric patterns and designed to deflect rather than let in the light. This mashrabiyya structure is applied as a theoretical metaphor to consider Arab women learners’ technological veiled affordances of filters, avatars and not replying. The mashrabiyya feminist postdigital framework develops unique inquiry into learners’ subtle practices; the authors’ self-reflexivity; and analysis of a (silent) email exchange and a Twitter avatar. Theorising suggests silences, invisibilities and disconnection are not necessarily a deficit but refractive responses enabling students and educators to stay below the radar.","Hurley, Zoë; Al-Ali, Khadija",Postdigit Sci Educ,610,1

We measured the following urinary and plasma biomarker levels of oxidative stress and antioxidants. As urinary biomarkers, (1) hexanoyl-lysine (HEL), which is a new biomarker of oxidative stress, (2) the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and (3) 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as a product of oxidative modifications to DNA; and the plasma levels of (4) the antioxidant protein superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is the crucial defense again oxygen reactive species, and (5) transferrin and (6) ceruloplasmin, which are biomarkers of iron and copper neurotransmission and oxidant-antioxidant systems. We examined the relationship between these urinary and plasma biomarkers and behavioral symptoms in 19 individuals with ASD (mean age, 10.8 ± 5.2 years) and 10 age-matched healthy controls (mean age, 14.2 ± 7.0 years). Behavioral symptoms were estimated using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Urinary TAC levels were significantly lower, whereas urinary HEL levels were significantly increased in the ASD group as compared with the control group. The five ABC subscale and total scores were significantly raised in the autism group than in the control group. The results of a linear regression analysis revealed that plasma SOD levels may be a more accurate predictor of differences in ABC scores between individuals with ASD and control individuals. The present study firstly revealed the important findings that the cooperation between the urinary antioxidant TAC and plasma SOD levels may contribute to the ABC subscale scores of stereotypy. Urinary TAC activity and antioxidant protein SOD may be associated with incomplete mineral body store and antioxidant-related transcription factor and browning reactions. Consequently, a critical imbalance between TAC urinary levels and plasma SOD levels may be an important contributor to autistic behavioral symptoms.","Imataka, George; Yui, Kunio; Shiko, Yuki; Kawasaki, Yohei; Sasaki, Hitomi; Shiroki, Ryoichi; Yoshihara, Shigemi",Front Psychiatry,610,20

Their qualification for this task is therefore of central importance in all phases of teacher training, especially since only about one third of teachers currently in active teaching service had learning opportunities for digitization-related competence building during their studies. Despite the desire for a digitization-related qualification, however, German teachers attend continuing education courses comparatively rarely. In addition to a lack of fit in the training offered, an insufficient offer could be responsible for this discrepancy. In this study, we investigate which in-service training courses were explicitly offered to science teachers via state in-service training catalogues in 12 of 16 German states, which competence areas of the orientation framework “Digitale Kompetenzen für das Lehramt in den Naturwissenschaften (DiKoLAN)” the in-service trainings address, and to what extent the didactic functions addressed in the in-service trainings could have supported teachers in providing distance learning during the 2020 school closures. A total of 90 in-service trainings are identified, too few to adequately address the objectives of the KMK strategy “Bildung in der digitalen Welt/Education in the Digital World”. The offers show little evidence of factors that enable individual teachers to build cumulative competence. Almost all of the in-service training offers address competence areas of the DiKoLAN orientation framework that are relevant for science teachers, and some of them are suitable for teaching teachers the didactic functions that can also be used in distance learning.","Diepolder, Charlotte; Weitzel, Holger; Huwer, Johannes; Lukas, Sarah",ZfDN,610,10

However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to explore the mechanism by which crizotinib targets NSCLC with ALK-rearrangement, mainly whether it is related to LINC01001 in regulating NSCLC progression via IGF2BP2/MYC axis. Methods: RT-qPCR is conducted to evaluate the mRNA levels of LINC01001, IGF2BP2 and MYC in A549/R and H1299/R cells. CCK-8 and EdU assays are performed to assess the viability and proliferation of A549/R and H1299/R cells. Western blot is conducted to measure the levels of PCNA and Ki-67 proteins in A549/R and H1299/R cells. FACs and TUNEL are performed to detect apoptosis of A549/R and H1299/R cells. Immunohistochemical staining is performed to assess the levels of Ki67 in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC tissue. Bioinformatics analysis of multiple CLIP (crosslinking-immunoprecipitation) data found potential binding sites between LINC01001 and IGF2BP2, IGF2BP2 and MYC, that are confirmed by RIP assay and RNA pulldown assay. Results: Our findings illustrated that LINC01001 is highly expressed in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells and associated with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients. Inhibition of LINC01001 depresses crizotinib resistance of NSCLC cells. LINC01001 interacts with IGF2BP2, and inhibition of IGF2BP2 depresses crizotinib resistance of NSCLC cells. IGF2BP2 interacts with the mRNA of MYC, and LINC01001 overexpression increases crizotinib resistance of NSCLC via MYC. Conclusion: LINC01001 promotes the progression of crizotinib-resistant NSCLC by modulating the IGF2BP2/MYC axis. Our research clarifies the specific mechanism of crizotinib-resistance in NSCLC treatment.","Zhang, Meiling; Wang, Qian; Ke, Zihao; Liu, Yijing; Guo, Huijin; Fang, Shencun; Lu, Kaihua",Front Pharmacol,610,8

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe a statewide vaccination program among incarcerated people and staff working in a prison setting. METHODS: Between December 2020 and February 2021, the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) offered the opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to all correctional staff and sentenced individuals. Two RIDOC public health educators provided education on the vaccine, answered questions, and obtained consent before the vaccine clinic day for the incarcerated group. All staff received information on signing up for vaccines and watched an educational video that was created by the medical director. Additional information regarding vaccine education and resources was sent via email to the entire RIDOC department. RESULTS: During this initial campaign, 76.4% (1106/1447) of sentenced individuals and 68.4% (1008/1474) of correctional staff accepted and received the vaccine. Four months after the first vaccine was offered, 77.7% (1124/1447) of the sentenced population and 69.6% (1026/1474) of staff were fully vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of vaccine implementation in a carceral setting.

While surgery forms the mainstay of treatment, evidence pertaining to the management of gastric cancer in the Western population in this age group is scarce. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted total and distal gastrectomies at our centre from 2005 to 2015. Patients aged 70 years or above were included in the elderly group. RESULTS A total of 60 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy over a 10-year period, with a predominance of male patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of overall surgical and non-surgical complications, in-hospital mortality, operation time and length of hospital stay, between the elderly and non-elderly groups. Univariate analysis, performed for risk factors relating to anastomotic leak and surgical complications, showed that age over 70 years and higher American Association of Anesthesiologists grades are associated with a higher, though not statistically significant, number of anastomotic leaks (P = 1.000 and P = 0.442, respectively) and surgical complications (P = 0.469 and P = 0.162, respectively). The recurrence rate within the first 3 years of surgery was significantly higher in the non-elderly group compared with the elderly group (Log Rank test, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups (Log Rank test, P = 0.619). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy is safe and feasible in an elderly population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A meta-analysis was performed by analyzing all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that compared SILA and CTLA for appendicitis in adults and children. These studies compared these two methods from different angles including outcomes of interest, patient characteristics, operative time, pain visual analogue scales scores (VAS scores), length of hospital stay, time to return to full activity, resumption of diet, postoperative complications and cosmetic results The risk ratios (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed to assess the outcome. RESULTS Seven recent RCTs encompassing 1170 patients (586 SILA and 584 CTLA cases) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that conversion rate, drain inserted, reoperation, length of hospital stay, resumption of normal diet and postoperative complications were statistically comparable between the two groups. The postoperative abdominal pain within 24 h was -0.57 in favor of the SILA technique (p = 0.05). Compared with CTLA, SILA showed a better cosmetic satisfaction score (SMD, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-0.83; p < 0.0001) and shorter time to recover normal activity (WMD, -0.69; 95% CI, -1.11-0.26; p = 0.001). However, SILA has a longer operative time (WMD, 5.38; 95% CI, 2.94-7.83; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, SILA was confirmed to be as safe and effective as CTLA. Despite the longer operative time, SILA has higher cosmetic satisfaction and shorter recovery time to normal activity.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Pathology, Combined Military Hospital, Multan, Pakistan, from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY Sixty-three cases of all ages admitted in Isolation ward, Combined Military Hospital, Multan with COVID-19 were included. Clinical features like fever, cough and shortness of breath were recorded. Blood sample was collected in plain tube for biochemical features like serum albumin, ferritin, AST, LDH, CRP and urea, which were analysed in Pathology Department of the Hospital. Association of the clinical features and these biochemical markers were determined. RESULTS In 63 patients, only one (1.6%) patient was between 1 to 12 years, 42 (66.7 %) belonged to 13 to 45 years while 20 (31.7%) patients were between 46 to 95 years. Mean age was 41.39+15.68 years. Forty-eight (76.2%) patients were males and 15 (23.8%) females. Thirteen (20.6%) patients presented with fever, 14 (22.2%) had productive cough and only 3 (4.8%) patients were aware of known history of contact. Median (IQR) value of serum ferritin, LDH, albumin, AST, CRP and urea were 176.5 (252) ng/ml, 284 (96) IU/L, 42 (7) g/L, 28 (22) U/L, 3.9 (11) mg/L and 4.25 (1.6) mmol/L, respectively.

We report a 6-year-old female with PHACE syndrome presented with left facial hemangiomas, cystic lesion in the cerebral posterior fossa, coarctation of the aorta, aplasia of the left vertebral artery and stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Surgical repair of the aorta with left heart bypass under beating heart was scheduled. We monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) with infrared spectroscopy in order to detect cerebral hypoperfusion. A decrease of rSO2 ipsilateral to the cerebrovascular anomalies occurred during anastomosis of the aorta, which was treated by reducing the flow rate of left heart bypass and by increasing the inhalational oxygen concentration. As children with PHACE syndrome are frequently accompanied with cerebrovascular anomalies and at a risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, prevention of cerebral hypoperfusion is crucially important during general anesthesia.","Imada, Tatsuyuki; Okutani, Ryu; Oda, Yutaka",Journal of anesthesia,610,26

This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of a novel surgical treatment for membranous tracheobronchomalacia. A consecutive series of patients with tracheobronchomalacia were treated with two to three holmium laser scarring surgeries of the hyperdynamic tracheal and bronchial walls for the purpose of stiffening them through fibrosis. Patients filled out a Dyspnea Index questionnaire before and after treatment. Ten patients were treated for their tracheobronchomalacia with a mean age of 54 years. Symptoms included severe dyspnea, dry cough, recurrent pulmonary infections, and respiratory failure. Fifty percent of patients presented with wheezing refractory to traditional treatment. Tracheobronchomalacia was associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 8), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 5), and tracheal stenosis (n = 3). Only 50 % of patients presented with morbid obesity. All cases showed significant improvement of their respiratory symptoms with a mean postoperative difference of 22.3 out of a maximum impairment score of 40 (P < 0.01) on the Dyspnea Index. The mean number of procedures was 2.3 per patient with the average laser energy delivered per procedure of 1600 J.

This was achieved using Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEL), a lectin widely used in monitoring cancer. Four small identical LEL columns were coupled in series to form a single affinity chromatography system with the last in the series connected to an absorbance detector. The serial affinity column set (SACS) was then loaded with human plasma proteins. At the completion of loading, the column set was disassembled, the four columns were eluted individually, the captured proteins were trypsin digested, the peptides were deglycosylated with PNGase F, and the parent proteins were identified through mass spectral analyses. Significantly different sets of glycoproteins were selected by each column, some proteins appearing to be exclusively bound to the first column while others were bound further along in the series. Clearly, sample displacement chromatography (SDC) occurs. Glycoproteins were bound at different places in the column train, identifying the presence of glycoforms with different affinity on a single glycoprotein. It is not possible to see these phenomena in the single column mode of chromatography. Moreover, low abundance proteins were enriched, which facilitates detection. The great advantage of this method is that it differentiates between glycoproteins on the basis of their binding affinity. Displacement phenomena are concluded to be a significant component of the separation mechanism in heavily loaded lectin affinity chromatography columns. This further suggests that care must be exercised in sample loading of lectin columns to prevent analyte displacement with nonretained proteins.","Cho, Wonryeon",Analytical chemistry,610,27

Recently, two single-incision platforms, robotic and SPIDER, have attempted to ameliorate such problems. This study aimed to compare three different techniques of single-incision cholecystectomy: standard laparoscopic, robotic, and SPIDER approaches. METHODS The authors retrospectively collected data from their first 166 single-incision robotic cholecystectomies (SIRCs) and compared the findings with the data from their first 166 SILCs and the first 166 s-generation SPIDER procedures. All the SILCs were performed with three trocars placed in one umbilical incision and with gallbladder retraction using a Prolene stitch on the right upper quadrant. All the robotic cases were managed using the da Vinci Single-Site Surgical System, and all the SPIDER procedures were performed using the SPIDER Surgical System. RESULTS The SILC, SIRC, and SPIDER groups consisted respectively of 129 (76.3%), 131 (78.9%), and 136 (81.9%) women with the respective mean ages of 44.5 ± 14.3, 51.6 ± 15.9, and 46.4 ± 15.2 years. The mean body mass indexes (BMIs) were respectively 29.1 ± 5.6, 29.4 ± 6.2, and 27.5 ± 4.8 kg/m(2), and the mean surgical times were 37.1 ± 13.3, 63.0 ± 25.2, and 52.8 ± 18.7 min. The total hospital stays were respectively 1.3 ± 5.3, 1.2 ± 2.2, and 1.5 ± 2.6 days, and complications were seen respectively in three SILC cases (1.8%), three SIRC cases (1.8%), and two SPIDER cases (1.2%). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study demonstrate similar results among the three platforms for most of the parameters measured. The SILC procedure appears to be superior to SIRC and SPIDER in terms of surgical time, but selection bias could be the cause. The SILS, SIRC, and SPIDER procedures all are similar in terms of complication profile. It can be concluded that SILC, SIRC, and SPIDER all are feasible and safe alternatives when used for single-incision cholecystectomy.","Gonzalez, Anthony Michael; Rabaza, Jorge Rafael; Donkor, Charan; Romero, Rey Jesús; Kosanovic, Radomir; Verdeja, Juan Carlos",Surgical endoscopy,610,1

Goal of this study was to analyze the incidence of this phenomenon and its evolution on follow-up imaging. METHODS One hundred fifty-two patients in our database of 949 patients, who were treated for acute stroke between January 2010 and January 2015, fulfilled the inclusion criteria of (a) EST for an acute stroke in the anterior circulation, (b) an ASPECT-score < 10 on pre-interventional CT, and (c) postinterventional CT imaging within 4.5 h after the procedure. Two independent reviewers analyzed imaging data of these patients. RESULTS Transformation of brain areas from hypoattenuated on pre-interventional CT to isodense on postinterventional CT was seen in 37 patients in a total of 49 ASPECTS areas (Cohen's kappa 0.819; p < 0.001). In 17 patients, the previously hypoattenuated brain areas became isodense, but appeared swollen. In 20 patients (13%), the previously hypodense brain area could not be distinguished from normal brain parenchyma. On follow-up imaging, all isodense brain areas showed signs of infarction. CONCLUSION Pseudo-normalization of infarct hypoattenuation on postinterventional CT is not infrequent. It is most likely caused by contrast leakage in infarcted parenchyma and does not represent salvage of ischemic brain parenchyma.","Dekeyzer, Sven; Reich, Arno; Othman, Ahmed E; Wiesmann, Martin; Nikoubashman, Omid",Neuroradiology,610,1

Physiologically speaking, a balance between the vasodeleterious (Angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/Angiotensin II [Ang II]/Ang II type 1 receptor [AT1R]) and vasoprotective (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]/Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]/Mas receptor [MasR]) components of the RAS is critical for cardiopulmonary homeostasis. Upregulation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis shifts the system toward vasoconstriction, proliferation, hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis, all factors that contribute to the development and progression of cardiopulmonary diseases. Conversely, stimulation of the vasoprotective ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis produces a counter-regulatory response that promotes cardiovascular health. Current research is investigating novel strategies to augment actions of the vasoprotective RAS components, particularly ACE2, in order to treat various pathologies. Although multiple approaches to increase the activity of ACE2 have displayed beneficial effects against experimental disease models, the mechanisms behind its protective actions remain incompletely understood. Recent work demonstrating a non-catalytic role for ACE2 in amino acid transport in the gut has led us to speculate that the therapeutic effects of ACE2 can be mediated, in part, by its actions on the gastrointestinal tract and/or gut microbiome. This is consistent with emerging data which suggest that dysbiosis of the gut and lung microbiomes is associated with cardiopulmonary disease. This review highlights new developments in the protective actions of ACE2 against cardiopulmonary disorders, discusses innovative approaches to targeting ACE2 for therapy, and explores an evolving role for gut and lung microbiota in cardiopulmonary health.","Cole-Jeffrey, Colleen T; Liu, Meng; Katovich, Michael J; Raizada, Mohan K; Shenoy, Vinayak",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,610,1

Sixty-two and 82 hernias were operated on in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups, respectively. Postoperative complications, recurrence, and patient satisfaction levels were evaluated. RESULTS One hernia in the slit mesh group (1/62, 1.6%) and one in the non-slit mesh group (1/82, 1.2%) developed recurrence (P = 1.00). The incidence of postoperative neuralgia was 4/62 (6.5%) and 7/82 (8.5%) in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups, respectively (P = 0.76). Satisfaction rates in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups were similar at 60/62 (96.8%) and 80/82 (97.6%), respectively (P = 1.00). CONCLUSION No significant differences in outcomes were found between slit and non-slit mesh placement.

That is, the current density is gradually reduced in a fixed degradation time, and the Reactive Blue 19 simulated dye wastewater was used as the degradation target. The general applicability of the process was further confirmed by studying the optimal gradient current density output parameters, the dye concentration, electrolyte concentration and other dye compounds with different molecular structures. The corresponding results show that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (78%) and the color removal (100%) under the GOP are similar to those in the COP, and the overall energy consumption is reduced by about 50% compared with that in the traditional constant current mode. Moreover, the current efficiency in the middle and late stages of EO process has increased by 8.6 times compared with COP.","Liu, Ting; Miao, Dongtian; Liu, Guoshuai; Wei, Qiuping; Zhou, Kechao; Yu, Zhiming; Ma, Li",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,610,16

In this study, the ex vivo metabolic characteristics of porcine donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver in short-term perfusion using whole or diluted blood were compared with those of the in vivo transplanted state to evaluate their initial response to resuscitation. Methods The porcine DCD model was constructed by clamping the thoracic aorta. After 60 min of blood flow cessation, retrieved livers were flushed with 500 mL of heparin saline (20 000 IU/L) followed by perfusion with 500 mL of cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution. The liver grafts were immersed in cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 60 min. Subsequently, normothermic ex vivo perfusion was performed with 20 000 IU/L of heparin added to the collected blood (whole blood group) or medium mixed with 10% whole blood (dilution group) for 3 h. Blood from the portal vein, the hepatic artery, and infra hepatica inferior vena cava was collected hourly and metabolomic analyses were performed. The other liver graft was heterotopically transplanted as a control (in vivo group). Each experiment was conducted once. Results The guanosine levels demonstrated similar fluctuating trends in the whole blood and in vivo groups. In contrast, the levels increased during the perfusion in the diluted blood group. Fluctuations in choline metabolism demonstrated similar trends in the whole blood and in vivo groups. Conclusions Ex vivo machine perfusion with whole blood over a short time resulted in a metabolic trend similar to that in the in vivo model.

The abilities of platelets and keratinocytes may be harnessed in order to stimulate wound healing through the formation of platelet clots, the release of several growth factors and cytokines, and cell proliferation. The aim of the study was to test whether autologous keratinocyte suspensions in platelet concentrate would improve wound healing. The study was conducted at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland in 45 patients, randomized to three different topical treatment groups: standard treatment serving as control, autologous platelet concentrate (PC) and keratinocytes suspended in autologous platelet concentrate (PC + K). Split thickness skin graft donor sites were chosen on the anterolateral thighs of patients undergoing plastic surgery for a variety of defects. Wound healing was assessed by the duration and quality of the healing process. Pain intensity was evaluated at day five. RESULTS Healing time was reduced from 13.9 ± 0.5 days (mean ± SEM) in the control group to 7.2 ± 0.2 days in the PC group (P < 0.01). An addition of keratinocytes in suspension further reduced the healing time to 5.7 ± 0.2 days. Pain was reduced in both the PC and PC + K groups. Data showed a statistically detectable advantage of using PC + K over PC alone (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The results demonstrate the positive contribution of autologous platelets combined with keratinocytes in stimulating wound healing and reducing pain. This strikingly simple approach could have a significant impact on patient care, especially critically burned victims for whom time is of the essence.

Here, we present the five-yr follow-up data. METHODS PROTECT was a randomized controlled study in which LTxR received basiliximab and CNI-based immunosuppression ± corticosteroids. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive EVR or continue CNI. Patients completing the core study could enter the extension study on their randomized treatment. RESULTS A total of 81 patients entered the extension study (41, EVR; 40, CNI).

We hypothesized that acute SAL intake would induce changes in cerebral responses during exercise, with significant improvement in cerebral oxygenation and voluntary activation (VA) contributing to an increase in muscle performance. METHODS Fourteen trained male subjects (25 ± 5 yr) performed repeated isometric knee extensions until task failure (TF) after 4 mg (oral) SAL, 800 μg (inhaled) SAL, or placebo intake. VA, corticospinal excitability, and inhibition assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation and changes in hemoglobin concentrations assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy were measured before and during the fatiguing task. RESULTS SAL had no significant effect both at rest and during exercise on prefrontal cortex oxygenation (e.g., changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration at TF: 11.4 ± 11.1 (4 mg SAL) vs 10.4 ± 10.6 (800 μg SAL) vs 10.8 ± 8.1 μmol (placebo); P = 0.314) and neuromuscular function (e.g., VA measured by TMS at TF: 90.2% ± 6.6% vs 92.6% ± 5.0% vs 90.1% ± 7.0%; P = 0.760). SAL had no effect on the number of contractions until TF (95 ± 51 vs 100 ± 52 vs 93 ± 47; P = 0.629).

Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia is associated with postoperative complications and remains common despite the use of effective and safe warming devices. This study aimed to measure the impact of targeted audit and feedback on anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management and subsequent patient outcomes. METHODS This study was a three-arm cluster randomized-controlled trial. Anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management performance was analyzed in two phases. The first was a baseline phase with audit but no feedback for eight months, followed by an intervention phase over the next seven-month period after participants had received interventions according to their randomized group allocation of no feedback (control), benchmarked feedback, or ranked feedback. Anesthesiologists' percentage of hypothermic patients at the end of surgery (primary endpoint) and use of a warming device were compared among the groups. RESULTS Forty-five attending anesthesiologists who took care of 7,846 patients over 15 months were included. The odds of hypothermia (temperature < 36°C at the end of surgery) increased significantly from pre- to post-intervention in the control and ranked groups (control odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.56; P = 0.02; ranked OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.56; P = 0.04) but not in the benchmarked group (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.28; P = 0.58). Between-arm differences in pre- to post-intervention changes were not significant (benchmark vs control OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.10; P = 0.19; ranked vs control OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.33, P = 0.94). No significant overall effect on intraoperative warmer use change was detected. CONCLUSION We found no evidence to suggest that audit and feedback, using benchmarked or ranked feedback, is more effective than no feedback at all to change anesthesiologists' intraoperative temperature management performance. Feedback may need to be included in a bundle to produce its effect. TRIALS REGISTRATION www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02414191).

Comprehensive analysis of this unprecedented outbreak may help to fight against the disease and may play a pivotal role in decreasing the mortality rate linked with it. Papain like protease (PLpro), a multifunctional polyprotein facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and evades it from the host immunological response by antagonizing cytokines, interferons and may be considered as potential drug target to combat the current pandemic. METHODS Natural moieties obtained from medicinal plants were analysed for their potency to target PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking study and were compared with synthetic analogs named as remdesivir, chloroquine and favipiravir. The stability of complexes of top hits was analysed by MD Simulation and interaction energy was calculated. Furthermore, average RMSD values were computed and deepsite ligand binding pockets were predicted using Play Molecule. Drug like abilities of these moieties were determined using ADMET and bond distance between the ligand and active site was assessed to predict the strength of interaction. RESULTS Nimbocinol (-7.6 Kcal/mol) and sage (-7.3 Kcal/mol) exhibited maximum BA against PLpro SARS-CoV-2 as evident from molecular docking study which was found to be even better than remdesivir (-6.1 Kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.3 Kcal/mol) and favipiravir (-5.7 Kcal/mol). Both nimbocinol-PLpro and sage-PLpro SARS-CoV-2 complex exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310 K and potential, kinetic and electrostatic interaction energies were computed which was observed to be concordant with results of molecular docking study. RMSD average values were found to be 0.496 ± 0.015 Å and 0.598 ± 0.023 Å for nimbocinol and sage respectively thus revealing that both the deviation and fluctuations during MD Simulation were observed to be least. Deepsite prediction disclosed that both compounds occupied cryptic pockets in receptor and non-bond distance analysis revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds during ligand-receptor interaction. ADMET exploration further validated the drug like properties of these compounds. CONCLUSION Present study revealed that active constituents of Azadirachta indica and Salvia officinalis can be potentially used to target SARS-CoV-2 by hindering its replication process.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Mittal, Rashmi; Arya, Vedpriya",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,610,29

OBJECTIVE To compare the remission of T2DM following surgical and nonsurgical treatments. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from October 1, 2009, to June 26, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, outcomes were assessed 3 years after treating 61 obese participants aged 25 to 55 years with T2DM. Analysis was conducted with an intent-to-treat population. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention for 1 year followed by a low-level lifestyle intervention for 2 years or surgical treatments (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [LAGB]) followed by low-level lifestyle intervention in years 2 and 3. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end points were partial and complete T2DM remission and secondary end points included diabetes medications and weight change. RESULTS Body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was less than 35 for 26 participants (43%), 50 (82%) were women, and 13 (21%) were African American. Mean (SD) values were 100.5 (13.7) kg for weight, 47.3 (6.6) years for age, 7.8% (1.9%) for hemoglobin A1c level, and 171.3 (72.5) mg/dL for fasting plasma glucose level. Partial or complete T2DM remission was achieved by 40% (n = 8) of RYGB, 29% (n = 6) of LAGB, and no intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention participants (P = .004). The use of diabetes medications was reduced more in the surgical groups than the lifestyle intervention-alone group, with 65% of RYGB, 33% of LAGB, and none of the intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention participants going from using insulin or oral medication at baseline to no medication at year 3 (P < .001). Mean (SE) reductions in percentage of body weight at 3 years were the greatest after RYGB at 25.0% (2.0%), followed by LAGB at 15.0% (2.0%) and lifestyle treatment at 5.7% (2.4%) (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among obese participants with T2DM, bariatric surgery with 2 years of an adjunctive low-level lifestyle intervention resulted in more disease remission than did lifestyle intervention alone.

However, due to their strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical studies often do not address challenges presented by non-trial populations. AREAS COVERED This review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of ICIs in trial-ineligible patients, including those with autoimmune disease, chronic viral infections, organ transplants, organ dysfunction, poor performance status, brain metastases, as well as the elderly, children and those who are pregnant. In addition, we review data concerning other real-world challenges with ICIs, including timing of therapy switch, relationships to radiotherapy or surgery, re-treatment after an immune-related toxicity, vaccinations in patients on ICIs, and current experience around ICI and COVID-19. Where possible, we provide recommendations to aid the often-difficult decision-making process in those settings. CONCLUSIONS Data suggest ICI are often active and have acceptable safety profile in the populations described above, with the exception of PD-1 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients. Decisions about whether to treat with ICIs should be personalised and require multidisciplinary input and careful counselling of patients with respect to potential risks and benefits. Clinical judgements need to be carefully weighed, considering factors such as underlying cancer type, feasibility of alternative treatment options, or activity in trial-eligible patients.","Rzeniewicz, K; Larkin, J; Menzies, A M; Turajlic, S",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,610,27

Viral infections were detected by the use of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on pharyngeal swabs. During a 12-month period pharyngeal swabs were obtained in 136 exacerbations of 63 patients. In 35 exacerbations (25.7%) a viral infection was detected. Most viral infections occurred in the winter (n = 14, 40.0%), followed by summer (n = 9, 25.7%), autumn (n = 6, 17.1%), and spring (n = 6, 17.1%). Rhinovirus was the most frequently isolated virus (n = 19, 51.4%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (n = 6, 16.2%), human metapneumovirus (n = 5, 13.5%), influenza A (n = 4, 10.8%), parainfluenza 4 (n = 2, 5.4%), and parainfluenza 3 (n = 1, 2.7%).

Many researchers are in search for simple and realistic models to manage preventive resources and implement effective measures against hazardous circumstances. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the fact about deficiencies in health resource planning of some countries having relatively high case count and death toll. A unique epidemic model incorporating stochastic processes and queuing theory is presented, which was evaluated by computer simulation using pre-processed data obtained from an urban clinic providing family health services. Covid-19 data from a local corona-center was used as the initial model parameters (e.g. R0, infection rate, local population size, number of contacts with infected individuals, and recovery rate). A long-run trend analysis for 1 year was simulated. The results fit well to the current case data of the sample corona center. Effective preventive and reactive resource planning basically depends on accurately designed models, tools, and techniques needed for the prediction of feature threats, risks, and mitigation costs. In order to sufficiently analyze the transmission and recovery dynamics of epidemics it is important to choose concise mathematical models. Hence, a unique stochastic modeling approach tied to queueing theory and computer simulation has been chosen. The methods used here can also serve as a guidance for accurate modeling and classification of stages (or compartments) of epidemics in general.","Kondakci, Suleyman; Kondakci, Dilek Doruk",Science progress,610,1

We found that student participation dropped significantly in moving online, but instructors were able to implement new teaching strategies to increase participation. We document seven concrete strategies that instructors used to promote equitable participation in their online classes and that can be incorporated by biology educators into their online teaching. The strategies were: 1) re-establishing norms, 2) using student names, 3) using breakout rooms, 4) leveraging chat-based participation, 5) using polling software, 6) creating an inclusive curriculum, and 7) cutting content to maintain rigor.

It can be associated with several comorbidities, in particular developmental disabilities (DD). In Emilia-Romagna (ER), a region in Northern Italy, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide the diagnostic framework and treatment for these conditions. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss, both isolated or in association with comorbidities, in the juvenile population. The study draws its data from the ER Childhood and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Information System (SINPIAER), an Administrative Healthcare Database collecting the clinical data of all those who have attended CAMHS since 2010. The most frequent type of hearing loss was bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which was present in 69-72% of the cases, while bilateral conductive hearing loss was the second most common type, ranging from 8 to 10%. Among DD, congenital malformations, mental retardation, visual impairment, and cerebral palsy were the most common. In particular, autism spectrum disorders show increasing incidence and prevalence among CAMHS users in ER region. In-depth knowledge of hearing loss epidemiology and related conditions, such as developmental disabilities, in the juvenile population is crucial for disease prevention, health planning, and resource allocation.","Genovese, Elisabetta; Palma, Silvia; Polizzi, Valeria; Bianchin, Giovanni; Cappai, Michela; Kaleci, Shaniko; Martini, Alessandro; Ciorba, Andrea; Stagi, Paolo",Audiology research,610,24

Recent advances had focused on reducing risk of renal damage by shortening the warm ischaemia time. These techniques included unclamped excision, selective arterial clamping and improved renorrhaphy methods. Operative times and warm ischaemia times have also improved once the learning curve are overcome, which is less steep than conventional laparoscopy. With longer follow-up and more widespread experience, the outcome of RLPN could be favourable compared to conventional laparoscopy. Improving techniques had made this surgery a safe and efficacious treatment option for small renal masses.","Png, Keng-Siang; Sundaram, Chandru P",Indian journal of surgical oncology,610,1

It is also the ubiquitous component in the alloys used to manufacture intracranial devices for aneurysm treatments, including aneurysm clips, self-expanding stents, flow-diverting stents, and endosaccular occlusion devices. Adverse events related to nickel allergy after deployment of such devices are uncommon but can be severe, resulting in dilemmas in the choice of treatment strategies and devices in managing nickel-sensitive patients with intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies reporting on nickel-related adverse events in patients being treated for cerebral aneurysm. The materials of the culprit devices, clinical presentation, histological features, and treatments were reviewed. Clinical considerations and management options for nickel allergy patients were evaluated. RESULTS Nickel is a major component of the cobalt alloy used in aneurysm clips and also of nitinol, which is commonly used in flow diverters and intracranial stents. Our literature review identified 9 articles reporting 10 unique cases of nickel-related adverse events after aneurysm treatment. Five of the cases occurred after aneurysm clipping, and the other 5 were attributed to endovascular devices. Two patients presented with dermatologic manifestations and 8 with neurologic manifestations, including cerebral edema and cerebritis. CONCLUSIONS Neurologic complications related to nickel in cerebral aneurysm treatments are rare but remain concern owing to the high prevalence of nickel allergy in the population. Surgeons and interventionists should consider the metal allergy history and its potential clinical significance in managing nickel-allergic patients with aneurysms.","Tsang, Anderson Chun On; Nicholson, Patrick; Pereira, Vitor Mendes",World neurosurgery,610,16

This study examines these effects with common face masks, namely a neck gaiter, disposable surgical mask, and N95 mask, as well as a novel material that could be used as a mask (acoustic foam). A recorded excerpt from the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" was played through a miniature speaker placed inside the mouth of a masked manikin. Experienced listeners were asked to rate perceptual qualities of these singing stimuli by blindly comparing them with the same recording captured without a mask. Acoustic analysis showed that face masks affected the sound by enhancing or suppressing different frequency bands compared to no mask. Acoustic energy around the singer's formant was reduced when using surgical and N95 masks, which matches observations that these masks are more detrimental to the perceptions of singing voice compared with neck gaiter or acoustic foam. It suggests that singers can benefit from masks designed for minimal impact on auditory perception of the singing voice while maintaining reasonable efficacy of filtering efficiency.","Oren, Liran; Rollins, Michael; Gutmark, Ephraim; Howell, Rebecca",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,610,23

OBJECTIVE To report retrospectively analyzed results of endovascular aneurysm treatment comparing stent-assisted coiling with coiling without stents at our hospital from 2005 to 2009. METHODS In this retrospectively reviewed case series, aneurysms were grouped as intent-to-treat or initially treated with stent-assisted coiling (A) vs coiling alone (B) or as-treated-those that ultimately received a stent (C) or not (D). Complication and occlusion rates were compared between groups. Some patients crossed from group B to C after receiving stent placement at a later treatment following the initial therapeutic modality (without a stent). RESULTS In 459 patients, 489 aneurysms were treated by group as follows: A = 181, B = 308, C = 225, and D = 264. In stent groups (A and C), there were significantly lower frequencies of ruptured aneurysms (A vs B = 11% vs 62%, P < .001; C vs D = 20.4% vs 62.5%, P < .001) and more giant aneurysms (A vs B = 7.3% vs 1.0%, P = .001; C vs D = 5.9% vs 1.1%, P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in permanent event-related morbidity (A vs B = 4.4% vs 4.2%, P = 1.0; C vs D = 4.4% vs 4.2%, P = 1.0).

Differences in disease processes are closely related to genetic variation in the envelope (env) region of the genome of six defined subgroups. The primary hosts of FeLV are domestic cats of the Felis genus that also harbor endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) elements stably integrated in their genomes. EnFeLV elements display 86% nucleotide identity to exogenous, horizontally transmitted FeLV (FeLV-A). Variation between enFeLV and FeLV-A is primarily in the long terminal repeat (LTR) and env regions, which potentiates generation of the FeLV-B recombinant subgroup during natural infection. The aim of this study was to examine recombination behavior of exogenous FeLV (exFeLV) and enFeLV in a natural FeLV epizootic. We previously described that of 65 individuals in a closed colony, 32 had productive FeLV-A infection, and 22 of these individuals had detectable circulating FeLV-B. We cloned and sequenced the env gene of FeLV-B, FeLV-A, and enFeLV spanning known recombination breakpoints and examined between 1-13 clones in 22 animals with FeLV-B to assess sequence diversity and recombination breakpoints. Our analysis revealed that FeLV-A circulating in the population, as well as enFeLV env sequences, are highly conserved. We documented many recombination breakpoints resulting in the production of unique FeLV-B genotypes. More than half of the cats harbored more than one FeLV-B variant, suggesting multiple recombination events between enFeLV and FeLV-A. We concluded that FeLV-B was predominantly generated de novo within each host, though we could not definitively rule out horizontal transmission, as nearly all cats harbored FeLV-B sequences that were genetically highly similar to those identified in other individual. This work represents a comprehensive analysis of endogenous-exogenous retroviral interactions with important insights into host-viral interactions that underlie disease pathogenesis in a natural setting. Importance Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a felid retrovirus with a variety of disease outcomes. Exogenous FeLV-A is the virus subgroup almost exclusively transmitted between cats. Recombination between FeLV-A and endogenous FeLV analogues in the cat genome may result in emergence of largely replication-defective, but highly virulent subgroups. FeLV-B is formed when the 3' envelope (env) region of endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) recombines with that of the exogenous FeLV (exFeLV) during viral reverse transcription and integration. Both domestic cats and wild relatives of the Felis genus harbor enFeLV, which has been shown to limit FeLV-A disease outcome. However, enFeLV also contributes genetic material to the recombinant FeLV-B subgroup. This study evaluates endogenous-exogenous recombination outcomes in a naturally infected closed-colony of cats to determine mechanisms and risk of endogenous retroviral recombination during exogenous virus exposure that leads to enhanced virulence. While FeLV-A and enFeLV env regions were highly conserved from cat to cat, nearly all individuals with emergent FeLV-B had unique combinations of genotypes, representative of a wide range of recombination sites within env. The findings provide insight into unique recombination patterns for emergence of new pathogens and can be related to similar viruses across species.","Erbeck, Katelyn; Gagne, Roderick B; Kraberger, Simona; Chiu, Elliott S; Roelke-Parker, Melody; VandeWoude, Sue",Journal of virology,610,1

Numerous studies have reported volatile anesthesia-induced attenuation of inflammatory responses in such scenarios. If the effect also extends to clinical outcome is yet undetermined. We hypothesized that volatile anesthesia is superior to intravenous anesthesia regarding postoperative complications. METHODS Five centers in Switzerland participated in the randomized controlled trial. Patients scheduled for lung surgery with one-lung ventilation were randomly assigned to one of two parallel arms to receive either propofol or desflurane as general anesthetic. Patients and surgeons were blinded to group allocation. Time to occurrence of the first major complication according to the Clavien-Dindo score was defined as primary (during hospitalization) or secondary (6-month follow-up) endpoint. Cox regression models were used with adjustment for prestratification variables and age. RESULTS Of 767 screened patients, 460 were randomized and analyzed (n = 230 for each arm). Demographics, disease and intraoperative characteristics were comparable in both groups. Incidence of major complications during hospitalization was 16.5% in the propofol and 13.0% in the desflurane groups (hazard ratio for desflurane vs. propofol, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.22; P = 0.24). Incidence of major complications within 6 months from surgery was 40.4% in the propofol and 39.6% in the desflurane groups (hazard ratio for desflurane vs. propofol, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.28; P = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial addressing the effect of volatile versus intravenous anesthetics on major complications after lung surgery. No difference between the two anesthesia regimens was evident.","Beck-Schimmer, Beatrice; Bonvini, John M; Braun, Julia; Seeberger, Manfred; Neff, Thomas A; Risch, Tobias J; Stüber, Frank; Vogt, Andreas; Weder, Walter; Schneiter, Didier; Filipovic, Miodrag; Puhan, Milo",Anesthesiology,610,5

The analysis data of the pathological and anatomical changes in 57 deaths from COVID-19 in hospitals and 74 forensic medical examinations where infectious pathology was established as the main cause of death are presented. For microscopy the sections were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin, OCG, immunohistochemical study with markers for CD3, CD 4, CD 20, SK-7. The mixed viral and bacterial lesions of the lungs were detected more often than pure viral infection in those who died suddenly from COVID-19 compared with people whose death occurred in medical facilities. This allows speaking about the lack of adequate antibiotic therapy out-patiently. Features of mononuclear lung infiltration in COVID-19 with a predominance of a moderately pronounced reaction of T-lymphocytes and a mild B-lymphocytic reaction indicate a decrease in immunological reactivity. Conducting clinical and anatomical analysis allows determining the features of pathogenesis and morphogenesis in each specific fatal case and informing the clinicians of health facilities (clinics and hospitals) allows the autopsy doctor (pathologist, forensic physician) to provide significant assistance in improving the quality of diagnosis and treatment of patients with this highly contagious severe viral disease.","Savchenko, S V; Gritsinger, V A; Tikhonov, V V; Lamanov, A N; Novoselov, V P; Koshlyak, D A",Sudebno-meditsinskaia ekspertiza,610,7

Prior observational studies comparing IBD characteristics between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (NHW) have yielded mixed results. AIMS We performed a meta-analysis of observational studies examining IBD phenotype in Hispanics compared to NHW. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of US-based studies comparing IBD subtype (Ulcerative Colitis: UC or Crohn's disease: CD) and phenotype (disease location and behavior) between Hispanics and NHW. We evaluated differences in age at IBD diagnosis, the presence of family history and smoking history. A random effects model was chosen ""a priori."" Categorical and continuous variables were analyzed using odds ratio (OR) or standard mean difference (SMD), respectively. RESULTS Seven studies were included with 687 Hispanics and 1586 NHW. UC was more common in Hispanics compared to NHW (OR 2.07, CI 1.13-3.79, p = 0.02). Location of disease was similar between Hispanics and NHW except for the presence of upper gastrointestinal CD, which was less common in Hispanics (OR 0.58, CI 0.32-1.06, p = 0.07). Hispanics were less likely to smoke (OR 0.48, CI 0.26-0.89, p = 0.02) or have a family history of IBD (OR 0.35, CI 0.22-0.55, p < 0.001). CD behavior classified by Montreal classification and age at IBD diagnosis were similar between Hispanics and NHW. CONCLUSION UC was more common among US Hispanics compared to NHW. Age at IBD diagnosis is similar for both Hispanics and NHW. For CD, disease behavior is similar, but Hispanics show a trend for less upper gastrointestinal involvement. A family history of IBD and smoking history were less common in Hispanics.","Avalos, Danny J; Mendoza-Ladd, Antonio; Zuckerman, Marc J; Bashashati, Mohammad; Alvarado, Andres; Dwivedi, Alok; Damas, Oriana M",Digestive diseases and sciences,610,1

We propose a scalable, easily modulated and live assistive technology system, based on a comfortable smart footwear capable of detecting walking behaviour, in order to prevent possible health problems in the elderly, facilitating their urban life as independently and safety as possible. This brings with it the challenge of handling the large amounts of data generated, transmitting and pre-processing that information and analysing it with the aim of obtaining useful information in real/near-real time. This is the basis of information theory. This work presents a complete system aiming at elderly people that can detect different user behaviours/events (sitting, standing without imbalance, standing with imbalance, walking, running, tripping) through information acquired from 20 types of sensor measurements (16 piezoelectric pressure sensors, one accelerometer returning reading for the 3 axis and one temperature sensor) and warn the relatives about possible risks in near-real time. For the detection of these events, a hierarchical structure of cascading binary models is designed and applied using artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms and deep learning techniques. The best models are achieved with convolutional layered ANN and multilayer perceptrons. The overall event detection performance achieves an average accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.84 and 0.96, respectively.","Aznar-Gimeno, Rocío; Labata-Lezaun, Gorka; Adell-Lamora, Ana; Abadía-Gallego, David; Del-Hoyo-Alonso, Rafael; González-Muñoz, Carlos",Entropy,610,24

Apart from the risk of intestinal damage following adhesiolysis, to date no information is available on the best way of preventing the formation of new adhesions in the vicinity of the implanted meshes. Numerous experimental investigations, mainly conducted on an open small-animal model, have demonstrated the advantages of coating meshes, inter alia with absorbable materials, compared with uncoated polypropylene meshes. In our established laparoscopic porcine model we set about investigating three of these meshes, which are already available on the market. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 18 domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic surgery and three different composite meshes were tested in each case on six animals (Dynamesh IPOM, Proceed, Parietene Composite). At 4 months, postmortem diagnostic laparoscopy was carried out, followed by full-wall excision of the specimens. Planimetric analysis was conducted to investigate the size of the entire surface area and the extent of adhesions. Histological investigations were performed on five sections for each specimen. These focused on the partial volumes of inflammatory cells, the proliferation marker Ki67, apoptotic index, inflammatory cell marker CD68 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) as a marker of the extracellular matrix. RESULTS A similar value of 14% was obtained for shrinkage of Dynamesh IPOM and Parietene Composite, while Proceed showed a 25% reduction in its surface area. Markedly lower values of 12.8% were obtained for Parietene Composite in respect of adhesions to the greater omentum, compared with 31.7% for Proceed and 33.2% for Dynamesh IPOM (p = 0.01). Overall, Parietene Composite performed best in the histological and immunhistochemistry tests. CONCLUSIONS On the whole, all composite meshes showed evidence of good biocompatibility. However, none of the coatings was completely able to prevent adhesions. Coating of polypropylene meshes with collagen appears to confer significant advantages compared with other coatings.","Schug-Pass, Christine; Sommerer, Florian; Tannapfel, Andrea; Lippert, Hans; Köckerling, Ferdinand",Surgical endoscopy,610,17

Increasing AMR and a dry pipeline of novel antimicrobial drugs have put AMR in the international spotlight. One strategy to combat AMR is to reduce antimicrobial drug consumption. Governments around the world have been experimenting with different policy interventions, such as regulating where antimicrobials can be sold, restricting the use of last-resort antimicrobials, funding AMR stewardship programs, and launching public awareness campaigns. To inform future action, governments should have access to synthesized data on the effectiveness of large-scale AMR interventions. This planned systematic review will (1) identify and describe previously evaluated government policy interventions to reduce human antimicrobial use and (2) estimate the effectiveness of these different strategies. METHODS An electronic search strategy has been developed in consultation with two research librarians. Seven databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PAIS Index, Web of Science, and PubMed excluding MEDLINE) will be searched, and additional studies will be identified using several gray literature search strategies. To be included, a study must (1) clearly describe the government policy and (2) use a rigorous design to quantitatively measure the impact of the policy on human antibiotic use. The intervention of interest is any policy intervention enacted by a government or government agency in any country to change human antimicrobial use. Two independent reviewers will screen for eligibility using criteria defined a priori. Data will be extracted with Covidence software using a customized extraction form. If sufficient data exists, a meta-analysis by intervention type will be conducted as part of the effectiveness review. However, if there are too few studies or if the interventions are too heterogeneous, data will be tabulated and a narrative synthesis strategy will be used. DISCUSSION This evidence synthesis is intended for use by policymakers, public health practitioners, and researchers to inform future government policies aiming to address antimicrobial resistance. This review will also identify gaps in the evidence about the effectiveness of different policy interventions to inform future research priorities.

Two-hundred twenty-eight nursing home workers in Spain participated in this cross-sectional study. High levels of workload, social pressure from work, contact with suffering, and fear of contagion were found. In nursing homes where cases of COVID-19 had been detected, workers experienced higher levels of secondary traumatic stress. Social pressure from work, high doses of exposure to suffering, lack of personnel and personal protective equipment, and minimal supervisor support were significant in explaining traumatic stress. Supervisor and coworker support moderated some of these relationships. The results are discussed in terms of the need to implement urgent psychosocial protection strategies and to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to help prevent future psychological disorders in this worker population.","Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer; Amutio, Alberto; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Moreno-Jiménez, Bernardo; Garrosa, Eva",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,610,1

METHODS A retrospective review of the Medline database was performed, including studies published up to February 2019. RESULTS Overall, 69 patients (50 males) with a median age of 61 years (range, 31-90) from 16 studies underwent SILLS for malignant liver disease and were included in this review. The majority of patients underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 52, 75 %), followed by metastatic disease (n = 15, 22 %). The hepatic lesions were located in anterolateral liver segments in 62 patients (90 %) and in posterosuperior liver segments in 7 patients (10 %). Sixty-five patients (94 %) underwent minor liver resection. The median blood loss was 200 mL (range 0-2500), while 4 patients that underwent single-port resection were converted to either conventional laparoscopy or open resections. Two cases were reported to be associated with postoperative complications in the single-port group (1 [1.7 %] grade Dindo-Clavien I-II, 1 [1.7 %] grade Dindo-Clavien III-IV), while no complications were noted in the multiport group. All patients successfully underwent R0 resection. CONCLUSIONS SILLS seems to be a safe and efficient treatment modality for malignant liver disease when performed by experienced surgeons in carefully selected patients. More studies are needed to better identify which patients may benefit from such an operative approach.","Machairas, Nikolaos; Papaconstantinou, Dimitrios; Gaitanidis, Apostolos; Hasemaki, Natasha; Paspala, Anna; Stamopoulos, Paraskevas; Kykalos, Stylianos; Sotiropoulos, Georgios C",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,610,19

Measuring affect beyond self-report, i.e., using implicit measures, could add to our understanding of stress-related CV activity. The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) was administered in two studies to test its ecological validity and relation with CV responses and self-report measures of affect. In Study 1 students (N = 34) viewed four film clips inducing anger, happiness, fear, or no emotion, and completed the IPANAT and the Positive And Negative Affect Scale at baseline and after each clip. Implicit negative affect (INA) was higher and implicit positive affect (IPA) was lower after the anger inducing clip and vice versa after the happiness inducing clip. In Study 2 students performed a stressful math task with (n = 14) or without anger harassment (n = 15) and completed the IPANAT and a Visual Analog Scale as an explicit measure afterwards. Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were recorded throughout. SBP and DBP were higher and TPR was lower in the harassment condition during the task with a prolonged effect on SBP and DBP during recovery. As expected, explicit negative affect (ENA) was higher and explicit positive affect (EPA) lower after harassment, but ENA and EPA were not related to CV activity. Although neither INA nor IPA differed between the tasks, during both tasks higher INA was related to higher SBP, lower HRV and lower TPR and to slower recovery of DBP after both tasks. Low IPA was related to slower recovery of SBP and DBP after the tasks. Implicit affect was not related to recovery of HR, HRV, and TPR. In conclusion, the IPANAT seems to respond to film clip-induced negative and positive affect and was related to CV activity during and after stressful tasks. These findings support the theory that implicitly measured affect can add to the explanation of prolonged stress-related CV responses that influence CV health.","van der Ploeg, Melanie M; Brosschot, Jos F; Thayer, Julian F; Verkuil, Bart",Frontiers in psychology,610,1

As access to whole-genome sequencing has grown, greater amounts of molecular data have helped improve the ability to detect and track outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, investigate transmission chains and explore large-scale population dynamics, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings. We hope that the creation of this ecosystem will allow agencies to effectively and efficiently share data, workflows and analyses and thereby increase the reproducibility, accessibility and auditability of pathogen genomic analysis while also supporting agency autonomy.","Black, Allison; MacCannell, Duncan R; Sibley, Thomas R; Bedford, Trevor",Nature medicine,610,31

We therefore performed selective thrombus aspiration with the Penumbra system for the occluded central and precentral arteries distal to the non-occlusive dissecting lesion. Sufficient recanalization was achieved and the patient made a marked recovery. Although mechanical thrombectomy with the use of retrieval intracranial stent systems has demonstrated satisfactory recanalization rates, the aspiration methodology remains useful for patients with an accompanying proximal vascular lesion.","Fujimoto, Motoaki; Tateshima, Satoshi; Ali, Latisha; Raychev, Radoslav; Vinuela, Fernando",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,610,1

In our characterization of the molecular machinery underlying NAADP action, we identified an NAADP-binding protein, called hematological and neurological expressed 1-like protein (HN1L) [also known as Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2)]. Gene deletion of Hn1l/Jpt2 in human Jurkat and primary rat T cells resulted in decreased numbers of initial Ca2+ microdomains and delayed the onset and decreased the amplitude of global Ca2+ signaling. Photoaffinity labeling demonstrated direct binding of NAADP to recombinant HN1L/JPT2. T cell receptor/CD3-dependent coprecipitation of HN1L/JPT2 with RYRs and colocalization of these proteins suggest that HN1L/JPT2 connects NAADP formation with the activation of RYR channels within the first seconds of T cell activation. Thus, HN1L/JPT2 enables NAADP to activate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through RYR.","Roggenkamp, Hannes G; Khansahib, Imrankhan; Hernandez C, Lola C; Zhang, Yunpeng; Lodygin, Dmitri; Krüger, Aileen; Gu, Feng; Möckl, Franziska; Löhndorf, Anke; Wolters, Valerie; Woike, Daniel; Rosche, Anette; Bauche, Andreas; Schetelig, Daniel; Werner, René; Schlüter, Hartmut; Failla, Antonio V; Meier, Chris; Fliegert, Ralf; Walseth, Timothy F; Flügel, Alexander; Diercks, Björn-Philipp; Guse, Andreas H",Science signaling,610,20

The removal rate of 1,4-NPQ by birnessite-catalyzed oxidation (pH = 5) was faster in the presence of phenolic mediators with electron-donating substituents (pseudo-first-order initial stage rate constant (k1) = 0.380-0.733 h-1) than with electron-withdrawing substituents (k1 = 0.071-0.244 h-1), and the effect on the substituents showed a positive correlation with the Hammett constant (Σσ) (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.001). The rate constants obtained using variable birnessite loadings (0.1-1.0 g L-1), catechol concentrations (0.1-1.0 mM), and reaction sequences indicate that phenolic mediators are the major limiting factor for the cross-coupling reaction of 1,4-NPQ in the initial reaction stages, whereas the birnessite-catalyzed surface reaction acts as the major limiting factor in the later reaction stages.

This step invariably occurs by Env positioning itself in the host membrane at the location of viral budding and being incorporated along with the host membrane into the viral particle. In some ways, this step of the viral life cycle would appear to be imprecise. There is no specific sequence in Env or in the retroviral structural protein, Gag, that is inherently required for the production of an infectious Env-containing particle. Additionally, Env-defective proviruses can efficiently produce infectious particles with any of a number of foreign retroviral Env glycoproteins or even glycoproteins from unrelated viral families, a process termed pseudotyping. However, mounting evidence suggests that Env incorporation is neither passive nor random. Rather, several redundant mechanisms appear to contribute to the carefully controlled process of Env acquisition, many of which are apparently used by a wide variety of enveloped viruses. This review presents and discusses the evidence for these different mechanisms contributing to incorporation.","Johnson, Marc C",AIDS research and human retroviruses,610,20

Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5°C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5°C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases. This has implications for the prevention, management and mortality of other serious diseases, including cancer.","Negri, Eva; La Vecchia, Carlo",European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation,610,29

We report a new cure and less invasive method of creating a stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy in reduced-port laparoscopic surgery for unresectable gastric cancers with gastric outlet obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 2.5-cm vertical intraumbilical incision was made, and EZ Access (Hakko Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was placed. After pneumoperitoneum was created, an additional 5-mm trocar was inserted in the right upper abdomen. A gastrojejunostomy was performed in the form of an antiperistaltic side-to-side anastomosis, in which the jejunal loop was elevated in the antecolic route and anastomosed to the greater curvature of the stomach using an endoscopic linear stapler. The jejunal loop together with the stomach was dissected with additional linear staplers just proximal to the common entry hole so that a functional end-to-end gastrojejunostomy was completed. At the same time, the stomach was partitioned using a linear stapler to leave a 2-cm-wide lumen in the lesser curvature. Subsequently, jejunojejunostomy was performed 30 cm distal to the gastrojejunostomy, and the stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy resembling Roux-en Y anastomosis was completed. RESULTS All patients resumed oral intake on the day of operation. Neither anastomotic leakage nor anastomotic stricture was observed. CONCLUSIONS Our less invasive palliative operation offers the utmost priority to improve quality of life for patients with unresectable gastric cancer.","Hirahara, Noriyuki; Matsubara, Takeshi; Hyakudomi, Ryoji; Hari, Yoko; Fujii, Yusuke; Tajima, Yoshitsugu",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Methods: Clinical neuropsychologists who practice in Canada were invited to participate in an online survey that was available from 1/17/20 to 4/02/20. Available survey findings were obtained from 111 respondents, which reflects a response rate of 51.3% of the 216 doctoral-level Canadian neuropsychologists identified in at least one major North American or international professional organization membership list (AACN, INS, NAN, or SCN). Results: Most of the current respondents were White/Caucasian women who identified as adult providers and worked full-time in urban institutional settings. Four Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec) accounted for more than 91% of the current respondent sample. Incomes and career satisfactions were largely encouraging, though some important variations were noted by province, work setting, and professional identity. Incomes were significantly associated with forensic practices and years of clinical experience. Most respondents made use of technician support in their practices, largely to increase productivity and patient volume. Only a small minority of respondents were board-certified and there was generally limited interest in future board certification. Conclusions: While important similarities were observed in the current Canadian sample relative to recent survey findings obtained in a U.S. sample, results also reveal a number of important differences that serve as important areas of future consideration.","Nelson, Nathaniel W; Sweet, Jerry J; Klipfel, Kristen M; Moberg, Paul J",The Clinical neuropsychologist,610,1

We describe the operative strategies currently in use for the management of these complex vascular lesions and discuss their rationale in a literature meta-analysis and single centre blinded retrospective study. The single centre study included a review of initial presentation, angiographic features and clinical outcome (with modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores) over a long-term follow-up. In our series, small aneurysms were effectively treated by endosaccular coil embolization, whereas a strategy including flow-diverter devices combined with endosaccular coil embolization was the option of choice in large and giant aneurysms, leading to satisfactory outcomes in most cases. Our Medline review showed that endovascular treatment was chosen in most VBJ cases, whereas the microsurgical option was assigned to only a few cases. Among the endovascular treatments, the most common techniques used for the treatment of VBJ aneurysms were: coiling, stent-assisted coiling and flow diversion. Our study highlights that aneurysm morphology, location and patient-specific angio-architecture are key factors to be considered in the management of VBJ aneurysms. Most case series, including our own, show that parent artery reconstruction using a flow-diverter device is a feasible and successful technique in some cases of giant and complex aneurysms (especially those involving the lower third of the basilar artery) while a ""sit back, wait and see"" approach may represent the safest and most reasonable option.","Graziano, Francesca; Ganau, Mario; Iacopino, Domenico Gerardo; Boccardi, Edoardo",The neuroradiology journal,610,16

Many researches have demonstrated that a high level of PD-1 expression is closely related to persistent infection and immune evasion in some human infections. In order to study the relationship between PD-1 expression and persistent infections caused by some porcine viruses, we first cloned the porcine PD-1 from porcine PBMCs based on the blast result in the EST database using the human PD-1 sequence. Sequence analysis showed that the cloned PD-1 molecule shares 63 and 54% amino acid sequence identity with human and murine PD-1, respectively. Its molecular structure is also similar to that of human and murine PD-1, containing an IgV-like domain in the extracellular region and two immune regulatory motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. The in vitro T cell proliferation assay showed that the cloned PD-1 could inhibit porcine T cell proliferation by 71% and secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by 64 and 53%, respectively.

Although ADAMs are being considered as crucial modulators of physiological and pathophysiological processes, their roles in neuronal death/survival are largely unexplored. In the present study, changes in brain expression of ADAM15 and ADAM17 (TACE) have been quantitatively examined in rats in response to injurious severe hypoxia (SH) and in animals which acquired hypoxic tolerance through preconditioning to mild hypoxia prior SH. SH persistently up-regulated ADAM15 mRNA and protein levels in hippocampus and neocortex but not in thalamus or hypothalamus. This effect was not observed in the preconditioned rats tolerant to SH. In contrast, hippocampal levels of ADAM17 mRNA and neocortical levels of ADAM17 mRNA and protein were largely reduced following SH in non-preconditioned rats. Hypoxic preconditioning prevented down-regulation of the adam17 gene and considerably enhanced ADAM17 protein expression in hippocampus and neocortex in response to SH. The present findings implicate ADAM15 in the processes of neuronal hypoxic injury. On the other hand, these results also provide evidence for a pro-survival neuroprotective role of ADAM17 and its engagement in the process of preconditioning-induced hypoxic tolerance. The analysis of the protein levels of soluble and membrane-bound forms of APP in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats subjected to SH and SH with preconditioning has demonstrated that an increased ADAM17 expression in preconditioned animals 24h after hypoxia corresponded to a higher level of soluble form of APP and a reduction of the membrane bound fraction which reflects the role of ADAM17 in APP shedding.","Rybnikova, Elena; Gluschenko, Tatjana; Galeeva, Anasthasia; Tulkova, Ekaterina; Nalivaeva, Natalia N; Makova, Natalia Z; Turner, Anthony J; Samoilov, Mikhail",Neuroscience research,610,5

TDLN-targeted PD-L1-blockade induces enhanced anti-tumor T cell immunity by seeding the tumor site with progenitor-exhausted T cells, resulting in improved tumor control. Moreover, we show that abundant PD-1/PD-L1-interactions in TDLNs of nonmetastatic melanoma patients, but not those in corresponding tumors, associate with early distant disease recurrence. These findings point at a critical role for PD-L1 expression in TDLNs in governing systemic anti-tumor immunity, identifying high-risk patient groups amendable to adjuvant PD-1/PD-L1-blockade therapy.","Dammeijer, Floris; van Gulijk, Mandy; Mulder, Evalyn E; Lukkes, Melanie; Klaase, Larissa; van den Bosch, Thierry; van Nimwegen, Menno; Lau, Sai Ping; Latupeirissa, Kitty; Schetters, Sjoerd; van Kooyk, Yvette; Boon, Louis; Moyaart, Antien; Mueller, Yvonne M; Katsikis, Peter D; Eggermont, Alexander M; Vroman, Heleen; Stadhouders, Ralph; Hendriks, Rudi; Thüsen, Jan von der; Grünhagen, Dirk J; Verhoef, Cornelis; van Hall, Thorbald; Aerts, Joachim G",Cancer cell,610,1

We herein report the essential components to design and implement a rigorous training course for developing laparoscopic skills in surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS At our institution, we developed a week-long pilot intensive laparoscopic training course. Six surgical residents (ranging from interns to chief residents) participate in the structured, multimodality course, without any clinical responsibilities. It consists of didactic instruction, laboratory training, practice in the simulation laboratory, and performance (under the direction of attending laparoscopic surgeons) of surgical procedures on pigs. The pigs are anesthetized and attended by veterinarians and technicians, and then euthanized at the end of each day. Three teams of two different training-level residents are paired. Daily briefing, debriefing, and analysis are performed at the close of each session. A written paper survey is completed at the end of the course. RESULTS This report describes the results of first 36 surgical residents trained in six courses. Preliminary data reveal that all 36 now feel more comfortable handling laparoscopic instruments and positioning trocars; they now perform laparoscopic surgery with greater confidence and favor having the course as part of their educational curriculum. CONCLUSION A multimodality intensive laparoscopic training course should become a standard requirement for surgical residents, enabling them to acquire basic and advanced laparoscopic skills on a routine basis.","Zimmerman, Hannah; Latifi, Rifat; Dehdashti, Behrooz; Ong, Evan; Jie, Tun; Galvani, Carlos; Waer, Amy; Wynne, Julie; Biffar, David; Gruessner, Rainer",Surgical endoscopy,610,17

This study examined the barriers and financial impact associated with SDD in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing elective AF ablation. METHODS A single center retrospective review was conducted of the 249 first case-of-the-day outpatient AF ablations performed in 2019 to evaluate the proportion of patients that could have undergone SDD. Barriers to SDD were defined as any intervention that prevented SDD by 8PM. The financial impact of SDD was based on savings from avoidance of the overnight hospital stay and revenue related to management of chest pain facilitated by a vacant hospital bed. RESULTS SDD could have occurred in 157 patients (63%) without change in management and in up to 200 patients (80%) if avoidable barriers were addressed. Barriers to SDD included non-clinical logistical issues (43%), prolonged post-procedure recovery (42%) and minor procedural complications (15%). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with barriers to SDD included increasing age (p = 0.01), left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% (p = 0.04), and severely dilated left atrium (p = 0.04). The financial gain from SDD would have ranged from $1,110,096 (assuming discharge of 63% of eligible patients) to $1,480,128 (assuming 80% discharge) over the course of a year. CONCLUSIONS Up to 80% of patients undergoing outpatient AF ablation were amenable to SDD if avoidable delays in care had been anticipated. Based on reduced hospital operating expenses and increased revenue from management of individuals with chest pain, this would translate to a financial savings of ∼$1.5 million.

RESULTS For all parameters investigated (burst pressure, cut quality, tissue adhering to the instrument, time needed to seal and cut the vessel and thermal damage), BiCision® was at least as good as EnSeal(™). Regarding the burst pressure, BiCision® was superior over EnSeal(™) in arteries: 600 mmHg (±478) versus 241 (±269) mmHg, respectively (p < 0.0001*). In veins, almost equivalent burst pressures of 155 ± 134 mmHg (BiCision®) and 173 ± 139 mmHg (EnSeal(™)) were obtained. CONCLUSION BiCision® appeared to be as good as or even superior to EnSeal(™).

METHODS We test this proposition empirically using longitudinal survey data collected at five timepoints during the early outbreak of the virus in the US (N = 403). RESULTS Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave.

An innovative method to reduce external collisions between instruments and handles is to use instruments of different lengths. This study evaluated the impact of instrument and laparoscope length on simulated SILS performance. METHODS Performance was assessed using peg transfer (PEG) and pattern cutting (CUT) tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) curriculum. Following baseline testing, surgeons were randomized into 3 trial arms: Control--standard length instruments and standard length laparoscope; group 1--one long instrument, one standard length instrument and standard length laparoscope; and group 2--standard length instruments and long laparoscope. Two phases were undertaken using a validated SILS-modified FLS box trainer: phase 1--25 repetitions of PEG and phase 2--5 repetitions of CUT. FLS scoring parameters measured performance and the Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device (ICSAD) captured motion analysis of hands. RESULTS Twenty-three surgeons were recruited--control (n = 7), group 1 (n = 9), and group 2 (n = 7). No significant differences were observed in operative experience or baseline skills performance. Phase 1: Peak FLS score was significantly higher in group 1 compared with control (P = .009). Comparison of learning curves revealed learning plateau was significantly higher in group 1 compared with control (P = .010). Phase 2: Group 1 revealed a trend toward higher peak FLS scores over the control (P = .067). No significant differences in motion analysis of hands were demonstrated using ICSAD.

METHODS A cross-sectional telephone survey interviewed 300 adults in the Hong Kong adult general population during April 21-28, 2020. The instruments of social distancing behaviors, perceived response efficacy, and perceived freedom infringement assessed the frequencies of practicing seven types of social distancing behaviors in the past week, perceived response efficacy of four types of governmental social distancing measures/instructions, and a 5-point Likert scale item on perceived infringement on personal freedom regarding a governmental social distancing measure of banning gatherings of >4 people in public areas. Linear regression adjusted for background factors was performed; the interaction term of perceived response efficacy × perceived freedom infringement was tested. RESULTS About 40.4%-83.0% of the respondents practiced various types of social distancing behaviors; 57.3%-75.0% perceived response efficacies of related governmental measures; about 20% showed perceived freedom infringement. Perceived response efficacy, but not perceived freedom infringement, was independently and positively associated with social distancing behaviors. Perceived freedom infringement significantly moderated the association between perceived response efficacy and social distancing behaviors; such a positive association was significant at higher (those scored ""extremely agree""), but not lower (those scored ""extremely disagree""), levels of perceived freedom infringement. CONCLUSION Perceived response efficacy is a potential determinant of social distancing. However, the strength of such an association may be modified by opposing social values about personal freedom. Future studies are warranted to verify above findings and explore other potential determinants.","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph Tak Fai; Lau, Mason Man Chun",International journal of health policy and management,610,19

The calculated results show that the recovery depends on the bolus penetration depth, flow rate, particle size, breath holding time and bolus volume. Three sets of published experimental data with different controlling factors (particle size, flow rate and breath holding time) are adopted to make the quantitative comparisons with the calculated results.

Cattle are considered to be the primary host and reservoir, and previous studies suggested a tropism of IDV for the upper respiratory tract and a putative role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. This study aimed to characterize the pathogenicity of IDV in naive calves as well as the ability of this virus to transmit by air. Eight naive calves were infected by aerosol with a recent French isolate, D/bovine/France/5920/2014. Results show that IDV replicates not only in the upper respiratory tract but also in the lower respiratory tract (LRT), inducing moderate bronchopneumonia with restricted lesions of interstitial pneumonia. Inoculation was followed by IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses. Study of the innate immune response in the LRT of IDV-infected calves indicated the overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and of chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, but without overexpression of genes involved in the type I interferon pathway. Finally, virological examination of three aerosol-sentinel animals, housed 3 m apart from inoculated calves (and thus subject to infection by aerosol transmission), and IDV detection in air samples collected in different areas showed that IDV can be airborne transmitted and infect naive contact calves on short distances. This study suggests that IDV is a respiratory virus with moderate pathogenicity and probably a high level of transmission. It consequently can be considered predisposing to or a cofactor of respiratory disease.IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family, has a broad geographical distribution and can infect several animal species. Cattle are so far considered the primary host for IDV, but the pathogenicity and the prevalence of this virus are still unclear. We demonstrated that under experimental conditions (in a controlled environment and in the absence of coinfecting pathogens), IDV is able to cause mild to moderate disease and targets both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The virus can transmit by direct as well as aerosol contacts. While this study evidenced overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors and chemokines in the lower respiratory tract, IDV-specific IgG1 production as early as 10 days postchallenge, and likely both Th1 and Th2 responses, further studies are warranted to better understand the immune responses triggered by IDV and its role as part of the bovine respiratory disease complex.","Salem, Elias; Hägglund, Sara; Cassard, Hervé; Corre, Tifenn; Näslund, Katarina; Foret, Charlotte; Gauthier, David; Pinard, Anne; Delverdier, Maxence; Zohari, Siamak; Valarcher, Jean-François; Ducatez, Mariette; Meyer, Gilles",Journal of virology,610,1

The subsequent line of therapy should be determined on the basis of previous treatments and approved drugs available, based on the results of randomized clinical trials. Unfortunately, no phase 3 trial has compared the safety and efficacy of drugs after immunotherapy; thus, drug choice is more empirical than evidence-based. As the tumor may still be anti-VEGFR drug-naïve, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for first line treatment (e.g., sunitinib or pazopanib) may be beneficial. Because this is a second-line treatment, patients could also receive axitinib, cabozantinib, or a combination of lenvatinib and everolimus. The treating physician should choose an appropriate treatment according to the patient's age, comorbidities, and tolerability of previous checkpoint inhibitors, among other considerations.

Obtaining an optimal projection that separates the outflow limb from the aneurysm is most critical. Each of the three techniques described enabled the distal access to giant intracranial aneurysms during treatment with flow diversion. CONCLUSION The looped-around technique, balloon-assisted technique, and retrograde access are valuable strategies in crossing the aneurysm if direct distal access cannot be obtained.","Kan, Peter; Wakhloo, Ajay Kumar; Mokin, Maxim; Puri, Ajit",Surgical neurology international,610,7

As shown in our previous study, microRNA (miR) 302c regulates influenza A virus-induced IFN expression by targeting NF-κB-inducing kinase. However, little is known about the role of the miR-302 cluster in EV71-mediated proinflammatory responses. In this study, we found that the miR-302 cluster controls EV71-induced cytokine expression. Further studies demonstrated that karyopherin α2 (KPNA2) is a direct target of the miR-302 cluster. Interestingly, we also found that EV71 infection upregulates KPNA2 expression by downregulating miR-302 cluster expression. Upon investigating the mechanisms behind this event, we found that KPNA2 intracellularly associates with JNK1/JNK2 and p38, leading to translocation of those transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus. In EV71-infected patients, miR-302 cluster expression was downregulated and KPNA2 expression was upregulated compared with controls, and their expression levels were closely correlated. Taken together, our work establishes a link between the miR-302/ KPNA2 axis and EV71-induced cytokine expression and represents a promising target for future antiviral therapy.","Peng, Nanfang; Yang, Xuecheng; Zhu, Chengliang; Zhou, Li; Yu, Haisheng; Li, Mengqi; Lin, Yong; Wang, Xueyu; Li, Qian; She, Yinglong; Wang, Jun; Zhao, Qian; Lu, Mengji; Zhu, Ying; Liu, Shi",Journal of immunology,610,1

METHODS Clinical data of patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia implemented by ECMO in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from October 2018 to December 2019 were retrospective analyzed, including general information, ECMO transport distance, time, clinical parameters before and after ECMO, including the patients' oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), respiratory rate (RR), pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and pH value, various complications during transport, mechanical ventilation time, patients' prognosis and other indicators. Experience from the aspects of personal protection, transport process and equipment, team cooperation, mid-transit monitoring, quality control, etc., was summarized to provide suggestions for patients with severe COVID-19 using ECMO during inter-hospital transport and protection. RESULTS A total of 6 patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia were transported on ECMO. All patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College by the ECMO transport team after the establishment of ECMO in the local hospital. The transfer distance was 11 to 197 km, with an average of (93.8±58.6) km; the transfer time was 30 to 150 minutes, with an average of (79.2±40.6) minutes. Two patients experienced a drop in ECMO flow and SpO2 during the process, and the main reason was insufficient volume, which was improved after fluid resuscitation and posture adjustment. All patients maintained SpO2 above 0.93. Six patients survived and were discharged. ECMO assisted time was 4-9 days, with an average of (6.5±1.5) days; mechanical ventilation time was 7-24 days, and median time was 10.0 (8.0, 14.5) days. No H1N1 transmission occurred in medical personnel. To achieve good therapeutic effect, the main experience was to choose the proper timing and mode of ECMO; intact transportation vehicles and equipment to reduce or avoid mechanical complications; the effective management of respiration and circulation during the transportation to avoid ventilation-associated lung injury (VALI) and serious hypoxemia; the appropriate space for the transfer team to quickly handle various critical situations; and personal protection to avoid infection. CONCLUSIONS With an experienced ECMO transport team, good transport equipment, comprehensive protection measures, reasonable transport procedures, and a perfect emergency plan, it is safe to use ECMO transport for COVID-19 patients.","Xu, Qiancheng; Jiang, Xiaogan; Wang, Tao; Zhou, Quan; Wang, Jun; Zhang, Peng; Yang, Shangzhi; Yan, Hao; Tao, Xiubin; Lu, Weihua",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,610,24

The water contact angle and water content show hydrophobicity of hydrogels increased with increasing content of crosslinked Ph groups. The seeded mouse embryo fibroblast-like cell line and human cervical cancer cell line, on the HA-Ph hydrogel, proved cell attachment and spreading with a high content of crosslinked Ph groups. The HA-Ph with a higher degree of Ph moieties shows the maximum degree of cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation which presents this hydrogel as a suitable biomaterial for biomedical and tissue engineering applications.

Indeed the management of localized renal tumours has become focused on techniques that maximally preserve nephron quantity and quality, and therefore maximize renal function after surgery. Postoperative renal function is determined primarily by three factors: preoperative renal function, volume of renal mass preserved and surgical renal ischaemia. Minimization of surgical ischaemia is achieved by early unclamping and unclamped (zero ischaemia) techniques.

During both the first and second pandemic waves, several national and regional organizations provided Italian and Lombardian RT departments with detailed guidelines aimed at ensuring safe treatments during the pandemic. The spread of infection among patients and personnel was limited by adopting strict measures, including triage procedures, interpersonal distance, and adequate implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE). Screening procedures addressed to both the healthcare workforce and patients, such as periodic nasopharyngeal swabs, have allowed the early identification of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 cases, thus reducing the spread of the infection. Prevention of infection was deemed of paramount importance to protect both patients and personnel and to ensure the availability of a minimum number of staff members to maintain clinical activity. The choice of treating COVID-19-positive patients has represented a matter of debate, and the risk of oncologic progression has been weighted against the risk of infection of personnel and other patients. Such risk was minimized by creating dedicated paths, reserving time slots, applying intensified cleaning procedures, and supplying personnel and staff with appropriate PPE.

Although the virus is a ubiquitous problem, world leaders have varied appreciably in their responses resulting in substantially different outcomes in terms of virus mitigation, population health, and economic stability. One explanation for this inconsistency is that leaders have taken differential approaches to making sense of the crisis that, in turn, have driven their approaches to decision making and communication. The present article elaborates on the role of leaders as sensemakers and explains how a leader's sensemaking approach is a critical element in successful crisis management efforts. Through the charismatic, ideological, pragmatic (CIP) leadership model, a sensemaking-focused theory of leadership, it is explained how specific, relatively stable sensemaking approaches manifest and what actions leaders engaged in those styles are likely to take in times of crisis. These connections are then reinforced through case examples of 3 world leaders, framed through CIP, and demonstrate how their sensemaking approach has influenced their response to COVID-19.

Other symptoms, including those related to hearing and balance organs (hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness), are reported less frequently by patients. They are especially rarely reported as the first symptoms of this infection. In order to answer the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause hearing and balance damage, the authors reviewed the literature sources from 2019-2020 included in EMBASE and PubMed, entering the following words: ""hearing loss,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""sensorineural hearing loss,"" ""vertigo,"" and ""dizziness.""

Most importantly, we investigated two attention mechanisms: the built-in self-attention mechanism of BERT and the additional attention layer on top of BERT for relevant term annotation. The classification performance showed that the BERT-based models worked better than the traditional models, and BERT with an additional attention layer can achieve higher overall precision than the basic BERT model.

However, this effect depends on several factors. We found that using an elevation training mask during low-intensity aerobic exercise causes an IOP rise. PURPOSE To assess the influence of wearing an elevation training mask (ETM) on IOP during low-intensity endurance training. METHODS 16 physically active young adults (age=23.9±2.9▒y) cycled during 30 minutes at 10% of maximal power production with and without an ETM in two different days and randomized order. A rebound tonometer was used to measure IOP at baseline, after a warm-up of 5 minutes, during cycling (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 minutes), and recovery (5 and 10 minutes) by rebound tonometry. RESULTS The use of an ETM significantly affects the IOP behaviour during exercise (P<0.001, ηp²=0.66). In the ETM condition, there was an IOP increment during exercise (P<0.001, ηp²=0.28) whereas an IOP-lowering effect was observed in the control condition (P<0.001, ηp²=0.41). Post-hoc comparisons showed that there were greater IOP values during exercise in the ETM condition in comparison to the control condition (average IOP difference=3.7±2.2▒mmHg; corrected P values<0.01, and Cohen´s ds >1.10, in all cases). CONCLUSION Low-intensity endurance exercise causes an increment in IOP when it is performed wearing an ETM and a decrease in IOP when the air flow is not restricted (control condition). Therefore, the ETM should be discouraged during low-intensity endurance exercise for individuals who need to reduce IOP levels (e.g., glaucoma patients or those at risk). However, the external validity of these results needs to be addressed in future studies with the inclusion of glaucoma patients.","Vera, Jesús; Jiménez, Raimundo; Redondo, Beatríz; Perez-Castilla, Alejandro; García-Ramos, Amador",Journal of glaucoma,610,1

In pigs, conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) have been described in blood and tissues. Different pathogens, such as viruses, could infect these cells, and in some cases, compromise their response. The understanding of the interaction between DCs and viruses is critical to comprehend viral immunopathological responses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen in the global pig population. Different reports support the notion that PRRSV modulates pig immune response in addition to their genetic and antigenic variability. The interaction of PRRSV with DCs is a mostly unexplored area with conflicting results and lots of uncertainties. Among the scarce certainties, cDCs and pDCs are refractory to PRRSV infection in contrast to moDCs. Additionally, response of DCs to PRRSV can be different depending on the type of DCs and maybe is related to the virulence of the viral isolate. The precise impact of this virus-DC interaction upon the development of the specific immune response is not fully elucidated. The present review briefly summarizes and discusses the previous studies on the interaction of in vitro derived bone marrow (bm)- and moDCs, and in vivo isolated cDCs, pDCs, and moDCs with PRRSV1 and 2.","Hernández, Jesús; Li, Yanli; Mateu, Enric",Frontiers in immunology,610,11

RDN is assumed to decrease sympathetic activity. Consequently, RDN can potentially increase renal oxygenation. Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) provides a non-invasive tool to determine renal oxygenation in humans. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of RDN on renal oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI. METHODS Patients with resistant hypertension or the inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side effects were included. BOLD-MRI was performed before and 12 months after RDN. Twenty-seven patients were imaged on 3 T and 19 on 1.5 T clinical MRI systems. RESULTS Fifty-four patients were included, 46 patients (23 men, mean age 57 years) completed the study. Mean 24-h BP changed from 163(±20)/98(±14) mmHg to 154(±22)/92(±13) mmHg (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001). eGFR did not change after RDN [77(±18) vs. 79(±20) mL/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.13]. RDN did not affect renal oxygenation [1.5 T: cortical R2*: 12.5(±0.9) vs. 12.5(±0.9), p = 0.94; medullary R2*: 19.6(±1.7) vs. 19.3(1.4), p = 0.40; 3 T: cortical R2*: 18.1(±0.8) vs. 17.8(±1.2), p = 0.47; medullary R2*: 27.4(±1.9) vs. 26.7(±1.8), p = 0.19]. CONCLUSION The current study shows that RDN does not lead to changes in renal oxygenation 1 year after RDN as determined by BOLD-MRI. KEY POINTS • Renal denervation significantly decreased ambulatory blood pressure. • Renal denervation did not change renal oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI. • Absence of a change in renal oxygenation might be explained by autoregulation.","Vink, E E; Boer, A; Verloop, W L; Spiering, W; Voskuil, M; Vonken, E; Hoogduin, J M; Leiner, T; Bots, M L; Blankestijn, P J",European radiology,610,29

We propose a conversion technique without peel-away sheath: a guide wire is advanced through the existing temporary CVC; then, a subcutaneous tunnel is created from the exit to the venotomy site. After removing the temporary CVC, the tunneled one is advanced along the guide wire. The study group included all patients requiring a catheter conversion from January 2012 to June 2014; the control group included incident patients who had received de novo placement of tunneled CVCs from January 2010 to December 2011. The main outcome measures were technical success and immediate complications.

OBJECTIVES A strategy involving the electrostatic interaction between a common antiseptic and a discontinued antibiotic (i.e. octenidine and carbenicillin) was evaluated as a potential treatment for gonorrhoea. Octenidine/carbenicillin is a novel group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) with inherent in vitro antibacterial activity that comes from its parent antiseptic and antibacterial ions, octenidine and carbenicillin, respectively. METHODS Antibacterial activities for octenidine dihydrochloride, disodium carbenicillin, octenidine/carbenicillin and stoichiometrically equivalent 1:1 octenidine dihydrochloride to disodium carbenicillin were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay for N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226) and three clinical isolates. Predictive permeability using the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay and cytotoxicity against HeLa cells was also evaluated. RESULTS Additive in vitro antibacterial activities against N. gonorrhoeae were observed in this study, which suggests octenidine/carbenicillin could be a useful agent in reducing N. gonorrhoeae transmission and minimizing gonorrhoea infections. Octenidine/carbenicillin also exhibited bioequivalence to azithromycin and doxycycline, two currently prescribed antibiotics. Likewise, octenidine/carbenicillin had improved predicted permeability compared with octenidine dihydrochloride.

METHODS Clinical and surgical characteristics were collected for patients in an academic tertiary care hospital. Included were patients who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy by 1 of 3 fellowship-trained gynecologists from January 1, 2009, to July 1, 2015 and subsequently had confirmed uterine weights of 1 kg or greater on pathology report. Both robotic and conventional laparoscopic procedures were included. RESULTS During the study period, 95 patients underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy with confirmed uterine weight over 1 kg. Eighty-eight percent were performed with conventional laparoscopy and 12.6% with robot-assisted laparoscopy. The median weight (range) was 1326 g (range, 1000-4800). The median estimated blood loss was 200 mL (range, 50-2000), and median operating time was 191 minutes (range, 75-478). Five cases were converted to laparotomy (5.2%). Four cases were converted secondary to hemorrhage and one secondary to extensive adhesions. There were no conversions after 2011. Intraoperative transfusion was given in 6.3% of cases and postoperative transfusion in 6.3% of cases. However, after 2013, the rate of intraoperative transfusion decreased to 1.0% and postoperative transfusion to 2.1%. Of the 95 cases, there were no cases with malignancy. CONCLUSIONS This provides the largest case series of hysterectomy over 1 kg completed by a minimally invasive approach. Our complication rate improved with experience and was comparable to other studies of minimally invasive hysterectomy for large uteri. When performed by experienced surgeons, minimally invasive hysterectomy for uteri >1 kg can be considered feasible and safe.","Ito, Traci E; Vargas, Maria V; Moawad, Gaby N; Opoku-Anane, Jessica; Shu, Michael K M; Marfori, Cherie Q; Robinson, James K",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,610,11

The eukaryotic actin polymerization/depolymerization cycle is critical for providing force and structure in many processes, including membrane remodeling. In general, Asgard genomes encode two classes of actin-regulating proteins from sequence analysis, profilins and gelsolins. Asgard profilins were demonstrated to regulate actin filament nucleation. Here, we identify actin filament severing, capping, annealing and bundling, and monomer sequestration activities by gelsolin proteins from Thorarchaeota (Thor), which complete a eukaryotic-like actin depolymerization cycle, and indicate complex actin cytoskeleton regulation in Asgard organisms. Thor gelsolins have homologs in other Asgard archaea and comprise one or two copies of the prototypical gelsolin domain. This appears to be a record of an initial preeukaryotic gene duplication event, since eukaryotic gelsolins are generally comprise three to six domains. X-ray structures of these proteins in complex with mammalian actin revealed similar interactions to the first domain of human gelsolin or cofilin with actin. Asgard two-domain, but not one-domain, gelsolins contain calcium-binding sites, which is manifested in calcium-controlled activities. Expression of two-domain gelsolins in mammalian cells enhanced actin filament disassembly on ionomycin-triggered calcium release. This functional demonstration, at the cellular level, provides evidence for a calcium-controlled Asgard actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the calcium-regulated actin cytoskeleton predates eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, dynamic bundled actin filaments are responsible for shaping filopodia and microvilli. By correlation, we hypothesize that the formation of the protrusions observed from Lokiarchaeota cell bodies may involve the gelsolin-regulated actin structures.","Akıl, Caner; Tran, Linh T; Orhant-Prioux, Magali; Baskaran, Yohendran; Manser, Edward; Blanchoin, Laurent; Robinson, Robert C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,610,1

The purpose of this study was to compare three different bend angles of 70, 80, and 90 degrees for lighted stylet intubation. METHODS The patient trachea was intubated with a lighted stylet bent at 70, 80, or 90 degrees according to the randomly allocated groups (group I, II, and III, respectively). A lighted stylet combined with a tracheal tube was prepared with a bend angle of 70, 80, or 90 degrees according to the assigned group. We checked the success rate at the first attempt and overall success rate for the two attempts. Additionally, we measured search time, which was time from insertion of the bent union into the patient mouth to the start of advancing the tracheal tube while separating it from the lighted stylet, and evaluated postoperative sore throat (POST) at 2, 4, and 24 h after the recovery from anesthesia. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between group I, II, and III for success rate at first attempt (73.9 %, 88.2 %, and 94.7 %, respectively, p = 0.178), even though there was a trend of increasing success rate with increasing bend angles. For overall success rate, there was similar result to that in the first attempt between the groups I, II, and III (82.6 %, 94.1 %, and 100 %, respectively, p = 0.141). However, search time took significantly longer in group I than groups II and III (p < 0.001). When group II and III were compared for POST with numeric rating scale (0-10), it was significantly lower in group II than III at 2, 4 h after the recovery (0.5 vs. 2.3, p = 0.016, and 0.4 vs. 1.8, p = 0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The bend angle of the lighted stylet affected the time required for tracheal intubation and POST in our study. 80 and 90 degrees as a bend angle seem to be acceptable for clinicians in regard to success rate of lighted stylet intubation. Considering the success rate of lighted stylet intubation and POST, the bend angle of 80 degrees might be better than 70 and 90 degrees.

Our objective was to precisely quantify the effects modified or mediated by PA and SB using the recently developed four-way effect decomposition. METHODS Our analysis included 22,117 adults (aged≥20 years) participating in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moderate recreational activity (MRA), moderate work activity (MWA), and walk or bicycle for transportation, were measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A four-way decomposition was applied with PA and SB as mediator to decompose the total effects of CVDs on depression into four components: controlled direct effect (CDE), pure indirect effect (PIE), reference interaction (INTref), and mediated interaction effect (INTmed). RESULTS There were statistically significant associations between CVDs, MRA, and depression, with the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of being 1.73 (1.42~2.30), 1.81 (1.42~2.30), respectively. With MRA as a mediator, there were interaction and mediation effects in the associations between CVDs and depression, and the proportions attributable of INTref, INTmed, and PIE were 94.08% (P<0.001), 3.92% (P = 0.007), and 1.68% (P = 0.006), respectively. Furthermore, the mediation effect was statistically significant in females rather than males. CONCLUSIONS MRA strongly modified and mediated the effects of CVDs on depression, especially in females. Our results suggested that sufficient MRA (at least 150 min per week) was considered as requirement for preventing depression in CVDs patients in females.","Xu, Huafu; Deng, Kaisheng; Lin, Ziqiang; Huang, Zhenhui; Gong, Xiao; Tan, Jianyi; Huang, Baoying; Gao, Yanhui",Journal of affective disorders,610,1

METHODS Between January 2005 and December 2015, we retrospectively analyzed 901 patients treated with endovascular aortic repair (EVAR): 883 (98%) had 1 valid postoperative radiologic evaluation, at least. All patients with operative repair for IMA-related T2E entered the final analysis. Indication of their operative repair was sac enlargement (>5 mm within 6 months or >1 cm from the preoperative diameter, irrespectively of the postoperational time) and/or its persistence >12 months. RESULTS We detected 192 (21.7%) T2Es, overall. We identified 37 (4.2%) IMA-related T2Es, and treated 21 cases (VLS n = 11, TAE n = 10). Aneurysm-related mortality and major or minor morbidity was never observed. Time of intervention did not differ significantly (minutes, VLS = 97 ± 46 vs. TAE = 95 ± 21, P = 0.901). Hospitalization was significantly lower in the TAE group (days, 4 ± 2 vs. 1 ± 0.4, P < 0.001). No patient was lost at a mean follow-up of 46 ± 32 months (range, 1-110; median, 48). At last follow-up, sac diameter was significantly more stable in the VLS (mm, 60 ± 10 vs. 55 ± 7, P = 0.593) than that in the TAE group (mm, 57 ± 9 vs. 63 ± 10, P = 0.050).

Many documents of recommendations toward safe practice have been developed for this purpose. OBJECTIVE To assess adjustments that have been undertaken by phoniatricians and otolaryngologists in the delivery of health-care services during the pandemic in order to reduce staff exposure to COVID-19 and improve safety. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional. METHODS An online self-administered survey was used during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020 to collect data related to demographics of participants, their sources of information, administrative alterations, and changes they adopted when meeting patients for a consultation/procedure/surgery. RESULTS The eligible 154 responses were grouped into 4 groups based on country of residence. Alterations to service delivery amongst the different groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS The majority of participants were following the suggested recommendations to service delivery adjustments, with some inconsistencies in practice across countries.","Shadi, Mariam S; Rubin, John S; Geneid, Ahmed; Magdy, Elham; Ibrahim, Reham Abdelwakil",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,610,31

Recent progress in neuroimaging technology, such as advanced MRI and CT, provides non-invasive methods to accurately diagnose DAVF, including evaluation of the hemodynamics of the drainage veins. The clinical manifestations of DAVFs vary widely and depend on the location and venous drainage pattern of arteriovenous shunting. Patients with high grade DAVFs having cortical venous reflux should receive aggressive treatment to prevent the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage and other neurological deficits related to venous congestion. Intra-arterial or intravenous endovascular embolization remains the primary therapy for high grade DAVF, while open surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery can serve as alternative treatment options. Early and accurate diagnosis with appropriate treatment is the goal for clinical management of DAVFs to reduce symptoms and prevent the development of venous congestion and stroke.","Tsai, Li-Kai; Liu, Hon-Man; Jeng, Jiann-Shing",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,610,1

DESIGN Population based quasi-experimental study. SETTING Canada. PARTICIPANTS 663 100 respondents to the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Canadian censuses aged 25-89 years who had consistently lived in areas with either high or low PM2.5 levels over five years preceding census day and moved during the ensuing five years. INTERVENTIONS Changes in long term exposure to PM2.5 arising from residential mobility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was deaths from natural causes. Secondary outcomes were deaths from any cardiometabolic cause, any respiratory cause, and any cancer cause. All outcomes were obtained from the national vital statistics database. RESULTS Using a propensity score matching technique with numerous personal, socioeconomic, health, and environment related covariates, each participant who moved to a different PM2.5 area was matched with up to three participants who moved within the same PM2.5 area. In the matched groups that moved from high to intermediate or low PM2.5 areas, residential mobility was associated with a decline in annual PM2.5 exposure from 10.6 μg/m3 to 7.4 and 5.0 μg/m3, respectively. Conversely, in the matched groups that moved from low to intermediate or high PM2.5 areas, annual PM2.5 increased from 4.6 μg/m3 to 6.7 and 9.2 μg/m3. Five years after moving, individuals who experienced a reduction in exposure to PM2.5 from high to intermediate levels showed a 6.8% (95% confidence interval 1.7% to 11.7%) reduction in mortality (2510 deaths in 56 025 v 4925 deaths in 101 960). A greater decline in mortality occurred among those exposed to a larger reduction in PM2.5. Increased mortality was found with exposure to PM2.5 from low to high levels, and to a lesser degree from low to intermediate levels. Furthermore, the decreases in PM2.5 exposure were most strongly associated with reductions in cardiometabolic deaths, whereas the increases in PM2.5 exposure were mostly related to respiratory deaths. No strong evidence was found for the changes in PM2.5 exposure with cancer related deaths. CONCLUSIONS In Canada, decreases in PM2.5 were associated with lower mortality, whereas increases in PM2.5 were associated with higher mortality. These results were observed at PM2.5 levels considerably lower than many other countries, providing support for continuously improving air quality.","Chen, Hong; Kaufman, Jay S; Olaniyan, Toyib; Pinault, Lauren; Tjepkema, Michael; Chen, Li; van Donkelaar, Aaron; Martin, Randall V; Hystad, Perry; Chen, Chen; Kirby-McGregor, Megan; Bai, Li; Burnett, Richard T; Benmarhnia, Tarik",BMJ,610,19

Objectives We aimed to evaluate the current practice of EUS in Portugal. Methods By email, we invited 1 physician of each one of the 26 national Gastroenterology Departments which perform EUS to complete a survey questionnaire available on the Google Forms platform. The online questionnaire was available from September 2017 until February 2018 and was answered only by physicians who perform EUS. Results A total of 21/26 (80.8%) national Gastroenterology Departments answered the questionnaire. In Portugal, there are 42 echoendoscopes in total; most of the echoendoscopy units have only 1 EUS processor (81%), 1 radial echoendoscope (66.7%), 1 linear echoendoscope (76.2%), 1 anorectal probe (57.1%), but no miniprobes (85.7%). About 81% have histological core acquisition needles. In 81% of the units, there are at least 2 ultrasonographers who perform echoendoscopy together (at least 2 ultrasonographers per EUS) in 47.6% of these departments. The ultrasonographers also performed abdominal ultrasound (US), anal US, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 71.4, 66.7, and 42.9%, respectively. The echoendoscopy units have 2.4 ± 1.1 periods of echoendoscopy per week and 4 ± 1.5 EUS per period (499.2 ± 416.8 EUS per year). Subepithelial lesions and biliopancreatic lesion evaluation as well as gastrointestinal neoplasia staging were the most common EUS indications. The number of FNA (fine-needle aspirations) ranges from 10 to 160/year. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) is available in 60% of units and is performed by the cytopathologist (66.7%) in the majority of cases. The main reason for omitting ROSE is the limited pathology staff. Cytopathological material is prepared by the ultrasonographer in 25% of the units. Air drying (50%) and formalin (50%) are most frequently used to fix and preserve smears, respectively. Pancreatic pseudocyst drainage (66.7%), celiac plexus neurolysis (52.4%) and pancreatic necrosectomy (42.9%) are the most widespread therapeutic procedures. Conclusions This survey provides the first insight into the current status of digestive echoendoscopy in Portugal. There is a great variability in diagnostic and therapeutic echoendoscopy practice.","Costa, Juliana M; Fernandes, Dália; Gonçalves, Bruno; Gonçalves, Raquel; Soares, João B",GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology,610,16

This GLP study was requisite for FDA approval to determine if equivalent cell capture and cellularity was observed with the balloon compared to surface sampling brushes and to determine the balloon's usability for naive otolaryngologists. METHODS Three naïve users tested the Hobbs brush and Strome-Blitzer balloon on 4 Yorkshire swine. Four anatomical sites were sampled, beginning distally and ending proximally. In 2 animals, the balloon was used first distally and in the remaining 2, 4 new Hobbs brushes were used distally first. Moving proximally, the balloon and brushes were sequentially alternated. In follow-the-leader fashion, the balloon was introduced trans-orally followed by an endoscope to the desired site. The balloon was inflated exposing the abrasive strips to contact the esophageal mucosa. Moving the balloon 1 to 2 cm superiorly and inferiorly effected circumferential cell capture. The balloon was collapsed and removed, preserving the cellularity. The Hobbs brush was passed through the scope's channel. Four brushes, 1 per quadrant, obtained the samples at an anatomical site. The balloon was rated as pass/fail on the following: delivery, kinking, usability, and malfunction. A blinded veterinary pathologist evaluated the cytology. RESULTS There was no device malfunction, mucosal trauma, or difficulty with device use. Balloon cytologic samples were comparable in cellularity and quality to the brush. CONCLUSION A single balloon sampling was comparable to 4 brushes in capturing diagnostically relevant cellular volumes and architecture. Naïve users easily performed the procedures after reading the guidelines.

The application of radioprotective spacers was first reported 30 years ago regarding radiotherapy of tongue and abdominal cancers; more recently, they are increasingly being used in prostate cancer. This review focuses on the published data concerning the features of different types of spacers and their application in various tumor sites. Placement-related complications and the cost-effectiveness of the spacers are also discussed. With the increasing use of high-precision radiotherapy in clinical practice, especially the paradigm-changing stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), more robust studies are warranted to further establish the role of radioprotective spacers through materials development and novel placement techniques.","Tang, Qiuying; Zhao, Feng; Yu, Xiaokai; Wu, Lingyun; Lu, Zhongjie; Yan, Senxiang",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,610,1

Although many studies have examined events' impact on features or behaviors, few studies have examined how events impact aggregate emotions and how these effects may unfold over time. Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning technique (i.e., the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] algorithm), the current study extracted the public's daily emotion associated with working from home (WFH) at the U.S. state level over four months (March 01, 2020-July 01, 2020) from 1.56 million tweets. We then applied discontinuous growth modeling (DGM) to investigate how COVID-19 and resultant stay-at-home orders changed the trajectories of the public's emotions associated with WFH. Our results indicated that stay-at-home orders demonstrated both immediate (i.e., intercept change) and longitudinal (i.e., slope change) effects on the public's emotion trajectories. Daily new COVID-19 case counts did not significantly change the emotion trajectories. We discuss theoretical implications for testing EST with the global pandemic and practical implications. We also make Python and R codes for fine-tuning BERT models and DGM analyses open source so that future researchers can adapt and apply the codes in their own studies.

There is an urgent need for identification and understanding of clinical and laboratory parameters related to progression towards a severe and fatal form of this illness, often preceded by a so-called cytokine-storm syndrome (CSS). Therefore, we explored the hemocytometric characteristics of COVID-19 patients in relation to the deteriorating clinical condition CSS, using the Sysmex XN-10 hematology analyzer. Methods From March 1st till May 16th, 2020, all patients admitted to our hospital with respiratory complaints and suspected for COVID-19 were included (n=1,140 of whom n=533 COVID-19 positive). The hemocytometric parameters of immunocompetent cells in peripheral blood (neutrophils [NE], lymphocytes [LY] and monocytes [MO]) obtained upon admission to the emergency department (ED) of COVID-19 positive patients were compared with those of the COVID-19 negative ones. Moreover, patients with CSS (n=169) were compared with COVID-19 positive patients without CSS, as well as with COVID-19 negative ones. Results In addition to a significant reduction in leukocytes, thrombocytes and absolute neutrophils, it appeared that lymphocytes-forward scatter (LY-FSC), and reactive lymphocytes (RE-LYMPHO)/leukocytes were higher in COVID-19-positive than negative patients. At the moment of presentation, COVID-19 positive patients with CSS had different neutrophils-side fluorescence (NE-SFL), neutrophils-forward scatter (NE-FSC), LY-FSC, RE-LYMPHO/lymphocytes, antibody-synthesizing (AS)-LYMPHOs, high fluorescence lymphocytes (HFLC), MO-SSC, MO-SFL, and Reactive (RE)-MONOs.

Despite the fact that a variety of production routes and starting cellulose sources are employed, all industrially produced CNCs consist of cellulose I (CNC-I), the native crystalline allomorph of cellulose. Here a comparative study of the physico-chemical properties and liquid crystalline behavior of CNCs produced from cellulose II (CNC-II) and typical CNC-I is reported. CNC-I and CNC-II are isolated by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cotton and mercerized cotton, respectively. The two allomorphs display similar surface charge densities and ζ-potentials and both have a right-handed twist, but CNC-II have a slightly smaller average length and aspect ratio, and are less hygroscopic. Interestingly, the self-assembly behavior of CNC-I and CNC-II in water is different. Whilst CNC-I forms a chiral nematic phase, CNC-II initially phase separates into an upper isotropic and a lower nematic liquid crystalline phase, before a slow reorganization into a large-pitch chiral nematic texture occurs. This is potentially caused by a combination of factors, including the inferred faster rotational diffusion of CNC-II and the different crystal structures of CNC-I and CNC-II, which are responsible for the presence and absence of a giant dipole moment, respectively.","Delepierre, Gwendoline; Eyley, Samuel; Thielemans, Wim; Weder, Christoph; Cranston, Emily D; Zoppe, Justin O",Nanoscale,610,1

The ability to competently engage in a multicultural world is often considered the “literacy of the future”. Global interconnectedness has brought studies into intercultural competence to centre stage. This has increased the demand for cross-cultural education experiences that facilitate such learning. However, there is a dearth of empirical research into the issues and effects surrounding short-term cross-cultural educational experiences for adolescents. This mixed-methods study extends previous research by looking specifically into what impact short-term cross-cultural experiences may have on the formation of intercultural competence (IC) and emotional intelligence (EI) of Australian high school students. This study used two instruments for measuring IC and EI in a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design (n = 14), the General Ethnocentrism (GENE) Scale and Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ). Moreover, it conducted in-depth post-experience qualitative interviews (n = 7) that broadly followed a phenomenological paradigm of inquiry. The findings suggest that fully embodied cross-cultural immersive experiences can effectively support the formation of IC and EI in high school students and may thereby play a contributing role in redressing ignorance, xenophobia, prejudice, and discrimination. A greater understanding of the linkages between immersive cross-cultural experiences and intercultural competence offers prospects for policymakers, educators, pastoral carers, and other relevant stakeholders who might employ such experiential learning to foster more interculturally and interracially harmonious human relations.","Nelson, Wendy Luetz Johannes M.",Social Sciences,610,1

In congregate settings restrictions were more stringent due to residents’ vulnerability and high risks of the virus spreading. In the first case, a UK social worker recounts his proactive advocacy on behalf of a young woman living in residential care, enabling easing of some restrictions for her. In the second case, a German researcher discusses how limits on entering nursing homes resulted in postponing and then ending a participatory research project, with the researcher regretting loss of contact with a home. Following each case is a commentary from an outsider’s perspective. Both authors foreground their responsibilities to care about people facing difficult circumstances and to take action for change. This suggests that situated approaches to ethics, focussing on particular people, roles and relationships in context (such as the ethics of care and virtue ethics) are helpful in understanding the ethical challenges described. The cases illustrate the extra cognitive and practical effort required to engage in ethical reflection on the implications of new circumstances, in which taken-for-granted ways of being, thinking and acting are difficult or impossible.","Banks, Sarah Marilena von Köppen",Ethics & Social Welfare,610,1

Based on this test, PPKM showed a significant effect on the addition of daily new cases and recovered cases. Conversely, the vaccination program only had a significant impact on recovered cases. A forecast of the COVID-19 cases was conducted and indicated that the daily new cases showed a negative trend, although it fluctuated for the next 7 days, while death and recovered cases continued to increase.

A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.","Srinivasan, Shriya; Ramadi, Khalil B; Vicario, Francesco; Gwynne, Declan; Hayward, Alison; Langer, Robert; Frassica, Joseph J.; Baron, Rebecca M.; Traverso, Giovanni",bioRxiv,610,1

A high density of visitors at a given site and permanent increase in the number of visitors exceed the Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC) of trails and produce the associated issue of overtourism. In order to pursue research in this area of study and find ways to counteract overtourism, visitor traffic in national parks should be monitored. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of visitors and to measure the degree of seasonality of visitor flow in one of the most visited national park in Poland, named Stołowe Mountains National Park (SMNP). The analysis in the study includes variability of daily visitor flow over a 4-year study period based on a determination of tourist seasons and sub-seasons. In order to accomplish this goal two indices were determined: Visitor Index (VI), Seasonality Index (SI). The relevant data were collected daily over a 4-year time period (2017–2019;1095 daily visitors) and preprocessed data during Covid-19 period in 2020, from a system of 39 pyroelectric sensors part of a Monitoring System of tourist traffic (MSTT). The research found four types of tourist seasons were identified in the study: high season in summer, mid-season in autumn, mid-season in spring, low season in late autumn and winter. The presented Seasonality Index of periods and sub-periods shows some variability in the intensity of weekend tourism. The interpretation of indices allowed to create a detailed description of visitor flow in SMNP. This made it possible to determine the variability of visitor flow on an annual or monthly basis, and to identify seasons and sub-seasons based on available daily data. The Covid-19 pandemic has substantially changed the temporal distribution of tourism visitor flow. Management implications New indices: Visitor Index (VI) and a Seasonality Index (SI). The greatest advantage of the proposed indices make it possible to define tourist season periods regardless of the division into months and/or weeks. Presented seasons and sub-seasons last regardless of the monthly and weekly division, and taking into account the daily resolution data, these seasons can be precisely defined. The proposed Visitor Index (VI) and a Seasonality Index (SI) indices provide more detailed insight and serve as accurate measures of tourist season periods The current literature is lacking such approach, where monthly values are usually presented.

Cytokine release syndrome might contribute to extra-pulmonary manifestations such as acute kidney injury, venous thrombosis, neurological complications, hepatic and myocardial injury. Reactive arthritis is an emerging musculoskeletal (MSK) manifestation post COVID-19 infection. Reactive arthritis manifests as asymmetrical, oligoarthritis mainly involving peripheral or axial joints of lower extremities and associated with extra-articular manifestations. Objectives: review the clinical presentation and management outcomes of COVID-19 associated reactive arthritis. Methods: A literature research was conducted using PubMed and Google scholar for published abstracts, case reports, and studies from January 2020 to January 2021. We used search keywords reactive arthritis, COVID-19 pneumonia, SARS CoV2 infection, and Musculoskeletal. Descriptive analysis was used due to small sample size. Results: COVID-19 associated reactive arthritis is rarely reported. In review of literature, 10 cases were identified and we included our case of hip arthritis and avascular necrosis post COVID-19 infection. The mean age of cases (n=11) was of 42.8 years and 54.5 % of patients were males. (Table 1) The median duration of reactive arthritis diagnosis from COVID-19 infection ranged from 1 to 8 weeks. The severity of COVID-19 infection varied from mild (n= 6) to severe disease (n=2) per description in each reported case. Majority of the patients had oligoarticular involvement (2 to 4 joints) 45.5%, followed by monoarticular 36.4%, and polyarticular (> 4 joints) in 18%. Extra-articular manifestations were identified in 54.5% of patients including skin rash (erythematous itchy rash), urticarial rash, wrist tendinitis, Achilles enthesitis /tendonitis and balanitis. HLA-B27 testing was done in five patients and only one patient had a positive result. Plain radiographs were normal. Therapy provided of such cases were NSAIDS (n=4), steroids (oral, intra-articular) (n=1) or combination of steroids and NSAIDS (n=3) with favorable outcomes. The median reported follow up period ranged from 1.5 to 8 weeks. Conclusion: Reactive arthritis is a rare MSK manifestations post COVID-19 infection. HLA-B27 positive testing might indicate severe and delayed form of arthritis with risk of recurrence. Larger studies are required to delineate the potential risk factors and long-term management outcomes for reactive arthritis associated with COVID-19 infection.","Alkindi, F.; Alseiari, K.; Al Naqbi, K.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,610,14

Subsequent concerns around caring for patients with sickle cell disease who require automated red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusions emerged, especially in the setting of physical distancing and national shortages in blood product supplies. In this vulnerable population at high risk of allo-immunization, ideal transfusion parameters (e.g., antigen optimization) will likely grow increasingly difficult to satisfy and require careful evaluation and strategic planning. Methods: Automated RBC exchange transfusions were performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in patients with sickle cell disease for a variety of clinical indications with the primary objective of lowering the amount of Hemoglobin S (goal 15%) and replacing it with Hemoglobin A. We collected the number of weekly RBC exchange transfusions performed and then compared the frequencies between 01/05/20 and 03/14/20 (pre-pandemic) to those between 03/15/20 and 08/01/20 (intra-pandemic) using a one-tailed t-test. We also examined the number of RBC units ordered per week at UAB, in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, shortly before and after the declaration of a global pandemic using a one-tailed t-test. Results: The mean frequency of RBC exchange transfusions performed per week was 8.1 [standard deviation 2.3] pre-pandemic and 8.6 [2.3] intra-pandemic (Figure 1a). There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.27) in the frequency between these two periods. Shortly prior to the start of the pandemic (02/23/20-03/14/20), a mean of 77.3 [17.9] units/week were ordered for outpatient RBC exchange transfusions. Shortly after the start of the pandemic (03/15/20-04/26/20), a mean of 55.3 [22.8] units/week were ordered for outpatient RBC exchange transfusions, which was also not significantly different (p=0.09). During this time period, the mean number of RBC units per week ordered in the inpatient surgical setting significantly declined from 719.3 [43.1] to 390.0 [46.8] as elective procedures were delayed (p<0.005) (Figure 1b). Conclusions/Future Directions: The frequency of automated RBC exchange transfusions performed at UAB did not decrease after the onset of the pandemic. UAB was able to continue caring for patients with sickle cell disease receiving RBC exchange transfusions as the pandemic emerged and national blood product supplies declined despite a similar overall demand. Interestingly, there was also a concomitant decrease in the demand for RBCs from inpatient surgical settings as elective procedures were delayed, possibly contributing to the blood bank's ability to maintain ideal transfusion parameters and perform antigen optimization of transfused RBCs. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the national shortage of blood product supplies will likely worsen and necessitate multidisciplinary efforts, including intra-institutional and inter-institutional collaborations, to continue caring for patients with sickle cell disease receiving RBC exchange transfusions. Furthermore, community education, safely structured blood drives, and other efforts to encourage donations are essential to maintain the national blood product supply.

The specific vulnerability and the protective factors for persons with ID/LF-ASD attending residential and rehabilitative facilities have however received little attention. This paper aims to describe how two facilities located in the Italian COVID-19 red zone faced the risks associated with the spread of the pandemic and the results they have achieved so far. Design/methodology/approach Interventions to contrast the spread of the pandemic and preserve clients' health conditions have been systematically monitored and recorded since the very beginning of the pandemic. Findings 26/138 clients had to undergo clinical screening and laboratory tests for COVID-like symptomatology, but only one resulted affected by COVID-19 and survived. Considering that Lombardy had 89,595 cases and 16,262 deaths (January-May 2020), one COVID-19 case/138 clients is a good result. Temporarily limiting physical contacts with friends/family in favor of reducing the burden of risk and adopting a system of prevention/safety strategies directed for persons with ID/LF-ASD attending and their caregivers have been useful measures. Research limitations/implications Structured or semi-structured interviews (using professional caregivers as informant) to confirm behavioral and emotional changes in the clients could not be carried out because of lack of time and resources (which were captured by the management of the pandemic) and could be the next goal for our residential facilities to implement the management of epidemic acute phases in a research-oriented view. Originality/value This study is a service evaluation report about facing COVID-19 pandemic.

The high-current, high-energy electron beam can also be used to drive a free electron laser (FEL). In this study, we investigate the performance of an LHeC-based FEL, operated in the self-amplified spontaneous emission mode using electron beams after one or two turns, with beam energies of, e.g., 10, 20, 30 and 40 GeV, and aim at producing X-ray pulses at wavelengths ranging from 8~\AA\ to 0.5~\AA . In addition, we explore a possible path to use the 40 GeV electron beam for generating photon pulses at much lower wavelengths, down to a few picometre. We demonstrate that such ERL-based high-energy FEL would have the potential to provide orders of magnitude higher average brilliance at \AA\ wavelengths than any other FEL either existing or proposed.

Methods: From September to November 2020, clinical and laboratory data were collected from 50 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Saiful Anwar General Hospital in Malang, Indonesia. Antiphospholipid antibodies were measured by finding IgM anti-beta 2 glycoprotein, lupus anticoagulant, and IgM/IgG anticardiolipin. Clinical characteristics, thrombotic events, ICU admission, and mortality during hospitalization were recorded. Disease severity was defined by the Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19, Indonesia. Results: Among 50 patients, 5 patients (10.0%) were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies: 4 patients (80.0%) had IgM anti-beta 2 glycoprotein and 1 patient had IgG anti-cardiolipin (20.0%) and IgM anti-cardiolipin (20.0%), none of lupus anticoagulant was detected. Antiphospholipid antibodies were associated with anosmia (OR 8.1;95% CI 1.1-57.9;P=0.018), nausea and vomiting (OR 12.4;95% CI 1.2-122.6;P=0.010), diarrhea (OR 9.8;95% CI 1.3-70.9;P=0.010), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.4;95% CI 1.0-1.9;P=0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR 12.0;95% CI 1.6-90.1;P=0.05), acute coronary syndrome (OR 29.3;95% CI 2.0-423.7;P=0.001), moderate (OR 0.11;95% CI 0.01-1.10;P=0.031) and severe (OR 18.5;95% CI 1.8-188.4;P=0.002) disease severity, and in-hospital mortality (OR 8.1;95% CI 1.1-57.9;P=0.018). However, there is no correlation between the presence of antiphospholipid antibody and ICU admission.

The molecular mechanisms by which combinations of mutations, especially involving those distal from the active site, alter drug binding to confer resistance are poorly understood and thus difficult to counteract. A machine learning strategy was developed that couples parallel molecular dynamics simulations and experimental potency to identify specific conserved mechanisms underlying resistance. A series of 28 HIV-1 protease variants with 0-24 substitutions each were used as a rigorous model of this strategy. Many of the mutations were distal from the active site and the potency of variants to a drug (darunavir) varied from low pM to near µM. With features extracted from the simulations, elastic network machine learning was applied to correlate physical interactions with loss of potency and succeeded to within 1 kcal/mol of experimental affinity for both the training and test sets, outperforming MM/GBSA calculations. Feature reduction resulted in a model with 4 specific features that describe interactions critical for potency for all 28 variants. These predictive features, that specifically vary with potency, occur throughout the enzyme and would not have been identified without dynamics and machine learning. This strategy thus captures the conserved dynamic mechanisms by which complex combinations of mutations confer resistance and identifies critical features that serve as bellwethers of loss of inhibitor potency. Machine learning models leveraging molecular dynamics can thus elucidate mechanisms of drug resistance that confer loss of affinity and will serve as predictive tools in future drug design.","Leidner, Florian; Yilmaz, Nese Kurt; Schiffer, Celia A.",bioRxiv,610,25

Methods We develop an age-structured mathematical model to influenza transmission to analyze ten consecutive seasons (from 2010-2011 to 2019-2020) of influenza epidemiological and virological data reported to the Italian surveillance system. Results We estimate that 18.4%-29.3% of influenza infections are detected by the surveillance system. Influenza infection attack rate varied between 18.0% and 35.6% and is generally larger for seasons characterized by the circulation of A/H3N2 and/or B types/subtypes. Individuals aged 14 years or less are the most affected age-segment of the population, with A viruses especially affecting children aged 0-4 years. For all influenza types/subtypes, the mean effective reproduction number is estimated to be generally in the range 1.1-1.4 (8 out of 10 seasons) and never exceeding 1.55. The age-specific susceptibility to infection appears to be a type/subtype-specific feature. Conclusions The results presented in this study provide insights on type/subtype-specific transmission patterns of seasonal influenza that could be instrumental to fine-tune immunization strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at limiting seasonal influenza spread and burden.","Trentini, F.; Pariani, E.; Bella, A.; Diurno, G.; Crottogini, L.; Rizzo, C.; Merler, S.; Ajelli, M.",,610,20

The study had adopted the ideological approach to examine the select policies formulated by the respective countries to revive their tourism industry such as what are the bail-out programmes, financial aids, etc. The present study relied on a meta-analysis approach to identify, summarize, and analyze how the selected countries adopted different models to identify and define policy problems. Based on the findings of the meta-analysis, the study establishes that countries adopted ideologies that pragmatically worked and rejected ideologies that are inherently adopted as the state’s governing principle.","Chaitanya, Pradeep N.; Khan, Sumyrah Afreen",Atna Journal of Tourism Studies,610,17

Such characteristics and their breath-by-breath variability might be useful indicators of respiratory health. Objectives: To enable breath-by-breath characterization of respiratory kinematics, we developed a method to detect breaths using motion sensor signals. Methods: In 34 volunteers who underwent maximal exercise testing, we used 8 motion sensors to record upper rib, lower rib and abdominal kinematics at 3 exercise stages (rest, lactate threshold and exhaustion). We recorded volumetric air flow signals using clinical exercise laboratory equipment and synchronized them with kinematic signals. Using instantaneous phase landmarks from the analytic representation of kinematic and flow signals, we identified individual breaths and derived respiratory rate signals at 1Hz. To evaluate the fidelity of kinematics-derived respiratory rate signals, we calculated their cross-correlation with the flow-derived respiratory rate signals. To identify coupling between kinematics and flow, we calculated the Shannon entropy of the relative frequency with which kinematic phase landmarks were distributed over the phase of the flow cycle. Measurements and Main Results: We found good agreement in the kinematics-derived and flow-derived respiratory rate signals, with cross-correlation coefficients as high as 0.94. In some individuals, the kinematics and flow were significantly coupled (Shannon entropy < 2) but the relationship varied within (by exercise stage) and between individuals. The final result was that the phase landmarks from the kinematic signal were uniformly distributed over the phase of the air flow signals (Shannon entropy close to the theoretical maximum of 3.32). Conclusions: The Analysis of Respiratory Kinematics method can yield highly resolved respiratory rate signals by separating individual breaths. This method will facilitate characterization of clinically significant breathing motion patterns on a breath-by-breath basis. The relationship between respiratory kinematics and flow is much more complex than expected, varying between and within individuals.","Ashe, W. B.; Innis, S.; Shanno, J.; Hochheimer, C.; Williams, R.

The aim of this study is to give insight into safety risks in grain handling facilities through information processing of workers’ compensation data on agro-manufacturing occupational incidents within commercial grain elevators in the Midwest region of the United States between 2008 and 2016. The severity of occupational incidents is determined by total dollar amount incurred on medical, indemnity, and other expenses in workers’ compensation claims. The most important factors that affect the cost escalation of occupational incidents are extracted using bootstrap partitioning method, and are applied as input for constructing two machine learning models: random forests decision trees, and naïve Bayes. Both models show high accuracy (87.64% and 92.78% respectively) in predicting that a future claim is classified as either low or medium, severity. The models contribute to identifying high injury risk groups, and prevalent incident causes, allowing a more research-based focused intervention effort in grain handling workplaces. In addition, the results are applicable in forecasting cost severity of future claims, and identifying factors that contribute to the escalation of claims costs.","Kakhki, Fatemeh Davoudi; Freeman, Steven A.; Mosher, Gretchen A.",Procedia Manufacturing,610,24

Whether these alterations persist and could be related to long-term respiratory dysfunction is unknown. Design: From the NOR-Solidarity trial (n=181), plasma was collected during hospital admission and after three months, and analyzed for markers of gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation. At the three-month follow-up, pulmonary function was assessed by measuring diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and rectal swabs for gut microbiota analyses were collected (n= 97) and analysed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: Gut microbiota diversity was reduced in COVID-19 patients with persistent respiratory dysfunction, defined as DLCO below lower limit of normal three months after hospitalization. These patients also had an altered global gut microbiota composition, with reduced abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and increased abundance of Flavonifractor and Veillonella, the latter potentially being linked to fibrosis. During hospitalization, increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were strongly associated with respiratory failure, defined as pO2/fiO2-(P/F-ratio)<26.6 kPa. LBP levels remained elevated during and after hospitalization, and was associated with low-grade inflammation and persistent respiratory dysfunction after three months. Conclusion: Persistent respiratory dysfunction after COVID-19 is associated with reduced biodiversity and gut microbiota alterations, along with persistently elevated LBP levels. Our results point to a potential gut-lung axis that should be further investigated in relation to long-term pulmonary dysfunction and long COVID.","Vestad, B.; Ueland, T.; Lerum, T. V.; Dahl, T.

There is a variety of feature selection and extraction tools that may help with the dimensionality problem, but most of them do not focus on the complexity of the classes. In this paper, a new autoencoder-based model for addressing class complexity in data is introduced, aiming to extract features that present classes in a more separable fashion, thus simplifying the classification task. This is possible thanks to a combination of the standard reconstruction error with a least-squares support vector machine loss function. This model is then applied to a practical use case: classification of chest X-rays according to the presence of COVID-19, showing that learning features that increase linear class separability can boost classification performance. For this purpose, a specific convolutional autoencoder architecture has been designed and trained using the recently published COVIDGR dataset. The proposed model is evaluated by means of several traditional classifiers and metrics, in order to establish the improvements caused by the extracted features. The advantages of using a feature learner and traditional classifiers are also discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Charte, D.; Sevillano-García, I.; Lucena-González, M.

More specifically, we use panel-based social contact data from diary-based surveys conducted in Belgium combined with the next generation principle to infer the relative incidence and we compare this to real-life incidence data. Comparing these two allows for the estimation of age-specific transmission parameters. Our analysis implies the susceptibility in children to be around half of the susceptibility in adults, and even lower for very young children (preschooler). However, the probability of adults and the elderly to contract the infection is decreasing throughout the vaccination campaign, thereby modifying the picture over time.","Franco, N.; Coletti, P.; Willem, L.; Angeli, L.; Lajot, A.; Steven, A.; Beutels, P.; Faes, C.; Hens, N.",,610,25

The most common organ affected by COVID-19 is the lungs, but another well-known effect of COVID-19 infection is thromboembolic phenomena. In this case, a patient previously infected with SARSCoV-2 developed chest pain radiating to the back, shortness of breath, and marked hypertension and was diagnosed with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by a moderate pericardial effusion which led to a cardiac tamponade. The patient had all three of the components of Beck's Triad: muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and hypotension as well as a narrow pulse pressure and had COVID-19 induced myocarditis resulting in a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. This COVID-19 associated pericardial effusion has, to our knowledge, been reported only six times in the literature and this presentation was unique because the patient was in the subacute phase with COVID-19, had a cardiac tamponade, and had a thrombosed stent during the catheterization despite being on long term apixaban. The patient underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with two stents and was transferred to the intensive care unit where he was noted to have worsening hypotension despite aggressive vasopressor support. Ultimately, despite an emergent bedside pericardiocentesis, the patient succumbed to complications of COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, there have only been six reported cases in the literature of COVID-19 associated pericardial effusions, and four had cardiac tamponade. It is imperative that clinicians be wary of, and educated about, the less common effects of COVID-19 infection even after the acute phase has passed, which include a persistent prothrombotic state. © Journal of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

The publication by the regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), of a Guideline for Spondyloarthritis (NG65) in 2017 2 and the corresponding Quality Standard (QS170) in 2018 3, for the first time provided national guidance and standards of services that should be available for people with axial SpA. National oversight of the implementation of these however was missing. Objectives: NASS worked with Parliamentarians to establish the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Axial Spondyloarthritis in January 2019. We gave it a very specific objective -to oversee the implementation of NH65 and QS170. The group seeks to improve axial SpA services in England whilst raising awareness of the condition at a parliamentary level, working closely with NASS. Methods: The group is a unique forum in the UK, bringing together patients, clinicians, researchers, policy makers, national bodies and parliamentarians. The group has met five times covering a range of topics including the delay to diagnosis, the uptake of NG65 and hydrotherapy. In 2019 the group carried out a national inquiry into the standards of axial SpA services in the UK, developing a ten-question quality framework, based largely on the NICE Guideline recommendations and Quality Standard. In July 2020 a meeting was convened to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on axial SpA services. The meeting presented research carried out by NASS and M&F Health with patients and clinicians respectively. Results: The results of the national inquiry for England were published in January 2020 4. The inquiry found that large discrepancies remain in the provision of axial SpA services. Only 21% of local commissioning bodies have an inflammatory back pain pathway, and less than half of NHS providers have a specialist axial SpA clinic. The results of COVID survey shows significant impacts on the health of axial SpA patients and on the availability and modality of rheumatology services. The APPG later published a report with a set of recommendations 5, creating minimum service specifications for axial SpA services during crisis periods such as the recent pandemic, as well as service recovery. Comment on this research was also published in The Lancet Rheumatology 6. In September 2020 the work of the APPG led to a debate in Parliament on delayed diagnosis in axial SpA. Discussions on the future of hydrotherapy services has resulted in the mobilisation of stakeholders across condition areas. Conclusion: All All Party Parliamentary Group is already proving to be an effective political lever to improve axial SpA care. It has shown huge variations in the standard of care and provision of services still remain and has brought this to the attention of Parliamentarians, policy makers and clinicians.","Hamilton, J.; Webb, D.; Whalley, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,610,1

The lack of data at ward level has enabled the disease to evade focused interventions. The goal of this study was to describe the geographic distributions, care-seeking behaviors, Spatio-temporal cluster patterns of the micro-hotspots (hotspots wards) linked with suspected and confirmed cases and deaths of cholera in Kano State. Suspected and confirmed cholera morbidity and mortality at the ward level from 2010-2019 were acquired from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Population and waterbody data were obtained from the Nigeria Expanded Program on Immunization and online, respectively. Data analysis used SaTScan and methods recommended by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. During these ten years, 18,483 suspected and confirmed cases (617 deaths) were reported with 67.7% of the cases and 72% of the deaths from rural wards. The ages of the cases ranged from 1 month to 100 years with a distribution skewed to the older years. CFRs were statistically higher in the <5-year olds compared to those >14 years (p-value = 0.0005). For 2010-2019, gender was statistically associated with cholera outcome (survived/died) (p-value = 0.0006), and women in the rural setting disproportionately died from cholera than women in the urban area (p-value = 0.003). Cholera severity, as measured by hospitalization and death, was higher in the urban (77.4%) compared with the rural (53.4%) setting with the highest severity (84.7%) registered among those >14 years. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) were performed in 1.3% (249) samples of all suspected cases and ranged from 0.7% among the 5-14 year-olds in the rural to 3.5 % among the < 5-year-olds in the urban areas. Of the stool samples collected, 62.7% tested positive for V. cholerae using RDT. The positivity rate was least in the urban setting amongst the <5 years (41.2%) while care-seeking-behavior ranged from 52.1% in the urban to 82.7% in the rural settings. Seasonal patterns of disease often differed between urban and rural settings with outbreaks occurring in both the dry and rainy seasons, but with more intense transmission occurring during the rainy season from week 22 (early June) to week 40 (late September). A Spatio-temporal clustering analysis detected 168 micro-hotspots out of 404 wards, with a population of 4,876,254, having a significantly higher risk (relative risk 1.01-18.73) compared to the State as a whole. While 79 micro-hotspots with a population of 2,119,974 had a RR [≥] 2. The micro-hotspots tended to cluster around waterbodies. SaTScan and GTFCC methods generally agreed in micro-hotspots detection. This study shows the epidemiology of cholera in Kano State differs between urban and rural settings and that hotspot maps at the ward level, not hotpots maps at the Local Government Area level, are best suited for targeting interventions including vaccines. Appropriate studies are needed to further delineate the urban and rural divide of outbreaks but targeting interventions to the identified high-priority micro-hotspots will facilitate cholera elimination from the state.","Ngwa, M.

We first established the approach using explants from colonized rhesus macaques, a model for human IAV. Trachea, bronchi, and lungs from 11 California sea lions, 2 Northern elephant seals and 10 rhesus macaques were inoculated within 24 hours post-mortem with 6 strains representing 4 IAV subtypes. Explants from the 3 species showed similar IAV infection kinetics with peak viral titers 48-72 hours post-inoculation that increased by 2-4 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/explant relative to the inoculum. Immunohistochemistry localized IAV infection to apical epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that respiratory tissue explants from wild marine mammals support IAV infection. In the absence of the ability to perform experimental infections of marine mammals, this ex vivo culture of respiratory tissues mirrors the in vivo environment and serves as a tool to study IAV susceptibility, host-range, and tissue tropism. Importance Although influenza A virus can infect marine mammals, a dearth of marine mammal cell lines and ethical and logistical challenges prohibiting experimental infections of living marine mammals means that little is known about IAV infection kinetics in these species. We circumvented these limitations by adapting a respiratory tract explant model first to establish the approach with rhesus macaques and then for use with explants from wild marine mammals euthanized for non-respiratory medical conditions. We observed that multiple strains representing 4 IAV subtypes infected trachea, bronchi, and lungs of macaques and marine mammals with variable peak titers and kinetics. This ex vivo model can define infection dynamics for IAV in marine mammals. Further, use of explants from animals euthanized for other reasons reduces use of animals in research.","Liu, Hongwei; Plancarte, Magdalena; Ball, Erin.

We interrogated the effects of opioid dependence on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicts case-control status with high accuracy. We focus on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity. We developed a strategy to decode this heterogeneity based on convergence analysis, which leveraged promoter-capture Hi-C to identify five genes over-burdened by alterations in their regulatory network or “plexus”: ASTN2, KCNMA1, DUSP4, GABBR2, ENOX1. These convergent loci are enriched for opioid use disorder risk genes and heritability for generalized anxiety, number of sexual partners, and years of education.

Overlooking aggressive policies to manage this risk of zoonotic viruses reassorting between sick animals and humans misses the greatest opportunity for stopping future disease pandemics. In this study we review several disciplines, outline the scant planning literature on EIDs, and identify the increasing calls from virologists and medical professionals to address urbanization as a key EID driver. Using the case of avian influenza outbreaks in Vietnam in 2004 and 2005, we conceptualize a preventive planning approach to managing the risk of zoonotic transmission that results in EID pandemics.We make several recommendations for planners. Practicing planners should consider how their plans manage the risk of zoonotic disease transmission between animals and humans through land use planning and community planning. Planning education and certification organizations should develop positions regarding the role of planning for EIDs. Food systems planners should consider the importance of livestock practices in food production as a risk factor for EIDs. Diverse research teams should combine geographic scales, data sources, and disciplinary knowledge to examine how an extended series of upstream and downstream events can result in a global pandemic. Such empirical examination can lead to effective planning policies to greatly reduce this risk.

Likewise, there is an emerging need to accurately identify both infectious and non-infectious microbes non-invasively in the body at the genus and species level to guide diagnosis and treatment strategies. Here, we report development of radiometal-labelled bacterial chelators, knowns as metallophores that allow non-invasive and selective imaging of bacteria and bacterial products in vivo. We show that these novel contrast agents are able to identify E. coli with strain level specificity and other bacteria, such as K. pneumoniae, based on expression of distinct cognate transporters on the bacterial surface. The probe is also capable of tracking probiotic, engineered bacteria and bacterial products, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), in unique niches such as tumours. Moreover, we report that this novel targeted imaging approach has impactful applicability in monitoring antibiotic treatment outcomes in patients with pulmonary infections, thereby providing the ability to optimize individualized therapeutic approaches. Compared to traditional techniques used to manufacture probes, this strategy simplifies the process considerably by combining the function of metal attachment and cell recognition into a single molecule. Thus, we anticipate that these probes will be widely used in both clinical and investigative settings in living systems for non-invasive imaging of infectious and non-infectious organisms.","Siddiqui, Nabil A.; Houson, Hailey A.; Thomas, Shindu C.; Blanco, Jose R.; O’Donnell, Robert E.; Hassett, Daniel J.; Lapi, Suzanne E.; Kotagiri, Nalinikanth",bioRxiv,610,1

Our analysis, based on 333 genomes, revealed that the first variants detected in the state of Parana in March 2020 were the B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 variants. The variants B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were predominant throughout 2020 until the introduction of the variant P.2 in August 2020 and a variant of concern (VOC), P.1, in January 2021. Phylogenetic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were previously classified as the VOC P.1 lineage by PANGO showed that some genomes from February to April 2021 branched in a monophyletic clade and that these samples grouped together with genomes recently described with the lineage P.1-like-II. An extended phylogenetic analysis, including SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all over Brazil, showed that the P.1-like-II lineage appears at a high frequency in the southern region of the country. The P.1-like-II lineage genomes share some, but not all, defining mutations of the VOC P.1. For instance, it has the previously described ORF1a:D2980H and N:P383 L unique mutations and the newly detected ORF1a:P1213 L and ORF1b:K2340N mutations. Additionally, a new mutation (E661D) in the spike (S) protein has been identified in nearly 10% of the genomes classified as the VOC P.1 from Parana in March and April 2021. We also report the identification of the S:W152C mutation in one genome from Parana, classified as the N.10 variant. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the lineage and the P.1 variant frequency, age group (patients younger or older than 60 years old) and the clinical data of 86 cases from the state of Parana. This analysis does not support an association between the P.1 variant prevalence and COVID-19 severity or age strata. Our results provided a reliable picture of the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the state of Parana characterized by the dominance of the P.1 strain, as well as a high frequencies of the P.1-like-II lineage and the S:E661D mutations.

The characteristic of the tendency of change of the share of GDP formed in the field of tourism in the world from 2000 to 2019 and the list of the countries with the largest share of tourist incomes in GDP in 2019 are given in the article. An analysis of the tourism business at the beginning of 2020 and the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus on its functioning are presented. It was found that in the first quarter of 2020 there was a decrease in international world tourist flows by 22%, the number of tourist flows in March of 2020 decreased by 57%. This has led to a loss of about $ 80 billion in tourism. The tourism industry has faced an unprecedented conflict of threats: on the one hand - fear for human health and life, and on the other - economic losses from quarantine measures, which lead to the impoverishment of individuals and entire nations. The situation is complicated by the fact that investment problems of leading industries have to be solved in a crisis conditions, when the freezing of funds for specific projects has a very negative impact on the efficiency of the entire economic system and, consequently, nation's welfare.

This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence. Instead, humans construct external touch location post-hoc and on demand.","Maij, Femke; Seegelke, Christian; Medendorp, W. Pieter; Heed, Tobias",bioRxiv,610,1

Studies show that there is an intensive relationship between insulin and gonadal function. As per Rotterdam Criteria, there are four major phenotypes of PCOS with different presentation. Early detection of Insulin Resistance (IR) and consequential prevention of Metabolic Syndrome (MS) associated with PCOS may lead to better prospect for the disease. Aim: To find the pattern of IR in all the phenotypes of PCOS in relation to Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), Body Mass Index (BMI) and Testosterone and thereby, providing data for designing phenotype specific treatment of the disease. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, fasting insulin and fasting glucose were analysed to calculate HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment) and Testosterone for total 144 female subjects of reproductive age group (18-40 years). Subjects were classified in to four groups as per Rotterdam Criteria. Complete PCOS (PCO-COM), PCO with Oligo/Anovulation (PCO-O), Anovulation with Hyperandrogenism (O-HA), and PCO with Hyperandrogenism (PCO-HA). Regression analysis was done to find the relation among the study variables. ANOVA was used to analyse the significant variance among the groups. Results: IR was found to be maximum among O-HA phenotype (2.4±0.37) and lowest among PCO-HA phenotypes (1.3±0.22). Regression analysis shows that there exist significant associations between IR and BMI (t=4.96, p=0.001) as well as between IR and WHR (t=2.97, p=0.003). No independent association between testosterone and IR was observed. Conclusion: Significant difference of IR, WHR, and BMI was observed among the four phenotypes of PCOS.

In this article, we study fractional Brownian motion as a search process, which under parameter variation generates all three basic types of diffusion, from sub- to normal to superdiffusion. In contrast to L\'evy walks, fractional Brownian motion defines a Gaussian stochastic process with power law memory yielding anti-persistent, respectively persistent motion. Computer simulations of search by time-discrete fractional Brownian motion in a uniformly random distribution of targets show that maximising search efficiencies sensitively depends on the definition of efficiency, the variation of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, the perception of targets, the type of targets, whether to detect only one or many of them, and the choice of boundary conditions. In our simulations we find that different search scenarios favour different modes of motion for optimising search success, defying a universality across all search situations. Some of our numerical results are explained by a simple analytical model. Having demonstrated that search by fractional Brownian motion is a truly complex process, we propose an over-arching conceptual framework based on classifying different search scenarios. This approach incorporates search optimisation by L\'evy walks as a special case.","Khadem, S. Mohsen J.; Klapp, Sabine H.L.; Klages, Rainer",,610,13

There, Freeman argued about the need for coherence between the different nations' sub-systems and between the national, continental and global spheres in the matter of development. The emphasis was on the different types of (in)congruence of the different sub-systems of societies - e.g. education, science, technology, politics, culture, among others- that led to specific (under)development paths. The COVID - 19 crisis poses a new stage in the globalization process, and development is still a global challenge, both in terms of preventing new crises and overcoming future ones. Connecting the thoughts of Freeman to these challenges might contribute to a necessary renewed debate about development in current times.","Fiorentin, F.; Suarez, D.",Innovation and Development,610,10

Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.FindingsData analysis revealed four types of dynamic capabilities (i.e. sensing, learning, integrating and coordinating capabilities). Equipped with these capabilities, hotels made minor adjustments to their SST strategies. In general, during an economic downturn, hotels refrained from introducing new SSTs. SSTs introduced before the pandemic were used more frequently and received enhanced customer feedback. The findings further revealed that the factors influencing hotels’ application of SSTs before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 remained similar.Originality/valueThis is the first research integrating CP, dynamic capabilities and strategic management process to explain how hotels adjust technological strategies to recover in a suddenly changed environment. Such a framework enables scholars and practitioners from content-oriented and process-oriented perspectives to make quick but sound strategic management decisions in adapting to turbulent environments. This timely study enriches the expertise of using technology as a recovery strategy and contributes to future research on the practical application of SSTs and crisis management.","Liu, Chun Yang Jingjing",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,610,7

The original X-ray images were processed to produce two sets of images with different features. The first set was images enhanced with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. The second set was edge images produced by contrast-enhanced canny edge detection. Convolutional neural networks were used to extract features from the images and train classifiers, which were able to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy lungs cases.

Design - Matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT). Setting - Population of Scotland from 1 December 2020 to 19 August 2021. Main outcome measure - Severe COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Results - Efficacy against severe COVID-19 of two doses of vaccine was 93% (95 percent CI 90% to 95%) in those without designated risk conditions, 89% (95 percent CI 85% to 92%) in those with moderate risk conditions, but only 66% (95 percent CI 52% to 76%) in those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and eligible for shielding. Of the 330 cases of severe COVID-19 in double-vaccinated individuals, 47% had moderate risk conditions and 41% were CEV. In the double-vaccinated CEV group, the rate ratio for severe disease (with no risk condition as reference category) was highest in solid organ transplants at 98 (95% CI 29 to 332) but even in this subgroup the absolute risk of severe COVID-19 was low (14 cases in 16079 person-months of follow-up). Conclusions - Two doses of vaccine protect against severe COVID-19 in CEV individuals but the residual risk in double-vaccinated individuals remains far higher in those who are CEV than in those who are not. These results suggest that any policy of offering booster doses to doubly-vaccinated individuals should focus initially on the clinically vulnerable, and lay a basis for determining eligibility for passive immunization to protect those at highest risk.","McKeigue, P.

In an approach to inhibit the pathological signalling of pAkt by prolyl-hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) we employed α-ketoglutarate (αKG), a cofactor of PHD2. Octyl-αKG supplementation to platelets promoted PHD2 activity through elevated intracellular αKG:succinate ratio and reduced aggregation in vitro by suppressing pAkt1(Thr308). Augmented PHD2 activity was confirmed by increased hydroxylated-proline alongside enhanced binding of PHD2 to pAkt in αKG-treated platelets. Contrastingly, inhibitors of PHD2 significantly increased pAkt1 in platelets. Octyl-αKG followed similar mechanism in monocytes to inhibit cytokine secretion in vitro. Our data also describe a suppressed pAkt1 and reduced activation of platelet and leukocyte obtained from mice supplemented with dietary-αKG, unaccompanied by alteration in their counts. Dietary-αKG significantly reduced clot formation and leukocyte accumulation in various organs including lung of mice treated with thrombosis-inducing agent carrageenan. Importantly, we observed a significant rescue effect of dietary-αKG on inflamed lung of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. αKG significantly reduced leukocyte accumulation, clot formation and viral load alongside downmodulation of pAkt in lung of the infected animals. Therefore, our study suggests a safe implementation of dietary-αKG in prevention of Akt-driven anomalies including thrombosis and inflammation, highlighting a better pulmonary management in COVID-19.","Shrimali, Nishith M; Agarwal, Sakshi; Kaur, Simrandeep; Bhattacharya, Sulagna; Bhattacharyya, Sankar; Prchal, Josef T; Guchhait, Prasenjit",bioRxiv,610,1

However, direct evidence of autoimmunity, infections, or a proinflammatory state is often lacking, and there is no unifying pathogenic pathway. This could be due to underlying genetic heterogeneity, which could lead to the development of PANS through different cellular and molecular pathways. Unfortunately, little is known about the genetic basis of PANS. Consequently, we carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) on a U.S. cohort of 386 cases who met diagnostic criteria for PANS, including 133 family triads, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on ten cases from the European Union, who were selected for WGS because of severe PANS symptoms. We focused on identifying potentially deleterious genetic variants that were either de novo or ultra-rare with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001. Candidate mutations were found in 11 genes: PPM1D, SGCE, PLCG2, NLRC4, CACNA1B, SHANK3, CHK2, GRIN2A, RAG1, GABRG2, and SYNGAP1 in a total of 20 cases, which included two sets of siblings, and two or more unrelated subjects with ultra-rare variants in SGCE, NLRC4, RAG1, and SHANK3. The PANS candidate genes we identified separate into two broad functional categories. One group regulates peripheral innate and adaptive immune responses (e.g., PPM1D, CHK2, NLRC4, RAG1, PLCG2), some of which also influence microglia function. Another is expressed primarily at neuronal synapses or directly modulates synaptic function (SHANK3, SYNGAP1, GRIN2A, GABRG2, CACNA1B, SGCE). These neuronal PANS candidate genes are often mutated in autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorders, and myoclonus-dystonia. In fact, eight out of 20 cases in this study developed PANS superimposed on a preexisting neurodevelopmental disorder. There is, however, clinical overlap between these two groups and some crossover expression (e.g., some neuronal genes are expressed in immune cells and vice versa) that diminishes the neuronal/immune dichotomy. Genes in both categories are also highly expressed in the enteric nervous system, and in the choroid plexus and brain vasculature, suggesting they might contribute to a breach in the blood-CSF barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) that would permit the entry of autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and autoantibodies into the brain. Thus, PANS is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can occur as a stand-alone neuropsychiatric condition or co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders, with candidate genes functioning at several levels of the neuroinflammatory axis.","lachman, h.; Trifiletti, R.; Manusama, O.; Zheng, D.; Spalice, A.; Chiurazzi, P.; Schornagel, A.; Serban, A.; van Wijck, R.; Swagemakers, S.; van der Spek, P.",,610,16

We test the hypothesis that clinical characteristics of hospitalized CYP with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK second wave would differ from the first due to the combined impact of the alpha variant, school reopening and relaxation of shielding. Methods Patients <19 years hospitalised in the UK with clinician-reported SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in a prospective multicentre observational cohort study between 17th January 2020 and 31st January 2021. Minimum follow up time was two weeks. Clinical characteristics were compared between the first (W1) and second wave (W2) of infections. Findings 2044 CYP aged <19 years were reported from 187 hospitals. 427/2044 (20.6%) had asymptomatic/incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection and were excluded from main analysis. 16.0% (248/1548) of symptomatic CYP were admitted to critical care and 0.8% (12/1504) died. 5.6% (91/1617) of symptomatic CYP had Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Patients in W2 were significantly older (median age 6.5 years, IQR 0.3-14.9) than W1 (4.0 (0.4-13.6, p 0.015). Fever was more common in W1, otherwise presenting symptoms and comorbidities were similar across waves. After excluding CYP with MIS-C, patients in W2 had lower PEWS at presentation, lower antibiotic use and less respiratory and cardiovascular support compared to W1. There was no change in the proportion of CYP admitted to critical care between W1 and W2. 58.0% (938/1617) of symptomatic CYP had no reported comorbidity. Patients without co-morbidities were younger (42.4%, 398/938, <1 year old), had lower Paediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS) at presentation, shorter length of hospital stay and received less respiratory support. MIS-C was responsible for a large proportion of critical care admissions, invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, inotrope and intravenous corticosteroid use in CYP without comorbidities. Interpretation Severe disease in CYP admitted with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK remains rare. One in five CYP in this cohort had asymptomatic/incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The COVID-19 virus symptoms can include coughing, fatigue, fever for those with mild cases. For more severe cases, it can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and eventually death. Due to its infectious nature, people started taking health precautions that were advised by the World Health Organization such as social distancing, washing hands, and sanitizing surfaces. Due to this pandemic, the aim of this project is to automate mundane tasks with the help of a service robot to reduce physical contact as well as reduce the workload on healthcare workers. Tasks such as delivering food, medication, water, and other necessities to patients with infectious diseases. In addition, this project specifically reduces physical contact between patients and the attending nurse. A service robot is a robot that is built to perform a repetitive or dangerous task in order to assist humans. A service robot executes repetitive tasks more efficiently compared to a person who is prone to lose focus and make mistakes during work hours. The service robot performs tasks that are requested by the patients and accepted by the nurse through the mobile application. The application shows both the nurse and the patients the position of the robot and the task it is performing. The project's design was based on a small robot car that receives a path from the server upon a request using a mobile app. On top of that, the project includes a functional mobile application, a RESTful API, a no-SQL database, and a python microservice that is responsible for path planning. The path planning algorithm used is the A∗ algorithm for finding the shortest path to the destination. The service robot avoids obstacles by first stopping after detecting the obstacle, label the coordinates of that location as obstacle, rotates 180 degrees, moves to the previous location, and then requests the path again. The constant communication between the robot and the server allows the server to track the robot's movement. © 2021 IEEE.","Dadi, H.; Al-Haidous, M.; Radwi, N.; Ismail, L.","5th World Conference on Smart Trends in Systems Security and Sustainability, WorldS4 2021",610,8

Since early July 2021, SARS-CoV-2 cases in the United States have increased coincident with delta SARS-CoV-2 becoming the predominant lineage nationwide [3]. Understanding how and why the virus is spreading in settings where there is high vaccine coverage has important public health implications. It is particularly important to assess whether vaccinated individuals who become infected can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. In Wisconsin, a large local contract laboratory provides SARS-CoV-2 testing for multiple local health departments, providing a single standard source of data using the same assay to measure virus burdens in test-positive cases. This includes providing high-volume testing in Dane County, a county with extremely high vaccine coverage. These PCR-based tests provide semi-quantitative information about the viral load, or amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in respiratory specimens. Here we use this viral load data to compare the amount of SARS-CoV-2 present in test-positive specimens from people who self-report their vaccine status and date of final immunization, during a period in which the delta variant became the predominant circulating variant in Wisconsin. We find no difference in viral loads when comparing unvaccinated individuals to those who have vaccine ""breakthrough"" infections. Furthermore, individuals with vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive with viral loads consistent with the ability to shed infectious viruses. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that if vaccinated individuals become infected with the delta variant, they may be sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to others.","Riemersma, K. K.; Grogan, B.

It has been shown that in diabetes patients, covid-19 occurs in a more severe form, with these patients being more prone to the need for mechanical ventilation and having higher mortality rates than non-diabetic patients. In the present article, we describe possible pathophysiological mechanisms that could explain a more severe course of covid-19 in diabetes patients. We also describe the recommendations for use and discontinuation of anti-diabetic drugs during infection, and continue by explaining how to adjust the management of this chronic disease during an epidemic. In conclusion, our own experience in organizing outpatient diabetes clinic during the covid-19 epidemic at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana is described. Covid-19 still carries many unknowns, so it will not surprise us, if we soon realize that the findings described so far, are outdated. Nonetheless, the present recommendations for the treatment of diabetes patients during the epidemic will remain in force and will hopefully help to improve and optimize the treatment of our patients, even after the pandemic.","Janic, M.; Lunder, M.; Janez, A.",Zdravniski Vestnik,610,16

The traffic on the cloud servers or Host machines is unpredictable, and the demand may increase or decrease with a great variations many times. Even there are lots of reasons of such variations in traffic, here we are not going to discuss such reasons. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the meetings, teaching–learning, documents exchanging, etc. are performed using online applications. It is noticed that the both data and processing load are increased in multiple times during the last six months on the social networking sites, and clients faced the problem of low connectivity and slow processing of applications. These cases show that there is very great requirement of load balancing of computing resources on cloud servers to maintain the smooth processing of tasks. In this paper, our main focus is to measure the impacts of scheduling interval on dynamic resource allocation and to calculate the demand of resources dynamically on the basis of dynamic creation or deletion of virtual machines to serve the cloudlet load efficiently. Dynamic resource scaling can be done either horizontally or vertically. In horizontal dynamic resource scaling, the Host machines are equipped with the more number of resources rather than increasing the number of Host machines. In cloud computing, the service provider’s intention is to provide a cost-effective and efficient service support to its clients. The resources and services in cloud computing are on the pay-per-use basis, and hence, the horizontal dynamic resource scaling provides a good cost-effective solution for the resource requirement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Chaturvedi, A.

Aims : We sought to analyze outcome data and identify risk factors associated with mortality in children with heart disease and grown-ups with congenital heart disease (GUCH) who had a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Settings and Design : This is a retrospective, multicentric, observational study. Materials and Methods : The study included children with heart disease and GUCH population, who presented with either symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection to any of the participating centers. COVID-19-negative patients admitted to these centers constituted the control group. Results : From 24 pediatric cardiac centers across India, we included 94 patients with a median age of 12.5 (interquartile range 3–96) months and 49 (52.1%) patients were males. Majority (83 patients, 88.3%) were children. One-third of the patients (n = 31, 33.0%) had acyanotic congenital heart disease, and 41.5% (n = 39) were cyanotic, with > 80% of the patients being unoperated. Only 30 (31.9%) patients were symptomatic for COVID-19 infection, while the rest were incidentally detected positive on screening. A total of 13 patients died (case fatality rate: 13.8%).

Yet, their potential for reducing disease spread are poorly understood as the necessary theoretical framework for estimating epidemiological effects arising from gene editing applications is currently lacking. Here, we develop semi-stochastic modelling approaches to investigate how the adoption of gene editing may affect infectious disease prevalence in farmed animal populations and the prospects and time-scale for disease elimination. We apply our models to the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome PRRS, one of the most persistent global livestock diseases to date. Whereas extensive control efforts have shown limited success, recent production of gene-edited pigs that are fully resistant to the PRRS virus have raised expectations for eliminating this deadly disease. Our models predict that disease elimination on a national scale would be difficult to achieve if gene editing was used as the only disease control. However, when complemented with vaccination, the introduction of 10% of genetically resistant animals in a fraction of herds could be sufficient for eliminating the disease within 3-6 years. Besides strategic distribution of genetically resistant animals, several other key determinants underpinning the epidemiological impact of gene-editing were identified.","Leony Petersen, Gertje Eta; Buntjer, Jaap; Hely, Fiona S.; Byrne, Timothy John; Whitelaw, Bruce; Doeschl-Wilson, Andrea",bioRxiv,610,1

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its socioeconomic consequences, the needs of marginalized people have increased worldwide in terms of access to services and relevant information. In the Netherlands, along with the Red Cross, other humanitarian organizations such as the Salvation Army, the Rainbow Foundation, and the Foundation for the Homeless are already providing people in need with primary needs such as food and housing, but also with healthcare and legal support. Cooperation between services for the homeless is also gaining attention. However, collaboration between relevant stakeholders is still insufficient and urges to be expanded. Moreover, centralized monitoring is challenging as different services are provided (shelters, assisted housing) by different stakeholders and there is no central data collection system or pre-defined indicators. Recent, comprehensive data on homelessness figures are needed to understand the needs and how these may have changed, given the exacerbated consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on those in socioeconomic vulnerability, in order safeguard the health, safety and dignity of homeless people. Policy Options: To address the needs of homeless people, innovation is needed to overcome sectoral boundaries and to work collaboratively. At the level of service provision, as shown by some successful global experiences (e.g. Homeless Individuals and Families Information System (HIFIS), Housing First, Les Infirmières de la Rue), new partnerships and collaborations are a central dimension of many effective innovative initiatives relating to homelessness.

On the one hand, SW enables people to benefit from greater work flexibility, advancing individual control over organizational activities. On the other hand, it may impair interpersonal exchanges at work, disrupting job meaningfulness. Hence, the implications of SW on work meaningfulness are investigated through the mediating role of interpersonal exchanges at work. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate both the direct and indirect effects of SW on employees' perceived meaningfulness at work. Secondary data come from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey. The study encompasses a sample of 30,932 employees. A mediation model based on ordinary least square regressions and bootstrap sampling is designed to obtain evidence of SW's implications on meaningfulness at work through the mediating role of interpersonal relationships (IR). Findings The research findings suggest that SW triggers a positive sense of the significance of work. However, it negatively affects IR with peers and supervisors, entailing professional and spatial isolation. Impaired IR twists the positive implications of SW on organizational meaningfulness (OM), curtailing the employees' sense of significance at work. Practical implications SW is a double-edged sword. It contributes to the enrichment of OM, enhancing the individual self-determination to shape the spatial context of work. However, its side effects on interpersonal exchanges generate a drift toward organizational meaninglessness. Tailored management interventions intended to sustain IR at work are needed to fit the design of SW arrangements to the employees' evolving social needs. Originality/value The paper pushes forward what is currently known about the implications of SW on OM, examining them through the mediating role of IR at work.","Palumbo, R.; Flamini, G.; Gnan, L.; Pellegrini, M.

Methods: We collected data on NPIs, using government notifications and news reports, in six major Indian states from March to August 2020, and we matched these with district-level data on COVID related deaths and Google Mobility reports. We used a district fixed effect regression approach to measure the extent to which district-level lockdowns and mobility restrictions helped reduce deaths in 2020. Results: In most states, COVID deaths grew most rapidly only after the initial lockdown was lifted. District-level NPIs were associated with a statistically significantly lower COVID death count in three out of five sample states (district analysis was not possible in Delhi) and in the aggregate. Interventions that were most associated with slowing fatalities were temple closures, retail closures, and curfews. Discussion: Outside of Maharashtra (the first state struck) the first fatality wave appears to have been delayed by the national lockdown.

In summary, the lesions were localized in the pons in 52.9% of the cases, 17.7% were in the thalamus and/or the basal ganglia, 17.7% in the mesencephalon and respectively 5.8% in the temporal and occipital lobe.

Lockdowns have coincided with and strongly impacted the industrial transformation processes that have been taking place for a decade. Among the most important HoReCa transition processes are those related to the rapid growth of the delivery-food market and ordering meals via internet platforms. The new delivery-food market requires not only the development of specific distribution channels, but also the introduction of appropriate, very specific food packaging. Food packaging and its functionality are defined by the administrative requirements and standards applicable to materials that have contact with food and principally through the prism of the ecological disaster caused by enormous amounts of plastic waste, mainly attributed to the food packaging. To meet environmental and administrative requirements, new technologies to produce food packaging materials are emerging, ensuring product functionality, low environmental impact, biodegradability, and potential for composting of the final product. However, predominantly, the obtained product should keep the nutritional value of food and protect it against changes in color or shape. Current social transformation has a significant impact on the food packaging sector, on one hand creating a new lifestyle for society all over the world, and on the other, a growing awareness of the negative impact of humans on the environment and increasing responsibility for the planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to develop a circular economy based on the paradigm of shortening distribution channels, using local raw materials, limiting the consumption of raw materials, energy, water, and above all, minimizing waste production throughout the life cycle of products, all of which are in line with the idea of low-carbon development.","Kochańska, Ewa Łukasik Rafał M.; Dzikuć, Maciej",Energies,610,24

Here, we show that a combination of enhanced polymerase activity and HA stability is necessary for efficient airborne transmission in ferrets and that minor variants containing both properties are quickly selected. P4 and G15 were found to have decreased polymerase activity and relatively poor HA stability, respectively. Polymerase-enhancing variant PA-S321 was selected in half of P4 isolates that airborne-transmitted in ferrets. HA-stabilizing variant HA1-S210 was selected in all G15-inoculated ferrets and was transmitted. With an efficient polymerase and a stable HA, purified G15-HA1-S210 had earlier and higher peak titers in inoculated ferrets and was recovered at a higher frequency after airborne transmission than P4 and G15.

Participants and Methods: From July 2019 to June 2020, we surveyed Health Care Workers (HCW) pre and post COVID19 in an independent local community hospital for burnout with the Health Care Provider Wellness Assessment tool. Linear regression and means comparison were used to identify overall job demand and resource perception with burnout, unique stressor portraits by provider subtype and mean survey scores between those who did or did not voluntarily complete at least 14 days of a 28 day novel self-help intervention tool. Results: Regarding the pre COVID-19 data, of 73 respondents, there was statistically significant (p<.01) correlation between overall job demands (directly) and resources (inversely) with burnout intensity. With respect to the HCW stressor characteristic analyses there was statistical significance (p<.05) between the mean frequency occurrence of the top 5 stressors identified by respondent subtype when compared to the mean occurrence of overall individual responses within the corresponding subtype. Finally, although limited by a low number of respondents, the intervention tool analysis suggested a therapeutic trend toward disruption of the stress-burnout relationship. Regarding the post COVID-19 data, 18 respondents did not show statistically significant characterizable stressor portraits (ie stressors were present but not patternable). Conclusion: Unique stressor portraits were identified by HCW subtype which correlated with more intense burnout self-perception.

In this paper, by clustering multiple users into independent communities based on their geographic locations, we design a 5G-enabled UAV-to-community offloading system. A system throughput maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the transmission rate, atomicity of tasks and speed of UAVs. By relaxing the transmission rate constraint, the mixed integer non-linear program is transformed into two sub-problems. We first develop an average throughput maximization-based auction algorithm to determine the trajectory of UAVs, where a community-based latency approximation algorithm is developed to regulate the designed auction bidding. Then, a dynamic task admission algorithm is proposed to solve the task scheduling subproblem within one community. Performance analyses demonstrate that our designed auction bidding can guarantee user truthfulness, and can be fulfilled in polynomial time. Extensive simulations based on real-world data in health monitoring and online YouTube video services show that our proposed algorithm is able to maximize the system throughput while guaranteeing the fraction of served users.

This issue had not been studied on a broader international level earlier. This research firstly discovers altruism and volunteerism values in the economy. Then, based on the third-party model, observes each part, where participants are the (1) volunteer (employee) (2) company (and its CSR activity) and (3) an external organization, which manages this type of formal volunteerism. Each participant was analyzed through comprehensive analysis using descriptive and inference statistics and classification methods on complex, extensive secondary databases. Altogether, more than 10,000 respondents’ answers are examined from two worldwide surveys, and further ten international statistical indicators and indices are explored. These methods result in volunteer characteristics on a personal level, afterwards in country classification, which provides a cultural comparison of the employee volunteerism. Our findings prove that demographical differences do not, but company-level actions influence the intensity of formal volunteerism. Moreover, three main clusters (formed from 43 countries) show different values. This diversity might partly be caused by measurement fragmentations and lack of internationally accepted definitions and theories. This paper aims to provide a broader overview of the topic, which might be a useful starting point for the forthcoming aggregated conceptualization. Employee volunteers’ behavior arises from the personal value of volunteerism. However, the attendance and intensity of voluntary activity are primarily influenced by the environment (e.g., life period, living and working situation). Employee volunteerism programs are an important and essential part of CSR at the company level, and strongly frames this activity, where employee volunteerism could associate each participant’s interests and improve their values. However, the practices may differ in each country and in each sector. The current pandemic rewrote the traditional volunteerism model and our projection.

In this retrospective study from a reference diabetes centre (Krakow, Poland), we compared patient data from two different time periods: the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 - June 2020) and the preceding five months (October 2019 - February 2020). Data was collected from the medical records and telephone surveys. No patient was diagnosed with concomitant COVID-19. We included 155 women - Group 1 N=73 and Group 2 N= 82 from the COVID-19 pandemic period and non-COVID-19 period, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost half of all GDM women (N1=36, 49.3%) used telemedicine as a method of contacting their diabetic specialist while this tool was not utilized in the earlier period. Moreover, these patients reported difficulties in performing blood glucose self-control more often (N1=20, 27.4% vs. N2=7, 8.5% p=0.002) and spent less time on diabetes education and training than the control group on average (N1=39, 53.4% vs. N2=9, 9.8% below 2 hours of training;p≤0.001).

Background: During recovery from COVID surges, hospitals must plan for multiple patient populations vying for inpatient capacity, so that they maintain access for emergency department (ED) patients while enabling time-sensitive scheduled procedures to go forward. To guide pandemic recovery planning, we implemented a model to predict hospital occupancy for COVID and non-COVID patients. Methods: At a quaternary care hospital in New England, we included hospitalizations from March 10 to July 12, 2020 and subdivided them into COVID, non-COVID nonscheduled (NCNS), and non-COVID scheduled operating room (OR) hospitalizations. For the recovery period from May 25 to July 12, the model made daily hospital occupancy predictions for each population. The primary outcome was the daily mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) when comparing the predicted versus actual occupancy. Results: There were 444 COVID, 5637 NCNS, and 1218 non-COVID scheduled OR hospitalizations during the recovery period. For all populations, the MAPE and MAE for total occupancy were 2.8% or 22.3 hospitalizations per day;for general care, 2.6% or 17.8 hospitalizations per day;and for intensive care unit, 9.7% or 11.0 hospitalizations per day. Conclusions: The model was accurate in predicting hospital occupancy during the recovery period. Such models may aid hospital recovery planning so that enough capacity is maintained to care for ED hospitalizations while ensuring scheduled procedures can efficiently return.","Hu, M.; Copenhaver, M.; Langle, A.

In immunocompromised persons after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) the BKV high-rate replication is associated with haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) with a reported incidence of 17 %. Numerous studies of reconstitution of the immune system after HSCT have established the principal role of T cell effectors in the control of viral replication and reactivation. The value of pretransplant BKV-specific antibodies in transplanted patients for the protection from viral disease was long considered insignificant. We hypothesized that the status of BKV immunity prior to HSCT could provide evidence for the BKV tendency to reactivate and that examining the level of subtype-specific antibodies and T-cell response in individual patients could help to predict the risk of BKV reactivation and HC. Evaluation of the risk of HC in relation to pretransplant anti-BKV1,2,4 IgG levels together with clinical factors known before transplantation revealed that patients with medium anti-BKV IgG and significant clinical risk (SR) have a very significantly increased HC risk in comparison with the reference group of low anti-BKV IgG level and low clinical risk (LR) (P=0.0009). Analysis of pretransplant T cell immunity to BKV antigens VP1 and LTag has shown that magnitude of IFN-gamma T cell response inversely corelated with posttransplant DNAuria. We hypothesize that the control of BKV latency by BKV specific T cells before HSCT would be one of the factors that influence BKV reactivation after HSCT. Our study has shown that prediction using a combination of clinical and immunological pretransplant risk factors can help early identification of patients who are at risk of developing BKV disease after HSCT.","Stastna-Markova, M.; Hamsikova, E.; Hainz, P.; Hubacek, P.; Kroutilova, M.; Krystofova, J.; Ludvikova, V.; Musil, J.; Pecherkova, P.; Salakova, M.; Sroller, V.; Vydra, J.; Nemeckova, S.",,610,1

A recent study (Meltzer et al., 2020) demonstrated Vitamin D deficiency may increase risk of COVID-19 infection, and a small randomized controlled trial in Spain reported significant improvement in mortality among hospitalized patients treated with calcifediol. Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in two leading causes of cancer deaths: breast and prostate. In this study, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis on nationally representative electronic medical records (EMR) to assess whether Vitamin D deficiency affects risk of COVID-19 among these patients. Methods: Patients with breast (female) or prostate (male) cancer were identified between 3/1/2018 and 3/1/2020 from EMR data provided pro-bono by the COVID-19 Research Database (covid19researchdatabase.org ). Patients with an ICD-10 code for Vitamin D deficiency or < 20ng/mL 20(OH)D laboratory result within 12 months prior to 3/1/2020 were classified as Vitamin D deficient. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined using ICD-10 codes and laboratory results for COVID-19 at any time after 3/1/2020. Logistic regressions, adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, were conducted to estimate the effect of Vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 incidence in each cancer cohort. Results: A total of 16,287 breast cancer and 14,919 prostate cancer patients were included in the study. The average age was 68.9 years in the breast cancer cohort and 73.6 years in the prostate cancer cohort. The breast cancer cohort consisted of 85% Whites, 13% Black or African Americans, and less than 5% of other races. A similar race distribution was observed in the prostate cancer cohort. Unadjusted analysis showed the risk of COVID-19 was higher among Vitamin D deficient patients compared to non-deficient patients in both cohorts (breast: OR = 1.60 [95% C.I.: 1.15, 2.20];prostate: OR = 1.59 [95% C.I.: 1.08, 2.33]). Similar findings were observed when assessed in subgroups of patients with newly diagnosed cancer in the dataset, as well as after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Conclusions: Our study suggests breast and prostate cancer patients may have an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection if Vitamin D deficient. These results support findings by Meltzer et al., 2020 demonstrating a relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection. While a randomized clinical trial is warranted to confirm the role for Vitamin D supplementation in preventing COVID-19, our study underscores the importance of monitoring Vitamin D levels across and within cancer populations, particularly in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Galaznik, A.; Rusli, E.; Wing, V.; Jain, R.; Diamond, S.; Fajgenbaum, D.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,610,17

Participants held various roles, ranging from state agency leaders to front-line supervisors, although most were district-level directors or assistant directors. Analysis Data were analyzed using a phenomenological qualitative analytic approach. Results Four themes emerged. First, participants described the progression of the initial shock associated with the pandemic and service disruption, the flexibility they practiced, and the development of new routines. Second, keeping people (children, coworkers, and the community) safe was highlighted. The next theme captured participants' feeling that they came ""out of the shadows"" as communities and stakeholders recognized their important contribution to children's food security. Finally, they shared insight on communication and accountability during the emergency feeding response. Conclusions These programs demonstrated flexibility, resilience, and commitment to children during this crisis. As the pandemic continues and future disasters are considered, school nutrition programs and leaders can use the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction's ""build back better"" concept to refine disaster preparedness plans and advocate for changes that will continue to combat child food insecurity in the United States.","Patten, E.

How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC-SIGN have not been reported. Here, we develop and apply a mass spectrometry-based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O-glycans on the stability of DC-SIGN. We first quantify the Core 1 & 2 O-glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein via sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. We then use ion mobility mass spectrometry to show how specific O-glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas-phase stability of the glycoprotein isoforms of DC-SIGN. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC-SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites. Collectively, our results exemplify a combined multi-dimensional MS approach, proficient in evaluating protein stability in response to both glycoprotein macro- and micro-heterogeneity and adding structural detail to the infection enhancer DC-SIGN.","Yen, Hsin-Yung; Liko, Idlir; Gault, Joseph; Wu, Di; Struwe, Weston B.; Robinson, Carol V.",bioRxiv,610,25

In this study, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption and of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping when primary data is not available. Making use of a unique global data set, we show that the proposed models can explain up to 78% of the variation in insufficient food consumption and crisis or above food-based coping levels. We also show that the proposed models can be used to nowcast the food security situation in near-real time and propose a method to identify which variables are driving the changes observed in predicted trends, which is key to make predictions serviceable to decision makers.","Martini, G.; Bracci, A.; Jaiswal, S.; Corea, M.; Riches, L.; Rivers, J.; Omodei, E.",,610,1

HCQ and closely related chloroquine (CQ) have known ocular and cardiac toxicity. However, although screening guidance now exists from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists for the former (RCOphth)1, little is known regarding predictors of both forms of toxicity. Objectives: To systematically explore the literature on predictors of toxicity limited to cardiac and ocular toxicity. Methods: A detailed search of the following databases was conducted: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane library, EMCare and Academic Search Premier. Studies addressing predictors of HCQ toxicity with relevant search terms used were included. Exclusion criteria were: non-English articles, pre-clinical and paediatric studies. Three authors (SR, NC, PK) independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, ensuring each article was screened twice. Disagreement over inclusion was adjudicated by senior reviewers (EN, JG). Data extraction (SR, NC, PK) focused on predictors of toxicity. Results: The search strategy retrieved 3103 studies. 147 studies were included for data extraction, of which 92 were eventually excluded due to: not identifying predictors (n=17), reviews (n=19), not ocular or cardiovascular toxicity (n=18), case reports (n=3), paediatrics (n=1), screening articles that focused on detecting retinopathy (n=30), article unobtainable at time of abstract submission (n=4), leaving 55 studies for full review. Studies addressing cardiac toxicity (n=16) included: cohort, retrospective observational, a comparative pharmacovigilance, systematic monitoring protocol and a randomised control trial (RCT). The majority of these involved high-dose (>5mg/ kg/day) use for acute COVID-19 infection. The main significant predictors identified were: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use in combination with azithromycin (6/7 studies), cumulative dose (2 studies), pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity (2/3 studies) and prolonged baseline QTc (2 studies). Individual associations were also identified in the following: longer treatment duration, daily dosage, increased age, male gender, severe COVID-19 infection, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and concurrent use of loop-diuretics. Regarding predictors of ocular toxicity (n=39), only one study was a RCT. The remainder were observational studies: case-control, cohort, retrospective chart reviews and letters to the editor which included original patient data. Several predictors of retinopathy and maculopathy were examined in two or more studies and included: duration of use (16/18 studies), daily dosage (7/13 studies), cumulative dose (11/14 studies), increased age (10/11 studies), body weight or BMI (3/5 studies), renal impairment (5 studies), HCQ blood levels (2 studies), keratopathy (2 studies) and tamoxifen use (2 studies). Sex (2 studies) and history of cataract surgery (2 studies) were not found to be predictors of toxicity. Only few studies performed regression analysis presenting odds and/or hazard ratios with confidence intervals. Conclusion: The most recognised predictor of cardiac toxicity was co-administration with azithromycin. In ocular toxicity, commonly cited predictors included those already recognised by the RCOphth1, as well as cumulative dose, increased age, weight considerations, HCQ blood levels and keratopathy. Further research is warranted on better characterising predictors of cardiac and ocular toxicity in patients on HCQ and CQ therapy.","Citeroni, N.; Rampes, S.; Kotecha, P.; Schoones, J.; Nikiphorou, E.; Galloway, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,610,22

Through these vlogs developers share a rich perspective of their technical work as well their personal lives. However, does the type of activities portrayed in vlogs differ from activities developers in the industry perform? Would developers at a software company prefer to show activities to different extents if they were asked to share about their day through vlogs? To answer these questions, we analyzed 130 vlogs by software developers on YouTube and conducted a survey with 335 software developers at a large software company. We found that although vlogs present traditional development activities such as coding and code peripheral activities (11%), they also prominently feature wellness and lifestyle related activities (47.3%) that have not been reflected in previous software engineering literature. We also found that developers at the software company were inclined to share more non-coding tasks (e.g., personal projects, time spent with family and friends, and health) when asked to create a mock-up vlog to promote diversity. These findings demonstrate a shift in our understanding of how software developers are spending their time and find valuable to share publicly. We discuss how vlogs provide a more complete perspective of software development work and serve as a valuable source of data for empirical research.","Chattopadhyay, Souti; Zimmermann, Thomas; Ford, Denae",,610,1

Treatment of patients with lung cancer during the current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging and development of drugs for COVID-19 and lung cancer is urgently needed. Cathepsin L plays key role in lung cancer progression, invasion and more so, endocytosis of SARS-Cov-2 virus into the lung epithelial cells. Importantly, patients with KrasG12V mutation show agreessive disease and high-resistance to chemotherapy due to over-expression of Cathepsin L. Thus, Cathepsin L is a common target for lung cancer and COVID-19 infection. Chymostatin is a known cathepsin L inhibitor, here we screened it for dual inhibition of COVID-19 Mpro and lung cancer patients with COVID-19. In vitro COVID-19 Mpro fluorometric assay was performed to evaluate its inhibitory efficacy by chymostatin. Chymostatin showed dose-dependent inhibition of COVID-19 Mpro activity with IC50 of 15.81 μ M (P<0.0001). Isothermal titration calorimetry based binding studies determined that chymostatin strongly bound to COVID-19 Mpro (KD=22.45 μ M). CD spectrum analysis demonstrated that chymostatin (10 μ M)-induced changes in the secondary structure of COVID-19 Mpro. A unit cell crystal parameter COVID-19 Mpro co-crystalized with chymostatin (a = 49.926 Å, b = 108.71 Å, c = 56.49 Å, α = 90.0°, β = 102.7553°, γ = 90.0°;unit cell volume: 299.03 Ao) was determined using X-ray diffractometer. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that chymostatin interacts with active site amino acids (Cys145). Pro-apoptotic effect of chymostatin was evaluated on human H441 lung cancer cells and mouse lung normal epithelial cells using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Chymostatin did not show any cytotoxicity on normal mouse lung epithelial cells up to 100 μ M, where as it inhibited proliferation of human H441 lung cancer cells (KrasG12V mutant) with IC50 of 12 μ M. In conclusion, preliminary in vitro studies demonstrated that naturally occurring cathepsin L inhibitor chymostatin is a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor and exhibited anticancer activity against lung cancer cells. The results of the study warranted detailed studies to develop as drugs for lung cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic (supported by VPR-PHF, the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Centre for financial support through COVID-19 seed grant program).","Yarla, N.

The emergence of strains of SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting increase viral fitness and immune escape potential, such as the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), raises concerns in immunocompromised patients. To what extent Delta evades vaccine-induced immunity in immunocompromised individuals with systemic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases (cases) and controls receiving two doses of BNT162b2. Primary end points were anti-spike antibodies levels and cross-neutralization of Alpha and Delta variants after BNT162b2 vaccine. Secondary end points were T-cell responses, breakthrough infections and safety. Results. Sixty-four cases and 21 controls not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Kinetics of anti-spike IgG and IgA after BNT162b2 vaccine showed lower and delayed induction in cases, more pronounced with rituximab. Administration of two doses of BNT162b2 generated a neutralizing response against Alpha and Delta in 100% of controls, while sera from only one of rituximab-treated patients neutralized Alpha (5%) and none Delta. Other therapeutic regimens induced a partial neutralizing activity against Alpha, even lower against Delta. All controls and cases except those treated with methotrexate mounted a SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response. Methotrexate abrogated T-cell responses after one dose and dramatically impaired T-cell responses after 2 doses of BNT162b2. Conclusions. Rituximab and methotrexate differentially impact the immunogenicity of BNT162b2, by impairing B-cell and T-cell responses, respectively. Delta fully escapes the humoral response of individuals treated with rituximab. These findings support efforts to improve BNT162b2 immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals (Funded by the Fonds IMMUNOV; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04870411).","Hadjadj, J.; Planas, D.; Ouedrani, A.; Buffier, S.; Delage, L.; Nguyen, Y.; Bruel, T.; Stolzenberg, M.-C.; STAROPOLI, I.; Ermak, N.; Macraigne, L.; Morbieu, C.; Henriquez, S.; Veyer, D.; Pere, H.; Casadevall, M.; Mouthon, L.; Rieux-Laucat, F.; Chatenoud, L.; Schwartz, O.; Terrier, B.",,610,26

We aimed to evaluate the relationships between the anatomical location of stimulation fields and clinical responses including therapeutic and side effects. Methods: We collected data from eight TS patients treated with DBS. We evaluated the clinical outcomes using Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The DBS lead location was evaluated in the normalised brain space using a 3-D atlas. The volume of tissue activated (VTA) was determined, and the associated normative connective analyses were performed to link the stimulation field with the therapeutic and side effects. Results: The mean follow-up period was 10.9 {+/-} 3.9 months. All clinical scale showed significant significant improvement. While the VTA associated with therapeutic effects covers the CM and ventrolateral nuclei and showed association with motor networks, those associated with paraesthesia and dizziness were associated with stimulation of the ventralis caudalis and red nucleus, respectively. Depressed mood was associated with the spread of stimulation current to the mediodorsal nucleus and showed association with limbic networks. Conclusion: Our study addresses the importance of accurate implantation of DBS electrodes for obtaining standardised clinical outcomes and suggests that meticulous programming with careful monitoring of clinical symptoms may improve outcomes.","Morishita, T.; Sakai, Y.; Iida, H.; Yoshimura, S.; Ishii, A.; Fujioka, S.; Tanaka, S.; Inoue, T.",,610,16

Using databases, newspaper columns, government websites, and legislation, we outline the region's travel restrictions and exceptions, closures and militarization of borders, internal movement procedures, and economic subsidies to ease Covid-19's impact. While the regional mobility regime had already been under stress since 2015, exceptions to border closures and internal mobility further stratified people based on legal and economic statuses. Deeply affecting individual-state relations, access to mobility and citizenship rights such as labor, housing, and healthcare varied between nationals and non-nationals and between regular and irregular migrants.

What regulates the fate of these cells and to what extent they can assume the identity and function of resident macrophages remains unclear. We compared the normal fate of inflammation-elicited macrophages in the peritoneal cavity with their potential under non-inflamed conditions and in the absence of established resident macrophages. Following mild inflammation, elicited macrophages persisted for at least 5 months but failed to fully assume a GATA6hi resident identity due to the presence of enduring resident cells. In contrast, severe inflammation resulted in ablation of resident macrophages and a protracted phase wherein the cavity was incapable of sustaining a resident phenotype, yet ultimately elicited cells acquired a mature GATA6hi identity. Elicited macrophages also exhibited divergent features resulting from inflammation-driven alterations to the peritoneal cavity micro-environment and environment-independent features related to origin and time-of-residency. Critically, one environment-dependent feature of inflammation-elicited macrophages irrespective of severity of inflammation was a failure to produce the chemokine CXCL13, which correlated with a progressive loss in accumulation of peritoneal B1 cells post-inflammation. Hence, rather than being predetermined, the fate of inflammation-elicited peritoneal macrophages appears largely regulated by environment, changes in which result in long-term alteration in function of the peritoneal macrophage compartment post-inflammation.","Louwe, P.

The unknown nature of the disease and the fear of contagion have caused emotional reactions, including the self-consumption of drugs in the elderly. Therefore, this study investigated factors affecting the self-consumption of drugs for COVID-19 prevention in the elderly. Methods & Materials This descriptive and cross-sectional study was performed on 342 elderly in Sabzevar City, Iran, in 2020. The research units were selected as clusters from 16 health centers. The necessary data were collected by an online self-medication questionnaire. Data analysis was performed in SPSS. Results The Mean±SD age of the study participants was 66.2±5.67 years. The frequency of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 was 190(55.5%);analgesics, vitamins, anti-cold, and antibiotics were the most common drugs used. The major factors associated with self-medication in the COVID-19 pandemic were disease prevention, home quarantine, financial problems, experiencing previous self-medication, and others' advice. There was a significant relationship between self-medication and education and insurance coverage. No significant relationship was observed between gender, occupation, and marital status, and self-medication. Conclusion Self-Medication in the COVID-19 epidemic is notable as a crisis threatening the elderly's health.

That time coronaviruses were considered as a quite serious veterinary problem but they were not believed to become highly dangerous for humans. However, such ideas were revised in 2002 when SARS-CoV was transferred to human population in the Southeast Asia assumably from the bats, and later in 2012 when natural focus of the MERS-CoV was discovered in the Arabian countries. Using PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google scholar, the authors searched for various research and review articles using the combination of terms “coronavirus, Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, taxonomy”.

Since then taxonomic structures of coronaviruses underwent significant changes. This review is focused on the need for continued monitoring of the biological diversity of coronaviruses. The structural studies of coronaviruses regardless of the host species may allow us to identify early changes that can affect the evolutionary drift process of a particular HCoV species involved in viral transmission from bats or birds to humans. Taking into account the migratory abilities of bats and especially birds, it is necessary to not only to include coronaviruses in the ecological monitoring programs, but also to expand the scope and depth of environmental and virological monitoring. © 2021 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

The quality of children's natural humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet incompletely understood but crucial to guide pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. Methods: In this prospective observational multi-center cohort study, we followed 328 households, consisting of 548 children and 717 adults, with at least one member with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serological response was assessed at 3-4 months and 11-12 months after infection using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay for 23 human coronavirus antigens including SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants of Concern (VOC) and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and additionally by three commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Results: Overall, 33.76% of SARS-CoV-2 exposed children and 57.88% adults were seropositive. Children were five times more likely to have seroconverted without symptoms compared to adults. Despite the frequently asymptomatic course of infection, children had higher specific antibody levels, and their antibodies persisted longer than in adults (96.22% versus 82.89% still seropositive 11-12 months post infection). Of note, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections induced similar humoral responses in all age groups. In symptomatic children, only dysgeusia was found as diagnostic indicator of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred independent of HCoV serostatus. Antibody binding responses to VOCs were similar in children and adults, with reduced binding for the Beta variant in both groups. Conclusions: The long-term humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is robust and may provide long-term protection even after asymptomatic infection.

In addition, there is an increasing demand for products with high cocoa content and organic chocolates. International commodity price fluctuations and the COVID-19 pandemic have had negative impact on global market prices also influencing the efficiency of circular economy. Therefore, cocoa production chain faces the challenge of finding sustainable ways to increase production while meeting the demands of modern society. Innovative developments in this area include adding value to residues, which account for approximately 80% of the fruit. Cocoa honey is a translucent juice produced during the cocoa fermentation process, with chemical and sensory characteristics similar to cocoa pulp. This juice has high contents of pectin, minerals, and fructose and technological potential to develop new products is foreseen. Its sweet taste, for instance, can be exploited in food preparations as a natural substitute for refined sugar.

[1-4] Taking into account the lack of effective drugs to treat the COVID-19 and despite the burdensome and costly lockdown measures adopted to counteract the spread of SARS-CoV-2, effective and safe vaccines appear reasonably to be the best strategy for fighting the virus. [6] Before vaccines availability, several reports showed that a non-negligible proportion of subjects, among the general population or within specific categories, would have refused vaccination against COVID-19 once possible;[6, 7] data on vaccination hesitation among patients with RMD are not available yet. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the attitude of patients with RMDs to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the factors which may influence it. Methods: During the first weeks of Europe vaccination campaign, we proposed an online survey to Italian adult patients with RMDs followed up in the Rheumatology Unit. All patients fulfilled the most recent classification criteria for each disease. HCs were recruited using a “best friend” system. The informed consent was collected for all participants. The questionnaires included the following items: demographic features, presence of comorbidities, educational level, and ongoing therapy. The individual's perception of the COVID-19 vaccination, as well as the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination with targeted questions was properly assessed. For the statistical analyses, Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests were used. To account for baseline clinical differences among RMD-patients and controls, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used;covariates were selected according to a clinical criterion. The hypothesis that willingness for COVID-19 vaccine varied in specific subgroups of patients was tested using interaction terms at logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were performed using the RStudio graphical interface and all tests were two-sided with a significance level set at p<0.05. Results: We provided an online survey to 830 adult RMD-patients and 370 healthy controls (HCs). Overall, 626 RMD-patients and 345 HCs completed the survey. Patients with RMDs were less willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccination compared to HCs (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 -0.34, p<0.0001) despite they perceived themselves as at higher risk both to get infected (OR 11.3, 95% CI 8 -15.9, p<0.0001) and develop a severe COVID-19 (OR 11.06, 95% CI 7.8 -15.6, p<0.0001) and even if they had been vaccinated for influenza and pneumococcus more frequently than controls (OR 1.60 95% CI 1.18 -2.16, p=0.002;OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.34 -3.73, p=0.002). However, our results reveal that RMD-patients are more willing to change their minds if properly informed by the rheumatologist (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.19 -4.34, p<0.0001) in comparison to controls. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate for the first time that patients with RMDs are less willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination compared to the general population, despite perceiving themselves as at higher risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19. However, our data underscored a meaningful aspect: patients with RMDs may change their attitude to COVID-19 vaccination if properly informed about risks and benefits by their trusted specialist. The results of this study encourage the entire rheumatologist community to become more committed to patient education, increasing their willingness to COVID-19 vaccine, which is the most promising strategy to protect them from the virus.","Priori, R.; Pellegrino, G.; Colafrancesco, S.; Alessandri, C.; Ceccarelli, F.; Di Franco, M.; Riccieri, V.; Scrivo, R.; Sili Scavalli, A.; Spinelli, F.

As the incidence of cases currently decreases, questions remain about the potential impact of the delta variant already present in the city. Methods: We used an agent-based model calibrated to data on age-structured deaths and dominance of variants in Bogota. We used efficacy data for the portfolio of vaccines available, including known changes for SARS-CoV-2 variants. We modelled scenarios of early and delayed introduction of the delta variant in the city along with changes in mobility and social contact, and vaccine strategies over the next months. Findings: We estimate that by mid July, vaccination may have already prevented 17,800 (95% CrI: 16,000 - 19,000) deaths in Bogota. The delta variant could become dominant and lead to a fourth wave later in the year, but its timing will depend on the date of introduction, social mixing patterns, and vaccination strategy. In all scenarios, higher social mixing is associated with a fourth wave of considerable magnitude. If an early delta introduction occurred (dominance by mid July), a new wave may occur in August/September and in such case, age prioritization of vaccination and second dose not postponed are more important. However, if introduction occurred one or two months later (dominance by mid August/September) the age-prioritization is less relevant but maintaining the dose scheme without postponement is more important. In all scenarios we found that increasing the vaccination rate from the current average of 50,000/day to 100,000/day reduces the impact of a fourth wave due to the delta variant. Conclusions: In Bogota, the delta variant could still lead to a fourth wave, whose magnitude would depend on its introduction time and the level of social mixing. Its impact can be mitigated by increasing vaccination rates to achieve high coverage quickly, with non-delayed second doses. We found that, at this point, suspending the age prioritization to achieve higher coverage with first doses does not seem to have a major effect on deaths and ICU demand. But, delaying the second dose may not be beneficial and may even increase the incidence of severe outcomes.","Espana, G.; Cucunuba, Z.

Here we describe expanded chemistry for the Digital Spatial Profiling platform to quantify whole transcriptomes in human and mouse tissues using a wide range of spatial profiling strategies and sample types. We designed multiplexed in situ hybridization probe pools targeting the protein-coding genes in the human and mouse transcriptomes, hereafter referred to as the human or mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). We validated the human and mouse WTA assays using cell lines to demonstrate concordance with orthogonal gene expression profiling methods in profiled region sizes ranging from ∼10-500 cells. By benchmarking against bulk RNAseq and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate robust transcript detection possible down to ∼100 transcripts per region. To assess the performance of WTA across tissue and sample types, we applied WTA to biological questions in cancer, molecular pathology, and developmental biology. We show that spatial profiling with WTA can detect expected spatial gene expression differences between tumor and tumor microenvironment, identify spatial disease-specific heterogeneity in gene expression in histological structures of the human kidney, and comprehensively map transcriptional programs in anatomical substructures of nine organs in the developing mouse embryo.

Organizational resilience (OReg) and emotional intelligence (EI) discretely have been identified as indicators of employee performance (EP) over the years, but during the period of crisis, it has scarcely been analysed. Therefore, this study aims to examine the mediating role of EI on the relationship between OReg and EP in such a global pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 390 samples including teaching and non-teaching professionals working in higher educational institutions (HEIs) were collected from different HEIs located in India through online survey questionnaires. The collected data was further analysed using regression analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modelling along with bootstrapping technique, reliability and validity analysis, mediation analysis and model fit indices analysis. Findings: The results of the study confirmed the partial mediation effect of EI on the OReg-EP relationship, and further results also exhibited that employees with a higher level of EI, contribute more positively to the OReg level, which further enhances the performance level at the workplace. Research limitations/implications: The samples collected for the current study pertain to the HEIs only, and therefore the present study results have limited general applicability. Furthermore, the study does not investigate the influence of time. Practical implications: This study would assist practitioners of HEIs in improving the resilience capabilities of the organization. EP can be improved by enhancing the levels of OReg and individual emotional intelligence, which is in line with the findings of the current study. Social implications: In the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide the students are affected due to the transition to online teaching. This study will help HEI’s to cope up with the student’s loss by being flexible in approach for the retention of performance of employees by taking care of their emotional needs and focusing on their skill development by providing a learning culture in a depressing time of the pandemic so that students will not suffer due to this rapid change without any preparation or previous experience in a pandemic.

Infection is known as one of the common trigger factors for SLE. Coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), a severe acute respiratory syndrome, is now spreading rapidly throughout the world2.Though previous studies have addressed the susceptibility of lupus patients to the virus but how patients with SLE deal with COVID-19 is unclear up until now Objectives: To clarify the common pathogenesis of SLE and COVID-19, and find the appropriate treatment for Lupus and prevent COVID-19. Methods: The transcription profile of SLE (GSE38351) and COVID-19 (GSE161778) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). R package was used to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between lupus patients and HCs. After background adjustment and other pre-procession, DEGs were extracted from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 at three different disease progression(moderate, severe and remission status). The Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) was used to cluster and compare average DEGs with coherent changes. The different expression patterns of time-series genes (TSGs) were also compared among these patients. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of TSGs and DEGs were performed by Metascape. Results: Compared with HC, patients with SLE expressed 977 DEGs, which were mainly associated with defense response to virus, Epstein-Barr virus infection and response to interferon-γ(INF-γ) (Figure 1a). As for COVID-19 patients, there were 1584 DEGs obtained when compared with those of HCs (P < 0.05) (Figure 1b). Gene landscapes suggested the signatures of COVID-19 patients gradually changed during the disease progression, and gradually converge to HCs signatures. Time-series genes in the three stage of disease had different expression patterns and functions. A total of 959 TSGs in profile 3 showed a stable-stable-decreasing expression trend and significantly associated with INF signaling pathway (Figure 1c,1d). Interestingly, patients with SLE and COVID-19 shared common pathways such as INF-γ related functional pathway. Conclusion: INF-γ is an important common node of SLE and COVID-19. Controlling the production of INF-γ not only has therapeutic effect on SLE patients, but also may prevent COVID-19.","Li, Y.; Zhang, S.

Third, the emergence of innovative health technology has strengthened health system preparedness during the pandemic, and provide an opportunity to re-examine the strengths and deficiencies of an entire health system for better health care.","Aminullah, Erman Erman Erwiza",Technology in Society,610,33

This successful public event, as evidenced by the participation of more than 150 attendees, with 65 % from the ultraviolet technology industry, was part of an ongoing collaborative effort between NIST and the IUVA and its affiliates to examine the measurement and standards needs for pathogen abatement with UV-C in the healthcare whole-room environment. Prior to and since this event, stakeholders from industry, academia, government, and public health services have been collaboratively engaged with NIST to accelerate the development and use of accurate measurements and models for UV-C disinfection technologies and facilitate technology transfer. The workshop served as an open forum to continue this discussion with a technical focus centered on the effective design, use, and implementation of UV-C technologies for the prevention and treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in complex hospital settings. These settings include patient rooms, operating rooms, common staging areas, ventilation systems, personal protective equipment, and tools for the reprocessing and disinfecting of instruments or devices used in medical procedures, such as catheters and ventilators. The critical need for UV-C technologies for disinfection has been amplified by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stimulating an even greater emphasis on identifying testing and performance metrology needs. This paper discusses these topics based on the international workshop and community activities since the workshop, including a public World-Wide-Web-based seminar with more than 500 registered attendees on September 30, 2020;an international conference on UV-C technologies for air and surface disinfection, December 8-9, 2020;and a webinar on returning to normalcy with the use of UV-C technologies, April 27 and 29, 2021. This article also serves as an introduction to a special section of the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where full papers address recent technical, noncommercial, UV-C technology and pathogen-abatement investigations. The set of papers provides keen insights from the vantage points of medicine and industry. Recent technical developments, successes, and needs in optics and photonics, radiation physics, biological efficacy, and the needs of future markets in UV-C technologies are described to provide a concise compilation of the community's efforts and the state of the field. Standards needs are identified and discussed throughout this special section.

Medical records of COVID-19 patients have been reported and analyzed worldwide. The Health Agency of Jakarta, Indonesia, collected clinical symptoms, demographics, travel history, and mortality information from March 2020 up to now. Despite massive research on COVID-19 patients' data, the significant clinical symptoms that lead to COVID-19 mortality in Jakarta have not been well described to the best of the authors' knowledge. We extracted the COVID-19 records in Jakarta and compared them between patients who were discharged and deceased. This paper examines each clinical symptom's importance to mortality using machine learning techniques, namely weighted Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. We observed that Pneumonia, Shortness of Breath, Malaise, Hypertension, Fever, and Runny Nose are the top six significant clinical symptoms that lead to deaths in Jakarta.

One variant, JHM-DL, produces large plaques, while the other, JHM-DS, produces small plaques in tissue culture. DS replicates more slowly, has a lower virus yield in vitro, and is less virulent for mice than DL. They also differ in their pathogenicity for mice: JHM-DL infection results in acute encephalomyelitis while JHM-DS infection results in demyelination. Oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of the RNA genomes of these two variants revealed that they had almost identical genetic sequences. Each variant, however, had a unique oligonucleotide spot not found in the other. The unique spot of the large plaque variant, JHM-DL, was localized at approximately 3 to 5 kb from the 3' end, while the JHM-DS unique spot was mapped at 14 to 15 kb from the 3' end of the genome. We have further shown that these oligonucleotide changes are not correlated with the plaque morphology.

The aim of the present study was to examine drug use trends in patients with AORCs in ambulatory care and to study age-specific drug use. METHODS Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to examine ambulatory visits for AORCs during 2001-2005. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics (narcotics and nonnarcotics), steroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs (DMARDs) was measured as the proportion of visits that resulted in a prescription. Age-specific drug use trends were determined separately for adult (19-64 years) and for elderly (> or = 65 years) patients. RESULTS According to the national surveys, there were 208 million ambulatory visits for AORCs during the study period. Use of NSAIDs, analgesics, steroids, and DMARDs was found to be 33.3%, 23.5%, 15.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Analgesic use increased from 18.3% in 2001 to 26.7% in 2005. DMARDs and NSAIDs were prescribed 1.2 times more to adult patients than to elderly patients. Steroids and analgesics were prescribed 1.3 and 1.2 times more, respectively, to elderly patients than to adult patients. LIMITATION The findings do not translate to population-based prevalence measures, as the unit of analysis was the patient visit. CONCLUSIONS NSAIDs remain the most frequently prescribed drug class for AORCs; however, there has been increased use of analgesics in recent years. The study findings suggest that the patient's age plays a role in the choice of drugs prescribed for AORCs.","Desai, Rishi J; Agarwal, Santosh J; Aparasu, Rajender R",North Carolina medical journal,610,24

Since this 3' region, designated 3'(-)209, is the site of initiation of full-length positive-strand RNA and is the template for the synthesis of the 5' leader sequence, which is found on both full-length and subgenomic mRNAs, it is likely to contain cis-acting signals for RNA synthesis and to interact with cellular and viral proteins to form replication complexes. Gel mobility shift assays showed that cellular proteins in MA104 S100 cytoplasmic extracts formed two complexes with the SHFV 3'(-)209 RNA, and results from competition gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that these interactions were specific. Four proteins with molecular masses of 103, 86, 55, and 36 kDa were detected in UV-induced cross-linking assays, and three of these proteins (103, 55, and 36 kDa) were also detected by Northwestern blotting assays. Identical gel mobility shift and UV-induced cross-linking patterns were obtained with uninfected and SHFV-infected extracts, indicating that the four proteins detected are cellular, not viral, proteins. The binding sites for the four cellular proteins were mapped to the region between nt 117 and 184 (68-nt sequence) from the 3' end of the SHFV negative-strand RNA. This 68-nt sequence was predicted to form two stem-loops, SL4 and SL5. The 3'(-)NCR RNA of another arterivirus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus C (LDV-C), competed with the SHFV 3'(-)209 RNA in competition gel mobility shift assays. UV-induced cross-linking assays showed that four MA104 cellular proteins with the same molecular masses as those that bind to the SHFV 3'(-)209 RNA also bind to the LDV-C 3'(-)NCR RNA and equine arteritis virus 3'(-)NCR RNA. However, each of these viral RNAs also bound to an additional MA104 protein. The binding sites for the MA104 cellular proteins were shown to be located in similar positions in the LDV-C 3'(-)NCR and SHFV 3'(-)209 RNAs. These data suggest that the binding sites for a set of the cellular proteins are conserved in all arterivirus RNAs and that these cell proteins may be utilized as components of viral replication complexes.","Hwang, Y K; Brinton, M A",Journal of virology,610,1

We used a right to mental health framework, paired with qualitative methods, to investigate barriers to accessing perinatal mental health care. Based on in-depth interviews with 14 key informants in South Africa, we found that (1) physical health was prioritized over mental health at the clinic level; (2) there were insufficient numbers of antenatal and mental health providers to ensure minimum essential levels of perinatal mental health services; (3) the implementation of human rights-based mental health policy has been inadequate; (4) the social determinants were absent from the clinic-level approach to mental health; and (5) a lack of context-specific provider training and support has undermined the quality of mental health promotion and care. We offer recommendations to address these barriers and improve approaches to perinatal mental health screening and care, guided by the following elements of the right to mental health: progressive realization; availability and accessibility; and acceptability and quality.","Brown, Shelley; MacNaughton, Gillian; Sprague, Courtenay",Health and human rights,610,28

OBJECTIVE For patients with fever, normal or low count of white blood cell and with suspected pneumonia suggested by X-ray, it was urgent to determine the etiological agents of the diseases before they were admitted to the hospital. METHODS Throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected from those patients and common respiratory virus antigens including influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types I, II, and III were tested by indirect immunofluorescent assay. The patients with atypical pneumonia diagnosed by X-ray and evidences of common respiratory virus infection were admitted to the regular ward for children with respiratory diseases. Children with pneumonia demonstrated by X-ray and negative for common respiratory viruses were admitted to the isolated ward for suspected SARS patients for the first step and further viral etiological studies were requested. RT-PCR was performed for those patients to detect gene fragments of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RhV) and enterovirus (EV) in their specimens. Nested RT-PCR was also developed to detect SARS coronavirus gene fragment from the specimens. Primer sequences for SARS virus detection with the PCR were selected according to the primer sequences published online by WHO on April 18, 2003. All the primers derived from the sequence at the 1b frame of coronavirus replicase gene and products with a size of 368 or 348 bp were expected with 2 different primer pairs. RESULTS Amplicons with the sizes of 368 bp and 348 bp were obtained from a throat swab specimen collected from a 17 years old girl, who was admitted to the isolated ward because of high fever (39.5 degrees C) for 7 days, cough for 2 days, low WBC count, and pneumonia shown by X-ray when she visited the ""Fever and Cough"" Clinic, and without known history of contact with probable SARS patient. Antigens for the common respiratory viruses were all negative, RT-PCR for HMPV, RhV and EV were also negative while RT-PCR with different primer pairs for SARS virus were all positive which indicated that SARS coronavirus gene fragments were amplified from the specimen from this girl. The amplified fragment with a size of 368 bp was sequenced and the sequence was compared with those in the GenBank. The sequence shared 100% homology with the sequences from 1b frame of replicase genes from all 17 of SARS coronaviruses published in the GenBank so far, and shared very low homology with 2 reference strains of human coronavirus as well as other animal coronaviruses. The serum collected before her discharge from the hospital (19 days after the onset of the disease) showed SARS specific IgM and IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION These data indicate that the patient was a confirmed case of SARS. It is of great importance to differentiate SARS patients from those infected with common respiratory viruses during SARS epidemic, especially for pediatric patients, because most of the patients visiting the outpatient department present with the symptoms of fever, cough and normal WBC count. The data mentioned above indicate that antigen and gene detections for those common respiratory viruses are useful methods for the differentiation to avoid the spread of SARS.","Zhu, Ru-nan; Qian, Yuan; Deng, Jie; Zhao, Lin-qing; Wang, Fang; Cao, Li; Wang, Tian-you; Chen, Da-kun; Zhang, Qi",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,610,11

The proteins were shown to localize either to the cytoplasm alone or to the cytoplasm and a structure in the nucleus. This feature was confirmed to be the nucleolus by using specific antibodies to nucleolin, a major component of the nucleolus, and by confocal microscopy to image sections through a cell expressing N protein. These findings are consistent with our previous report for infectious bronchitis virus (group III coronavirus) (J. A. Hiscox et al., J. Virol. 75:506-512, 2001), indicating that nucleolar localization of the N protein is a common feature of the coronavirus family and is possibly of functional significance. Nucleolar localization signals were identified in the domain III region of the N protein from all three coronavirus groups, and this suggested that transport of N protein to the nucleus might be an active process. In addition, our results suggest that the N protein might function to disrupt cell division. Thus, we observed that approximately 30% of cells transfected with the N protein appeared to be undergoing cell division. The most likely explanation for this is that the N protein induced a cell cycle delay or arrest, most likely in the G(2)/M phase. In a fraction of transfected cells expressing coronavirus N proteins, we observed multinucleate cells and dividing cells with nucleoli (which are only present during interphase). These findings are consistent with the possible inhibition of cytokinesis in these cells.","Wurm, T; Chen, H; Hodgson, T; Britton, P; Brooks, G; Hiscox, J A",Journal of virology,610,28

Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder may result in considerable psychologic pain and suffering for the individual in addition to significant functional impairment. In addition to the heterogeneity of symptoms that occur in post-traumatic stress disorder, there may also be extensive comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and other psychiatric disorders. This complicates the treatment picture. Currently, accepted treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder include psychotherapy, in particular cognitive behavioral-based approaches and antidepressant medication. However, many patients are refractory to these initial treatments or have only a partial response. In light of this, may clinicians combine additional classes of psychotropic agents and different psychotherapeutic approaches to enhance treatment response. This article reviews the literature on the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Most of the research to date has involved combat veterans partially responsive or refractory to treatment, namely with antidepressants. Studies have shown improvement across post-traumatic stress disorder symptom clusters, as well as improvement in comorbid psychotic symptoms or disorders. More research is needed to confirm these recent findings and further delineate the role of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

We attempted to determine appropriate dosages to immobilize swift foxes for an adequate field-handling period based on three anesthesia intervals (induction period, immobilization period, and recovery period) and physiologic responses (rectal temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate). Between October 1998-July 1999, we conducted four trials, evaluating three different dosage ratios of ketamine and xylazine (2.27:1.2, 5.68:1.2, and 11.4:1.2 mg/kg ketamine:mg/kg xylazine, respectively), followed by a fourth trial with a higher dosage at the median ratio (11.4 mg/kg ketamine: 2.4 mg/kg xylazine). We found little difference in induction and recovery periods among trials 1-3, but immobilization time increased with increasing dosage (P < 0.08). Both the immobilization period and recovery period increased in trial 4 compared with trials 1-3 (P < or = 0.03). There was a high variation in responses of individual foxes across trials, making it difficult to identify an appropriate dosage for field handling.

As the vast majority of information on the effectiveness of acupuncture on this condition is based on data collected in Western countries, little is known about patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in Asian countries. In this pilot clinical study, acupuncture was incorporated into the standard care for adult patients with osteoarthritis of the knee to determine its contribution to pain relief and improved mobility. In a prospective, non-randomized controlled study, patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were separated into two groups. The first (the experimental group; n = 12) was scheduled for up to 8 sessions of acupuncture in addition to standard care, while the second (the control group; n = 12) received standard care only. Measurements using the six-minute walking distance test, pain visual analogue scale, and osteoarthritis of the knee outcome measurement were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks. Both study and control groups showed significant improvement with respect to time effects in terms of six-minute walking distance, pain visual analogue scale, pain domain and mobility domain scores determined by the osteoarthritis of the knee outcome measurement (p < .01), after adjusting for covariables. However, improvements measured in the study group did not differ significantly from those in the control group. Patients with osteoarthritis of the knee seemed to experience clinical improvements in six-minute walking distance, pain relief and mobility when their standard care was supplemented with acupuncture.","Maa, Suh-Hwa; Sun, Mao-Feng; Wu, Chi-Chuan",The journal of nursing research : JNR,610,16

Membrane fusion and polykaryocyte formation was observed only after incubating the viruses at acidic pH. Two groups of monoclonal antibodies reacting with distinct non-overlapping antigenic domains on the TBE virus protein E inhibited fusion from without. One of these domains contains the most highly conserved and putative fusion-active sequence of the flavivirus protein E. Of five TBE virus monoclonal antibody escape mutants, each defined by a single amino acid substitution in the envelope protein E, one revealed a reduced fusion activity and another one a lower pH threshold. TBE virus grown in the presence of ammonium chloride as well as Langat virus purified from the supernatant of infected chick embryo cells contained the precursor of protein M (prM) rather than M itself. These 'immature' virions did not cause fusion from without, suggesting that the proteolytic processing of prM may be necessary for the generation of fusion-competent virions.","Guirakhoo, F; Heinz, F X; Mandl, C W; Holzmann, H; Kunz, C",The Journal of general virology,610,23

However, at the molecular level, the role of nsp1 in EAV subgenomic mRNA synthesis is poorly understood. A yeast two-hybrid screen did not reveal interactions between EAV nsp1 and other viral non-structural proteins or the nucleocapsid protein, although both nsp1 and the nucleocapsid protein were found to form homomers. Subsequently, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library was performed using nsp1 as bait. Remarkably, this analysis revealed (potential) interactions between EAV nsp1 and factors that are involved in host cell transcriptional regulation. The interaction of nsp1 with one of these proteins, p100, a transcription co-activator that also interacts with regulatory proteins of other viruses, was confirmed by mutual co-immunoprecipitation from lysates of EAV-susceptible mammalian cells.","Tijms, Marieke A; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,610,16

METHODS Twenty-nine patients (11 men and 18 women, 20 - 74 years old age range) were diagnosed with infectious SARS and admitted in our hospital from the March 5th to April 14th, 2003 in this study. The data of clinical presentation and disease progression of all the patients including index subject as the infectious SARS resource patient, her family infected members and 21 health care workers were abstracted. RESULTS The first SARA outbreak in Beijing was characterized with the cluster feature of resource patient family members and health care providers. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 14 days. All the patients had a fever (temperature > 38 degrees C for over 24 hours) and other manifestations as reported before. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive pathologic air-space disease. Twenty patients showed the severe syndrome with various time ranged from 1 day to 14 days. Two patients died of progressive acute respiratory distress disease. The histologic analysis of one death patient showed diffuse alveolar damage in the two lungs. Twenty-six patients receiving the combined therapy including use of corticosteroid, antiviral ribavirin agents after the onset of symptoms and showed they had an acute self-limited disease course. The oldest patient (74 year old, male) received the healthy convalescent plasma infusion (50 ml) from recovered SARS subject and completely recovered within 21 days, having a shorter disease course. CONCLUSION SARS is a kind of new self-limited and acute infectious disease. Early diagnosis, early isolation, early antiviral therapy for patients and efficient prevention for health care providers are urgently recommended. In particular, a combinational therapy of use of antiviral agents, preventive antibacterial antibiotics and pulsed dosage of corticosteroid can efficiently raise the clinical recovery rate and decrease mortality of SARS patients.","Zhou, Xian-zhi; Zhao, Min; Wang, Fu-sheng; Jiang, Tian-jun; Li, Yong-gang; Nie, Wei-min; Zhou, Zhi-ping; Wang, Ye; He, Jing; Fan, Rong; Zhao, Jing-min; Zhang, Xin-wei",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,610,4

Oncogenic properties of eIF4E are directly linked to its ability to bind 7-methyl guanosine of the 5' mRNA. Here, we observe that the antiviral guanosine analogue ribavirin binds to eIF4E with micromolar affinity at the functional site used by 7-methyl guanosine mRNA cap, competes with eIF4E:mRNA binding, and, at low micromolar concentrations, selectively disrupts eIF4E subcellular organization and transport and translation of mRNAs posttranscriptionally regulated by eIF4E, thereby reducing levels of oncogenes such as cyclin D1. Ribavirin potently suppresses eIF4E-mediated oncogenic transformation of murine cells in vitro, of tumor growth of a mouse model of eIF4E-dependent human squamous cell carcinoma in vivo, and of colony formation of eIF4E-dependent acute myelogenous leukemia cells derived from human patients. These findings describe a specific, potent, and unforeseen mechanism of action of ribavirin. Quantum mechanical and NMR structural studies offer directions for the development of derivatives with improved cytostatic and antiviral properties. In all, ribavirin's association with eIF4E may provide a pharmacologic means for the interruption of posttranscriptional networks of oncogenes that maintain and enhance neoplasia and malignancy in human cancer.","Kentsis, Alex; Topisirovic, Ivan; Culjkovic, Biljana; Shao, Ling; Borden, Katherine L B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,610,16

In addition to typical respiratory signs (dry cough, shortness of breathing), some patients may develop gastrointestinal and hepatological complications including diarrhea or acute hepatitis, respectively. Due to the close contact to the patient's secretion, the gastroenterologists are at increased risk of getting the infection. Therefore, a proper individual risk stratification before every endoscopic procedure is highly recommended. Endoscopy personnel should reduce exposure hazards by keeping a distance from the patient and using gloves, face masks, face shields and gowns. Taking into the consideration the fact that the virus proliferates in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, special attention should be given to handling with stool specimens. In patients obtaining FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection, recommended screening measures include donor's medical history and testing for SARS-CoV-2 presence in pharyngeal and stool specimens.","Konturek, Peter Christopher; Harsch, Igor Alexander",Wiadomosci lekarskie,610,16

After hospitalization of approximately 2-4 days, these patients return home presenting a possible radiation hazard to the people around them. This work aims to estimate the possible radiation burden to people (co-travelers and cohabitants) which came in contact with the patients after their release from the hospital, analyzing data obtained during their hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 1065 patients were used to estimate the possible radiation burden to family members and people that came in contact with the patients, grouping them according to their age, type of contact with the patient (co-traveler, cohabitant) and patient family status, assuming different exposure scenarios for each group and based on the written precautions given to all patients before discharge. Relations between the iodine effective half-life (Teff), estimated from patient dose rate measurements during hospitalization, patient age and the method used for thyroid preparation for ablation (thyroid hormone withdrawal-THW or administration of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone-rhTSH) were also investigated. RESULTS Median absorbed dose to adult cohabitants was estimated to be 8.3μSv (0.1-117.2μSv), to babies (0-5yr) 15.7μSv (1.2-196.1μSv), to young children (5-10yr) 13.1μSv (0.8-100.7μSv), to children (10-18yr) 8.4μSv (0.5-116.8μSv) and to co-travelers 4.8μSv (0.2-114.9μSv). The highest doses to cohabitants were estimated in the few cases where the patient was a single parent of one or more children (median children dose 28.9μSv, range 11.2-279.4μSv). A statistically significant difference in median Teff between THW (15.1h) and rhTSH (13.9h) patient groups was found. CONCLUSION Provided necessary precautions are followed, radiation burden to the family members and co-travelers of DTC patients treated with radioiodine following thyroidectomy can be kept well below the corresponding dose limits and constraints.","Hatziioannou, K; Papanastasiou, E; Badiavas, K; Zapros, A; Iakovou, I",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,610,16

Several risk factors for PF have been reported, including high drain amylase level (D-AMY). Among the 140 consecutive patients who underwent PD, we analyzed 110 cases with D-AMY measurements over time after PD. According to the D-AMY change, we divided patients into five patterns and defined delayed PF cases. We analyzed clinical characteristics, including serum amylase and D-AMY, and examined the correlation between the period of drain insertion and PF grade. In 15 delayed PF cases, 12 cases were grade B or C, pancreatic cancer was less frequent, pancreatic ducts were smaller, and soft pancreas texture was more commonly observed. The D-AMY on postoperative day (POD) 1 was higher in cases of delayed PF compared with non-PF cases (P < 0.0001). In 28 cases with drain removal before POD 7, grade B or C PF was not observed afterward. The average D-AMY on POD 1 in cases with drain removal before POD 1 was significantly lower than in delayed PF cases. Although further studies are required to determine the most appropriate timing of drain removal, it is thought that intra-abdominal drains should be removed within seven days of PD in cases without signs of PF. On the other hand, delayed PF should be considered in cases of soft pancreas texture and/or high D-AMY on POD 1, even if D-AMY levels are low on POD 3 or decreasing on POD 5.","Maeda, Takashi; Kayashima, Hiroto; Imai, Daisuke; Takeishi, Kazuki; Harada, Noboru; Tsujita, Eiji; Tsutsui, Shinichi; Matsuda, Hiroyuki",The American surgeon,610,5

To compare the sugar and pathogen binding properties of LSECtin with those of related but more extensively characterized receptors, such as DC-SIGN, a soluble fragment of LSECtin consisting of the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain has been expressed in bacteria. A biotin-tagged version of the protein was also generated and complexed with streptavidin to create tetramers. These forms of the carbohydrate-recognition domain were used to probe a glycan array and to characterize binding to oligosaccharide and glycoprotein ligands. LSECtin binds with high selectivity to glycoproteins terminating in GlcNAcbeta1-2Man. The inhibition constant for this disaccharide is 3.5 microm, making it one of the best low molecular weight ligands known for any C-type lectin. As a result of the selective binding of this disaccharide unit, the receptor recognizes glycoproteins with a truncated complex and hybrid N-linked glycans on glycoproteins. Glycan analysis of the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus reveals the presence of such truncated glycans, explaining the ability of LSECtin to facilitate infection by Ebola virus. High mannose glycans are also present on the viral glycoprotein, which explains why DC-SIGN also binds to this virus. Thus, multiple receptors interact with surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses that bear different types of relatively poorly processed glycans.","Powlesland, Alex S; Fisch, Tanja; Taylor, Maureen E; Smith, David F; Tissot, Bérangère; Dell, Anne; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Drickamer, Kurt",The Journal of biological chemistry,610,2

After the sudden and unexpected spreading of a global pandemic in 2020, many mental health researchers have launched alarms about a possible suicide rates' rise, due to the inevitable consequences of the ongoing social and health emergency. However, recent articles in scientific literature have disconfirmed this thesis. Trentino also seems not to deviate from this dynamic: preliminary data, collected in an unconventional, and not yet official way, have been able to show that in 2020 the suicide rate remained stable. The finding that excludes up to date such a rise in rates does not unfortunately provide any guarantee that the situation will remain constant over time, and that there cannot be significant differences regarding gender, ethnicity, religious faith, sexual orientation or social class in determining a different impact of the current crisis on the suicidal phenomenon. Further studies and insights into the processing of the data in our possession are needed. Difficulties and uncertainties connected to the covid-19, with which it is now clear that the community will have to ""learn to live together"", could also in the medium and long term constitute a prolonged stress-generating element with a greater negative impact on the mental health of the population. It is essential, in light of the particular social and health situation we are experiencing, to carry out with even greater effectiveness, precision and continuity actions such as those promoted within the Invito alla Vita Project for the prevention of suicide, in order to guarantee the most effective prevention of this serious phenomenon. The psychological and social implications of the covid-19 pandemic will only be fully assessable in a few years, when the crisis will be effectively over. Only then we will be able to understand if the efforts put in place at a global level, and in particular in the province of Trento, have been effective in the managing of the suicidal phenomenon.","di Napoli, Wilma Angela Renata",Psychiatria Danubina,610,33

However, the phenotype of circulating EPCs remains elusive but they are more often described as CD34+KDR+. The aim of the study was to extensively characterize circulating potential vasculogenic stem cell candidates in two populations of patients with cardiovascular disease by powerful multidimensional single cell complementary cytometric approaches (mass, imaging and flow). We identified cellular candidates in one patient before and after bioprosthetic total artificial heart implantation and results were confirmed in healthy peripheral and cord blood by mass cytometry. We also quantified cellular candidates in 10 patients with different COVID-19 severity. Both C-TAH implantation and COVID-19 at critical stage induce a redistribution of circulating CD34+ and CD19+ sub-populations in peripheral blood. After C-TAH implantation, circulating CD34+ progenitor cells expressed c-Kit stem marker while specific subsets CD34+CD133-/+CD45-/dimc-Kit+KDR- were mobilized. KDR was only expressed by CD19+ B-lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes subpopulations in circulation. We confirmed by mass cytometry this KDR expression on CD19+ in healthy peripheral and cord blood, also with a VE-cadherin expression, confirming absence of endothelial lineage marker on CD34+ subtypes. In COVID-19, a significant mobilization of CD34+c-Kit+KDR- cells was observed between moderate and critical COVID-19 patients regardless CD133 or CD45 expression. In order to better evaluate EPC phenotype, we performed imaging flow cytometry measurements of immature CD34+KDR+ cells in cord blood and showed that, after elimination of non-circular events, those cells were all CD19+. During COVID-19, a significant mobilization of CD19+KDR+ per million of CD45+ cells was observed between moderate and critical COVID-19 patients regardless of CD34 expression. CD34+c-Kit+ cells are mobilized in both cardiovascular disease described here. KDR cells in peripheral blood are CD19 positive cells and are not classic vasculogenic stem and/or progenitor cells. A better evaluation of c-Kit and KDR expressing cells will lead to the redefinition of circulating endothelial progenitors.Graphical abstract Central illustration figure. Multidimensional proteomic approach of endothelial progenitors demonstrate expression of KDR restricted to CD19 cells. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in cardiovascular diseases, however their phenotype remains elusive. We elucidated here EPCs phenotype by a deep characterization by multidimensional single cell complementary cytometric approaches after Bioprosthetic total artificial heart implantation and during COVID-19. We showed a redistribution of circulating CD34+ and CD19+ sub-populations in both situations. None of the immature cell population expresses KDR. Mobilized CD34+ expressed c-Kit.

The COVID-19 ‘pancession’ (pandemic + recession) has rattled global economies, possibly accelerating the fossil fuel phase out. This raises the question: What opportunities has COVID-19 presented to phase out fossil fuels, and subsequently, how can transformative recovery efforts be designed to utilize these opportunities and promote social, ecological and relational inclusiveness? We find that: (a) the COVID-19 pancession provides a unique opportunity to accelerate climate action, as it has devalued financial assets, stunned fossil fuel production and paralyzed relevant infrastructure, thus easing the pathway towards stranding global fossil fuel resources and assets;(b) four possible post-pancession recovery scenarios may unravel, of which only one is ecologically, socially and relationally inclusive, transformative, and in line with the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030;and (c) an inclusive recovery requires that political leadership channels the gargantuan state resources for recovery into prioritizing healthcare and the environment as public/merit goods, conscious investment in non-fossil fuel energy sector recovery accompanied by stringent climate policy, and equitably managing stranded assets to ensure that the burden falls on rich and capable actors, predominantly from the North.","Rempel, Arthur Gupta Joyeeta",World Development,610,25

Among possible transmission routes, air transfer of the virus is thought to be prominent. To investigate this further, measurements were conducted at Razi hospital in Ahvaz, Iran, which was selected to treat COVID-19 severe cases in the Khuzestan province. Passive and active sampling methods were employed and compared with regard to their efficiency for collection of airborne SARS-COV-2 virus particles. Fifty one indoor air samples were collected in two areas, with distances of less than or equal to 1 m (patient room) and more than 3 m away (hallway and nurse station) from patient beds. A simulation method was used to obtain the virus load released by a regularly breathing or coughing individual including a range of microdroplet emissions. Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 11.76% (N=6) of all indoor air samples (N=51) collected in the COVID-19 ward tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, including 4 cases in patient rooms and 2 cases in the hallway. Also, 5 of the 6 positive cases were confirmed using active sampling methods with only 1 based on passive sampling. The results support airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols in indoor air. Multivariate analysis showed that among 15 parameters studied, the highest correlations with PCR results were obtained for temperature, relative humidity, PM levels, and presence of an air cleaner.","Baboli, Zeynab; Neisi, Niloofar; Babaei, Ali Akbar; Ahmadi, Mehdi; Sorooshian, Armin; Birgani, Yaser Tahmasebi; Goudarzi, Gholamreza",Atmos Environ (1994),610,16

The results reveal that, while managing COVID-19 inflow risk pressure plays a critical role in the city's pandemic disaster resilience. city agglomeration characteristics also matters. To be exact, we find that large and high-density cities with high inter and intra-city mobility flows have more difficulties in containing the epidemic spread, but improving healthcare infrastructure adequacy and urban governance capacity can increase time efficacy of pandemic control and then improve the city's resilience against pandemic. Although our analysis is based on the performance of Chinese cities in the case of COVID-19, the research framework can be applied in understanding COVID-19 control performance of cities in other countries and the findings can be useful for improving health-related urban resilience and sustainability.","Yang, Tianren; Pan, Haozhi; Zhang, Xiaoling; Greenlee, Andrew; Deal, Brian",Sustain Cities Soc,610,24

Chi-square tests and MANOVA with post-hoc corrections were conducted to compare demographic characteristics, ED pathology, and probable ED diagnosis prevalence between students with and without individual food insecurity. RESULTS: Partially supporting hypotheses, MANOVA indicated significantly greater frequency of objective binge eating, compensatory fasting, and ED-related impairment for students with food insecurity compared with individuals without food insecurity. Chi-squared tests showed higher prevalence of ED diagnoses among individuals with food insecurity compared with those without food security (47.6 vs. 31.1%, respectively, p < .01, NNT = 6.06), specifically bulimia nervosa and other specified feeding and eating disorder.

Having a temperature of 38 °C or more and increasing comorbidity score were also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Significant predictors of ICU admission included having a saturated oxygen level less than 90%, hypertension, dementia, rheumatologic disease, having a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths per minute. Being of Hispanic ethnicity and immunosuppressant utilization greatly increased the risk of 30-day readmission. Having an oxygen saturation less than 90% and an underlying neurological disorder were associated with an increased likelihood of death.

In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control.

The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25-50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV­2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV­2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV­2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis. In case of shortfalls in admission capacities, the requirement of acute emergency care may necessitate that isolation and cohorting in the hospital will have to be performed temporarily in a less restrictive way than recommended here for standard.","Berner, Reinhard; Huebner, Johannes; Huppertz, Hans-Iko; Simon, Arne; Walger, Peter",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,610,9

In general, newly presenting patients should be assessed, and patients recently receiving chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radionuclide therapy, or showing tumour growth, should be closely followed. For previously diagnosed patients, who have indolent disease, some delay in routine follow-up or treatment may not be problematic. However, patients developing acute secretory syndromes due to functional neuroendocrine neoplasms (such as of the pancreas, intestine or lung), phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, will require prompt treatment. Patients with life-threatening Covid-19-related symptoms should be urgently treated and long-term anti-tumoral treatments may be temporarily delayed. In patients with especially aggressive NENs, a careful judgement should be made regarding the severity of any Covid-19 illness, tumour grade, and the immunosuppressant effects of any planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g. interferon-alpha), targeted therapy or related treatment. In other cases, especially patients with completely resected NENs, or who are under surveillance for a genetic disorder, a telephone or delayed consultation may be in order, balancing the risk of a delay against that of the possible development of Covid-19.","Casey, Ruth T; Valk, Gerlof D; Schalin-Jäntti, Camilla; Grossman, Ashley B; Thakker, Rajesh V",Eur J Endocrinol,610,26

It is also known now that the disease may have sequelae affecting various systems. The respiratory sequelae include pulmonary fibrosis due to the immune-mediated mechanisms that follow a cytokine storm, diffuse alveolar damage, and microvascular thrombosis. A decline in lung function may be seen in patients who still have residual symptoms and hypoxia. COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, a well-recognized complication, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, has emerged as a significant risk factor for increased mortality. Fatigue is a common symptom that patients come back with, in the post-COVID period. Dyspnea without hypoxia has been attributed to respiratory muscle dysfunction and deconditioning resulting in decreased exercise tolerance. Palpitation is another common persisting symptom. Thromboembolic disease, a common association during the acute phase of illness, is not an uncommon entity that is seen even after ""recovery"" from COVID-19. Thromboembolic events causing stroke have been identified as an immediate complication of COVID-19, but can occur during the recovery phase as well, in high-risk patients. The return of smell and taste sensations could take a few weeks to months even after complete recovery from the illness. Mood swings, anxiety, and sleep deprivation have all been reported by patients recovering from this viral illness.

METHODS: We studied patients with proven COVID-19 disease in the intensive care unit of Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China from 30 to 2019 to 31 March 2020. RESULTS: Of 180 patients, 89 (49.44 %) had died, 85 (47.22 %) had been discharged alive, and 6 (3.33 %) were still hospitalised by the end of data collection. A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission was significantly associated with 30 day mortality, and a D-dimer concentration of > 5 mg/L was found in a much higher proportion of non-survivors than survivors. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring systems were dichotomised as < 4 or &#8805; 4 and < 5 or &#8805; 5, respectively, and the mortality rate was significantly different between the two stratifications in both scoring systems. Enoxaparin was administered to 68 (37.78 %) patients for thromboembolic prophylaxis, and stratification by the D-dimer concentration and DIC score confirmed lower mortality in patients who received enoxaparin when the D-dimer concentration was > 2 than < 2 mg/L or DIC score was &#8805; 5 than < 5. A low platelet count and low serum calcium concentration were also related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission is a risk factor for severe disease. A SIC score of > 4 and DIC score of > 5 may be used to predict mortality. Thromboembolic prophylaxis can reduce mortality only in patients with a D-dimer concentration of > 2 mg/L or DIC score of &#8805; 5.","Zheng, Runhui; Zhou, Jing; Song, Bin; Zheng, Xia; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Pan, Chun; Zhang, Wei; Xia, Jiaan; Chen, Nanshan; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhang, Dingyu; Xi, Yin; Lin, Zhimin; Pan, Ying; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Shiyue; Xu, Yuanda; Li, Yimin; Tan, Huo; Zhong, Nanshan; Luo, Xiaodan; Sang, Ling",Exp Hematol Oncol,610,26

Here, we monitored the clinical characteristics and virological features of 38 patients with COVID-19 (long-term carriers) who recovered from the acute disease, but still shed viral RNA for over 3 months. The median carrying history of the long-term carriers was 92 days after the first admission, and the longest carrying history was 118 days. Negative-positive viral RNA-shedding fluctuations were observed. Long-term carriers were mostly elderly people with a history of mild infection. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the sputum, where high level viral RNA was found. All nine full-length genomes of samples obtained in March-April 2020 matched early viral clades circulating in January-February 2020, suggesting that these patients persistently carried SARS-CoV-2 and were not re-infected. IgM and IgG antibodies and neutralizing-antibody proï¬les were similar between long-term carriers and recovered patients with similar disease courses.

Background: The government's guidelines affected people with COPD on different levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to belonging to a group of particularly vulnerable persons, they had to adapt their health behaviours, in particular physical activity, to recommendations provided in order to prevent negative effects on disease progression. There is little knowledge regarding how this group of patients coped with these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe the health behaviours and needs people with COPD convey during nursing phone consultations and which nursing interventions have been carried out. METHODS: A document analysis of 50 nursing phone consultations was performed. The data were summarised descriptively and analysed thematically. RESULTS: The main topics were the adaptation of physical activity, the implementation of the recommendations to the individual life situation, the detection of a COVID-19 infection and questions concerning the planning of medical appointments. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to the disease management of people with COPD. The increased need for care brought on by the pandemic was able to be met by the knowledge provided in the nursing phone consultations.

Previous studies showed RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of ACE2, a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which provokes a concern that the use of ACEI and ARB in hypertensive individuals might lead to increased mortality and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To further investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 patients, we systematically reviewed relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria in search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The search strategy included clinical data published through October 12, 2020. Twenty-six studies involving 8104 hypertensive patients in ACEI/ARB-treated group and 8203 hypertensive patients in non-ACEI/ARB-treated group were analyzed. Random-effects meta-analysis showed ACEI/ARB treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.624, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.457-0.852, p = .003, I2 = 74.3%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age, gender, study site, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores, comorbidities of diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, or cancer has no significant modulating effect of ACEI/ARB treatment on the mortality of hypertensive COVID-19 patients (all p > .1). In addition, the ACEI/ARB treatment was associated with a lower risk of ventilatory support (OR = 0.682, 95% CI = 0.475-1.978, p = .037, I2 = 0.0%). In conclusion, these results suggest that ACEI/ARB medications should not be discontinued for hypertensive patients in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Yixuan; Chen, Baixin; Li, Yun; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Yuyi; Yang, Shuaibing; Xiao, Xue; Qin, Qingsong",J Med Virol,610,1

Medical and municipal waste management systems are critical services in combating the virus spread in the community. This assessment is useful due to poor available data of medical waste flow in environmental reports and it covers COVID-19 patients, quarantined, and self-isolated persons as the main potential infectious waste sources. The proposed model estimates that COVID-19 related waste flow is 4312 t at the national level from 25 February to 15 June of which 2633 t in the emergency state period. This assessment is correlated with deficiencies of medical and municipal waste management systems in Romania before the COVID-19 pandemic as stress factors of public health and environment. This study points out the main challenges of waste operators and reveals some best practices during this pandemic crisis.

However, Few emergency departments (EDs) have ophthalmologists on call, and eye care provided in EDs without ophthalmic services can be inaccurate. METHODS: We review the current state of ophthalmic telemedical care in EDs and highlight important considerations when implementing telemedicine in this setting. RESULTS: Telemedicine allows ophthalmologists to work with on-site emergency care providers to interview and examine patients remotely in EDs, enabling proper assessment of patient history, visual acuity, pupils, intraocular pressure, as well as the anterior and posterior segment. To date, patients' perceptions of this new model of care have been largely positive. DISCUSSION: The use of telemedical consultations for remote evaluation of patients with ophthalmic complaints stands to improve the quality of care provided to patients and extend the reach of remote ophthalmologists. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of in-person care further highlights the potential for telemedicine to augment existing models of emergency care.","De Arrigunaga, Sofia; Aziz, Kanza; Lorch, Alice C; Friedman, David S; Armstrong, Grayson W",Semin Ophthalmol,610,26

Despite one year of intensive research, the current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infected people are still limited. Clearly, novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are still urgently needed. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatment and accessible to a vast majority of people worldwide. Natural products with antiviral activity may contribute to improve the overall condition of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that glycyrrhizin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, we uncovered the underlying mechanism and showed that glycyrrhizin blocks the viral replication by inhibiting the viral main protease Mpro that is essential for viral replication. Our data indicate that the consumption of glycyrrhizin-containing products such as licorice root tea of black licorice may be of great benefit for SARS-CoV-2 infected people. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin is a good candidate for further investigation for clinical use to treat COVID-19 patients.","van de Sand, Lukas; Bormann, Maren; Alt, Mira; Schipper, Leonie; Heilingloh, Christiane Silke; Steinmann, Eike; Todt, Daniel; Dittmer, Ulf; Elsner, Carina; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Viruses,610,16

Anyone living in the transitive society of today does not exercise full control over his or her life activity due to various factors of indefiniteness. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, starting at the beginning of 2020, swept the world and is now considered to be a global indefiniteness factor. Life indefiniteness that grew with the pandemic is a supplementary stress factor, the one that can be treated as either distress or eustress. This article is aimed at showing the results of an empirical study of differences in the life-purpose orientations and self-reflection in young unmarried females being trained in psychology in the city of Rostov-on-Don in March 2017 (n=53) and in October 2020 (n=43), that is prior to and during the pan-demic, which may be considered as different indefiniteness effects in life. D.A. Leontyev's ""life-purpose orientations""test and I.A. Stetsenko's self-reflection questionnaire were implied in the study. Growth of all mean indicators in both tests during the pandemic against the same indicators prior to the pandemic, was revealed. Differences in all parameters are statistically veratious, which was stated by the Mann-Whitney test. The empirical study established that the pandemic may be viewed in respect of the examined acmeologically homogenous category as eustress, i.e. an overcomable indefiniteness factor. The above eustress resulted in a positive reconstruction of meaning regulation processes and in psychological adaptation, which lead to the growth of the level of life orientation meaningfulness and self-reflection among the respondents. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Abakumova, I.; Ponomarev, P.; Kolesina, K.; Godunov, M.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",610,9

This contagious disease has spread across different lengths and breadths of the globe, taking a death toll to nearly 700 k by the start of August 2020. The number is well expected to rise even more significantly. In the absence of a thoroughly tested and approved vaccine, the onus primarily lies on obliging to standard operating procedures and timely detection and isolation of the infected persons. The detection of SARS n-CoV2 has been one of the core concerns during the fight against this pandemic. To keep up with the scale of the outbreak, testing needs to be scaled at par with it. With the conventional PCR testing, most of the countries have struggled to minimize the gap between the scale of outbreak and scale of testing. METHOD: One way of expediting the scale of testing is to shift to a rigorous computational model driven by deep neural networks, as proposed here in this paper. The proposed model is a non-contact process of determining whether a subject is infected or not and is achieved by using chest radiographs; one of the most widely used imaging technique for clinical diagnosis due to fast imaging and low cost. The dataset used in this work contains 1428 chest radiographs with confirmed COVID-19 positive, common bacterial pneumonia, and healthy cases (no infection). We explored the pre-trained VGG-16 model for classification tasks in this. Transfer learning with fine-tuning was used in this study to train the network on relatively small chest radiographs effectively. RESULTS: Initial experiments showed that the model achieved promising results and can be significantly used to expedite COVID-19 detection. The experimentation showed an accuracy of 96% and 92.5% in two and three output class cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: We believe that this study could be used as an initial screening, which can help healthcare professionals to treat the COVID patients by timely detecting better and screening the presence of disease. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Its simplicity drives the proposed deep neural network model, the capability to work on small image dataset, the non-contact method with acceptable accuracy is a potential alternative for rapid COVID-19 testing that can be adapted by the medical fraternity considering the criticality of the time along with the magnitudes of the outbreak.","Pandit, M K; Banday, S A; Naaz, R; Chishti, M A",,610,3

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify original articles regarding clinical, laboratory, and anatomopathological kidney changes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 published until May 7, 2020. The search was carried out across PubMed, Scopus, and Embase using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""kidney injury"" and ""kidney disease"". Fifteen studies presented clinical and laboratory renal changes in patients with COVID-19, and three addressed anatomopathological changes. DISCUSSION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a relevant finding in patients with COVID-19. There were also significant changes in laboratory tests that indicated kidney injury, such as increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, and hematuria. The presence of laboratory abnormalities and AKI were significant in severely ill patients. There was a considerable prevalence of AKI among groups of patients who died of COVID-19. Histopathological analysis of the kidney tissue of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus may directly affect the kidneys. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 affects mainly the lungs, it can also impact the kidneys. Increased serum creatinine and BUN, hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI were frequent findings in patients with severe COVID-19 and were related to an increased mortality rate. Further studies focusing on renal changes and their implications for the clinical condition of patients infected with the novel coronavirus are needed.","Nogueira, Samuel Átila Rodrigues; Oliveira, Samuel Ciríaco Silva de; Carvalho, Ana Flávia Moreira de; Neves, Julia Moreira Cavalcante; Silva, Leila Silveira Vieira da; Silva Junior, Geraldo Bezerra da; Nobre, Maria Elizabeth Pereira",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),610,16

Patients admitted from February 24 to May 27, 2020, were stratified according to blood group. As a control, blood groups of 3,730,027 anonymized individuals representing almost Kuwait's entire population were obtained from a national database. RESULTS: Of 3305 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 37.1%, 25.5%, 28.9%, and 8.5% were groups O, A, B, and AB, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed no significant differences in severe clinical outcomes or death among the blood groups. However, multivariable analysis demonstrated that group A individuals had higher odds of developing pneumonia compared with non-group A (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72, p < .036). Compared with the general population, the COVID-19 cohort had a lower frequency of group O, equivalent frequency of A, and higher frequency of B and AB. No significant difference in the RhD group was found.

This may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that are often overlooked in clinical practice. Elderly patients are more affected by comorbidities increasing the risk of DDIs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Statins are effective in elderly patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are prescribed on a long-term basis and may undergo DDIs, particularly on pharmacokinetic bases. The risk of DDIs varies among statins, and safety and ADRs of statins are of special concern in patients affected by multiple chronic conditions requiring concomitant therapies at risk of DDIs, such as the elderly. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this manuscript is to give an update on the potential statin DDIs and related ADRs with an exclusive focus on the data available in elderly patients. EXPERT OPINION: A better and more close attention to the potential DDIs among statins and other therapeutic options will help physicians in selecting the more effective and less harmful treatment for their patients.

An online questionnaire was randomly sent by social media to clinicians in different countries from 24 April, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The survey consisted of a series of questions about demographic characteristics, endodontic emergency diagnoses, approaches to prevent aerosol formation, drug prescriptions in case of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and the ways in which dentists managed endodontic emergencies during the COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 1,058 dentists responded to the questionnaire; 344 (32.6%) of the participants were endodontists. Slightly less than half of the participants (n = 485, 45.8%) worked during the lockdown, but only 303 participants (28.6%) treated endodontic cases/emergencies. The responses showed agreement between endodontists and GDPs regarding the diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP), symptomatic apical periodontitis (SAP), reversible pulpitis, and asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis (AIP). SIP and SAP were considered an emergency, whereas reversible pulpitis and AIP were not considered an emergency (p &gt; 0.05). Non-aerosol-generating procedures and treatment approaches differed between the groups (p &lt; 0.05). One-third of the participants did not use rubber dam (p &gt; 0.05). Ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were the most frequently prescribed drugs for pain associated with SIP. In conclusion, the most relevant findings in our survey were the differences between endodontists and GDPs in diagnosis, precheck triage, deep caries excavation procedures, and endodontic emergency pain relief strategies.","ATES, Ayfer Atav; ALOMARI, Taher; BHARDWAJ, Anuj; TABNJH, Abedelmalek; GAMBARINI, Gianluca",Braz. oral res.

To investigate the association between fungal co-infection and mortality due to COVID-19, we systematically searched Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and Cochrane Library for eligible studies published in the period from 1 January to 1 December 2020. We performed a meta-analysis of nine studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total, data from 2780 patients and 426 patients were included who were admitted to the ICU. In eight of the articles, 211 participants died due to COVID-19 infection, which means an overall mortality rate of 10.9%.

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. RESULTS: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway.

Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases.

Using a likelihood-based approach, we developed a statistical framework to reconstruct a time-varying and variant-specific case fatality ratio (CFR), and to estimate changes in CFR associated with a single mutation empirically. For illustration, the statistical framework is implemented to the COVID-19 surveillance data in the United Kingdom (UK). The reconstructed instantaneous CFR gradually increased from 1.0% in September to 2.2% in November 2020 and stabilized at this level thereafter, which monitors the mortality risk of COVID-19 on a real-time basis. We identified a link between the SARS-CoV-2 mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 mortality risk at population scale, and found that the 501Y variants may slightly but not significantly increase 18% of fatality risk than the preceding 501N variants. We found no statistically significant evidence of change in COVID-19 mortality risk associated with 501Y variants, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of the modelling framework.","Zhao, S.; Lou, J.; Chong, M.

METHODS: From online surveys in the general Dutch population in 2018 and during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we analysed data of people with (index group, n = 239) and without (control group, n = 1821) an inflammatory rheumatic disease. Worry, stress, mental well-being (SF-36) and psychological flexibility levels were subjected to covariate-adjusted analyses of variance or linear regression analyses. RESULTS: During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as compared with the control group, the index group was more worried about getting infected with the virus (partial Î·2=0.098; medium effect) and more stressed (partial Î·2= 0.040; small effect). However, as compared with data acquired in 2018, the level of mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic peak was not lower in both groups. Levels of psychological flexibility did not moderate associations of group or year with mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease were more worried and stressed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, their level of mental well-being was not reduced, which may have prevented us from finding a buffering effect of psychological flexibility. Overall, our results suggest that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease is modest, which could imply that common education and health care will do for most patients.","Koppert, Tim Y; Jacobs, Johannes W G; Geenen, Rinie",Rheumatology (Oxford),610,18

Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics-baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively.

While past work has documented the prevalence and correlates of vaccine refusal, I assess how a less explored topic -- properties of vaccines themselves (e.g., national origin, efficacy, risk of side effects) -- might influence vaccination intentions. This information can help public health officials preempt differential intentions to vaccinate, and inform health communication campaigns that encourage vaccine uptake. RATIONALE: Previous research suggests that Americans should be more likely to intend to vaccinate if presented with a US-made vaccine that carries a low risk of minor side effects, is highly effective, is administered in just one dose, and has spent significant time in development. METHODS: I administered a conjoint experiment (N = 5940 trials) in a demographically representative survey (N = 990) of US adults to assess how variation in vaccine properties influence self-reported public vaccination intentions. RESULTS: I find that respondents prefer vaccines that are US-made, over 90% effective, and carry a less than 1% risk of minor side effects. This is potentially problematic, as some leading vaccine candidates are produced outside the US, and/or may be more likely to produce minor side effects than respondents would otherwise prefer. Worryingly, intended vaccine refusal rates exceed 30% for a vaccine meeting these optimal characteristics. Encouragingly, though, Americans show no clear preference for vaccines administered in one dose, or developed in under a year, and do not appear to draw a distinction between weakened viral vs. mRNA-based vaccines. CONCLUSION: Americans' preferences for a novel coronavirus vaccine may be at odds with the vaccine that ultimately hits the market, posing both policy and health communication challenges for vaccination uptake.","Motta, Matt",Soc Sci Med,610,30

Methods: We established a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (&#8805; 18 years old) from two tertiary hospitals: the People's hospital of Wuhan University and Leishenshan Hospital between February 16, 2020, and April 14, 2020. The diagnosis of the cases was confirmed according to the WHO interim guidance. The data of consecutive severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to these hospitals were analyzed. A total of 566 patients from the People's Hospital of Wuhan University were included in the training cohort and 436 patients from Leishenshan Hospital were included in the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression were used to select the variables and build the mortality risk prediction model. Results: The prediction model was resented as a nomograph and developed based on identified predictors, including age, chronic lung disease, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), creatine, and total bilirubin. In the training cohort, the model displayed good discrimination with an AUC of 0.912 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884-0.940] and good calibration (intercept = 0; slope = 1). In the validation cohort, the model had an AUC of 0.922 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.891-0.953] and a good calibration (intercept = 0.056; slope = 1.161). The decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: A risk score for severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality was developed and externally validated. This model can help clinicians to identify individual patients at a high mortality risk.","Chen, Bo; Gu, Hongqiu; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Guqin; Yang, Hang; Hu, Huifang; Lu, Chenyang; Li, Yang; Wang, Liyi; Zhao, Yi; Pan, Huaqin",,610,1

The pathogenesis of severe cases remains unknown. We performed an in-depth prospective analysis of immune and inflammation markers in two patients with severe COVID-19 disease from presentation to convalescence. Peripheral blood from 18 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 9 with severe and 9 with mild COVID-19 disease, was obtained at admission and analyzed for T-cell activation profile, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cytokine profiles. MDSC functionality was tested in vitro. In four severe and in four mild patients, a longitudinal analysis was performed daily from the day of admission to the early convalescent phase. Early after admission severe patients showed neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increase in effector T cells, a persisting higher expression of CD95 on T cells, higher serum concentration of IL-6 and TGF-ß, and a cytotoxic profile of NK and T cells compared with mild patients, suggesting a highly engaged immune response. Massive expansion of MDSCs was observed, up to 90% of total circulating mononuclear cells in patients with severe disease, and up to 25% in the patients with mild disease; the frequency decreasing with recovery. MDSCs suppressed T-cell functions, dampening excessive immune response. MDSCs decline at convalescent phase was associated to a reduction in TGF-ß and to an increase of inflammatory cytokines in plasma samples. Substantial expansion of suppressor cells is seen in patients with severe COVID-19. Further studies are required to define their roles in reducing the excessive activation/inflammation, protection, influencing disease progression, potential to serve as biomarkers of disease severity, and new targets for immune and host-directed therapeutic approaches.","Agrati, Chiara; Sacchi, Alessandra; Bordoni, Veronica; Cimini, Eleonora; Notari, Stefania; Grassi, Germana; Casetti, Rita; Tartaglia, Eleonora; Lalle, Eleonora; D039,; Abramo, Alessandra; Castilletti, Concetta; Marchioni, Luisa; Shi, Yufang; Mariano, Andrea; Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Chao; Fimia, Gian Maria; Capobianchi, Maria R; Piacentini, Mauro; Antinori, Andrea; Nicastri, Emanuele; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ippolito, Giuseppe",Cell Death Differ,610,22

In an observational study, unbound piperacillin concentrations (n = 196) were assessed in 78 critically ill patients following continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam (ratio 8:1). The initial dose of 8, 12, or 16 g (piperacillin component) was determined by individual creatinine clearance (CRCL). Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the EUCAST clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/liter), and the following PK/PD targets were evaluated: 100% free time (fT) > 1× MIC and 100% fT > 4× MIC. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3 consisting of a one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination separated into nonrenal and renal (linearly increasing with patient CRCL) clearances. Target attainment was predicted and visualized for all individuals based on the utilized CRCL dosing algorithm. The target of 100% fT > 1× MIC was achieved for all patients based on the administered dose, but few patients achieved the target of 100% fT > 4× MIC. Probability of target attainment for a simulated cohort of patients showed that increasing the daily dose by 4-g increments (piperacillin component) did not result in substantially improved target attainment for the 100% fT > 4× MIC target. To conclude, in patients with high CRCL combined with high-MIC bacterial infections, even a continuous infusion (CI) regimen with a daily dose of 24 g may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic concentrations.","Klastrup, Vibeke; Thorsted, Anders; Storgaard, Merete; Christensen, Steffen; Friberg, Lena E; Öbrink-Hansen, Kristina",,610,1

It is known that periods of stress and psychological distress can affect women's menstrual cycles. We therefore performed an observational study of women's reproductive health over the course of the pandemic thus far. Materials and Methods: An anonymous digital survey was shared by the authors via social media in September 2020. All women of reproductive age were invited to complete the survey. Results: 1031 women completed the survey. Mean age was 36.7 ± 6.6 years (range, 15-54). 693/70% reported recording their cycles using an app or diary. 233/23% were using hormonal contraception. 441/46% reported a change in their menstrual cycle since the beginning of the pandemic. 483/53% reported worsening premenstrual symptoms, 100/18% reported new menorrhagia (p = 0.003) and 173/30% new dysmenorrhea (p < 0.0001) compared to before the pandemic. 72/9% reported missed periods who not previously missed periods (p = 0.003) and the median number of missed periods was 2 (1-3). 17/21% of those who ""occasionally"" missed periods pre-pandemic missed periods ""often"" during pandemic. 467/45% reported a reduced libido. There was no change in the median cycle length (28 days) or days of bleeding (5) but there was a wider variability of cycle length (p = 0.01) and a 1 day median decrease in the minimum (p < 0.0001) and maximum (p = 0.009) cycle length. Women reported a median 2 kg increase in self-reported weight and a 30-min increase in median weekly exercise. 517/50% of women stated that their diet was worse and 232/23% that it was better than before the pandemic. 407/40% reported working more and 169/16% were working less. Women related a significant increase in low mood (p < 0.0001), poor appetite (p < 0.0001), binge eating (p < 0.0001), poor concentration (p < 0.0001), anxiety (p < 0.0001), poor sleep (p < 0.0001), loneliness (p < 0.0001) and excess alcohol use (p < 0.0001). Specific stressors reported included work stress (499/48%), difficulty accessing healthcare (254/25%), change in financial (201/19%) situation, difficulties with home schooling (191/19%) or childcare (99/10%), family or partner conflict (170/16%), family illness or bereavement (156/15%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the reproductive health of women.

METHODS: Participants included child-parent dyads seen in a PED following the state's issuance of mandatory stay-at-home orders on 19 March 2020. A total of 351 children age 0-25 years and 335 parents enrolled in the study. Parents provided baseline demographic data and completed standardised surveys that assessed aspects of parental and child anxiety and parental health, as well as child new-onset maladaptive behaviours. Children &#8805;8 years of age completed surveys that assessed child anxiety. FINDINGS: Parents reported the new onset of maladaptive behaviours in children during the pandemic with frequencies up to 43%. Bivariate analysis identified predictors such as child anxiety (t(96) = -2.04, P = 0.044) as well as parental variables such as state anxiety (t(190) = -4.91, P < 0.001) and parental sensitivity to anxiety (t(243) = -3.19, P = 0.002). A logistic regression model identified parent mental health and COVID-19 anxiety as predictors of new onset maladaptive behaviours in children (X2 (6) = 42.514, P < 0.001). Specifically, every unit change in parental anxiety of COVID-19 was associated with a unit increase in maladaptive behaviours in children. CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct parent and child-related factors that predicted new onset child maladaptive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of such predictors may help clinicians to prevent maladaptive responses to the pandemic quarantine.","Heyming, Theodore W; Fortier, Michelle A; Martin, Sarah R; Lara, Bryan; Bacon, Kellie; Kain, Zeev N",J. paediatr. child health,610,24

Although a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been used as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the utility of CT based diagnostic tools have been suggested to improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Herein we propose a semi-supervised deep neural network for an improved detection of COVID-19. The proposed method utilizes CT images in a supervised and unsupervised manner to improve the accuracy and robustness of COVID-19 diagnosis. Both labeled and unlabeled CT images are employed. Labeled CT images are used for supervised leaning. Unlabeled CT images are utilized for unsupervised learning in a way that the feature representations are invariant to perturbations in CT images. To systematically evaluate the proposed method, two COVID-19 CT datasets and three public CT datasets with no COVID-19 CT images are employed. In distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 CT images, the proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.83%, sensitivity of 0.9286, specificity of 0.9832, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.9192. The results are consistent between the COVID-19 challenge dataset and the public CT datasets. For discriminating between COVID-19 and common pneumonia CT images, the proposed method obtains 97.32% accuracy, 0.9971 sensitivity, 0.9598 specificity, and 0.9326 PPV. Moreover, the comparative experiments with respect to supervised learning and training strategies demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve the diagnostic accuracy and robustness without exhaustive labeling. The proposed semi-supervised method, exploiting both supervised and unsupervised learning, facilitates an accurate and reliable diagnosis for COVID-19, leading to an improved patient care and management.","Han, Chang Hee; Kim, Misuk; Kwak, Jin Tae",PLoS One,610,16

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 52.8 ± 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 ± 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 ± 3.8) and lower (4.5 ± 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 ± 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 ± 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (&#8804; 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.","Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,610,16

Most of the participants were 31-40 years old, female (60.4%), married (72%), urban residents (87.3%), and employed (58.8%). The majority of them also had a bachelor's degree or higher (58.8%). Significant positive correlations were observed between the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and the perceived vulnerability (r = 0.192, P < 0.001), perceived severity (r = 0.092, P < 0.001), response efficacy (r = 0.398, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (r = 0.497, P < 0.001), and protection motivation (r = 0.595, P < 0.001). On the other hand, significant negative correlations were found between the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and maladaptive behavior rewards (r = - 0.243, P < 0.001) and perceived costs (r = - 0.121, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present findings showed that maladaptive behavior reward and fear negatively predicted the protective behaviors. On the other hand, response efficacy and self-efficacy positively predicted the protective behaviors; the impact of self-efficacy was the strongest. Overall, the information provided in this study can contribute to health policymaking in Iran.","Ezati Rad, Roghayeh; Mohseni, Shokrollah; Kamalzadeh Takhti, Hesamaddin; Hassani Azad, Mehdi; Shahabi, Nahid; Aghamolaei, Teamur; Norozian, Fatemeh",BMC Public Health,610,13

A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants' hesitancy. The study was conducted online in November, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 538 individuals from the general Greek population participated in the study and completed the Hesitancy Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), the Short Health Anxiety Inventory and a COVID-19-related worry question. The Hesitancy Questionnaire proved to have adequate psychometric properties. Correlation with anxiety as assessed by GAD-2 proved to be significant but low, indicating that the two scales are measuring two different concepts. The greatest hesitancy was observed in older adults for both genders (males, M = 40.86, SD = 15.24; females, M = 49.34, SD = 14.74). Women in general appeared more hesitant than men scoring higher (males, M = 36.13, SD = 15.25; females, M = 42.63, SD = 17.31) with a statistically significant difference [t(536) = - 3.706, p = .001).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of mortality comparing critically ill patients with COVID-19 to seasonal influenza. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) at two academic medical centers with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A or B infections between January 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020. Clinical data were obtained by medical record review. All patients except one had follow-up to hospital discharge or death. We used relative risk regression adjusting for age, sex, number of comorbidities, and maximum sequential organ failure scores (SOFA) on ICU day 1 to determine the risk of hospital mortality and organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 compared to influenza. RESULTS: We identified 65 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 74 with influenza. The mean (± standard deviation) age in each group was 60.4 +/- 15.7 and 56.8 +/- 17.6 years, respectively. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be male, have higher body mass index and higher rates of chronic kidney disease and diabetes. Thirty-seven percent of COVID-19 patients identified as Hispanic, compared to 10% of influenza patients. A similar proportion of patients had fever (~40%) and lymphopenia (~80%) on hospital presentation. Rates of acute kidney injury and shock requiring vasopressors were similar between the groups. While need for invasive mechanical ventilation was also similar in both groups, patients with COVID-19 had slower improvements in oxygenation, longer durations of mechanical ventilation, and lower rates of extubation compared to patients with influenza. Hospital mortality was 40% in COVID-19 patients and 19% in influenza patients (adjusted relative risk 2.13, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 3.63; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Need for invasive mechanical ventilation was common in ICU patients with COVID-19 or influenza. Compared to those with influenza, ICU patients with COVID-19 had worse respiratory outcomes, including longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 were at greater risk for in-hospital mortality, independent of age, sex, co-morbidities, and ICU severity of illness.","Cobb, Natalie L; Sathe, Neha A; Duan, Kevin I; Seitz, Kevin P; Thau, Matthew R; Sung, Clifford C; Morrell, Eric D; Mikacenic, Carmen; Kim, H Nina; Liles, W Conrad; Luks, Andrew M; Town, James; Pipavath, Sudhakar; Wurfel, Mark M; Hough, Catherine L; West, T Eoin; Bhatraju, Pavan K",Ann.

In this paper we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data, reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases, critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the pandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers in September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the epidemic.","Wells, Jonathan; Robertson, Chris; Marmara, Vincent; Yeung, Alan; Kleczkowski, Adam",,610,26

It is not known whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of death than residents without COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher mortality rate in NH residents, considering frailty status assessed with the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, made in 31 NHs in Venice, Italy, the presence of COVID-19 was ascertained with a nasopharyngeal swab. Frailty was evaluated using the MPI, modified according to the tools commonly used in our NHs. A Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using COVID-19 as exposure and mortality as outcome and stratified by MPI tertiles. Similar analyses were run using MPI tertiles as exposure. RESULTS: Overall, 3946 NH residents (median age = 87 years, females: 73.9%) were eligible, with 1136 COVID-19 + . During a median follow-up of 275 days, higher values of MPI, indicating frailer people, were associated with an increased risk of mortality. The incidence of mortality in COVID-19 + was more than doubled than COVID-19- either in MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3 groups. The presence of COVID-19 increased the risk of death (HR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59-2.15), also in the propensity score model using MPI as confounder (HR = 2.48; 95% CI 2.10-2.93). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of NH residents, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality than those not affected by COVID-19 also considering the different grades of frailty.","Veronese, Nicola; Koyanagi, Ai; Stangherlin, Vanni; Mantoan, Paola; Chiavalin, Marco; Tudor, Florina; Pozzobon, Gianfranco; Tessarin, Michele; Pilotto, Alberto",Aging clin. exp. res,610,17

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of physical activity among Swiss office workers. Methods: Office workers from two Swiss organizations, aged 18-65 years, were included. Baseline data from January 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic became effective in Switzerland were compared with follow-up data during the lockdown phase in April 2020. Levels of physical activity were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Paired sample t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Data from 76 participants were analyzed. Fifty-four participants were female (71.1%). The mean age was 42.7 years (range from 21.8 to 62.7) at baseline. About 75% of the participants met the recommendations on minimal physical activity, both before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown. Weak statistical evidence for a decline in total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week (MET min/week) was found (estimate = -292, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 74, p-value = 0.09), with no evidence for a decrease in the three types of activity: walking (estimate = -189, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 100, p-value = 0.28), moderate-intensity activity (estimate = -200, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 30, p-value = 0.22) and vigorous-intensity activity (estimate = 80, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 460, p-value = 0.74). Across the three categories ""high,"" ""moderate,"" and ""low"" physical activity, 17% of the participants became less active during the lockdown while 29% became more active. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a reduction in total physical activity levels among a sample of Swiss office workers during the first weeks of lockdown.

RLF-100™ (aviptadil), a synthetic form of VIP has been granted Fast Track Designation for treating Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure and is currently in phase 2/3 placebo-controlled trials. Methods: Case series of 21 consecutive patients with Acute Respiratory Failure in Critical COVID-19 and multiple co-morbidities, treated with intravenous VIP. Sixteen patients were treated with mechanical ventilation and five with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Results: Twenty of 21 patients demonstrated improvement inblood oxygenation. The improvement in patients on ECOM was similar to that seen in patients treated with conventional mechanical ventilation. Available data from blood gases showed stark increases in PaO2:FiO2 ratio after the 2nd dose (Median increase = 92.5, IQR = 74) and at 24 hours after the 3rd dose (Median increase over baseline 84.5, IQR = 110). No patient showed deterioration of oxygenation below baseline during subsequent measurements. A mean 292% increase in PaO2:FiO2 ratio was seen with full or partial resolution of the “ground glass” parenchymal changes associated with COVID-19 pneumonitis in 19 patients.A laboratory panel of inflammatory markers, including LDH, troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-Dimer, and interleukin-6 was obtained prior to and post treatment with aviptadil. In all patients, improvement can be seen on each of the inflammatory markers. The largest average percent decrease was seen in C-reactive protein (76% ±3%) and interleukin-6 (75% ±3%). No patient demonstrated an increase in any of the inflammatory markers.Clinically and statistically significant improvement was seen on the WHO Ordinal Scale, where zero represents discharge to home with no need for further therapy and 10 represents death can be seen in both ventilated and ECMOtreated patients. The median improvement was 4 points (mean 2.5 points;p&lt;0.001).Comment: The short-term outcomes in these 21 patients represent a dramatic response in patients who are excluded from all other trials of COVID therapeutics. Improvement in radiographic appearance, oxygenation requirement, and inflammatory markers is consistent with in vitro evidence of direct anti-viral effect. .","Youssef, J.; Beshay, S.; Bitar, M.

With pandemic control being widely coordinated, the supply chain of FAPs was gradually optimized and improved. However, after the outbreak of COVID-19, achieving an effective supply of FAPs in future pandemics has become a key issue. The present work therefore aimed to construct a three-level supply chain based on the Stackelberg game model, consisting of suppliers, third-party logistics (TPL), and retailers, to guarantee the supply of FAPs. COVID-19 pandemic factors such as virus infection coefficients and pandemic prevention efforts were fully integrated into the model. RESULTS: Compared with the wholesale prices of FAPs, preservation efforts and pandemic prevention efforts have huge impacts on the retail prices of FAPs. When suppliers are in the leading position, the quality assurance effort level is positively correlated with the optimal profit. Compared with this situation, when FAP retailers are in the leading position, TPL providers show higher levels of pandemic prevention effort and FAP preservation effort. With an increase in consumer preference for pandemic prevention, the profits of supply-chain members when FAP retailers are in the leading position will gradually increase. CONCLUSION: This study reveals an effective supply mechanism for FAPs in metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic and describes the authors' experience of guaranteeing the quality and safety of FAPs for future pandemic cases. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","Yin, Shi; Bai, Lan; Zhang, Runqing",J. sci. food agric,610,16

The aims of this study were to assess (1) provider-reported use of medications and their perceived effectiveness and (2) degree of difficulty managing specific symptoms at episodic COVID-19 care sites and in a longitudinal monitoring program. METHODS: We sent an online survey to physicians, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses redeployed to COVID-19 care sites at an academic medical center from March to May 2020. We asked about the use of medications and perceived effectiveness of medications to treat symptoms of COVID-19 and the perceived challenge of symptom management. Comparison was made by provider type (episodic or longitudinal site of care). RESULTS: Responses from 64 providers were included. The most frequently used medications were acetaminophen (87.1% of respondents), benzonatate (83.9%), and albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDI) (80.6%). Therapies for lower respiratory tract symptoms were reported as more commonly used by longitudinal follow-up providers compared to episodic providers including guaifenesin (90.6% vs 60.0%, p = 0.007), benzonatate (93.8% vs 73.3%, p = 0.04), nebulized albuterol for patients with asthma (75.0% vs 43.3%, p = 0.019), and albuterol MDIs for patients without asthma (90.6% vs 66.7%, p = 0.029). Medications found to have the highest perceived efficacy by respondents using the therapy (> 80% reporting ""very efficacious"") included albuterol, acetaminophen for fever, non-sedating antihistamines, nasal steroid spray, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for myalgia, arthralgia, or headache. Lower respiratory symptoms and anxiety were rated as the most challenging symptoms to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Providers reported that clinical care of mild COVID-19 with medications in common use for other respiratory infections is effective, both at episodic care and longitudinal sites of care, but that specific symptoms are still challenging to manage.","O039,; Keefe, James B; Newsom, Lydia C; Taylor, Thomas H",,610,2

The northern hemisphere awaits winter with foreboding, anticipating an amplification of the current second wave of COVID-19 concurrent with annual seasonal influenza. METHODS: This paper attempts to overview current seasonal COVID-19 trends. RESULTS: Cases are spiking now in winter in Australia and also in summer weather, such as in Florida. Clearly warm weather does not significantly dampen viral spread unless public health mitigation measures are adhered to. Respiratory pathogens (including influenza), will co-circulate in winter. Co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 may worsen outcomes and mutations of either virus may change and further negatively affect such outcomes. The public in Australia has avidly taken the influenza vaccine and this, along with COVID-19 prevention measures, has drastically curbed influenza spread in this country. CONCLUSIONS: Countries in the northern hemisphere with high rates of COVID-19 should strive to reduce numbers prior to the onset of winter. Those that managed to maintain low COVID-19 rates due to public health measures should endeavor to maintain this status quo despite opening borders for economically badly needed tourists. Spikes of cases in countries wherein COVID-19 was formerly under control will deter tourists, further depressing beleaguered economies. Vigilance must be maintained until an effective vaccine becomes available. The key is to have public health driven economy whereby opening of borders and activities organized are driven by evidence based public health advice.

Adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance. Although a large body of studies have been conducted to investigate the immune mechanism in COVID-19 patients, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the BCR repertoire in patients. In this study, we used the single-cell V(D)J sequencing to characterize the BCR repertoire across convalescent COVID-19 patients. We observed that the BCR diversity was significantly reduced in disease compared with healthy controls. And BCRs tend to skew toward different V gene segments in COVID-19 and healthy controls. The CDR3 sequences of heavy chain in clonal BCRs in patients were more convergent than that in healthy controls. In addition, we discovered increased IgG and IgA isotypes in the disease, including IgG1, IgG3 and IgA1. In all clonal BCRs, IgG isotypes had the most frequent class switch recombination events and the highest somatic hypermutation rate, especially IgG3. Moreover, we found that an IgG3 cluster from different clonal groups had the same IGHV, IGHJ and CDR3 sequences (IGHV4-4-CARLANTNQFYDSSSYLNAMDVW-IGHJ6).

Knowledge about COVID-19 in CVID patients is sparse. We, here, synthesize current research addressing the level of threat COVID-19 poses to CVID patients and the best-known treatments. METHOD: Review of 14 publications. RESULTS: The number of CVID patients with moderate to severe (~29%) and critical infection courses (~10%), and the number of fatal cases (~13%), are increased compared to the general picture of COVID-19 infection. However, this might be an overestimate. Systematic cohort-wide studies are lacking, and asymptomatic or mild cases among CVID patients occur that can easily remain unnoticed. Regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy was administered in almost all patients, potentially explaining why the numbers of critical and fatal cases were not higher. In addition, the application of convalescent plasma was demonstrated to have positive effects. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses an elevated threat to CVID patients. However, only systematic studies can provide robust information on the extent of this threat. Regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy is beneficial to combat COVID-19 in CVID patients, and best treatment after infection includes the use of convalescent plasma in addition to common medication.","Weifenbach, Niels; Jung, Alisha; Lötters, Stefan",Immun.

Yet, over the long-term, questions about the order of distribution will be displaced by questions about how to achieve high levels of vaccination rates. Historically, absent incentives or mandates, Americans have shown ambivalence, if not general antipathy, towards vaccinations, and vaccination rates have generally been low for many vaccines. There is evidence that vaccination requirements across educational settings are an effective policy instrument to increase vaccination rates. We administered a large national survey to assess American's attitudes towards vaccination requirements across three educational settings (daycare, K-12 schools, and universities) in general and for COVID-19 specifically. Partisanship, gender, race, rurality, and perceptions about the appropriate role schools should play in providing health services are substantive predictors of public opinion. While Americans generally support vaccination mandates across all three settings for both types of requirements, support is consistently and significantly lower for COVID19 requirements. The effect of partisanship is accentuated for COVID-19 requirements as compared to general requirements. Drop off in support between general and COVID-19 specific requirements are driven by partisanship, gender, political knowledge, rurality, and having children in the household. Nonetheless, mandates are supported by a majority of Americans. Assessing Americans' opinions of vaccination requirements in educational settings offers an important opportunity to explore the potential of mandates as policy instrument in the government's arsenal against COVID-19 and guide public policy on the issues.","Haeder, Simon F",Vaccine,610,1

Besides describing the spatio-temporal contagion risk of the virus, ultimately, it seeks to test the hypothesis that higher population density results in exacerbated COVID-19 virulence in the community. The population density of 143 districts in Malaysia, as per data from Malaysia's 2010 population census, was plotted against cumulative COVID-19 cases and infection rates of COVID-19 cases, which were obtained from Malaysia's Ministry of Health official website. The data of these three variables were collected between 19 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. Based on the observations, districts that have high population densities and are highly inter-connected with neighbouring districts, whether geographically, socio-economically, or infrastructurally, tend to experience spikes in COVID-19 cases within weeks of each other. Using a parametric approach of the Pearson correlation, population density was found to have a moderately strong relationship to cumulative COVID-19 cases (p-value of 0.000 and R2 of 0.415) and a weak relationship to COVID-19 infection rates (p-value of 0.005 and R2 of 0.047). Consequently, we provide several non-pharmaceutical lessons, including urban planning strategies, as passive containment measures that may better support disease interventions against future contagious diseases.","Aw, Siew Bee; Teh, Bor Tsong; Ling, Gabriel Hoh Teck; Leng, Pau Chung; Chan, Weng Howe; Ahmad, Mohd Hamdan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,20

However, little research to date has empirically explored influential factors of consumer willingness toward using these novel technologies, and the effect of individual differences in predicting this willingness. Objectives: This study aims to explore (a) the influential factors of consumers' willingness to use health chatbots related to COVID-19, (b) the effect of individual differences in predicting willingness, and (c) the likelihood of using health chatbots in the near future as well as the challenges/barriers that could hinder peoples' motivations. Methods: An online survey was conducted which comprised of two sections. Section one measured participants' willingness by evaluating the following six factors: performance efficacy, intrinsic motivation, anthropomorphism, social influence, facilitating conditions, and emotions. Section two included questions on demographics, the likelihood of using health chatbots in the future, and concerns that could impede such motivation. Results: A total of 166 individuals provided complete responses. Although 40% were aware of health chatbots and only 24% had used them before, about 84% wanted to use health chatbots in the future. The strongest predictors of willingness to use health chatbots came from the intrinsic motivation factor whereas the next strongest predictors came from the performance efficacy factor. Nearly 39.5% of participants perceived health chatbots to have human-like features such as consciousness and free will, but no emotions. About 38.4% were uncertain about the ease of using health chatbots.

Initially, 154 studies were identified and, after selecting them according to eligibility criteria, 16 were included. RESULTS: Among the main recommendations according to the available evidence are air exchange in rooms as a measure to reduce the risk of infection among patients; reinforcement of measures in intensive care units; follow-up of positive case contacts; and adequate training of professionals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The studies included in the review addressed infection prevention and control practices by analyzing risks associated with exposure and listing actions to avoid complications in critically ill patients. Patterns of case transmission, contacts and associated factors were identified. Professional knowledge and attitudes were also studied, showing the importance of good infection control training, and of sufficient equipment and adequate infrastructure.Nurses are important vectors of spread. Although there is little evidence available on the effectiveness of care to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, published studies on the prevention and control of previous outbreaks of coronavirus are of considerable value.","Brito-Brito, Pedro Ruymán; Martínez-Alberto, Carlos Enrique; Cuéllar-Pompa, Leticia",Enferm. clin.

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-centre observational study SETTING: Birmingham, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 907 hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from a multi-ethnic community, admitted between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary analysis was an evaluation of cardiovascular conditions and diabetes in relation to ethnicity and social deprivation, with the end-point of inpatient death or death within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate HRs while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: 361/907 (39.8%) died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge. The presence of diabetes and hypertension together appears to confer the greatest mortality risk (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.21; p<0.001) compared with either condition alone. Age >65 years (OR 3.32; 95% CI 2.15 to 5.11), male sex (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.82), hypertension (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61) and cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.68) were independently associated with increased risk of death. The mortality risk did not differ between the quintiles of deprivation. High-sensitivity troponin I was the best predictor of mortality among biomarkers (OR 4.43; 95% CI 3.10 to 7.10). Angiotensin-receptor blockers (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96) and ACE inhibitors (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97) were not associated with adverse outcome. The Charlson Index of Comorbidity scores were significantly higher in non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The combined prevalence of hypertension and diabetes appears to confer the greatest risk, where diabetes may have a modulating effect. Hypertension and cerebrovascular disease had a significant impact on inpatient mortality. Social deprivation and ethnicity did not have any effect once the patient was in hospital.","Basu, Ansu; Agwu, Juliana Chizo; Barlow, Nicola; Lee, Brian",BMJ Open,610,16

Consistently with evidence already available for other viruses, we initially hypothesized the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence on PM, and we performed a first experiment specifically aimed at confirming or excluding this research hyphotesys. METHODS: We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (E, N, and RdRP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter. RESULTS: The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one of the three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers. Control tests to exclude false positivities were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on PM, thus suggesting a possible use as indicator of epidemic recurrence.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Perrone, Maria Grazia; Borelli, Massimo; Palmisani, Jolanda; Di Gilio, Alessia; Torboli, Valentina; Fontana, Francesco; Clemente, Libera; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro",Environ Res,610,16

For each state, Covid-19 data for 40 days (starting from May 1 for two northern states and June 1 for four southern states) are analyzed to estimate the transition probabilities between compartments and other parameters associated with the evolution of the epidemic. These quantities are then used to predict the course of the epidemic in the given state for the next 50 days (test period) under various policy allocations, leading to different values of the loss function over the training horizon. The optimal policy allocation is the one corresponding to the smallest loss. Our analysis shows that none of the six states need lockdowns over the test period, though the no lockdown prescription is to be interpreted with caution: responsible mask use and social distancing of course need to be continued. The caveats involved in modeling epidemic propagation of this sort are discussed at length. A sketch of a non-Markovian formulation of Covid-19 propagation (and more general epidemic propagation) is presented as an attractive avenue for future research in this area.","Eftekhari, Hamid; Mukherjee, Debarghya; Banerjee, Moulinath; Ritov, Ya'acov",,610,24

Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). Methods: We used the Arksey O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author's country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. Results: We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (≥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (≥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. Conclusion: The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs.","Shaukat, Natasha; Ali, Daniyal Mansoor; Razzak, Junaid",Int.

Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA. Data was compiled and statistically analysed. Results: 204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males. Mean age of the study population was 51.44 ± 16.501 years. Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample. Conclusion: Pre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers. RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures. However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team.","Kumar, K Kiran; Sampritha, U C; Maganty, Vandana; Prakash, Akshata A; Basumatary, Jessica; Adappa, Karishma; Chandraprabha, S; Neeraja, T G; Guru Prasad, N S; Preethi, B; Gangasagara, Suresh Babu; Sujatha Rathod, B L",Indian J Ophthalmol,610,16

These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index &#8805;40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to ""shelter in place,"" quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to ""flatten the curve"" by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","Preskorn, Sheldon H",J Psychiatr Pract,610,4

This study aimed at comparing the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC, within 72 h after admission) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC, beyond 72 h after admission) for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library. We only included articles from RCTs which designed to evaluate the complications, conversion to open cholecystectomy, recurrence of acute pancreatitis, the length of hospital stay, and costs between patients undergoing ELC and those undergoing DLC. We schemed to analyze data using STATA 15.0 with both the random-effects and the fixed-effect models. We computed relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4 studies involving 439 (215 vs 224) patients were included. The difference of complication rate [3.3% vs 3.2%; RR 1.03 (0.35, 3.01), P = 0.961] and rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy [3.8% vs 3.3%; RR 1.13 (0.37, 3.43), P = 0.830] are insignificant between patients who underwent ELC and ones who underwent DLC. The difference of rate of recurrence of acute pancreatitis is significant between ELC and DLC (2.17% vs 8.99%; RR 0.24 (0.08-0.70), P = 0.009). ELC does not shorten the length of hospital stay (random-effects model analysis: WMD -1.09 days (-2.67, 0.48), P = 0.173; fixed-effect model analysis: WMD -0.62 days (-1.00, -0.24), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to DLC, ELC is equally safe and feasible both in complication rate and rate of conversion to open procedure, and significantly reduces the recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis.

This retrospective assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between pre-diagnosis aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 35,370 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 32,836 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33-0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half. Findings demonstrated that pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription was strongly associated with decreased mortality rates for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. Prospective evaluation is required to more completely assess this correlation and its implications for patient care.","Osborne, Thomas F; Veigulis, Zachary P; Arreola, David M; Mahajan, Satish M; Röösli, Eliane; Curtin, Catherine M",PLoS One,610,16

Model reduction to a metapopulation model leads to a significant gain in computational efficiency, while preserving important dynamical properties. Based on a precise mathematical description of spatio-temporal ABMs, we present two different metapopulation approaches (stochastic and piecewise deterministic) and discuss the approximation steps between the different models within this framework. Especially, we show how the stochastic metapopulation model results from a Galerkin projection of the underlying ABM onto a finite-dimensional ansatz space.

Methods: For two 10-week periods before and during the lockdown, ambulance service deployment rates were analysed in 6 ambulance service areas for 6 tracer diagnoses. Random effects were minimised by comparing the results with the corresponding 2018 and 2019 time periods and a calculated expected value. Results: For emergency ambulance service calls, there was a reduction in call numbers (-16%) during the lockdown. A 20% reduction for the categories cardiac and cerebral ischaemia was found. In the urban area, the reduction in cardiac ischaemia was less pronounced at 14% than in the surrounding area at 23%.

It was observed that lockdowns and unlock down situations BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower than regular days. We applied the advanced air mass back trajectory (AMBT) model to locate airborne particulate matter dispersal from different directions to strengthen the new result. The diagnostic ratio analyses of BC shows that wood burning contribution was too high during the lockdown situations. However, during normal days, the PAHs source profile was dedicated toward biomass, coal burning, and vehicle emission as primary sources of PAHs. During the lockdown period, emission from biomass and coal burning was a significant contributor to PAHs.

We aimed to explore safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV. METHODS: In this single-arm open-label vaccination substudy within the protocol of the larger phase 2/3 trial COV002, adults aged 18-55 years with HIV were enrolled at two HIV clinics in London, UK. Eligible participants were required to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with undetectable plasma HIV viral loads (<50 copies per mL), and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per µL. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4-6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination. Outcomes were analysed in all participants who received both doses and with available samples. The COV002 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 5 and Nov 24, 2020, 54 participants with HIV (all male, median age 42·5 years [IQR 37·2-49·8]) were enrolled and received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Median CD4 count at enrolment was 694·0 cells per µL (IQR 573·5-859·5). No serious adverse events occurred. Local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after prime vaccination included pain at the injection site (26 [49%] of 53 participants with available data), fatigue (25 [47%]), headache (25 [47%]), malaise (18 [34%]), chills (12 [23%]), muscle ache (19 [36%]), joint pain (five [9%]), and nausea (four [8%]), the frequencies of which were similar to the HIV-negative participants. Anti-spike IgG responses by ELISA peaked at day 42 (median 1440 ELISA units [EUs; IQR 704-2728]; n=50) and were sustained until day 56 (median 941 EUs [531-1445]; n=49). We found no correlation between the magnitude of the anti-spike IgG response at day 56 and CD4 cell count (p=0·93) or age (p=0·48). ELISpot and T-cell proliferative responses peaked at day 14 and 28 after prime dose and were sustained to day 56. Compared with participants without HIV, we found no difference in magnitude or persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral or cellular responses (p>0·05 for all analyses). INTERPRETATION: In this study of people with HIV, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was safe and immunogenic, supporting vaccination for those well controlled on ART.

Governments can contain the disease and thereby mitigate the detrimental public health impact; allow the virus to spread to reach herd immunity; test, track, isolate, and treat; and suppress the disease regionally. An observation of Sweden and Finland showed a difference in feasible ways to communicate the chosen policy to the citizenry. Sweden assumed the herd immunity strategy and backed it up with health utilitarian arguments. This was easy to communicate to the Swedish people, who appreciated the voluntary restrictions approach and trusted their decision makers. Finland chose the contain and mitigate strategy and was towards the end of the observation period apparently hesitating between suppression and the test, track, isolate, and treat approach. Both are difficult to communicate to the general public accurately, truthfully, and acceptably. Apart from health utilitarian argumentation, something like the republican political philosophy or selective truth telling are needed. The application of republicanism to the issue, however, is problematic, and hiding the truth seems to go against the basic tenets of liberal democracy.","Häyry, Matti",Camb Q Healthc Ethics,610,6

PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95% CI=0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11).

In summary, PPI use is not associated with an increased risk of infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection.

MF-DFA indicated a multifractal nature for asset price returns, generally associated with long-term persistence. The strategy using the most efficient equities resulted in portfolios with lower levels of systematic risk (betas), indicating that the lack of efficiency is related to higher sensitivity to macroeconomic and conjuncture changes. The MVP portfolio produces higher performance than the alternatives in terms of risk and return.

According to the current reports, a situation has arisen when people need to understand the importance of social distancing and take enough precautionary measures more seriously. Maintaining social distancing and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine strategy are some common habits which people should adopt to avoid from being infected. And the growing information regarding COVID-19, its symptoms and prevention strategies help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we have considered a SAIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission where people in the susceptible environment move into asymptotically exposed class after coming contact with asymptotically exposed, symptomatically infected and even hospitalised people. The numerical study indicates that if more people from asymptotically exposed class move into quarantine class to prevent further virus transmission, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease outbreak can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. But for COVID-19, we have to wait until a proper vaccine is developed and hence natural immunity and taking proper precautionary measures is very important to avoid from being infected. In the latter part, a corresponding optimal control problem has been set up by implementing control strategies to reduce the cost and count of overall infected individuals. Numerical figures show that the control strategy, which denotes the social distancing to reduce disease transmission, works with a higher intensity almost after one month of implementation and then decreases in the last few days. Further, the control strategy denoting the awareness of susceptible population regarding precautionary measures first increases up to one month after implementation and then slowly decreases with time. Therefore, implementing control policies may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current pandemic situation as these controls reduce the overall infected population and increase the recovered population.","Saha, Sangeeta; Samanta, G P",Int J Dyn Control,610,2

INTRODUCTION: According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD: We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS: In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

COVID pandemic has added to the list of infectious agents that could result in arthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre. The study included patients who presented with clinical suspicion of post-infectious arthritis between July-September 2019 and 2020. The study was extended for another 2 months to include patients who presented between October-November 2020. The patients were categorized into post-viral arthritis, post-COVID arthritis, chikungunya arthritis and AIRDs. The demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, examination findings and laboratory parameters and the response to treatment for each participant were collected and assessed. RESULTS: In the year 2019 and 2020 (July-Sep), the corresponding number of patients analyzed were 20 and 33. The mean duration of presentation was 1.53 (±3.10) weeks. Chikungunya arthritis was noted in 10% of patients in 2019, while it was 15.15% in 2020. Other post-viral arthritis was identified in 65% and 66.67% of patients in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In the second part of the study, 65.68% of patients were classified as post-viral arthritis, including chikungunya arthritis, post-COVID arthritis and other post-viral arthritis. Around 27% were categorized as AIRDs. Rheumatoid factor negativity and anti-nuclear antibody negativity were found to be significant (P 0.0) in categorizing the patients into post-viral arthritis group, while presence of urinary symptoms (P 0.0) classified the patients into reactive arthritis. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the presence of chikungunya arthritis across the two years was comparable. Post-COVID arthritis needs to be considered as a potential differential in post-infectious arthritis. There are no identifiable characteristics (clinical or a simple routine laboratory parameter) that could differentiate the causes of post-infectious arthritis from AIRDs.","Jaladhar, P.; S, C.; Salanke, M.; Kori, D.",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,610,16

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched up to March 12, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 detection. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled. RESULTS: Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86-96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22-30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23-44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran's Q test (p < 0.01) and Higgins I2 heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%. CONCLUSION: Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation. However, the specificity is low. In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.","Xu, Buyun; Xing, Yangbo; Peng, Jiahao; Zheng, Zhaohai; Tang, Weiliang; Sun, Yong; Xu, Chao; Peng, Fang",Eur. radiol,610,10

OBJECTIVE: To present the position of the European Association of Urology (EAU) in 2021 and provide recommendations for the use of PSA testing as part of a risk-adapted strategy for the early detection of prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The authors combined their review of relevant literature, including the EAU prostate cancer guidelines 2021 update, with their own knowledge to provide an expert opinion, representing the EAU's position in 2021. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The EAU has developed a risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy for well-informed men based on PSA testing, risk calculators, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, which can differentiate significant from insignificant prostate cancer. This approach largely avoids the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of men unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms during their lifetime and facilitates an early diagnosis of men with significant cancer to receive active treatment. It also reduces advanced-stage diagnosis, thereby potentially reducing prostate cancer-specific mortality and improving quality of life. Education is required among urologists, general practitioners, radiologists, policy makers, and healthy men, including endorsement by the European Commission to adapt the European Council's screening recommendations in its 2022 plan and requests to individual countries for its incorporation into national cancer plans. CONCLUSIONS: This risk-adapted approach for the early detection of prostate cancer will reverse current unfavourable trends and ultimately save lives. PATIENT SUMMARY: The European Association of Urology has developed a patient information leaflet and algorithm for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. It can identify men who do not need magnetic resonance imaging or a biopsy and those who would not show any symptoms versus those with more aggressive disease who require further tests/treatment. We need to raise awareness of this algorithm to ensure that all well-informed men at risk of significant prostate cancer are offered a prostate-specific antigen test. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy, incorporating prostate-specific antigen testing, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, risk calculators, and biomarkers, will avoid overdiagnosis/overtreatment of insignificant cancers and ensure early detection and treatment of significant cancers, thereby improving quality of life and reducing prostate cancer-related deaths.","Van Poppel, Hendrik; Roobol, Monique J; Chapple, Christopher R; Catto, James W F; N039,; Dow, James; Sønksen, Jens; Stenzl, Arnulf; Wirth, Manfred",Eur. urol,610,1

When this suspension was enacted, it was unknown when cases would resume. OBJECTIVES: This analysis aims to estimate the regional economic impact of the pandemic specifically with regards to elective, aesthetic surgical procedures. As knowledge regarding the effects of the pandemic has grown, the authors then evaluated the accuracy of our projected estimates when compared to actual events. METHODS: Using the ASPS 2018 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, regional case volume and surgeons' fees were obtained for the top five aesthetic procedures. Models developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were used to estimate the anticipated duration of suspension by using the date that no ventilators would be required to for COVID-19 patients. This duration was used to calculate the volume of cases that would not occur. RESULTS: These estimates predict up to 1.3 billion fewer dollars will be collected in surgeons' fees, representing a 20% loss compared to 2018. The South Atlantic region is predicted to have the greatest number of OR days lost; However, the Mountain and Pacific regions are estimated to have the greatest loss in case volume and surgeons' fees. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative impact of the pandemic on life, society, and the economy is tremendous.

They includeNewDelhimetallo-ß-lactamase (NDM)-producing carbapenemase (50.4% of all species in Ontario). Antibiotic challenges for resistant bacteria in neonates pose challenges of unknown dosing and side effects. We report two antenatally diagnosed CP-CRE colonization scenarios with the NDM 1 gene. The case involves extreme preterm twins who had worsening respiratory distress at birth requiring ventilator support, with the first twin also having cardiovascular instability. They were screened for CP-CRE, and a polymyxin antibiotic commenced. In the delivery room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the follow-up clinic, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary group, contact precautions and isolation procedures were instituted. None of the infants exhibited infection with CP-CRE. Consolidating knowledge with regard to CP-CRE and modifying human behavior associated with its spread can mitigate potential negative consequences. This relates to now and later, when travel and prolific human to human contact resumes, from endemic countries, after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Standardized efforts to curb the acquisition of this infection would be judicious given the challenges of treatment and continued emerging antibiotic resistance. Simple infection control measures involving contact precautions, staff education and parental cohorting can be useful and cost-effective in preventing transmission. Attention to NICU specific measures, including screening of at-risk mothers (invitro fertilization conception) and their probands, careful handling of breastmilk, judicious antibiotic choice and duration of treatment, is warranted. What does this study add? CP-CRE is a nosocomial infection with increasing incidence globally, and a serious threat to public health, making it likely that these cases will present with greater frequency to the NICU team. Only a few similar cases have been reported in the neonatal literature. Current published guidelines provide a framework for general hospital management. Still, they are not specific to the NICU experience and the need to manage the parents' exposure and the infants. This article provides a holistic framework for managing confirmed or suspected cases of CP-CRE from the antenatal care through the NICU and into the follow-up clinic targeted at preventing or containing the spread of CP-CRE.","Seesahai, Judy Terrien Church Paige Asztalos Elizabeth Eng-Chong Melanee Arbus Jo Banihani Rudaina",Children,610,1

Severity of the disease (3.2% Vs 7.2%; p=0.0039) and requirement of ventilatory support (2.8% Vs 5.9%; p=0.0154) were significantly low in the vaccinated group despite the fact that these individuals had significantly higher age and risk factors. The rate of mortality was about 50% lower (2/132=1.51%) in the completely vaccinated breakthrough infections although mortality in individuals who had received a single dose was similar to the unvaccinated group (9/269=3.35% vs 23/666= 3.45%). Our results demonstrate that both COVISHIELD and COVAXIN are effective in preventing disease severity and mortality against the Delta variant in completely vaccinated hospitalized patients.","JagadeeshKumar, V; Sowpati, Divya Tej; Munigela, Apoorva; Banu, Sofia; Siva, Archana Bharadwaj; Sasikala, Mitnala; Nutalapati, Chandrasekhar; Kulkarni, Anand; Mukherjee, Payel; Zaveri, Lamuk; Team, - CCMB COVID-19; Team, - AIG Hospitals COVID-19 Vaccine study; Tallapaka, Karthik Bharadwaj; NageshwarReddy, D",,610,21

Antibody analysis is an important procedure for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated the IgG, IgM, and IgA responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 178) in the Al Madinah region, Saudi Arabia, participated in this study. Of the 178 patients, 72 (40%) were categorized as severe, including 50 (69%) males and 22 (31%) females. The remaining106 (60%) patients were categorized as non-severe, including 85 (80%) males and 21 (20%) females. Qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used to confirm the diagnosis of each patient. The specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in patients' sera were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between case presentations. Results: The current study showed that all severe hospitalized patients presented significantly (p < 0.0001) increased anti-S IgG and IgM antibody accumulation compared with non-severe patients. Additionally, the results also showed that 50% of severe males were positive to anti-S IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, whereas only 40% positivity for all three-antibody isotypes was observed in severe females. The study also showed that 86% of males and 81% of females categorized as severe were positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies but negative for the IgA antibody against the S protein. Conclusion: The humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 proteins commonly results in the production of antibodies against viral proteins. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG class antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than IgM class antibodies, and both IgG and IgM antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than the IgA antibody among all patients. The variations of the humoral immune responses among hospitalized patients reflect the association between disease presentations and immunity against the virus. Collectively, these findings afford new insights into the different antibody isotypes in responses to COVID-19 hospitalized patients with dissimilar disease severity.","Mahallawi, Waleed H",,610,11

There are many reasons to be concerned but, as health care workers, we want to emphasize something particular. We reacted with enormous sacrifices during the first pandemic wave, despite the uncertainty, despite the inexperience, despite the structural and managerial inadequacies (partly unavoidable). In the following months the overwhelming wave turned into a slow but continuous dripping, we had to deal with. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the term ""pandemic fatigue"" to indicate the widespread feeling of distress in the entire population as a reaction to a prolonged state of crisis whose end cannot be foreseen. Health workers are no stranger to the general population, although they perceive the world from a particular standpoint. The first concern is that doctors and nurses might not be able to make up for the flaws (largely avoidable at this point) of the health care system in case of further waves. Because the strengths are breaking down and because public support, crucial in previous months, is waning. The second concern relates to the discomfort that could affect a large part of health care workers. A state of discontent and anger never seen before between doctors and nurses is spreading all around us.

Palliative care consultation may benefit these patients and their families. Prior to the pandemic, our institution implemented a policy of automatic palliative care consultation for all patients on ECMO due to the high mortality, medical complexity, and psychosocial distress associated with these cases. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to describe the role of the palliative care team for patients on ECMO for COVID-19 infection. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes for this cohort. DESIGN: Case series. SETTINGS/SUBJECTS: All patients age 18 or older infected by the novel coronavirus who required cannulation on ECMO from March through July of 2020, at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. Inter-disciplinary palliative care consultation occurred for all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 43 years [range 28-64], mean body mass index 34.9 kg/m2 [SD 9.2], 65% Hispanic ethnicity) were cannulated on ECMO. Eleven patients died during the hospitalization (48%). Patients older than 50 years of age demonstrated a trend toward increased odds of death compared to those younger than 50 years of age (OR 9.1, P = 0.07). Patients received an average of 6.8 (SD 3.7) palliative clinical encounters across all disciplines. The actions provided by the palliative care team included psychosocial support and counseling, determination of surrogate decision maker (for 100% of patients), pain management (83%), and non-pain symptom management (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present one of the first studies describing the patient characteristics, outcomes, and palliative care actions for critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ECMO. Almost half of the patients in this cohort died during their hospitalization. Given the high morbidity and mortality of this condition, we recommend involvement of palliative care for patients/families with COVID-19 infection who are on ECMO. The impact of palliative care on patient and family outcomes, such as symptom control, satisfaction with communication, rates of anxiety, and grief experience merits further investigation.","Rao, Anirudh; Zaaqoq, Akram M; Kang, In Guk; Vaughan, Erin M; Flores, Jose; Avila-Quintero, Victor J; Alnababteh, Muhtadi H; Kelemen, Anne M; Groninger, Hunter",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,610,24

But what if we could free our desires from this fixation on looks? Science fiction writer Ted Chiang has explored this possibility in a fascinating short story - and scientific developments might, in the future, move it beyond the realm of fiction. In this paper, I lay out the prudential case for using ""attraction-expanding technology,"" and then consider it from a moral point of view. Using the technology would, in one respect, be morally good: it would benefit those whom prevailing beauty standards marginalize. But attraction-expanding technology also raises a moral concern - one that can be cast in non-harm-based and harm-based terms. I argue that the non-harm-based objection should be rejected, because it is incompatible with a moral principle central to queer rights. And the harm-based objection, I argue, is outweighed by the benefits of attraction-expanding technology, and undermined by the prerogative you have over your personal romantic choices. I conclude by considering whether, from the perspective of society, the development of attraction-expanding technology would be desirable.","Thau, Tena",Ethical Theory Moral Pract,610,16

Cell-matrix adhesions are important molecular mechanosensors that their formation and maturation are force-dependent processes. However, most studies focused on the role of cell contractility or substrate stiffness in these processes. How external mechanical force stimulates the formation and maturation of cell-matrix adhesions is largely unknown. Here, by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)-collagen microtissues as a 3D model, we found that upon short-term dynamic compression, integrin &#945;V binding, focal adhesion formation, and subsequent FAK activation, are stimulated. This compression-stimulated FAK signaling also leads to YAP activation, suggesting crosstalk between integrin-based signaling and mechanosensing. More importantly, long-term compression induces maturation of &#945;5-integrin based adhesions to form long, slender 3D-matrix adhesions (3DMAs), which are distinct from 2D focal adhesions in composition and morphology and previously found only in cell-derived matrices and native tissues. Mechanical preconditioning hMSCs with long-term compression loading induces the formation of mature integrin &#945;5-dependent 3DMAs and potentiates their osteogenesis. Collectively, this work shows that active mechanical stimulation can modulate cell-matrix interactions significantly at the cell-material interfaces in a dynamic manner, and affects cell fate decisions, demonstrating the significance of loading-based functional tissue engineering.","Li, Chuen Wai; Lau, Yu Ting; Lam, Kwok Lim; Chan, Barbara Pui",Biomaterials,610,24

Beside managements of psychological symptoms, it is mandatory to offer to the last group physical rehabilitation approaches easy to learn and self-managed at home.

It is recommended that unnecessary casting be avoided in the events that alternative methods can be applied such as in stable ankle fractures, and hindfoot/ midfoot/forefoot injuries. Fiberglass casts are suboptimal because they require a follow up for cast removal while a conventional plaster cast is amenable to self-removal by submerging in water and cutting the cotton bandages with scissors. At present, only fiberglass casts are widely available to allow waterproof casting. To reduce the contact time during casting, a custom-made 3D printed casts/splints can be ordered remotely which reduces the number of visits and shortens the contact time while it allows for self-removal by the patient. The cast is printed after the limb is 3D scanned in 5-10 seconds using the commercially available 3D scanners. In contrast to the conventional casting, a 3D printed cast/splint is washable which is an advantage during an infectious crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sedigh, Ashkan; Kachooei, Amir Reza; Beredjiklian, Pedro K.; Vaccaro, Alexander R.; Rivlin, Michael",Arch.

The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for ""coronavirus"" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.","Bento, Ana I; Nguyen, Thuy; Wing, Coady; Lozano-Rojas, Felipe; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Simon, Kosali",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,610,24

Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Callejas Rubio, José Luis; Aomar Millán, Ismael; Moreno Higueras, Manuela; Muñoz Medina, Leopoldo; López López, María; Ceballos Torres, Ángel",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,610,10

Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people's resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.","Lau, Bobo Hi-Po; Chan, Cecilia Lai-Wan; Ng, Siu-Man",Front Psychiatry,610,16

Though rates of food insecurity declined to pre-recession levels just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, they are now once again increasing. As a result, in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, millions of young children continue to grow up in households that struggle daily with a problem that is often associated with the developing world. The result is both immediate and long-term health and development deficits for children. We propose that the degree of demographic and socioeconomic congruence between the households of young children and their neighborhood of residence lends unique insights to food insecurity. We examine this using the ECLS-K 2010-2011 for children in families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty line (N = 8600). Results show that congruence between household and neighborhood education and race/ethnicity associates with the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity. For example, households with non-Hispanic black children living in neighborhoods with high proportions of non-Hispanic blacks have significantly lower probabilities of food insecurity than similar households living in neighborhoods with smaller black populations. Similarly, more highly educated families experience lower probability of food insecurity in high education neighborhoods than when they reside in low education neighborhoods. Focusing on neighborhood risk factors as absolute and independent contributors limits our understanding of how families experience food insecurity as well as any policy efforts to address it.","Denney, Justin T; Brewer, Mackenzie; Kimbro, Rachel Tolbert",Soc Sci Med,610,16

There has been a rapid increase in cases and deaths since it was identified in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019, with over 4,000,000 cases of COVID-19 including at least 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020. However, limited data about the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been reported. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes during pregnancy, pregnant women may be at a higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and developing more complicated clinical events. Information on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) may provide insights into the effects of COVID-19's during pregnancy. Even though SARS and MERS have been associated with miscarriage, intrauterine death, fetal growth restriction and high case fatality rates, the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women has been reported to be similar to that in non-pregnant women. In addition, pregnant women do not appear to be at a higher risk of catching COVID-19 or suffering from more severe disease than other adults of similar age. Moreover, there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy or during childbirth. Babies and young children are also known to only experience mild forms of COVID-19. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy.","Wang, Chiu-Lin; Liu, Yi-Yin; Wu, Chin-Hu; Wang, Chun-Yu; Wang, Chun-Hung; Long, Cheng-Yu",Int J Med Sci,610,26

Corticosteroids have a rather unclear efficacy in viral non-SARS-COV-2 pneumonias and therefore their use is not universally recommended. In SARS-COV-2 pneumonia however, it is expected that they can reduce the deleterious consequences of the virus-related systemic inflammation. AREAS COVERED: a MEDLINE search covering the period 1995-2020 was completed to identify relevant papers. SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is very complex and is represented by the interplay of many cytokine-driven inflammation pathways. Its most severe form so called cytokine storm, is an exaggerate reaction of the host infected by the virus rapidly resulting in multiple organ dysfunction (MODS). Corticosteroids have the potential to blunt the inflammation response in such patients, but their efficacy is not the same for all patients. Further on the certainties and uncertainties regarding the efficacy of this therapy in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: In patients with severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, corticosteroids can be efficacious, but it is still not clear if they can be safely used in patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease or how the optimal duration of therapy can be established.","Crisan Dabija, Radu; Antohe, Ileana; Trofor, Antigona; Antoniu, Sabina A",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,610,21

The hybrid model was considered a mid-risk option compared with remote and in-person learning models. The current study assesses school-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in the early fall using a national data set. METHODS: We assess COVID-19 case growth rates from August 10 to October 14, 2020 based on a crowdsourcing data set from the National Education Association. The study follows a retrospective cohort design with the baseline exposures being 3 teaching models: remote learning only, hybrid, and in-person learning. To assess the consistency of our findings, we estimated the overall, as well as region-specific (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) and poverty-specific (low, mid, and high) COVID-19 case-growth rates. In addition, we validated our study sample using another national sample survey data. RESULTS: The baseline was from 617 school districts in 48 states, where 47% of school districts were in hybrid, 13% were in remote, and 40% were in-person. Controlling for state-level risk and rural-urban difference, the case growth rates for remote and in-person were lower than the hybrid (odds ratio [OR]: 0.963, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.960-0.965 and OR: 0.986, 95% CI: 0.984-0.988, respectively). A consistent result was found among school districts in all 4 regions and each poverty level. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid may not necessarily be the next logical option when transitioning from the remote to in-person learning models due to its consistent higher case growth rates than the other 2 learning models.","Liu, Dong; Lin, Ge; Sun, Xiaoting; Du, Yi; Liu, Han; Qu, Ming",J Sch Health,610,24

Heterogeneity in Policy Effectiveness against COVID-19 Spread in Chile,16.676699,3.7221978,2020,"Globally, community-based initiatives are effective in protecting ecosystems and the species within them. In this paper, we analyze the emergence and large-scale expansion of a community-based environmental protection system (the Voluntary Environmental Agents Program - VEA Program) in the Brazilian Amazon and identify factors that have determined its success since its inception, 25 years ago. Collective actions to protect the environment in the region have been undertaken by local people for at least 40 years, before their legal regulation in 2001 by the federal government of Brazil, and by the Amazonas state in 2007. The system is based on territorial surveillance and monitoring, and on guidelines for the better use of the territory and its natural resources. Between 1995 and 2020, the VEA Program expanded into the two protected areas where it was first implemented reaching approximately 9 thousand km2 of area protected by the system. The number of people participating also grew in this period by around 2050%, as did the participation of women, which grew by 5600%. The system was replicated in 37 protected areas in central Amazonia, and currently covers almost 200 thousand km2 of Amazon rainforest. From our analyses we unveil four main factors that may have allowed the VEA Program to expand and flourish: (a) the communities' previous demand for an effective control system, (b) its legal formalization and regulation, (c) the support from external institutions, and (d) the consolidation of community-based management programs to fund actions. These factors shall be further investigated as to confirm their critical role in the success of the VEA Program. We demonstrate that this community-based environmental protection system has established itself as a legitimate form of social control, and as a mechanism of socio-environmental governance in the areas in which it operates. By allowing more effective protection of territories, it generates consensus amongst users for the adequate management of natural resources, especially in contexts where government's actions are absent or inefficient. We claim that this system can be replicated in various parts of the world.","Franco, Caetano L B; El Bizri, Hani R; Souza, Paulo Roberto E; Fa, Julia E; Valsecchi, João; Sousa, Isabel Soares de; Queiroz, Helder Lima de",J Environ Manage,610,24

The mode of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into host cells occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As part of the efforts to mitigate COVID-19 infections, rapid and accurate detection methods, as well as smart vaccine and drug designs with SARS-CoV-2 targeting capabilities are critically needed. This systematic review aimed to present a good mapping between the structural and functional characteristics of aptamers and their potential applications in COVID-19 theranostics. Methods: In this study, extensive discussions into the potential development of aptameric systems as robust theranostics for rapid mitigation of the virulent SARS-CoV-2 was made. Information required for this study were extracted from a systematic review of literature in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and other official related reports from reputable organisations. Results: The global burden of COVID-19 pandemic was discussed including the progress in rapid detection, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs, and development of prophylactic vaccines. Aptamers have highly specific and stable target binding characteristics which can be generated and engineered with less complexity for COVID-19 targeted theranostic applications. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to develop safe innovative biomedical technologies to mitigate the dire impact of COVID-19 on public health worldwide. Research advances into aptameric systems bode well with the fact that they can be engineered for the development of effective and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics and prophylactic vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens.","Acquah, Caleb; Jeevanandam, Jaison; Tan, Kei Xian; Danquah, Michael K",Cell Mol Bioeng,610,17

Inadequate information on the factors affecting these services could be barrier to a reduction of maternal deaths in lowincome countries. Objective To assess the uptake of antenatal, postnatal and skilled care during childbirth. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in eight villages of Nawalparasi district in southern Nepal. A total of 447 women who had given birth within the preceding 24 months were recruited using multistage random sampling. Data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Chi-square tests were used to assess association between variables. Result Over 70% of women had gone for at least four antenatal care check-ups while only 14.3% had at least three postnatal check-ups in their last pregnancies. The proportion of institution delivery was 54%. Women's literacy was associated with the uptake of antenatal services (p=< 0.001), postnatal care (p=0.04) and institutional delivery (p=< 0.001). Knowledge of antenatal (p=< 0.001) and postnatal care was also associated with uptake of respective services (p=< 0.001). Conclusion The uptake and knowledge of antenatal care was much better than of postnatal care. Home delivery rates were still very high. A scaling-up of education and awarenessraising interventions in this community could help improve the uptake of maternal health services.","Pradhan, S; van Teijlingen, E; Simkhada, P P; Dhungel, A; Silwal, R C; Fanning, P; Wasti, S P",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),610,20

The efficient transmission strategy of the pathogen includes first remaining dormant inside the infected host, next undergoing reactivation to cause post-primary tuberculosis of the lungs (PPTBL) and then transmit via aerosol to the community. In this review, we are exploring recent findings on the role of bone marrow (BM) stem cell niche in Mtb dormancy and reactivation that may underlie the mechanisms of PPTBL development. We suggest that pathogen's interaction with the stem cell niche may be relevant in potential inflammation induced PPTBL reactivation, which need significant research attention for the future development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for PPTBL, especially in a post COVID-19 pandemic world.

Especially in a developing economy like Nigeria, where tech start-up founders are faced with diverse form of constraints and environmental uncertainties. Extant literature indicated that studies are been conducted to explain tech start-up emergence. However, such studies are fragmented with findings that are determinants to tech start-up emergence, with several determinants studied in isolation, and the emergence as linear and unidimensional events. Consequently, neglecting multi-dimensional perspective, which aggregate the dimensions of events characterizing tech start-up emergence. Given the iterative, event-based process, and interactive-dependent nature of tech start-up ventures to create activity-based products/services in an open, uncertain, nonlinear and dynamic environment, we argue that little are been known about tech start-up emergence.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using claims data of the biggest German health insurance company AOK, covering 26.9 million people all over Germany. In particular, patient-related characteristics and co-medication were evaluated. A multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to identify independent predictors for the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality or need for invasive or non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: 6637 patients in 853 German hospitals were included. The primary outcome occurred in 1826 patients (27.5%). 1372 patients (20.7%) died, 886 patients (13.3%) needed respiratory support, and 53 patients (0.8%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 34 of these patients survived (64.2%). The multivariable model demonstrated that pre-existing oral anticoagulation therapy with either vitamin-K antagonists OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.40-0.83, p = 0.003) or direct oral anticoagulants OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.56-0.91, p = 0.007)-but not with antiplatelet therapy alone OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.88-1.23, p = 0.66)-was associated with a lower event rate. This finding was confirmed in a propensity match analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a multivariable analysis, a therapy with both direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin-K antagonists-but not with antiplatelet therapy-was associated with improved clinical outcomes. ACE inhibitors did not impact outcomes. Prospective randomized trials are needed to verify this hypothesis.","Fröhlich, Georg M; Jeschke, Elke; Eichler, Uwe; Thiele, Holger; Alhariri, Laila; Reinthaler, Markus; Kastrati, Adnan; Leistner, David Manuel; Skurk, Carsten; Landmesser, Ulf; Günster, Christian",Clin. res. cardiol,610,1

Thus, investigating predictors of falls in patients waiting for THA would be valuable as it lead to more strategic interventions to prevent these problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictors of falls in patients during the first year after THA. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. A total of 157 patients who underwent THA for unilateral hip osteoarthritis were analyzed. The incidence of falls during the first year after THA was monitored, and patients were classified into a ""faller"" and ""non-faller"" group. The following factors were compared between the two groups: demographic data (age, sex, body mass index, leg length discrepancy, length of hospital stay, and history of falling), preoperative hip abductor muscle strength, functional performance (single leg stance and maximum walking speed), pain during walking, and physical activity. Results: On multivariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling were predictors of falls during the first year after THA. On subsequent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side was retained as a significant predictor, with a cut-off strength of 0.46 Nm/kg differentiating the faller and non-faller groups with a specificity of 73.6%, specificity of 50.0%, and area under the curve of 70.2%. Conclusions: Finding from the present study suggested that clinicians should focus on low preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling to prevent falls during the first year after THA.","Ninomiya, Kazunari; Takahira, Naonobu; Ikeda, Takashi; Suzuki, Koji; Sato, Ryoji; Hirakawa, Kazuo",Health Sci Rep,610,23

Supply is short, with donor availability further limited by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study examined whether a novel, personalized, technology-based nomogram was noninferior with regard to significant hypotensive adverse events (AEs) in healthy donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IMPACT (IMproving PlasmA CollecTion) was a prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial carried out between January 6 and March 26, 2020, in three U.S plasma collection centers. Donors were randomly assigned to the current simplified 1992 nomogram (control) or a novel percent plasma nomogram (PPN) with personalized target volume calculation (experimental). Primary endpoint was the rate of significant hypotensive AEs. Noninferiority (NI) was tested with a margin of 0.15%. Collected plasma volume was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 3443 donors (mean [SD] BMI: 32 [7.74] kg/m2 ; 65% male) underwent 23,137 donations (median [range]: 6 [1-22] per subject). Ten significant hypotensive AEs were observed (six control; four experimental), with model-based AE incidence rate estimates (95% CI) of 0.051% (0.020%-0.114%) and 0.035% (0.010%-0.094%), respectively (p = .58). NI was met at an upper limit of 0.043% versus the predefined margin of 0.15%. There was no statistical difference between total AEs (all AE types: p = .32). Mean plasma volume collected was 777.8 ml (control) versus 841.7 ml (experimental); an increase of 63.9 ml per donation (8.2%; p < .0001). CONCLUSION: This trial showed that a novel personalized nomogram approach in healthy donors allowed approximately 8% more plasma per donation to be collected without impairing donor safety.","Hartmann, Jan; Ragusa, Michael J; Burchardt, Elmar R; Manukyan, Zorayr; Popovsky, Mark A; Leitman, Susan F",Transfusion,610,24

It is well-established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulated immune responses. Arginase-1 (Arg1), which has a pivotal role in immune cells, can be expressed in most of the myeloid cells, e.g., neutrophils and macrophages. Arg1 has been associated with the suppression of antiviral immune responses. METHODS: Whole blood was taken from 21 COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy individuals, and after RNA extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, gene expression of Arg1 was measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The qPCR results showed that the expression of Arg1 was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.01). The relative expression analysis demonstrated there were approximately 2.3 times increased Arg1 expression in the whole blood of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a considerable diagnostic value for Arg1 expression in COVID-19 (p = 0.0002 and AUC = 0.8401).

COVID-19 related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviors (r = 0.18;p &lt;0·01) and risk perception (r = 0.10;p &lt;0.05). We found a high score of COVID-19 related knowledge and precautionary behaviors and moderate risk perception among students. Conclusions: Knowledge and protective behaviors towards infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have clinical applications in developing educational and formal training programs to promote adherence to the infection control practices among dental students. Clinical significance: The findings of this study will inform policymakers to emphasize on effective risk communication. Dental institutions can incorporate infection control modules in the current curriculum, thereby making future dental professionals capable of performing effective infection control management in the clinical settings. This is critical in improving their knowledge of infection control practices to minimize the risk of nosocomial infections.","Batra, Kavita Urankar Yashashri Batra Ravi Gomes Aaron F.; S, Meru Kaurani Pragati",Healthcare,610,1

As ações do governo mostraram contradições entre a presidência e o Ministério da Saúde. O objetivo deste ensaio é a reconstituição das ações do governo federal no enfrentamento da pandemia por Covid-19. Tais ações traduziram-se em uma política organizada em três frentes: o protagonismo dos governadores; o falso dilema entre a economia e a saúde e; a militarização do Ministério da Saúde com preenchimento dos quadros do corpo técnico por militares. Nos quatro meses iniciais após o registro do primeiro caso de Covid-19, o Ministério da Saúde saiu da linha de frente das ações e os estados conduziram as principais medidas de enfrentamento por meio da compra de materiais e serviços da iniciativa privada. Instaurou-se falsa cisão entre as medidas sanitárias e as medidas de retomada econômica. A condução da saúde pública foi repassada para militares, alterando o campo técnico-político. O modo de gerir baseado na negação da epidemia e na ausência de proposições pelo Ministério da Saúde caracterizou-se pelo abandono às medidas de proteção à saúde, objetivado na pergunta 'E daí?', proferida pelo presidente da república quando questionado sobre os óbitos no Brasil.","Sodré, Francis",Trab. educ. saúde,610,24

Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms initiating this exacerbated inflammatory response, thereby contributing to further increases in blood pressure (BP), are still being revealed. While participation of lymphoid-derived immune cells has been well described in the hypertension literature, the mechanisms by which myeloid-derived innate immune cells contribute to T cell activation, and subsequent BP elevation, remains an active area of investigation. In this article, we critically analyze the literature to understand how monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, contribute to hypertension and hypertension-associated end-organ injury. The most abundant leukocytes, neutrophils, are indisputably increased in hypertension. However, it is unknown how (and why) they switch from critical first responders of the innate immune system, and homeostatic regulators of BP, to tissue-damaging, pro-hypertensive mediators. We propose that myeloperoxidase-derived pro-oxidants, neutrophil elastase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and interactions with other innate and adaptive immune cells are novel mechanisms that could contribute to the inflammatory cascade in hypertension. We further posit that the gut microbiota serves as a set point for neutropoiesis and their function. Finally, given that hypertension appears to be a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, we put forth evidence that neutrophils and NETs cause cardiovascular injury post-coronavirus infection, and thus may be proposed as an intriguing therapeutic target for high-risk individuals. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

The South African government has imposed a number of measures aimed at controlling the pandemic, chief being a nationwide lockdown. This has resulted in income loss for individuals and firms, with vulnerable populations (low earners, those in informal and precarious employment, etc.) more likely to be adversely affected through job losses and the resulting income loss. Income loss will likely result in reduced ability to access healthcare and a nutritious diet, thus adversely affecting health outcomes. Given the foregoing, we hypothesize that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will disproportionately affect the health of the poor. METHODS: Using the fifth wave of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset conducted in 2017 and the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset conducted in May/June 2020, this paper estimated income-related health inequalities in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health was a dichotomized self-assessed health measure, with fair and poor health categorized as ""poor"" health, while excellent, very good and good health were categorized as ""better"" health. Household per capita income was used as the ranking variable. Concentration curves and indices were used to depict the income-related health inequalities. Furthermore, we decomposed the COVID-19 era income-related health inequality in order to ascertain the significant predictors of such inequality. RESULTS: The results indicate that poor health was pro-poor in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, with the latter six times the value of the former. Being African (relative to white), per capita household income and household experience of hunger significantly predicted income-related health inequalities in the COVID-19 era (contributing 130%, 46% and 9% respectively to the inequalities), while being in paid employment had a nontrivial but statistically insignificant contribution (13%) to health inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significance and magnitude of race, hunger, income and employment in determining socioeconomic inequalities in poor health, addressing racial disparities and hunger, income inequality and unemployment will likely mitigate income-related health inequalities in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nwosu, Chijioke O; Oyenubi, Adeola",Int J Equity Health,610,10

We have compared both the experiments' results, and it can be forenamed that LSTM has shown more satisfactory results. Upon study and testing on several models, we have shown that LSTM works better on a scenario-based model for Bangladesh with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)-4.51, root-mean-square error (RMSE)-6.55, and correlation coefficient-0.75.

Since its bioavailability is low at high doses, dose proportionality is not achieved for pharmacokinetic parameters. However, when taken with food, its bioavailability increases at high doses. In this study, nanocrystal technology was used to increase the solubility and, hence, the bioavailability of RXB. Pluronic F127, pharmacoat 603, and PVP K-30 were used as stabilizers to prepare RXB nanosuspension, combining ball mill and high pressure homogenization methods. Particle sizes of RXB in nanosuspension (formulation A:348 nm; formulation B:403 nm) and nanocrystal formulations (formulation A:1167 nm; formulation B:606 nm) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared to those of bulk RXB. In both formulations, 80% of the drug dissolved in 30 min. For dose proportionality evaluation, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg of RXB nanosuspensions (formulation B) were administered to rabbits. The dose proportionality for AUC and Cmax of RXB nanocrystals was assessed by the power model, variance analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters, linear regression, and equivalence criterion methods. Dose proportionality for AUC was achieved at doses between 10-15 and 3-15 mg/kg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents' concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Massive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 -7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P < 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%). Almost half were summoned to work on the COVID-19 front-line and 24.4% had COVID-19. Most residents had inadequate training to deal with COVID-19 patients and most reported a shortage of PPE. Residents' concerns included the risk of contaminating family members, being away from residency program, developing severe COVID-19 and overloading colleagues.

If adopted, the Consensus Model would align state laws related to APRNs and would clear the way for an APRN Compact, which would allow APRNs to practice across state borders. Although some states have completely adopted the Consensus Model's elements in the 13 years since its publication, many have not. Without regulatory uniformity, APRNs cannot efficiently provide care where needed throughout the country or practice to the full extent of their education, leaving some without access to quality care.

However, the evidence for an association between PFAS and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) is equivocal and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between background levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and the development of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in a Canadian pregnancy cohort. We also explored the potential for effect modification according to fetal sex. METHODS: Maternal plasma samples were collected in the first trimester from participants in the MIREC study and were analyzed for PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS. Blood pressure was measured during each trimester. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were defined using the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines. Logistic regression models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between PFAS concentrations (per doubling of concentration as well as according to tertiles) and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association between PFAS concentrations and changes in blood pressure throughout pregnancy. RESULTS: Data from 1739 participants were analyzed. 90% of women were normotensive throughout pregnancy, 7% developed gestational hypertension without preeclampsia, and 3% developed preeclampsia. In the full analyses, neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. However, each doubling of PFHxS plasma concentration was associated with higher odds of developing preeclampsia (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). In addition, participants in the highest PFHxS tertile (1.4-40.0 µg/L) had higher odds of developing preeclampsia relative to those in the lowest tertile (OR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.27, 7.39). In stratified analyses, this effect was only apparent among women carrying a female fetus (OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 1.02, 22.3). However, among women carrying a male fetus, both PFOS and PFHxS were associated with gestational hypertension, but not preeclampsia. Higher plasma concentrations of all three PFAS were associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy, and PFOA and PFHxS were also associated with systolic blood pressure. Discrepant findings were similarly revealed in analyses stratified by fetal sex. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of PFHxS were associated with the development of preeclampsia, but not gestational hypertension. Neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with either outcome. However, we show, for the first time, that fetal sex may modify these associations, a finding which warrants replication and further study.","Borghese, Michael M; Walker, Mark; Helewa, Michael E; Fraser, William D; Arbuckle, Tye E",Environ Int,610,20

There were three key findings: 1) high copy infectious virus was limited mostly to the alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells of the septal capillaries; 2) viral spike protein without viral RNA localized to ACE2+ endothelial cells in microvessels that were most abundant in the subcutaneous fat and brain; 3) although both infectious virus and docked viral spike protein was associated with complement activation, only the endocytosed pseudovirions induced a marked up-regulation of the key COVID-19 associated proteins IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, p38, IL8, and caspase 3. Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as the expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response.","Magro, Cynthia M; Mulvey, Justin; Kubiak, Jeffrey; Mikhail, Sheridan; Suster, David; Crowson, A Neil; Laurence, Jeffrey; Nuovo, Gerard",Ann Diagn Pathol,610,18

Others have permitted patients to decline testing. Little is known about the rate of COVID-19 infection in acute psychiatric inpatients. Characterizing the proportion of infected patients who have an asymptomatic presentation will help inform policy regarding universal mandatory versus symptom-based or opt-out testing protocols. We determined the COVID-19 infection rate and frequency of asymptomatic presentation in 683 consecutively admitted patients during the surge in the New York City region between April 3rd, 2020 and June 8th, 2020. Among these psychiatric inpatients, there was a 9.8 % overall rate of COVID-19 infection. Of the COVID-19 infected patients, approximately 76.1 % (51/67) either had no COVID-19 symptoms or could not offer reliable history of symptoms at the time of admission. Had they not been identified by testing and triaged to a COVID-19 positive unit, they could have infected others, leading to institutional outbreak. These findings provide justification for psychiatric facilities to maintain universal mandatory testing policies, at least until community infection rates fall and remain at very low levels.","Brody, Benjamin D; Shi, Zhenzhen; Shaffer, Charles; Eden, Daniel; Wyka, Katarzyna; Alexopoulos, George S; Parish, Sharon J; Kanellopoulos, Dora",Psychiatry Res,610,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns. RESULTS: The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of 6 subcategories of the SDSC questionnaire regarding the present time and six months before symptom onset. The total SDSC scores were also similar in two different evaluation time points described above (p=0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that COVID-19 did not impact the sleep parameters of children. Serum melatonin levels of all patients were higher than the reference range; however, they were higher in the non-COVID-19 patient group than the COVID-19 group. Since serum melatonin levels were higher than the reference values in children with COVID-19, and this disease is significantly less morbid in children, melatonin may have protective effects against COVID-19.","Yayici Köken, Özlem; Gültutan, Pembe; Güngören, Merve Sibel; Bayhan, Gülsüm Iclal; Yilmaz, Deniz; Gürkas, Esra; Özyürek, Hamit; Çitak Kurt, Aysegül Nese",Turkish journal of medical sciences,610,16

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, &#916; = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, &#916; = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, &#916; = 3, P = .001).

Outcomes of surgical versus percutaneous and outcomes relative to tracheostomy timing were also analysed. Studies reporting outcome data on patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy were identified and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Outcome data were analysed using a random-effects model. From 1016 unique studies, 39 articles reporting outcomes for a total of 3929 patients were included for meta-analysis. Weighted mean follow-up time was 42.03±26 days post-tracheostomy. Meta-analysis showed that 61.2% of patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation [95%CI 52.6%-69.5%], 44.2% of patients were decannulated [95%CI 33.96%-54.67%], and cumulative mortality was found to be 19.23% [95%CI 15.2%-23.6%] across the entire tracheostomy cohort. The cumulative incidence of complications was 14.24% [95%CI 9.6%-19.6%], with bleeding accounting for 52% of all complications. No difference was found in incidence of mortality (RR1.96; p=0.34), decannulation (RR1.35, p=0.27), complications (RR0.75, p=0.09) and time to decannulation (SMD 0.46, p=0.68) between percutaneous and surgical tracheostomy. Moreover, no difference was found in mortality (RR1.57, p=0.43) between early and late tracheostomy, and timing of tracheostomy did not predict time to decannulation. Ten confirmed nosocomial staff infections were reported from 1398 tracheostomies. This study provides an overview of outcomes of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, and contributes to our understanding of tracheostomy decisions in this patient cohort.","Ferro, A; Kotecha, S; Auzinger, G; Yeung, E; Fan, K",Br. j. oral maxillofac. surg,610,24

Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or outbreaks rise before lab-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public Health policies. We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with coefficient of determination $R^2>0.85$. This result allows us to estimate the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days before the lab results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data. We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit example in Villa Azul (Quilmes) where this tool resulted crucial to control an outbreak on time. The presented tools have been designed in urgency with the available data at the time of the development, and therefore have their limitations which we describe and discuss.

That evidence is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future, hidden as it is (or even destroyed) behind the impenetrable wall of secrecy that surrounds coronavirus research in China. However, it is becoming increasingly likely that the gain of function research on pathogenic viruses, so vigorously defended in the US by influential sections of the scientific establishment, may have contributed significantly to Chinese efforts in this area. Thus far, the major scientific journals, which act as gatekeepers for the credibility of the scientific literature have refrained from weighing in on the controversy surrounding the origins of the coronavirus. Their own credibility has been strained by their uncritical publication of correspondence last year, declaring that a natural origin for the virus was almost a foregone conclusion.","Balaram, P.",Current Science,610,1

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) may therefore aid in risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Non-contrast chest CT studies on 180 COVID-19 patients &#8805; age 21 admitted from March 1, 2020 to April 27, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists to determine CAC scores. Following feature selection, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between CAC scores and patient outcomes. RESULTS: The presence of any identified CAC was associated with intubation (AOR: 3.6, CI: 1.4-9.6) and mortality (AOR: 3.2, CI: 1.4-7.9). Severe CAC was independently associated with intubation (AOR: 4.0, CI: 1.3-13) and mortality (AOR: 5.1, CI: 1.9-15). A greater CAC score (UOR: 1.2, CI: 1.02-1.3) and number of vessels with calcium (UOR: 1.3, CI: 1.02-1.6) was associated with mortality. Visualized coronary stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) had no statistically significant association with intubation (AOR: 1.9, CI: 0.4-7.7) or death (AOR: 3.4, CI: 1.0-12). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with any CAC were more likely to require intubation and die than those without CAC. Increasing CAC and number of affected arteries was associated with mortality. Severe CAC was associated with higher intubation risk. Prior CABG or stenting had no association with elevated intubation or death.","Gupta, Yogesh Sean; Finkelstein, Mark; Manna, Sayan; Toussie, Danielle; Bernheim, Adam; Little, Brent P; Concepcion, Jose; Maron, Samuel Z; Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Kukar, Nina; Voutsinas, Nicholas; Cedillo, Mario A; Fernandes, Ajit; Eber, Corey; Fayad, Zahi A; Hota, Partha",Clin Imaging,610,29

METHODS: The research design was a prospective observational study that included 35 persistent allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. All patients who were diagnosed with persistent AR were included. A skin prick test was applied to all patients, and the Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 was used to evaluate sinonasal symptoms. Thiol/disulfide homeostasis balance parameters were measured using a novel automatic and spectrophotometric method and compared statistically. Serum total thiol (TT), native thiol (SH), disulphide (SS), disulphide/native thiol (SS/SH), disulphide/total thiol (SS/TT), and native thiol/total thiol (SH/TT) ratios were measured after the second month of the treatment. RESULTS: The 35 patients included 20 (58%) females and 15 (42%) males. The mean age of the patients was 33.17 ± 9.9 years. Disulphide, SS/SH, and SS/TT ratios decreased significantly after the treatment (P < .05), while SH and SH/TT increased significantly (P < .05). The mean SH measurement increased significantly in the second month (P = .001), but TT mean measurements showed no difference after the treatment (P = .058). The mean SS measurements, on the other hand, decreased significantly in the second month (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Thiol/disulfide homeostasis may be used as a marker to evaluate the efficacy of persistent AR treatments. After the treatment, the increase in SH levels suggested the decrease in oxidative stress, even though allergen exposure continued.","Göker, Ayse E; Alagöz, Maide H; Kumral, Tolgar L; Karaketir, Semih; Yilmazer, Ayça B; Tutar, Belgin; Ahmed, Esmail A; Biçer, Cemile; Uyar, Yavuz",Ear Nose Throat J,610,18

Although the majority of patients present with fever, dyspnea, cough, or myalgia, various signs and symptoms have been reported for this disease. Recently, neurological symptoms have been noticed in patients with COVID-19 with unknown etiology. However, the occurrence of strokes in young and middle aged patients with COVID-19 is not fully explained. METHODS: In this series, six patients younger than 55 years of age with diagnosis of stroke and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated for symptoms, lab data, imaging findings, and outcomes from March 2020 to the end of April 2020 from all stroke cases in a tertiary academic hospital. Patients older than 55 and all others who had evidence of cardiac abnormalities (arrhythmia/valvular) were excluded. RESULTS: Fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms noted in 66.66% (4/6), 66.66% (4/6), 50% (3/6), and 50% (3/6) of the patients, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for the patient was 10.16 ± 7.13 (ranged 5-24). The most involved area was middle cerebral artery (MCA) (five in MCA versus one in basal ganglia) and the majority of our patients had a low lung involvement score (mean ± SD: 13.16 ± 6.49 out of 24). Finally, one patient was deceased and rest discharged. CONCLUSION: Stroke may be unrelated to age and the extent of lung involvement. However, different factors may play roles in co-occurrence of stroke and COVID-19 and its outcome.

How to cooperate with the government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education and clinical practice represent significant challenges. In this paper, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario exercises. The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals. After implementation of these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for the on-campus clinical practicum than for the off-campus clinical practicum. Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and commented positively on their experience. For example, the students indicated that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning outcomes. The adjusted nursing clinical practicum described in this paper may be used as a reference to ensure the quality of nursing clinical practicum programs is maintained during epidemics.","Liu, Ying-Mei; Chen, Miao-Chuan; Chung, Fen-Fang; Huang, Hsiang-Ping; Chao, Li-Fen; Chen, Mei-Yen; Jane, Sui-Whi; Fan, Jun-Yu",Hu Li Za Zhi,610,24

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65 ± 16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the pandemic, many have posited that virtual visits will endure even as in-person visits are reinstated. The public's perception of telemedicine for an initial surgical consultation has not been previously studied. METHODS: A 43-question survey assessed respondents' attitudes toward telemedicine for initial consultations with surgeons, both in the context of COVID-19 and during ""normal circumstances."" Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing marketplace. RESULTS: Based on 1827 analyzable responses, we found that a majority (86%) of respondents reported being satisfied (either extremely or somewhat) with telemedicine encounters. Interestingly, preference for in-person versus virtual surgical consultation reflected access to care, with preference for telemedicine decreasing from 72% to 33% when COVID-related social distancing ends. Preferences for virtual visits decreased with increasing complexity of the surgical intervention, even during the pandemic. A majority felt that ""establishing trust and comfort"" was best accomplished in person, and the vast majority felt it was important to meet their surgeons prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The public views telemedicine as an acceptable substitute for in-person visits, especially during the pandemic. However, it appears that an in-person interaction is still preferred when possible for surgical consultations. If telemedicine services are to persist beyond social distancing, further exploration of its impact on the patient-surgeon relationship will be needed.","Sorensen, Meredith J; Bessen, Sarah; Danford, Julia; Fleischer, Christina; Wong, Sandra L",Ann. surg,610,12

AIM: A method for accurate and applicable real-time quantification of local sO2 with OA imaging. APPROACH: We combine multiple illumination (MI) sensing with learned spectral decoloring (LSD). We train LSD feedforward neural networks and random forests on Monte Carlo simulations of spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra, to apply the trained models to real OA measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable, reproducible, and easily scalable phantom model, based on copper and nickel sulfate solutions. RESULTS: With this sulfate model, we see a consistently high estimation accuracy using MI-LSD, with median absolute estimation errors of 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points. We further find fewer outliers in MI-LSD estimates compared with LSD. Random forest regressors outperform previously reported neural network approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Random forest-based MI-LSD is a promising method for accurate quantitative OA oximetry imaging.","Kirchner, Thomas; Frenz, Martin",J. biomed. opt. (Online),610,16

While leaders often claim responses are based on the best available advice from scientists and public health experts, recent policy diffusion research suggests that countries are emulating the COVID-19 policies of their neighbors instead of responding to domestic conditions. Political and geographic considerations play a role in determining which countries imitate one another, but even among countries that are politically or geographically distant, nationalist regimes seem to favor certain approaches towards the pandemic. We investigate why this is the case by examining whether countries that embrace a nationalist ideology are more likely to emulate the COVID-19 policies of similarly nationalist regimes. We demonstrate that, even after controlling for domestic circumstances and linguistic, trade, geographic, and political connections, nationalist countries are emulating each other's responses. These results are robust and shed light not only on new mechanisms of policy diffusion but also on the growing international cooperation of nationalist regimes and leaders.","Givens, John Wagner; Mistur, Evan",J Chin Polit Sci,610,1

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Setting and Participants, All patients undergoing anterior segment surgery at an Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) belonging to a tertiary academic center in South Florida during a 102-day period between June and September 2020 received nasal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent a relevant review of symptoms prior to surgery, with negative results required for both in order to proceed with surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures, A small sample of aqueous humor (approximately 0.2cc) was acquired at the beginning of anterior segment surgery in all participants. Aqueous humor was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Demographic information was acquired from participants for secondary analyses. RESULTS: A total of 70 samples were acquired. Of these, 39 were excluded due to insufficient material or inconclusive results. Out of 31 samples that were successfully analyzed, 6 (19.4%) demonstrated detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. None of the six individuals (0%) with detectable viral RNA in aqueous humor reported symptoms during the year, compared to 2 of 25 individuals (8%) with negative samples (p=1). Positive samples were distributed throughout the study period, including both the first and the last day of enrollment. CONCLUSION: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in aqueous despite negative nasal swab testing confirms its presence beyond the blood-ocular barrier in asymptomatic individuals and raises the possibility that the virus may persist in immunoprivileged spaces despite an absence of symptoms.","Koo, Ellen H; Eghrari, Allen O; Dzhaber, Daliya; Shah, Amar; Fout, Elizabeth; Dubovy, Sander; Maestre-Mesa, Jorge; Miller, Darlene",Am. j. ophthalmol,610,29

Governments, decision-makers and policy-makers broadly need information about the effectiveness of a control intervention concerning its cost-benefit to evaluate whether a control intervention offers the best value for money. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number R c , to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied. The main finding is that having two controls (transmission reduction and case isolation) is better than having one control, but is economically expensive. In case only one control is affordable, then transmission reduction is better than case isolation. Hopefully, the results of this research should help policy-makers when dealing with multiple waves of COVID-19.","Asamoah, Joshua Kiddy K; Jin, Zhen; Sun, Gui-Quan; Seidu, Baba; Yankson, Ernest; Abidemi, Afeez; Oduro, F T; Alzahrani, Faris; Moore, Stephen E; Okyere, Eric",Chaos Solitons Fractals,610,26

The early detection of this pathology is very helpful for minimizing the chances of stroke, other heart-related disorders, and coronary artery diseases. This paper proposes a novel method for the detection of AF pathology based on the analysis of the ECG signal. The method adopts a multi-rate cosine filter bank architecture for the evaluation of coefficients from the ECG signal at different subbands, in turn, the Fractional norm (FN) feature is evaluated from the extracted coefficients at each subband. Then, the AF detection is carried out using a deep learning approach known as the Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (H-ELM) from the FN features. The proposed method is evaluated by considering normal and AF pathological ECG signals from public databases. The experimental results reveal that the proposed multi-rate cosine filter bank based on FN features is effective for the detection of AF pathology with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 99.40%, 98.77%, and 100%, respectively. The performance of the proposed diagnostic features of the ECG signal is compared with other existing features for the detection of AF. The low-frequency subband FN features found to be more significant with a difference of the mean values as 0.69 between normal and AF classes.","Ghosh, S K; Tripathy, R K; Paternina, Mario R A; Arrieta, Juan J; Zamora-Mendez, Alejandro; Naik, Ganesh R",J Med Syst,610,26

Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (>50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for >15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality.","Bryan-Brown, Dale N; Connolly, Rod M; Richards, Daniel R; Adame, Fernanda; Friess, Daniel A; Brown, Christopher J",Sci Rep,610,24

This thread spray method explores the use of evidentiary fabric threads for rapid determination of hemoglobin directly from whole blood within textiles without prior extraction steps. The multiplicity of information that can be derived from the thread spray MS method distinguishes it from the current presumptive Bluestar® method, by enabling the detection of hemoglobin (both &#945;- and ß-chains), the heme co-factor and lipids all from a single blood sample. Lipid composition was found to differ for blood samples originating from human, canine, and horse species. The robustness of the thread spray MS method as a forensic analytical platform was evaluated in three ways: (1) its successful applicability to samples previously tested by the Bluestar® presumptive method, offering a confirmatory test without prior sample pre-treatment, (2) successful detection of heme from previously washed fabrics, which demonstrated the unprecedented sensitivity of the thread spray method, and (3) the ability to analyze samples stored under ambient conditions for up to 30 days. These results attest to the potential capabilities of the thread spray MS platform in forensic serology, and its application for direct analysis of evidentiary garments, which confer the advantages of rapid analysis and the reduction of the false positive and negative identification rates for blood on textiles.","Jackson, Sierra; Frey, Benjamin S; Bates, Maia N; Swiner, Devin J; Badu-Tawiah, Abraham K",Analyst,610,15

Furthermore, we expect that career future time perspective mitigates the harmful effects of IAWC on service and helping behaviors. We tested our moderated mediation model using data collected from multiple time points and multiple resources (i.e., hotel employees and their corresponding supervisors). The results show that IAWC indirectly influences service and helping behaviors via intrinsic motivation. In addition, career future time perspective moderated the effects of IAWC, such that the indirect effects of IAWC were weakened when employees' career future time perspective was high.

METHODS: AXL was retrospectively assessed by immunohistochemistry in 307 patients. RAS wild-type (WT) patients (N = 136) received first-line anti-EGFR-based therapy; RAS mutant patients (N = 171) received anti-angiogenic-based regimens. Preclinical experiments were performed using human RAS WT CRC cell lines and xenograft models. AXL RNA levels were assessed in a cohort of patients with available samples at baseline and at progression to anti-EGFR treatment and in the GSE5851 dataset. RESULTS: AXL was expressed in 55/307 tumour tissues, correlating with worse survival in the overall population (AXL-positive, 23.7 months; AXL-negative, 30.8 months; HR, 1.455, P = 0.032) and in RAS WT patients (AXL-positive, 23.0 months; AXL-negative, 35.8 months; HR,1.780, P = 0.032). Progression-free survival (PFS) in the RAS WT cohort was shorter in the AXL-positive cohort (6.2 months versus 12.1 months; HR, 1.796, P = 0.013). Three-dimensional cultures obtained from a patient following anti-EGFR therapy resulted AXL-positive, showing resistance to anti-EGFR drugs and sensitivity to AXL inhibition. AXL transfection in CRC cell lines induced AXL overexpression and resistance to the EGFR blockade. At progression to cetuximab, 2/10 SW48-tumour xenograft mice showed AXL expression. Consistently, AXL RNA levels increased in 5/7 patients following anti-EGFR therapy. Moreover, in the GSE5851 dataset higher AXL RNA levels correlated with worse PFS with cetuximab in KRAS-exon2 WT chemorefractory patients. CONCLUSIONS: AXL is a marker of poor prognosis in mCRC with consistent clinical and preclinical evidences of involvement in primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR drugs in RAS WT patients.","Cardone, Claudia; Blauensteiner, Bernadette; Moreno-Viedma, Veronica; Martini, Giulia; Simeon, Vittorio; Vitiello, Pietro P; Ciardiello, Davide; Belli, Valentina; Matrone, Nunzia; Troiani, Teresa; Morgillo, Floriana; Zito Marino, Federica; Dentice, Monica; Nappi, Annarita; Boccaccino, Alessandra; Antoniotti, Carlotta; Cremolini, Chiara; Pietrantonio, Filippo; Prager, Gerald W; Normanno, Nicola; Maiello, Evaristo; Argiles, Guillem; Elez, Elena; Signoriello, Giuseppe; Franco, Renato; Falcone, Alfredo; Tabernero, Josep; Sibilia, Maria; Ciardiello, Fortunato; Martinelli, Erika",Eur J Cancer,610,20

The perfect absorber consists of periodically arranged metallic nanodisks etched with regular prismatic holes standing on the dielectric-metal bi-layer films. Multiple ultra-narrow perfect absorption bands are obtained in the near-infrared region with the maximum bandwidth less than 21 nm and the intensity as high as 99.86%. The ultra-narrow multi-band perfect absorption originates from the synergy of localized surface plasmons, propagating surface plasmons and lattice resonances. The perfect absorber also presents other significant advantages, e.g., polarization insensitivity and high sensitivity of surrounding environments. Moreover, the prominent sensing performance for detecting the trace amounts of glucose in water is demonstrated. These features make it a promising candidate for great potentials in the fields of perfect absorbers, plasmonic sensors, filters and multiplexing binding bio-molecular detection.","Shi, Leilei; Shang, Jiangshan; Liu, Zheng-Qi; Li, Yuyin; Fu, Guolan; Liu, Xiaosha; Pan, Pingping; Luo, Haimei; Liu, Guiqiang",,610,1

However, GBSs in the setting of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly characterized, while GBSs prevalence among COVID-19 patients has not been previously systematically evaluated using a meta-analytical approach. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort and case-series studies reporting on the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated GBSs. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), when comparing to non-COVID-19, contemporary or historical GBSs patients. RESULTS: We identified 18 eligible studies (11 cohorts, 7 case-series) including a total of 136,746 COVID-19 patients. Among COVID-19 patients, including hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases, the pooled GBSs prevalence was 0.15 (95%CI:0-0.49; I2 =96%). Compared to non-infected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had increased odds for demyelinating GBSs subtypes (OR=3.27; 95%CI: 1.32-8.09; I2 =0%). In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, olfactory or concomitant cranial nerve involvement was noted in 41.4% (95%CI:3.5-60.4%; I2 =46%) and 42.8% (95%CI:32.8-53%; I2 =0%) of the patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality were comparable between COVID-19 GBSs patients and non-infected contemporary or historical GBSs controls. CONCLUSIONS: GBSs prevalence was estimated at 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. COVID-19 appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of GBSs and with demyelinating GBSs variants in particular.","Palaiodimou, Lina; Stefanou, Maria-Ioanna; Katsanos, Aristeidis H; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Papadopoulou, Marianna; Moschovos, Christos; Michopoulos, Ioannis; Kokotis, Panagiotis; Bakirtzis, Christos; Naska, Androniki; Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros I; Chroni, Elisabeth; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Tsivgoulis, Georgios",Eur. j. neurol,610,22

Convalescent Plasma Therapy has been authorized as an off-label therapeutic procedure. We assessed the outcome of convalescent plasma (CP) units versus standard treatment on the complete recovery, improvement and 28 days' mortality of COVID 19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present was multi-centric case controlled observational prospective study. The study was conducted for a period of four and half months from July 15 2020 to 30 November 2020 after taking approval from the Expert Committee, Health & Family Welfare Department, Government of Odisha. Plasma therapy was applied on two groups of 1189 serious COVID patients (959 number of pre- critical and 230 number of critical patients) not responding to oxygen therapy. It was compared with non- transfused control group of 1243 patients (996 number of pre-critical and 247 number of critical patients). RESULTS: Discharge was better in (55.5%) transfused than (43%)in non-transfused pre-critical patients and the mortality was lower (44.3%) in transfused, (48.9%) than non-transfused critical patients respectively. Complete recovery was highest in those who were transfused with CP with neutralizing titer more than 1:160 (52.5%), 18-30 years' age group (64%), females (53%), 'O' Rh D positive blood group (51.5%). There was no adverse reaction due to CP transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: CP is effective in improving the recovery rate with earlier discharge and decrease in the 28 days' mortality than in the control non-transfused group. CP with neutralizing antibody titer more than 1:160 has the best outcome with complete recovery and decrease in the mortality. It is more effective in treating pre-critical patients when transfused early, in female patients, in younger age group and in blood group 'O' Rh D positive.","Mahapatra, S; Rattan, R; Mohanty, C B K",Transfus. clin. biol,610,16

However, such measures are complex when established borders are open yet politically contested, as for the border that divides the Republic of Ireland (ROI) from Northern Ireland (NI). Understanding how this border affected the everyday lives of both populations during the pandemic is important for informing the continued development of effective responses to COVID-19 and future health crises. OBJECTIVE: This multi-methods study aimed to explore public perspectives on how the ROI-NI border affected experiences of and responses to the 'first wave' of the pandemic. METHOD: The study collated data from focus groups (n = 8), news articles (n = 967), and Twitter posts (n = 356) on the island of Ireland, which mentioned the ROI-NI border in relation to COVID-19. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of perspectives on the role played by the border during the early months of the pandemic. RESULTS: Analysis identified three themes: Cross-Border Interdependencies illustrated the complexity and challenges of living near the border; Interpretations of Cross-Border Policy Disparities showed that lay publics perceived NI and ROI policy approaches as discordant and politicised; and Responses to Cross-Border Policy Disparities revealed alternating calls to either strengthen border controls, or pursue a unified all-island approach. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal clear public appetite for greater synchronisation of cross-border pandemic responses, emphasise the specific vulnerability of communities living near the border, and highlight the risk of long-term socio-political repercussions of border management decisions taken during the pandemic. Findings will inform implementation of pandemic responses and public health policies in jurisdictions that share a porous land border.","O039,; Connor, Cliodhna; Connell, Nicola; Burke, Emma; Dempster, Martin; Graham, Christopher D; Scally, Gabriel; Zgaga, Lina; Nolan, Ann; Nicolson, Gail; Mather, Luke; Barry, Joseph; Crowley, Philip; Darker, Catherine D",Soc Sci Med,610,16

A case-series examination,16.870594,9.214474,2020,"The clinical impact of COVID-19 disease calls for the identification of routine variables to identify patients at increased risk of death. Current understanding of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pathophysiology points toward an underlying cytokine release driving a hyperinflammatory and procoagulant state. In this scenario, white blood cells and platelets play a direct role as effectors of such inflammation and thrombotic response. We investigate whether hemogram-derived ratios such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and the systemic immune-inflammation index may help to identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes. Activated platelets and neutrophils may be playing a decisive role during the thromboinflammatory phase of COVID-19 so, in addition, we introduce and validate a novel marker, the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR).Two thousand and eighty-eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted at any of the hospitals of HM Hospitales group in Spain, from March 1 to June 10, 2020, were categorized according to the primary outcome of in-hospital death.Baseline values, as well as the rate of increase of the four ratios analyzed were significantly higher at hospital admission in patients who died than in those who were discharged (p<0.0001). In multivariable logistic regression models, NLR (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08, p=0.00035) and NPR (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.36, p<0.0001) were significantly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality.According to our results, hemogram-derived ratios obtained at hospital admission, as well as the rate of change during hospitalization, may easily detect, primarily using NLR and the novel NPR, patients with COVID-19 at high risk of in-hospital mortality.","López-Escobar, Alejandro; Madurga, Rodrigo; Castellano, José María; Ruiz de Aguiar, Santiago; Velázquez, Sara; Bucar, Marina; Jimeno, Sara; Ventura, Paula Sol",J Investig Med,610,27

METHODS: The influences of noni juice on cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and the activity of AKT/nuclear factor- &#954; B (NF- &#954; B) signaling pathway in A549 human lung cancer cells were detected by MTT, cell counting kit-8, colony formation, Annexin V/PI double labeling, transwell, scratch test and immunoblotting assay, respectively. A549 cells were inoculated into the right axilla of nude mice, followed by noni juice treatment. The body weight of the nude mice was weighed, and the tumor volume and weight were measured. Cell proliferation and expression of apoptosis-related proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry, and the activity of NF- &#954; B signaling pathway was measured by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The in vitro studies showed that noni juice inhibited the A549 cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Noni juice also promoted cells apoptosis in A549 cells. Immunoblotting assay showed that the phosphorylation level of AKT, p50, and STAT3 proteins was inhibited to different extents after noni juice treatment. The in vivo studies showed that noni juice effectively suppressed tumor formation of A549 cells in nude mice. Noni juice treatment inhibited the expression of Ki67, PCNA, and Bcl-2 protein in the tumor; while promoted the expression of caspase-3 protein. Additionally, we also found that noni juice treatment could restrain the activity of AKT/NF- &#954; B signaling pathway in the tumor tissue. CONCLUSION: Noni juice inhibited the proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell invasion and migration via regulating AKT/NF- &#954; B signaling pathway.","Ma, Ling-di; Lin, Gui-Bin; Yang, Lu-Bo; Cao, Jia-Lin; Wang, Jian; Chen, Qiong-di; Li, Wei-Qiang; Zhong, Wang-Jing",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,610,2

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently searched for cross-sectional community-based studies published between December 1, 2019 and August 23, 2020, using PubMed, WoS, Embase, and other sources (e.g., grey literature, manual search). RESULTS: Of 3049 records retrieved, 43 studies were included. These studies yielded an estimated overall prevalence of anxiety of 25%, which varied significantly across the different tools used to measure anxiety. Consistently reported risk factors for the development of anxiety included initial or peak phase of the outbreak, female sex, younger age, marriage, social isolation, unemployment and student status, financial hardship, low educational level, insufficient knowledge of COVID-19, epidemiological or clinical risk of disease and some lifestyle and personality variables. CONCLUSIONS: As the overall global prevalence of anxiety disorders is estimated to be 7.3% normally, our results suggest that rates of anxiety in the general population could be more than 3 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest a substantial impact on mental health that should be targeted by individual and population-level strategies.","Santabárbara, Javier; Lasheras, Isabel; Lipnicki, Darren M; Bueno-Notivol, Juan; Pérez-Moreno, María; López-Antón, Raúl; De la Cámara, Concepción; Lobo, Antonio; Gracia-García, Patricia",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,610,16

Since then, the ongoing pandemic has overwhelmed many healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality emerging as a major global health crisis since the influenza pandemic of 1918. This viral infection readily spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets, mucosal contact, and through contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system;however, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system, and kidneys. Emerging data have shown that patients with COVID-19 infection presented with higher rates of isolated gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Patients with any primary GI-related symptoms or concurrent symptoms were at increased risk of hospitalization[1][2][3]. Emerging evidence is notable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the nasopharyngeal swab. Continued fecal shedding in symptomatic COVID-19 patients days after clinical recovery for an extended period has been reported which is concerning for possible fecal-oral transmission of this virus[4].COVID-19 is also frequently associated with the elevation of liver biochemistries in patients with or without clinical symptoms.

During Covid-19, as a precautionary measure, governments all across world announced full lockdown. This lockdown during CoV, disrupted well established supply chains throughout the world, as movement of people was restricted, factories were shut down, transportation facility came to stand still. With unlock of manufacturing activities in many countries, the organizations are tackling the intensity of technology innovation, or all the more decisively: big data analytics, to acquire troublesome changes at all degrees of Supply Chain. In this context, big data allows vast amounts of organized and unstructured data from multiple sources to be seen rapidly. This will help improve perceptibility for the supply chain, and provide additional bits of information to the entire supply chain. Looking at the potential benefits of big data, the aim of this chapter is to discuss the numerous inefficiencies in the supply chain and their negative effect on the competitiveness of companies. The chapter then evaluates how Big Data advancements could positively impact the supply chain inefficiencies. It also discusses what challenges organizations have to face for implementing big data framework in their organization structure.

With no pharmacological agents successfully implemented to control the outbreak, the use of less invasive nonpharmacological agents, such as vitamin D, are increasingly being studied. This purpose of this article is to determine the current knowledge about the risk of COVID-19 development for populations at risk for vitamin D deficiency, including individuals living with overweight and obesity, those of older age, and racial or ethnic minorities. Despite the documented impact of vitamin D on viral disease prevention, many subgroups at risk for contracting COVID-19 are also known to have increased rates of vitamin D deficiency. Because vitamin D is most commonly obtained from sunlight, when interpreted alongside the stay-at-home orders, the importance of identifying safe approaches to obtain sufficient vitamin D is apparent. Furthermore, elucidating the cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19, including optimal dosing for COVID-19 outcomes, is also warranted for immediate investigation.","DeLuccia, Rosemary; Clegg, Deborah; Sukumar, Deeptha",Nutr. rev,610,16

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for 'shielding', remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission's previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical. As the pandemic moves from a state of emergency into a 'new normal' in psychiatric services during second, or subsequent, waves, the use and place (if any) of remote assessments for detention needs to be considered.","Schölin, Lisa; Connolly, Moira; Morgan, Graham; Dunlop, Laura; Deshpande, Mayura; Chopra, Arun",J. med. ethics,610,16

Deep learning-based approaches have been widely adopted for semantic segmentation of medical data. In recent years, in addition to 2D deep learning architectures, 3D architectures have been employed as the predictive algorithms for 3D medical image data. In this paper, we propose a 3D stack-based deep learning technique for segmenting manifestations of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We also present a comparison based on the segmentation results, the contextual information retained, and the inference time between this 3D technique and a traditional 2D deep learning technique. We also define the area-plot, which represents the peculiar pattern observed in the slice-wise areas of the pathology regions predicted by these deep learning models. In our exhaustive evaluation, 3D technique performs better than the 2D technique for the segmentation of CT scans. We get dice scores of 79% and 73% for the 3D and the 2D techniques respectively. The 3D technique results in a 5X reduction in the inference time compared to the 2D technique. Results also show that the area-plots predicted by the 3D model are more similar to the ground truth than those predicted by the 2D model. We also show how increasing the amount of contextual information retained during the training can improve the 3D model's performance.","Shivdeo, Abhishek; Lokwani, Rohit; Kulkarni, Viraj; Kharat, Amit; Pant, Aniruddha",,610,9

We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures. Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules. Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged. Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.","Ceccato, Irene; Palumbo, Rocco; Di Crosta, Adolfo; La Malva, Pasquale; Marchetti, Daniela; Maiella, Roberta; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina; Marin, Anna; Mammarella, Nicola; Palumbo, Riccardo; Di Domenico, Alberto",Aging Ment Health,610,16

(preprint),16.639286,3.6438088,2021,"In Oslo, as elsewhere, the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures during spring 2020 led to increased use of urban green infrastructure. Whether this has led to more durable changes in recreation patterns remains an open question. We used mobile tracking data from 53,000 STRAVA users to explore the longevity of increases in recreational activity. We compared 2020 activity levels relative to a weather benchmark (i.e. baseline), defined as the activity one would have expected given the time of year and prevailing weather conditions. Recreational activity increased by 240% during the five weeks of comprehensive lockdown and were maintained until the summer vacation period in June/July when they dropped to baseline levels. Yet, during August they increased again to 89% above baseline. Although activity increased across all city land use zones, after lockdown there was a shift away from residential and commercial zones toward city green spaces including forests and protected areas. Cultural landscapes and protected areas received disproportionately high activity levels relative to the length of recreational trails available within them. Recreationists in the teenager demographic (13–19) exhibited a four-fold increase in their share of the STRAVA user-base at the start of lockdown. The COVID-19 pandemic and its disruptions to the status quo has had lasting effects over the short-term on the way Norwegian citizens recreate. Our findings reinforce the value of urban nature and open spaces for societal pandemic preparedness, particularly youths, during and after times of crisis.","Venter, Zander S.; Barton, David N.; Gundersen, Vegard Figari Helene Nowell Megan S.",Landscape and Urban Planning,610,16

We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene. Recent Findings: AI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed. Summary: Advantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting. Close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance is essential.","Fitzpatrick, Fidelma; Doherty, Aaron; Lacey, Gerard",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,610,1

Mobile health (mHealth)-based interventions taking advantage of smartphone technology have shown particular promise in increasing the quality of self-care among these patients, and in turn improving the outcomes of their disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to co-develop with physicians, patients with HF, and their caregivers a patient-oriented mHealth app, perform usability assessment, and investigate its effect on the quality of life of patients with HF and rate of hospitalizations in a pilot study. METHODS: The development of an mHealth app (The Hellenic Educational Self-care and Support Heart Failure app [ThessHF app]) was evidence based, including features based on previous clinically tested mHealth interventions and selected by a panel of HF expert physicians and discussed with patients with HF. At the end of alpha development, the app was rated by mHealth experts with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The beta version was tested by patients with HF, who rated its design and content by means of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Subsequently, a prospective pilot study (THESS-HF [THe Effect of a Specialized Smartphone app on Heart Failure patients' quality of self-care, quality of life and hospitalization rate]) was performed to investigate the effect of app use on patients with HF over a 3-month follow-up period. The primary endpoint was patients' quality of life, which was measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L). The secondary endpoints were the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (EHFScBS) score and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS: A systematic review of mHealth-based HF interventions and expert panel suggestions yielded 18 separate app features, most of which were incorporated into the ThessHF app. A total of 14 patients and 5 mHealth experts evaluated the app. The results demonstrated a very good user experience (overall PSSUQ score 2.37 [SD 0.63], where 1 is the best, and a median MARS score of 4.55/5). Finally, 30 patients (male: n=26, 87%) participated in the THESS-HF pilot study (mean age 68.7 [SD 12.4] years). A significant increase in the quality of self-care was noted according to the EHFScBS, which increased by 4.4% (SD 7.2%) (P=.002). The mean quality of life increased nonsignificantly after 3 months according to both KCCQ (mean increase 5.8 [SD 15] points, P=.054) and EQ-5D-5L (mean increase 5.6% [SD 15.6%], P=.06) scores. The hospitalization rate for the follow-up duration was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The need for telehealth services and remote self-care management in HF is of vital importance, especially in periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a user-friendly mHealth app to promote remote self-care support in HF. In this pilot study, the use of the ThessHF app was associated with an increase in the quality of self-care. A future multicenter study will investigate the effect of the app use on long-term outcomes in patients with HF.","Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Lazaridis, Charalampos; Theofillogianakos, Efstratios K; Billis, Antonios; Tzikas, Stergios; Fragakis, Nikolaos; Bamidis, Panagiotis D; Papadopoulos, Christodoulos E; Vassilikos, Vassilios P",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,610,16

The COVID-19 pandemic displaced many youth from their normative sport activities. As a result, sport-based positive-youth development (PYD) programs, typically delivered in person, had to reimagine ways to reach and engage youth in sport and life skill development. In fall 2020, The Los Angeles Football Club Youth Leadership Program (LAFC YLP) developed seven virtual sport-based PYD videos and one workshop for 120 socially vulnerable youth and their families. All virtual activities were designed to teach life skills through sport and play. Our study sought to explore the accessibility of the virtual sport-based PYD activities, the lived experiences of youth participants during lockdown, and learning outcomes of youth and families who participated in the program. We developed a mixed methods study using an online survey and virtual platform to allow youth to share photos, draw pictures, and leave comments about their lived experiences. Our findings indicated 53 youth and their families participated in the virtual sport-based PYD program and reported the activities were accessible, enjoyable, and challenging for the youth participants. In addition, 26 youth shared photos, images, or posts about their lived experiences. Our thematic analysis of the photos, images, and posts indicated the virtual sport-based PYD activities facilitated positive emotional responses, positive peer interaction, engagement with family, and utilization of environmental resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our findings also suggest virtual sport-based PYD activities may facilitate life skill transfer; an important developmental mechanism for learning in lieu of the decreased opportunities for sport and social interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bates, Samantha; Greene, Dekia; O039,; Quinn, Luke",Child Adolesc Social Work J,610,24

They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply. This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Recent findings: Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients. Recent findings: The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.","Pope, Janet E",Curr Treatm Opt Rheumatol,610,20

According to the Conservation of Resources theory from Hobfoll (1989, American Psychologist, 44, 513), those people who have a good supply of resources will be able to cope better with the adversities and will show less distress. The objective of this research is to identify what are the resources that, in a situation of confinement under the threat of COVID-19, predict eustress or well-being, and the loss or lack of which resources predict distress or discomfort. DESIGN AND METHOD: A total of 839 people complete an online questionnaire during the first week of COVID-19 confinement in Spain. The sample is weighted to obtain a distribution that is similar to the Spanish population. Using multiple linear regression analysis, factors are identified that are associated with eustress and distress based on the Conservation of Resources theory. RESULTS: A model is identified that explains 55% of the variance of eustress consisting mostly of personal resources, with vitality as the recourse having the most weight. The factors that explain distress (18.9% of the variance) are those related to work (employment situation, work satisfaction, and time devoted to work) and conditions in the home (space). CONCLUSIONS: The models that predict eustress and distress are completely different. Based on these results, a series of recommendations are proposed aimed at increasing eustress and reducing distress in a situation of confinement. Additionally, proposals are offered for future research.","Merino, M Dolores; Vallellano, M Dolores; Oliver, Coral; Mateo, Inmaculada",Br. j. health psychol,610,16

We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 and sickle cell disease (SCD)-related experiences, and the clinical course during the outbreak, to measure anxiety levels of adolescent and young adult patients with homozygous SCD, to analyze the correlations between their COVID-19 experiences and anxiety levels and painful episodes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 47 patients aged between 14 and 24 years responded to a descriptive instrument and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Clinical features requiring hospitalization for the same period (between March 10 and May 10) of two sequential years were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the patients had at least one negative COVID-19 experience of dizziness, sleep disturbance, tonic immobility, appetite loss or nausea/abdominal distress. The number of negative COVID-19 experiences was correlated with the state anxiety score, the trait anxiety score, and the number of painful episodes (&#961;=0.552, P<0.001; &#961;=0.529, P<0.001; &#961;=0.448, P=0.002, respectively).

Such heteroleptic metallosupramolecular architectures are expected to afford advanced utility in a variety of applications. In this concise review article, recent advances in the development of multi-nuclear-cluster-based heteroleptic multiple-stranded (HLMS) metallosupramolecules are summarized and demonstrated. To construct HLMS metallosupramolecules, one type of multitopic ligands can be employed for building up multiple strands, while another type of ligands can be utilized to construct multi-nuclear clusters. Most HLMS metallosupramolecules adopt helical geometries and have high molecular symmetry, which can be key factors for the structural completion. HLMS metallosupramolecules can be used as basic building blocks for the fabrication of higher-order polymeric or discrete assembly architectures with well-defined geometries.","Tran, Ngoc Minh; Yoo, Hyojong",,610,30

Little is known about appropriate nutrition therapy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection receiving mechanical ventilation. Data regarding patient demographics and nutrition therapy were collected. Patients that received enteral nutrition within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation were compared with patients starting enteral nutrition later. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for baseline differences in patient groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients were included in final analysis. Patients who received enteral nutrition within 24 hours received a significantly greater daily amount of calories (17.5 vs 15.2 kcal/kg, P = .015) and protein (1.04 vs 0.85 g/kg, P = .003). There was no difference in length of stay (18.5 vs 23.5 days, P = .37). The propensity score analysis included 100 patients. Following propensity scoring, significant differences in daily calorie (17.7 [4.6] vs 15.1 [5.1] kcal/kg/d, P = .009) and protein (1.03 [0.35] vs 0.86 [0.38] g/kg/d, P = .014) provision remained. No differences in length of stay or other outcomes were noted in the propensity score analysis. CONCLUSION: Initiation of enteral nutrition within 24 hours was not associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. No harm was detected either. Future research should seek to clarify optimal timing of enteral nutrition initiation in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation.","Farina, Nicholas; Nordbeck, Sarah; Montgomery, Michelle; Cordwin, Laura; Blair, Faith; Cherry-Bukowiec, Jill; Kraft, Michael D; Pleva, Melissa R; Raymond, Erica",Nutr Clin Pract,610,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigators designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of 889 subjects who presented for an odontogenic infection from March 19 to June 18 in the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The primary predictor variable was OMS consultation for an odontogenic infection during a non-COVID-19 (2017, 2018, and 2019) year (control) or during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (experimental). The primary outcome variable was treatment rendered. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed, and the level of significance was set at .05 for all tests. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of OMS consults in the 2 cohorts (P > .05). The number of patients presenting to the UW emergency department (ED) for an odontogenic infection decreased from an average of 246 in non-COVID years to 151 in 2020. Patients in the experimental cohort were more likely (55 vs 30.0%; P = .04) to present primarily to UW than a dentist and were less likely to undergo an incision and drainage (70.0 vs 88.8%; P = .04), aerosol-generating procedure (70.0 vs 88.8%; P = .04), and incision and drainage in the ED (15.0 vs 41.3%; P = .03).

The Csf1r+/- mouse mimics ALSP symptoms and pathology. Csf1r is mainly expressed in microglia, but also in cortical layer V neurons that are gradually lost in Csf1r+/- mice with age. We therefore examined whether microglial or neuronal Csf1r loss caused neurodegeneration in Csf1r+/- mice. The behavioral deficits, pathologies and elevation of Csf2 expression contributing to disease, previously described in the Csf1r+/- ALSP mouse, were reproduced by microglial deletion (MCsf1rhet mice), but not by neural deletion. Furthermore, increased Csf2 expression by callosal astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia was observed in Csf1r+/- mice and, in MCsf1rhet mice, the densities of these three cell types were increased in supraventricular patches displaying activated microglia, an early site of disease pathology. These data confirm that ALSP is a primary microgliopathy and inform future therapeutic and experimental approaches.","Biundo, Fabrizio; Chitu, Violeta; Shlager, Gabriel G L; Park, Eun S; Gulinello, Maria E; Saha, Kusumika; Ketchum, Harmony C; Fernandes, Christopher; Gökhan, Sölen; Mehler, Mark F; Stanley, E Richard",GLIA,610,3

Recently, the notion of fairness has attracted a lot of attention in the machine learning community. One can impose the fairness condition that at any given point of time, even during the learning phase, a poorly performing candidate should not be preferred over a better candidate. This fairness constraint is known to be one of the most stringent and has been studied in the stochastic multi-armed bandits' framework in a stationary setting for which regret bounds have been established. The main aim of this paper is to study this problem in a non-stationary setting. We present a new algorithm called Fair Upper Confidence Bound with Exploration Fair-UCBe algorithm for solving a slowly varying stochastic $k$-armed bandit problem. With this we present two results: (i) Fair-UCBe indeed satisfies the above mentioned fairness condition, and (ii) it achieves a regret bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{3}{2}} T^{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\log T}\right)$, for some suitable $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, where $T$ is the time horizon. This is the first fair algorithm with a sublinear regret bound applicable to non-stationary bandits to the best of our knowledge. We show that the performance of our algorithm in the non-stationary case approaches that of its stationary counterpart as the variation in the environment tends to zero.","ShaaradA., R; Dukkipati, Ambedkar",,610,1

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively. Initially, in the 82 patients without chronic liver disease and alcohol history; age older than 40 years (P = 0.027); male gender (P = 0.0145); elevated CRP (P = 0.0366), ALT (P < 0.0001), and ALP (P = 0.0003); and increased TGs (P = 0.0002) were found to be associated with elevated GGT levels. Elevated GGT (P = 0.0086) and CRP (P = 0.0162) levels have a longer length of hospital stay. Conclusion: A sizable number of patients with COVID-19 infection had elevated serum GGT levels.

While chest CT scans are routinely performed in the initial assessment of patients with severe pulmonary forms, thymus involvement and reactivation have not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we systematically scored the enlargement of the thymus and the lung involvement, using CT scans, in all adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID or any other cause (control group) at one centre between March and April 2020. Initial biological investigations included nasal detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a subgroup of 24 patients with different degrees of pulmonary involvement and thymus hypertrophy, plasma cytokine concentrations were measured and the export of mature T cells from the thymus was estimated simultaneously by PCR quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were studied: 50 COVID patients and 37 controls. Non-atrophic or enlarged thymus was more commonly observed in COVID patients than in controls (66% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). Thymus enlargement in COVID patients was associated with more extensive lung injury score on CT scans (4 [3-5] vs. 2 [1.5-4], p = 0.01), but a lower mortality rate (8.6% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with mortality were age, lymphopaenia, high CRP and co-morbidities. COVID patients had higher concentrations of IL-7 (6.00 [3.72-9.25] vs. 2.17 [1.76-4.4] pg/mL; p = 0.04) and higher thymic production of new lymphocytes (sj/ßTREC ratio = 2.88 [1.98-4.51] vs. 0.23 [0.15-0.60]; p = 0.004). Thymic production was also correlated with the CT scan thymic score (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) and inversely correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In COVID patients, thymus enlargement was frequent and associated with increased T lymphocyte production, which appears to be a beneficial adaptation to virus-induced lymphopaenia. The lack of thymic activity/reactivation in older SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could contribute to a worse prognosis.","Cuvelier, Pelagia; Roux, Hélène; Couëdel-Courteille, Anne; Dutrieux, Jacques; Naudin, Cécile; Charmeteau de Muylder, Bénédicte; Cheynier, Rémi; Squara, Pierre; Marullo, Stefano",Crit Care,610,16

For providers, shifts in healthcare provision, communication formats, and support offerings for families facing distress or loss during the pandemic may promote providers' moral distress. This study aimed to define the ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted end-of-life care and approach to bereavement care in pediatric palliative care (PPC). METHOD: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments and Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus (PANDEMIC) survey was developed to learn about the PPC experience during COVID-19 in the United States. The survey was posted with permission on seven nationally focused Listservs. RESULTS: A total of 207 PPC team members from 80 cities within 39 states and the District of Columbia participated. In the majority of hospitals, admitted pediatric patients were only allowed one parent as a visitor with the exception of both parents or nuclear family at end of life. Creative alternatives to grief support and traditional funeral services were described. The high incidence of respondents' depicted moral distress was often focused on an inability to provide a desired level of care due to existing rules and policies and bearing witness to patient and family suffering enhanced by the pandemic. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the provision of end-of-life care and bereavement for children, family caregivers, and PPC providers. Our results identify tangible limitations of restricted personal contact and the pain of watching families stumble through a stunted grieving process.

Any deviation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will reduce the predictive values of the test. Here, we report the occurrence of contaminations of commercial primers/probe sets with the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence of the RT-qPCR as an example for pitfalls during PCR diagnostics affecting diagnostic specificity. In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations. As such, contaminations may have happened more widely, and COVID-19 diagnostic results should be re-assessed retrospectively to validate the epidemiological basis for control measures.","Wernike, Kerstin; Keller, Markus; Conraths, Franz J; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Groschup, Martin H; Beer, Martin",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We developed 77 hybridomas and selected five neutralizing mAbs by immunization with S&#916;TM against MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain S-pseudotyped lentivirus. However, all five monoclonal antibodies (mAb) did not neutralize the pseudotyped V534A mutation. Additionally, one mAb RBD-14F8 did not show neutralizing activity against pseudoviruses with amino acid substitution of L506â¯F or D509â¯G (England1 strain, EMC/2012 L506â¯F, and EMC/2012 D509â¯G), and RBD-43E4 mAb could not neutralize the pseudotyped I529â¯T mutation, while three other neutralizing mAbs showed broad neutralizing activity. This implies that the mutation in residue 506-509, 529, and 534 of S is critical to generate neutralization escape variants of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, all five neutralizing mAbs have binding affinity to RBD, although most mAbs generated by RBD did not have neutralizing activity. Additionally, chimeric antibodies of RBD-14F8 and RBD-43E4 with human Fc and light chain showed neutralizing effect against wild type MERS-CoV KOR/KNIH/002, similar to the original mouse mAbs.

The aim of this study was to determine whether Hypnotherapy (HT) is not inferior to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychotherapy, in the percentage reduction of depressive symptoms, assessed in mild to moderate Major Depression (MD). METHODS: This study reports the main results of a monocentric two-armed randomized-controlled rater-blind clinical trial. A total of 152 patients with MD were randomized to either CBT or HT receiving outpatient individual psychotherapy with 16 to 20 sessions for the duration of six months. The primary outcome was the mean percentage improvement in depressive symptoms assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The difference in the mean percentage symptom reduction between HT and CBT was 2.8 (95% CI=-9.85 to 15.44) in the Intention-to-treat sample and 4.0 (95% CI=-9.27 to 17.27) in the Per Protocol sample (N=134). Concerning the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -16.4, both results confirm the non-inferiority of HT to CBT. The results for the follow-ups six and twelve months after the end of the treatment support the primary results. LIMITATIONS: For ethical reasons the trial did not include a control group without treatment; therefore we can only indirectly conclude that both treatment conditions are effective. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that HT was not inferior to CBT in MD, while employing rigorous methodological standards.","Fuhr, Kristina; Meisner, Christoph; Broch, Angela; Cyrny, Barbara; Hinkel, Juliane; Jaberg, Joana; Petrasch, Monika; Schweizer, Cornelie; Stiegler, Anette; Zeep, Christina; Batra, Anil",J Affect Disord,610,29

The impact on feasibility and outcome of rehabilitation during COVID-19 actually remains unclear. Nosocomial infection of healthcare workers or hospitalized patients is common, and prevention of nosocomial infections during rehabilitation is challenging. Therefore, we analyzed a cohort of nosocomial infected COVID-19 patients in a single-center inpatient rehabilitation clinic and described performance and outcome. DESIGN: The cohort (N = 27) describes patients with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection while participating in neuromusculoskeletal rehabilitation. Infection was caused by an initially unidentified so-called superspreader. We compared this cohort with all neuromusculoskeletal rehabilitation inpatients of 2019 (comparison group). Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean with standard deviation and the t test was used for comparison between groups. Linear regression was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Functional Independence Measure at discharge. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were mostly male (66.7%) with an age of 71.5 ± 12.3 yrs. Age, sex, and cumulated comorbidities of the comparison group (n = 786) were not different from the COVID-19 group. A total of 92.6% of COVID-19 patients had a mild or moderate course, two patients had to be referred to acute hospital because of respiratory failure, and one of these patients died in the acute hospital. After implementation of a strict hygiene concept, no further nosocomial COVID-19 infections were detected. The rehabilitation duration was significantly longer in the COVID-19 group (54.2 ± 23.6 days vs. 32.1 ± 17.7 days, P < 0.001). Daily therapy duration was 132.3 ± 44 mins before SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced to 81.9 ± 27.3 mins during COVID-19 (P < 0.001). After discontinuation of isolation measures, therapy duration increased significantly (99.3 ± 70.2 mins, P < 0.05).The baseline Functional Independence Measure score was higher in the COVID-19 group (91.93 ± 25.64 points vs. 82.98 ± 22.73 points) and Functional Independence Measure improvements were lower in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 comparison group (6.96 ± 8.96 points vs. 20.3 ± 15.98 points, P < 0.001). COVID-19 infection itself had a strong negative impact on Functional Independence Measure change as identified by regression analysis. Linear regression analysis showed that COVID-19 reduced the Functional Independence Measure at discharge by 8.9 points (95% CI = -14.725 to -3.097, P = 0.003) after correction for Functional Independence Measure at admission, age, sex, and morbidity index at admission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a strong negative impact on rehabilitation benefits as assessed by Functional Independence Measure. Neuromusculoskeletal rehabilitation could be continued, but all patients received less therapy minutes during isolation. After implementation of a strict COVID-19-specific hygiene concept, no further infections were detected.","Spielmanns, Marc; Pekacka-Egli, Anna-Maria; Cecon, Mikis; Witassek, Fabienne; Schoendorf, Sabine; Lutz, Dietmar; Hermann, Matthias",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,610,5

We sought to describe the natural course of alcohol and cannabis co-use from age 12 to 17 and 20 to 31 and to describe frequent (i.e., &#8805; once/month) binge drinking (i.e., &#8805; 5 drinks/occasion) and cannabis use from age 20 to 31. METHOD: Data were drawn from two longitudinal studies conducted in Montréal, Canada: AdoQuest (n = 1,852) and the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) study (n = 1,293). Complete data on alcohol and cannabis were available for 620 12-17-year-olds (58% female) followed from 2005 to 2011 in AdoQuest, and 673 20-31-year-olds (56% female) followed from 2007 to 2020 in NDIT. We reported proportions of co-use, exclusive drinking (""drinking""), exclusive cannabis use (""cannabis use""), frequent co-use, frequent binge drinking, and frequent cannabis use by age and sex. RESULTS: Co-use rose from 2% at age 12-13 to 23% at age 17, was stable at 44% at age 20 and 24, and then decreased to 37% at age 31. Drinking rose from 20% to 51%, and cannabis use was consistently rare (< 2%). During young adulthood, frequent co-use declined from 21% at age 20 to 12% at age 31, and frequent binge drinking declined from 29% at age 20 to 22% at age 31. Frequent cannabis use increased from 6% at age 20 to 11% at age 31. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and cannabis use should be studied as time-varying behaviors.

Novel-CoV-19 (also called SARS-CoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), the seventh known human pathogenic corona virus, was soon isolated as the infectious agent. The lung disease triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19. As with the SARS-CoV virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2001–2002, it became clear that ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) represents a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-19. ACE2 is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase and plays an important role in the breakdown of angiotensin II in vessels and in tissue. The fact that ACE2 is the receptor for the coronavirus fits very well with the clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-19 disease – generalised endotheliitis including pulmonary and cardiac inflammatory reactions, hypertensive derailment and impaired systemic microcirculation. Several studies in rats and humans suggest that long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors and especially angiotensin II type 1 receptor (Angiotensin-II-1-Rezeptor) blockers promotes ACE2 upregulation on the endothelium. These observations, as well as current knowledge of the physiopathology of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) lead to contradictory conclusions. The increased expression of ACE2 in sartan- and ACE inhibitor-treated patients may result in increased susceptibility to infection. On the other hand, increased ACE2 expression may counteract potentially deleterious effects of uncontrolled angiotensin II release in lungs and in the vascular system. In fact, recently published data point to a more favourable course of COVID-19 in patients with arterial hypertension under long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors. The targeted use of AT1-II-R blockers as a therapeutic approach to block deleterious effects of angiotensin II at the level of the endothelium, however, remains speculative. Conversely, there is no convincing argument to discontinue ACE inhibitors and AT1-II-R blockers in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the basis of recently published studies und the already clearly documented evidence of mortality reduction with ACE inhibitor / Angiotensin-II-1-Rezeptor blocker therapy in cardiovascular diseases, current guidelines for the treatment of arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or heart failure should be maintained. Further studies and research are urgently needed to make clear and reliable statements about the specific role of Angiotensin-II-1-Rezeptor blockers and ACE in COVID-19 disease.","Armelle, Tchoumi; Urs, Erikson; Nazmi, Krasniqi",Kardiovaskulare Med.,610,17

Our institution created a prenatal care delivery model incorporating these alternative approaches to continue safely providing prenatal care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate institutional-level adoption and patient and provider experiences with the coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single-site evaluation of a coronavirus disease 2019 prenatal care model incorporating a reduced frequency visit schedule and virtual visits deployed at a suburban academic institution on March 20, 2020. We used electronic health record data to evaluate institution-level model adoption, defined as changes in overall visit frequency and proportion of virtual visits in the 3 months before and after implementation. To evaluate the patient and provider experience with the coronavirus disease 2019 model, we conducted an online survey of all pregnant patients (>20 weeks' gestation) and providers in May 2020. Of note, 3 domains of care experience were evaluated: (1) access, (2) quality and safety, and (3) satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistics. Free-text responses coded by the 3 survey domains elucidated drivers of positive and negative care experiences. RESULTS: After the coronavirus disease 2019 model adoption, average weekly prenatal visit volume fell by 16.1%, from 898 to 761 weekly visits; the average weekly proportion of prenatal visits conducted virtually increased from 10.8% (97 of 898) to 43.3% (330 of 761); and the average visit no-show rate remained stable (preimplementation, 4.3%; postimplementation, 4.2%). Of those eligible, 74.8% of providers (77 of 103) and 15.0% of patients (253 of 1690) participated in the surveys.

The rates of chronic conditions and pregnancy complications also differed from national prevalence. Provider respondents were predominantly white (44 of 66; 66.7%) and female (50 of 66; 75.8%). Most patients and almost all providers reported that virtual visits improved access to care (patients, 174 of 253 [68.8%]; providers, 74 of 77 [96.1%]). More than half of respondents (patients, 124 of 253 [53.3%]; providers, 41 of 77 [62.1%]) believed that virtual visits were safe. Nearly all believed that home blood pressure cuffs were important for virtual visits (patients, 213 of 231 [92.2%]; providers, 63 of 66 [95.5%]). Most reported satisfaction with the coronavirus disease 2019 model (patients, 196 of 253 [77.5%]; providers, 64 of 77 [83.1%]). In free-text responses, drivers of positive care experiences were similar for patients and providers and included perceived improved access to care through decreased barriers (eg, transportation, childcare), perceived high quality of virtual visits for low-risk patients and increased safety during the pandemic, and improved satisfaction through better patient counseling. Perceived drivers of negative care experience were also similar for patients and providers, but less common. These included concerns that unequal access to virtual visits could deepen existing maternity care inequities, concerns that the lack of home devices (eg, blood pressure cuffs) would affect care quality and safety, and dissatisfaction with poor patient-provider continuity and inadequate expectation setting for the virtual visit experience. CONCLUSION: Reduced visit schedules and virtual visits were rapidly integrated into real-world care, with positive experiences for many patients and providers. Future research is needed to understand the health outcomes and care experience associated with alternative approaches to prenatal care delivery across more diverse patient populations outside of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to inform broader health policy decisions.","Peahl, Alex F; Powell, Allison; Berlin, Hanna; Smith, Roger D; Krans, Elizabeth; Waljee, Jennifer; Dalton, Vanessa K; Heisler, Michele; Moniz, Michelle H",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,610,33

While additional support is needed to better cope with increased job stressors, little is known about what types of hospital resources have been provided and how nursing staff perceive them. This study addressed this gap by describing nursing staff perceptions of resources provided by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: Registered nurses and nursing assistants who were working in hospitals during the pandemic were recruited to an online survey via social media posts and emails between May and June 2020. A total of 360 free-text responses to an open-ended survey question were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Over half of participants reported being provided with hospital resources. ""Basic needs"" resources that included food on-site, groceries, and childcare support were the most frequently reported compared with four other types of resources (personal health and safe practice, financial support, managerial support, communication). Four themes emerged related to staff perceptions of support: community support, unequal benefits, decreasing resources, and insufficient personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Our findings can assist organizational leaders in the planning and allocation of different types of resources that are meaningful to nursing staff and thus ensure sustainability, optimal performance, and worker well-being during crises.","Cho, Hyeonmi; Sagherian, Knar; Steege, Linsey M",Workplace Health Saf,610,24

Answers depend not only on the specifics of the emergency actions but also on executives’ rhetorical power to legitimize such actions via ideational/discursive coercion, structuring, or persuasion. After outlining the theoretical issues involved, this contribution considers the legitimacy and rhetorical power of political executives in multilateral emergency politics and technical executives in supranational emergency politics. It uses the cases of the Council and the ECB in the Eurozone and Covid-19 crises in illustration, considering their legitimacy over time, between a crisis’ fast-burning phase of emergency politics and its slow-burning phase of legitimizing normalization or delegitimation.

This review is intended to provide a broad view of how nutrient inputs-from fertilizer and CAFOs-as well as atmospheric NH3 and greenhouse gas emissions, are changing regionally within the US and how these changes compare with nutrient inputs from human wastewater. Use of commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizer in the US, which now exceeds 12,000,000 metric tonnes (MT) continues to increase, at a rate of 60,000 MT per year, while that of phosphorus (P) has remained nearly constant over the past decade at around 1,800,000 MT. The number of CAFOs in the US has increased nearly 10% since 2012, driven largely by a near 13% increase in hog production. The annualized inventory of cattle, dairy cows, hogs, broiler chickens and turkeys is approximately 8.7 billion, but CAFOs are highly regionally concentrated by animal sector. Country-wide, N applied by fertilizer is about threefold greater than manure N inputs, but for P these inputs are more comparable. Total manure inputs now exceed 4,000,000 MT as N and 1,400,000 MT as P. For both N and P, inputs and proportions vary widely by US region. The waste from hog and dairy operations is mainly held in open lagoons that contribute to NH3 and greenhouse gas (as CH4 and N2O) emissions. Emissions of NH3 from animal waste in 2019 were estimated at > 4,500,000 MT. Emissions of CH4 from manure management increased 66% from 1990 to 2017 (that from dairy increased 134%, cattle 9.6%, hogs 29% and poultry 3%), while those of N2O increased 34% over the same time period (dairy 15%, cattle 46%, hogs 58%, and poultry 14%). Waste from CAFOs contribute substantially to nutrient pollution when spread on fields, often at higher N and P application rates than those of commercial fertilizer. Managing the runoff associated with fertilizer use has improved with best management practices, but reducing the growing waste from CAFO operations is essential if eutrophication and its effects on fresh and marine waters-namely hypoxia and harmful algal blooms (HABs)-are to be reduced.","Glibert, Patricia M",Biogeochemistry,610,32

However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents ""used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus."" We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.","Campos-Castillo, Celeste; Laestadius, Linnea I",J Med Internet Res,610,16

Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is effectively captured by a single scalar function of time, regardless of the distribution of ß in the population. The continuum limit of the network model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in ß appears through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of u = ß . If the first few moments of u exist, the governing DDE can be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original compartmental DDE with a single ß . Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can be solved using either numerical integration over u at each time step, or with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an underlying continuum model for a pandemic with a simpler-seeming compartmental model and will hopefully lead to new analysis of continuum models for epidemics.","Vyasarayani, C P; Chatterjee, Anindya",Nonlinear Dyn,610,5

Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts).

We investigated the impact of the pandemic on energy demand and subsequent emissions from electricity and gas throughout 2020 in the UK. The daily pattern of electricity demand changed in both lockdowns, with weekday demand shifting to that of a typical pre-pandemic weekend. Energy demand in 2020 was modelled to reveal the impact of the weather and the pandemic. The first lockdown reduced demand by 15.6% for electricity and 12.0% for commercial gas, whereas the second lockdown produced reductions less than half. Domestic gas demand did not change during the first lockdown, but increased by 6.1% in the second, likely due to increased domestic heat demand. The changes in demand for gas resulted in little change to overall gas consumption emissions during the pandemic. For electricity, large emission reductions occurred during the two lockdowns: up to 22% for CO2, 47% for NO x , and 29% for PM2.5. Yet, the largest CO2 emission reduction for electricity in 2020 (25%) occurred before the pandemic, which happened during a warm and stormy spell with exceptional wind generation. These observations suggest that future similar changes in activity may result in little change for gas demand and emissions. For electricity, emission reductions through changes in energy demand are made possible by the generation mix. To enable further emission reductions in the future, the generation mix should continue to decarbonise. This will yield emission reductions in both times of lowered energy demand, but more importantly, during times of high renewable output.","Mehlig, Daniel ApSimon Helen Staffell Iain",Environmental Research Letters,610,16

The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p < .05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4).

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were consented. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Krebs von den Lungen 6, troponin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, B-type natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), CURB-65 and radiographic severity score on initial chest radiograph were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or death, with area under the curve (AUC) (figures calculated). RESULTS: 187 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.78), lymphocyte count (AUC: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.72) and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.77, 0.65 to 0.88) and suPAR (AUC: 0.81, 0.72 to 0.88) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS2 score (AUC: 0.70, 0.60 to 0.79) or age (AUC: 0.70, 0.62 to 0.77) performed nearly as well. DISCUSSION: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS2 score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should focus on the additive value of these biomarkers to routine care.","Arnold, David T; Attwood, Marie; Barratt, Shaney; Morley, Anna; Elvers, Karen T; McKernon, Jorgen; Donald, Charmaine; Oates, Adrian; Noel, Alan; MacGowan, Alasdair; Maskell, Nick A; Hamilton, Fergus W",Emerg. med. j,610,6

Many institutions are developing ventilator triage policies. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the development of ventilator triage policies and compare policy content. DESIGN: Survey and mixed-methods content analysis. SETTING: North American hospitals associated with members of the Association of Bioethics Program Directors. PARTICIPANTS: Program directors. MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of institutions and policies, including triage criteria and triage committee membership. RESULTS: Sixty-seven program directors responded (response rate, 91.8%); 36 (53.7%) hospitals did not yet have a policy, and 7 (10.4%) hospitals' policies could not be shared. The 29 institutions providing policies were relatively evenly distributed among the 4 U.S. geographic regions (range, 5 to 9 policies per region). Among the 26 unique policies analyzed, 3 (11.3%) were produced by state health departments. The most frequently cited triage criteria were benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8%]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]). Twenty-one (80.8%) policies use scoring systems, and 20 of these (95.2%) use a version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Among the policies that specify the triage team's composition (23 [88.5%]), all require or recommend a physician member, 20 (87.0%) a nurse, 16 (69.6%) an ethicist, 8 (34.8%) a chaplain, and 8 (34.8%) a respiratory therapist. Thirteen (50.0% of all policies) require or recommend that those making triage decisions not be involved in direct patient care, but only 2 (7.7%) require that their decisions be blinded to ethically irrelevant considerations. LIMITATION: The results may not be generalizable to institutions without academic bioethics programs. CONCLUSION: Over one half of respondents did not have ventilator triage policies. Policies have substantial heterogeneity, and many omit guidance on fair implementation.

Although researchers are racing to find or develop effective drugs or vaccines, no drugs from modern medical system have been proven effective and the high mutant rates of the virus may lead it resistant to whatever drugs or vaccines developed following modern drug development procedure. Current evidence has demonstrated impressive healing effects of several Chinese medicines (CMs) for Covid-19, which urges us to reflect on the role of CM in the era of modern medicine. Undoubtedly, CM could be promising resources for developing drug candidates for the treatment of Covid-19 in a way similar to the development of artemisinin. But the theory that builds CM, like the emphasis of driving away exogenous pathogen (virus, etc.) by restoring self-healing capacity rather than killing the pathogen directly from the inside and the 'black-box' mode of diagnosing and treating patients, is as important, yet often ignored, an treasure as CM herbs and should be incorporated into modern medicine for future advancement and innovation of medical science.","Li, Jin-Gen; Xu, Hao",Chin J Integr Med,610,16

We analyse the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine applied in Spanish headache consultations, review the literature, and issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in consultations. METHOD: The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. RESULTS: COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%). Neurologists are aware of the need to expand the availability of video consultations, which are clearly growing, and other e-health and m-health tools. CONCLUSIONS: The GECSEN recommends and encourages all neurologists who assist patients with headaches to implement telemedicine resources, with the optimal objective of offering video consultation to patients under 60-65 years of age and telephone calls to older patients, although each case must be considered on an individual basis. Prior approval and advice must be sought from legal and IT services and the centre's management.

FCBD contained cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and multiple terpenes. Treatments with FCBD and a FCBD formulation using phytocannabinoid standards (FCBD:std) reduced IL-6, IL-8, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligands (CCLs) 2 and 7, and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the A549 cell line. Treatment with FCBD induced macrophage (differentiated KG1 cell line) polarization and phagocytosis in vitro, and increased CD36 and type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG (FcÎ³RII) expression. FCBD treatment also substantially increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression in macrophages. FCBD:std, while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity in alveolar epithelial cells, led to reduced phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory IL secretion in macrophages in comparison to FCBD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective CT scan survey was conducted between March 16 and April 12, 2020, in accordance with the local IRB. Seven hundred nine radiology centers were invited to participate in a weekly online survey. Numbers of CT examinations related to COVID-19 including at least chest (CTcovid) and whole chest CT scan activities (CTchest) were recorded each week. A sub-analysis on French departments was performed during the 4 weeks of the study. The impact of the number of RT-PCRs (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions) on the CT workflow was tested using two-sample t test and Pearson's test. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-seven structures finally registered (78%) with mean response numbers of 336 ± 18.9 (323; 351). Mean CTchest activity per radiologic structure ranged from 75.8 ± 133 (0-1444) on week 12 to 99.3 ± 138.6 (0-1147) on week 13. Mean ratio of CTcovid on CTchest varied from 0.36 to 0.59 on week 12 and week 14 respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of RT-PCR performed and the number of CTcovid (r = 0.73, p = 3.10-16) but no link with the number of positive RT-PCR results. CONCLUSION: In case of local high density COVID-19, CT workflow is strongly modified and redirected to the management of these specific patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ Over the 4-week survey period, 117,686 chest CT (CTtotal) were performed among the responding centers, including 61,784 (52%) CT performed for COVID-19 (CTcovid). â¢ Across the country, the ratio CTcovid/CTtotal varied from 0.36 to 0.59 and depended significantly on the local epidemic density (p = 0.003). â¢ In clinical practice, in a context of growing epidemic, in France, chest CT was used as a surrogate to RT-PCR for patient triage.","Herpe, Guillaume; Naudin, Mathieu; Léderlin, Mathieu; Enikeeva, Farida; Boumendil, Olivier; Cassagnes, Lucie; Cavet, Madeleine; Chaumoitre, Kathia; Feuerstein, Philippe; Fitton, Isabelle; Flory, Violaine; Freitag, Cornelia Anna; Gaubert, Jean Yves; Gregory, Jules; Nivet, Hubert; Ohana, Mickaël; Petit, Isabelle; Sans, Nicolas; Wagner, Mathilde; Guillevin, Rémy; Saulnier, Pierre-Jean; Bartoli, Jean-Michel; Tasu, Jean Pierre; Beregi, Jean-Paul",Eur Radiol,610,16

COVID-19 challenges and needs required health systems to rapidly redesign the delivery of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our health system deployed 4 COVID-19 telehealth programs and 4 biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for COVID-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data, we describe the implementation and initial utilization. RESULTS: Through collaboration across multidisciplinary teams and strategic planning, 4 telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19-positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at the federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the COVID-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.","Ford, Dee; Harvey, Jillian B; McElligott, James; King, Kathryn; Simpson, Kit N; Valenta, Shawn; Warr, Emily H; Walsh, Tasia; Debenham, Ellen; Teasdale, Carla; Meystre, Stephane; Obeid, Jihad S; Metts, Christopher; Lenert, Leslie A",J Am Med Inform Assoc,610,1

The objective of the present work is to develop a method that is able to automatically determine mental status of vigilance, i.e., a person's state of alertness. Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state of mind. Aiming at the EEG feature selection and classification model in the identification of fatigue driving, the discretization algorithm using rough set theory is proposed to select the channel and EEG signal feature quantities. The support vector machine (SVM) is selected as the fatigue driving recognition model, and the risk of fatigue misjudgment is taken as SVM model parameters for model optimization. The experimental results of subjects show that compared with the principal component method, the rough set discretization algorithm selects fewer features, and the compatibility threshold 0.8. The number of features selected among the candidate features is 208. The features selected by different subjects are different and have an impact on the establishment of the support vector machine recognition model. Fatigue misjudgment risk control parameters can adjust the support vector machine recognition model error judgment risk. Even if the present approach is costly in computation time, it allows constructing a decision rule that provides an accurate and fast prediction of the alertness state of an unseen individual.","Chitti, Sridevi Kumar J.

Identification of known and approved drugs against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seems to be an urgent need for the repurposing of the existing drugs. So, here we examined a safe strategy of using approved drugs of SuperDRUG2 database against modeled membrane protein (M-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 which is essential for virus assembly by using molecular docking-based virtual screening. A total of 3639 drugs from SuperDRUG2 database and additionally 14 potential drugs reported against COVID-19 proteins were selected. Molecular docking analyses revealed that nine drugs can bind the active site of M-protein with desirable molecular interactions. We therefore applied molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculation using MM-PBSA to analyze the stability of the compounds. The complexes of M-protein with the selected drugs were simulated for 50 ns and ranked according to their binding free energies. The binding mode of the drugs with M-protein was analyzed and it was observed that Colchicine, Remdesivir, Bafilomycin A1 from COVID-19 suggested drugs and Temozolomide from SuperDRUG2 database displayed desirable molecular interactions and higher binding affinity towards M-protein. Interestingly, Colchicine was found as the top most binder among tested drugs against M-protein. We therefore additionally identified four Colchicine derivatives which can bind efficiently with M-protein and have better pharmacokinetic properties. We recommend that these drugs can be tested further through in vitro studies against SARS-CoV-2 M-protein.","Peele, K Abraham; Kumar, Vikas; Parate, Shraddha; Srirama, Krupanidhi; Lee, Keun Woo; Venkateswarulu, T C",J Pharm Sci,610,18

AIMS: To study carbapenemase production in P. aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems processed in the microbiology laboratory of the Health Network UC-CHRISTUS in 2014-2015 and compare them with the strains studied in 2004-2005. METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2015, 459 strains of P. aeruginosa from clinical samples were isolated. Susceptibility was determined by dilution in agar and strains with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were tested for carbaNP. Positive strains were studied by PCR for blaVIM, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaOXA and blaIMI genes. Pulsed field electrophoresis was performed on selected strains. RESULTS: From 459 strains studied, 300 had reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (65.3%). Of these, 183 were viable for study, corresponding to 164 patients. The carbaNP test was positive in 44 strains of the 183 strains (24%). The resistance genes found were: blaVIM-2 in 35 strains, blaKPC-2+VIM-2 in 7 strains and blaKPC-2 in 2 strains. In the blaKPC-2 strains clonal relation between them was found. CONCLUSIONS: A 65.3% of P. aeruginosa presented decreased susceptibility to carbapenems being the presence of carbapenemases not the main resistance mechanism.

PE had a significantly low incidence prior to the COVID-19 epidemic. This condition saw a sharp surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating an evident viral influence on PE's pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. The hypercoagulable state induced by the viral load seems to be the major contributor, and the classical causative factors seem to play a lesser role. PE in COVID-19 infection has become a mammoth challenge since the diagnosis is quite challenging due to overlapping symptoms, lack of prior-known predisposing risk factors, limited resources, and viral transmittance risk. Numerous factors arising out of the viral load or treatment lead to an increased risk for PE in COVID-19 patients, besides the fact that certain unknown risk factors may also contribute to the incidence of PE in COVID-19 patients. The management of PE in COVID-19 infection mainly comprises thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulant therapy with mechanical ventilation, depending on the risk stratification of the patient, with a post-COVID-19 management that prevents recurrent PE and complications.

Many of these measures caused a sudden rupture in people's daily routines, thereby eliciting considerable uncertainty and potentially also hampering the satisfaction of individuals' psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Drawing upon Maslow's Hierarchical Need Theory and Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the unique role of felt insecurity and the psychological needs, as well as their dynamic interplay, in the prediction of mental health. A large and heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 5118; Mage = 43.45 years) was collected during the first ten days of the lockdown period in Flanders, Belgium. A subsample (N = 835, Mage = 41.39) participated during a second wave one week later. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that felt insecurity, need satisfaction and need frustration all independently predicted various positive (life satisfaction, sleep quality) and negative indicators depressive symptoms, anxiety) of mental health, with little systematic evidence for interactions between the predictors. The pattern of findings obtained concurrently largely held in the longitudinal analyses. Finally, results showed that associations between felt insecurity and lower concurrent and prospective mental health were partially mediated by need satisfaction and frustration, with especially psychological need frustration predicting changes in mental health over time. Overall, the findings suggest that satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is not just a 'luxury good'. Satisfaction of these needs is important also in times of insecurity, while need frustration represents a risk factor for maladjustment during such times.","Vermote, Branko; Waterschoot, Joachim; Morbée, Sofie; Van der Kaap-Deeder, Jolene; Schrooyen, Charlotte; Soenens, Bart; Ryan, Richard; Vansteenkiste, Maarten",J Happiness Stud,610,16

Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.","Whiteside, Tess; Kane, Erin; Aljohani, Bandar; Alsamman, Marya; Pourmand, Ali",Am. j. emerg. med,610,26

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-&#945; levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Moniri, Afshin; Marjani, Majid; Malekmohammad, Majid; Mansouri, Davood; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M",Front Immunol,610,22

Particular vigilance has been warranted regarding the continuation of immunosuppressive treatments since viral clearing may be hampered in such cases. In contrast, it has also been hypothesized that overactive immune responses may trigger a cytokine storm associated with clinical deterioration, which has generated an interest in certain immunosuppressant drugs as potential treatment for COVID-19.

Evidence suggests diabetes to be a risk factor for the progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to understand the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19. We also aimed to compute the risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed to identify the articles reporting the diabetes prevalence and risk of mortality or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was to compute the pooled prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes. RESULTS: This meta-analysis was based on a total of 23007 patients from 43 studies. The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19 was found to be 15% (95% CI: 12%-18%), p = <0.0001.

It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class decision in representation based techniques.","Yamac, Mehmet; Ahishali, Mete; Degerli, Aysen; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

However, the mechanisms by which intolerance of uncertainty (IU) affects negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of pandemic-focused time and the moderating role of perceived efficacy in the association between IU and negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the uncertainty-time-efficacy-emotion model (UTEE). 1131 participants were recruited to complete measures of COVID-19 IU, pandemic-focused time, perceived efficacy, negative emotions and demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 IU was significantly and positively associated with negative emotions, and this link could be mediated by pandemic-focused time. Moreover, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was moderated by perceived efficacy. Specifically, the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions was much stronger for individuals with lower levels of perceived efficacy. The current study further extended the previous integrative uncertainty tolerance model.

Barriers pertain mainly to costs, not knowing where to get help, excessive wait times, and insufficient funding. Through the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities agreement, action is being taken by all jurisdictions in Canada to increase community-based mental health promotion programs and early interventions, especially those targeting children and youth. A growing body of evidence is demonstrating how specific community and primary care-based interventions are both effective and cost-effective. These integrated community solutions, shown to be effective for increasing access to appropriate services for patients while saving costs to the healthcare system, would benefit from the recent funding investments put in place by the federal government.","Moroz, Nicholas; Moroz, Isabella; D039, Slovinec; Angelo, Monika",Healthc Manage Forum,610,1

Despite many proposed therapies, no effective medication has yet been approved. Neutrophils appear to be the key mediator for COVID-19-associated inflammatory immunopathologic, thromboembolic and fibrotic complications. Thus, for any therapeutic agent to be effective, it should greatly block the neutrophilic component of COVID-19. One of the effective therapeutic approaches investigated to reduce neutrophil-associated inflammatory lung diseases with few adverse effects was roflumilast. Being a highly selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE4i), roflumilast acts by enhancing the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), that probably potentiates its anti-inflammatory action via increasing neprilysin (NEP) activity. Because activating NEP was previously reported to mitigate several airway inflammatory ailments; this review thoroughly discusses the proposed NEP-based therapeutic properties of roflumilast, which may be of great importance in curing COVID-19. However, further clinical studies are required to confirm this strategy and to evaluate its in vivo preventive and therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19.","El Tabaa, Manar Mohammed; El Tabaa, Maram Mohammed",Eur J Pharmacol,610,1

Methods: In this single center, retrospective, observational study, we identified 55 adults admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia who received Tocilizumab. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data was compared between those who received Tocilizumab and all patients admitted with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included role of concomitant steroid use and change in eosinophil counts, ferritin, AST, CRP and D-Dimer values. Results: Of the 589 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia, 55 received Tocilizumab as part of their treatment course. Patient demographics of those who received Tocilizumab include a mean age of 58 years with 73% male, 51% with diabetes, and 58% with hypertension. 4/55 (7.3%) were immunocompromised. Common presenting symptoms on admission were fever (62%), cough (78%) and dyspnea (89%). 35/55 (64%) were admitted to the ICU during their hospitalization;their mean P/F ratio was 127. Tocilizumab was administered on average admission day 4 (1-19). A second dose was given to 17 (31%) of patients, with 11 given the following day. Average hospital length of stay (LOS) postadministration was 17 days. Average white blood cell (WBC) count on day of Tocilizumab administration was 11, with an absolute lymphocyte count of 0.96. Mean IL-6 on hospital admission was 48.3. Two days post Tocilizumab administration there was a peak in ferritin, percent eosinophils, and AST. Both two-and five-day post-Tocilizumab CRP levels decreased while D-Dimer increased (Table 1). All Tocilizumab patients received antibiotics. In addition, three received hydroxychloroquine, 16 Remdesivir, and 51 convalescent plasma. 31 (56%) received steroids. On Day 2, those who did not receive steroids had, on average, more than double the percent of eosinophils in their blood (3.21% vs 1.53%). This difference decreased by Day 5. In time period of interest, COVID-19 admission mortality was 63/589 (10.6%) and 40/77 (52%) for mechanically ventilated patients. For Tocilizumab recipients, 25/55 patients were mechanically ventilated and 12/25 (48%) died. Overall, 28-day mortality was 11/55 (20%), with hospital mortality up to 16/55 (29%). This was similar to our larger cohort ICU mortality of 29.3%. Conclusion: Tocilizumab recipients in our cohort had a mortality similar to overall COVID ICU mortality. It appeared to be well tolerated except for an increase in eosinophilia if with no concomitant steroid use.","Palmer, G.; Meyer, N.; Jamous, F.

The rapid spread of the virus at a global scale highlights the need for a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring the human mobility that has proven to be associated with viral transmission. In this study, we analyzed over 580 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amenable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the effectiveness of those measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct. However, the impacts vary substantially among states.","Huang, Xiao; Li, Zhenlong; Jiang, Yuqin; Li, Xiaoming; Porter, Dwayne",PLoS One,610,1

However, it is not clear whether the thyroid gland is impaired in COVID-19 patients. Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) is usually associated with the disease severity and deterioration prognosis in critical illness. In this study, the thyroid function of COVID-19 patients was assessed and factors associated with outcomes were analyzed to determine the potential predictive value of ESS. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients with or without ESS in Changsha, China, were collected and analyzed on admission. Kaplan-Meier curve and cox regression model were utilized to determine the correlation between ESS and the endpoints. Subsequently, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the predictive performances of FT3 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the disease severity. Results: Forty-one (27.52%) cases of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with ESS. ESS patients had higher proportions of fever, shortness of breath, hypertension, diabetes, and severe events than those of non-ESS patients. The levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and the positive rate of procalcitonin were significantly higher, whereas the lymphocyte count was apparently lower in ESS patients than in non-ESS patients. The regression analysis showed that ESS was significantly associated with the disease severity of COVID-19 (HR = 2.515, 95% CI: 1.050-6.026, P = 0.039). The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting the severe disease were [0.809 (95% CI 0.727-0.892), P < 0.001] and [0.792 (95% CI 0.689-0.895), P < 0.001] for FT3 and CRP, respectively.

Surprisingly, very few studies have examined the potential neurotoxic action of Chq exposure at different points of gestation or how this phenomenon may affect neurophysiological well-being in later life. We therefore studied behavior, and the expression of specific genes and neurochemicals modulating crucial neural processes in offspring of rats exposed to prophylactic dose of Chq during different stages of gestation. Pregnant rats were injected 5 mg/kg/day (3 times) of Chq either during early- (first week), mid- (second week), late- (third week), or throughout- (all weeks) gestation, while controls received PBS injection. Behavioral characterization of offspring between postnatal days 15-20 in the open field, Y-maze, elevated plus and elevated zero mazes revealed that Chq evoked anxiogenic responses and perturbed spatial memory in rats, although locomotor activity was generally unaltered. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and cerebellum of rats prenatally exposed to Chq, RT-qPCR analysis revealed decreased mRNA expression of presynaptic marker synaptophysin, which was accompanied by downregulation of postsynaptic marker PSD95. Synaptic marker PICK1 expression was also downregulated in the hippocampus but was unperturbed in the PFC and cerebellum. In addition to recorded SOD downregulation in cortical and hippocampal lysates, induction of oxidative stress in rats prenatally exposed to Chq was corroborated by lipid peroxidation as evinced by increased MDA levels. Offspring of rats infused with Chq at mid-gestation and weekly treatment throughout gestation were particularly susceptible to neurotoxic changes, especially in the hippocampus. Interestingly, Chq did not cause histopathological changes in any of the brain areas. Taken together, our findings causally link intrauterine exposure to Chq with postnatal behavioral impairment and neurotoxic changes in rats.","Olajide, Olayemi Joseph; Alliy, Zainab Omolara; Ojo, Daniel Oluwapelumi; Osinubi, Olajumoke Olamipe; Bello, Sofiyat Opeyemi; Ibrahim, Faaizah Eniola; Adukwu, Faith Ojochenemi; Abikoye, Tolulope Olabisi; Gbadamosi, Ismail Temitayo; Mutholib, Nafisat Yetunde; Bamisi, Olawande; Ajiboye, Olaolu Joseph; Okesina, Akeem Ayodeji; Alli-Oluwafuyi, Abdulmusawwir; Oyewole, Aboyeji Lukuman; Nafiu, Abdulrazaq Bidemi; Akinola, Olugbenga",Neurotoxicol Teratol,610,16

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 1647 patients between the ages of 30 and 65 years with HPV 16/18 undergoing colposcopy-guided biopsy at a tertiary gynecological cancer center between January-2016 and January-2019. We compared the preinvasive lesion rates and the invasive cervical cancer rates of women with HPV 16/18 between the negative and the abnormal cytology group. RESULTS: Of the 1647 women, 1105 (67.1%) had negative cytology and 542 (32.9%) had abnormal cytology. Among women with initial negative cytology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ lesion was detected in 205 (18.6%) women. The rate of CIN 2+ lesion in women with abnormal cytology was 28%.

In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data.

RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

With the increase of online courses after Covid-19 pandemic, the type of student misbehaviors changed a lot. The aim of research was to examine student misbehaviors encountered during online courses, to identify the most common and disruptive student misbehaviors from teachers' perspective and to put forth teachers' suggestions about proper behaviors. The research was a phenomenological study. Data were gathered from 71 teachers teaching different courses and working at various levels. For data collection, a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was used. It was assessed through descriptive analysis. According to findings, a list containing 27 different student misbehaviors was generated. Results showed that the most common misbehaviors were indifference to course, not attending course, turning off webcam and slanging. The most disruptive misbehaviors were making noise, absenteeism, and distractibility. Findings revealed that teachers had some ideas to overcome these misbehaviors such as taking attendance, getting family support, encouraging students to turn on webcam, creating intrinsic motivation and organizing parent meetings. It can be concluded that some unwanted student behaviors can be seen during online courses;however, it can be overcome with the help of some precautions taken by teachers.","Akkas Baysal, Emine Ocak Gürbüz",Problems of Education in the 21st Century,610,16

We rely on a comprehensive panel dataset of 1,824 small agricultural households collected over two survey rounds, on November?December 2019 and May?June 2020. We place special emphasis on changes in agricultural and nonagricultural income sources, including remittances, and changes in dietary diversity, including consumption of animal source foods (ASF) and fruits and vegetables (F&V). We find that COVID-19 affected the incomes, food security, and dietary patterns of households, with a decrease in ASF diversity and an increase in F&V diversity, and an overall net decrease in dietary diversity across all food groups. Dietary diversity among women in reproductive age, however, remained unchanged, and increased among children under 2 years old. Interestingly, households with relatively higher incomes appear to have reduced their dietary diversity to a larger extent than lower income ones, as well as households located in communities with more severe access restrictions. The focus of the study in a region with a high prevalence of poverty and chronic malnutrition provides an important perspective into the consequences of the lockdown in complex rural contexts with vulnerable populations and contributes to inform eventual recovery measures.","Ceballos, Francisco Hernandez Manuel A.; Paz, Cynthia",Agricultural Economics,610,21

Although uncommon, another possible cause of AV shunt which can facilitate brain abscess is a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM). We report a case of brain abscess secondary to a solitary PAVM and review the literature. Case Description: A 74-year-old male patient presented with headaches, fatigue, low-grade fever, and homonymous hemianopsia. He was diagnosed with a brain abscess in the left occipital lobe. A chest computed tomography (CT) with intravenous (IV) contrast was performed because of fever and respiratory insufficiency in a period where screening for COVID-19 in suspected patients was important. A solitary PAVM of the left lung was diagnosed. Initial stereotactic burr hole drainage of the abscess was insufficient and resection of the abscess was deemed necessary. Routine workup did not reveal any additional pathology apart from the PAVM. After treatment of the cerebral abscess, the PAVM was treated with embolization using an endovascular plug. Conclusion: It is recommended to screen for PAVM by chest CT with IV contrast in patients with brain abscess when no obvious source of infection can be identified.

But with the social distancing imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work (RW) emerged as an adequate solution to continue labor at a large scale, even in the situations where remote work was unforeseeable and, in many cases, happened under inappropriate conditions. Despite some advantages, which are mainly identified by employees, there are other issues, pointed out by organizations, such as required technology infrastructure, HR training, etc. In any case, opting for remote work present some gains and losses for both employers and employees. With the end of the mandatory confinement, organizations reorganized the work format and, in some cases, it consisted in restoring the previous one.

We aimed to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis on the reliability and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and deep throat sputum (DTS) compared to nasopharyngeal, combined naso/oropharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The inclusion criteria were studies that specifically assessed a sample of saliva or DTS with at least one other respiratory specimen in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on RT-PCR tests. The DerSimonian-Laird bivariate random-effects model analysis performed using STATA software with the ""metaprop"" package. RESULTS: From 1598 studies, we retrieved 33 records, of which 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found an overall sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86-100) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 92% (95% CI, 80-99) for double naso/oropharyngeal swabs, 87% (95% CI, 77-95) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 83% (95% CI, 77-89) for saliva, 82% (95% CI, 76-88) for DTS, and 44% (95% CI, 35-52) for oropharyngeal swabs among symptomatic patients, respectively. Regardless of the type of specimens, the viral load and sensitivity in the severe patients were higher than mild and in the symptomatic patients higher than asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides evidence for the diagnostic value of different respiratory specimens and supports saliva and DTS as promising diagnostic tools for first-line screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the methods of sampling, storing, and laboratory assay need to be optimized and validated before introducing as a definitive diagnosis tool. Saliva, DTS, and nasopharyngeal swab showed approximately similar results, and sensitivity was directly related to the disease severity. This review revealed a relationship between viral load, disease severity, and test sensitivity. None of the specimens showed appropriate diagnostic sensitivity for asymptomatic patients.","Khiabani, Kazem; Amirzade-Iranaq, Mohammad Hosein",Am. j. infect. control,610,22

A key question is the role of pre-existing psychiatric disorders in how such measures are experienced. METHODS: During the first country-wide lockdown imposed in France, a Covid-19 module was added to the French portion of the ongoing World Mental Health International college student survey. The present study focuses on respondents who completed the survey during that time frame (n = 291). RESULTS: Students with prior depression endorsed greater increases in anxiety (72.2% vs 50.9%) and stress (72.2% vs 49.4%), as well as greater decreases in concentration (87.0% vs 72.9%) during lockdown as compared to those without depression history. In multivariate analyses, prior depression was associated with overall stress (AOR = 5.50), financial stress (AOR = 1.95), family stress (AOR = 2.47), work related stress (AOR = 5.15), and stress related to loved ones (AOR = 2.21). Prior depression was also associated with greater probability experiencing increased anxiety (AOR = 2.61) and stress (AOR = 2.55) during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the best predictor of experiencing stress and anxiety during the first Covid-19 lockdown was a history of depression prior to the pandemic outbreak. Implementing public health measures such as mandatory national lockdowns should be accompanied by strategies for reaching out to those who are vulnerable due to a history of mental illness.","Husky, Mathilde M; Kovess-Masfety, Viviane; Gobin-Bourdet, Clara; Swendsen, Joel",Compr Psychiatry,610,20

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is shed in the stool of infected individuals and aggregated in public sewers, where it can be quantified to provide information on population-level disease incidence that is unbiased by access to clinical testing. In this study, we present results from the largest nationwide wastewater monitoring system in the United States reported to date. We profile 55 locations with at least six months of sampling and highlight their wastewater data from April 2020 through May 2021. These locations represent over 12 million individuals across 19 states. Samples were collected approximately weekly by wastewater treatment utilities as part of a regular wastewater surveillance service and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (copies/mL) were normalized to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a stable and persistent indicator of feces concentrations in wastewater. Here, we show that wastewater data reflects temporal and geographic trends in clinical COVID-19 cases, demonstrating that wastewater surveillance is a feasible approach for nationwide population-level monitoring of COVID-19 disease. We also provide key lessons learned from our broad-scale implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology, which can be used to inform wastewater-based epidemiology approaches for future emerging diseases. With an evolving epidemic and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, wastewater-based epidemiology can serve as an important passive surveillance approach to detect changing dynamics or resurgences of the virus. HighlightsO_LIWe present results from a nationwide wastewater monitoring network in the United States, which represents one of the broadest temporal and geographic wastewater-based epidemiology datasets to-date.

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for clinical application.","Sharifrazi, Danial; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Roshanzamir, Mohamad; Joloudari, Javad Hassannataj; Shoeibi, Afshin; Jafari, Mahboobeh; Hussain, Sadiq; Sani, Zahra Alizadeh; Hasanzadeh, Fereshteh; Khozeimeh, Fahime; Khosravi, Abbas; Nahavandi, Saeid; Panahiazar, Maryam; Zare, Assef; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Acharya, U Rajendra",Biomed Signal Process Control,610,25

Stressors and strategies for coping with stress were also identified during the pandemic. The results indicated that employed students were more vulnerable to stress compared to non-employed ones before and during the pandemic. Females registered significantly higher stress scores compared to males in the period of the epidemic. The analysis of the overall sample suggested that gender and environment were significant stress factors during the pandemic, but living conditions were not relevant. The most effective coping strategies against stress for nurses during the COVID-19 crisis were based on self-control and the spiritual dimension, unlike the previous period when other colleagues' support helped most nurses to overcome difficult working conditions.

The model has been applied to a realistic case study considering a sociological structure of beneficiaries categorized by age and gender and representing the first decile of incomes of the Spanish population. The demand of macronutrients is satisfied by means of nine different groups of food, used to provide some level of variability in the consumption patterns of the beneficiaries. The results provide insight on cost-cutting opportunities related to centralizing the decision-making process, indicating a 10% reduction both in provisioning costs and food quantities. This suggests that the proposed model might serve as a tool for designing new strategies for the provisioning or evaluation of economic and social support policies for the food bank of Madrid.","Castañón, Rosendo; Campos, Fco Alberto; Doménech Martínez, Salvador; Villar, José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,20

Understanding the associations of school closures with the number of incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases is critical for decision-making. Objective: To estimate the association of schools being open or closed with the number of COVID-19 cases compared with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modelling study developed an agent-based transmission model using a synthetic population of 1â¯000â¯000 individuals based on the characteristics of the population of Ontario, Canada. Members of the synthetic population were clustered into households, neighborhoods, or rural districts, cities or rural regions, day care facilities, classrooms (ie, primary, elementary, or high school), colleges or universities, and workplaces. Data were analyzed between May 5, 2020, and October 20, 2020. Exposures: School reopening on September 15, 2020, vs schools remaining closed under different scenarios for nonpharmaceutical interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases between September 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. Results: Among 1â¯000â¯000 simulated individuals, the percentage of infections among students and teachers acquired within schools was less than 5% across modeled scenarios. Incident COVID-19 case numbers on October 31, 2020, were 4414 (95% credible interval [CrI], 3491-5382) cases in the scenario with schools remaining closed and 4740 (95% CrI, 3863-5691) cases in the scenario for schools reopening, with no other community-based nonpharmaceutical intervention. In scenarios with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented, the incident case numbers on October 31 were 714 (95% CrI, 568-908) cases for schools remaining closed and 780 (95% CrI, 580-993) cases for schools reopening. When scenarios applied the case numbers observed in early October in Ontario, the cumulative case numbers were 777 (95% CrI, 621-993) cases for schools remaining closed and 803 (95% CrI, 617-990) cases for schools reopening. In scenarios with implementation of community-based interventions vs no community-based interventions, there was a mean difference of 39â¯355 cumulative COVID-19 cases by October 31, 2020, while keeping schools closed vs reopening them yielded a mean difference of 2040 cases. Conclusions and Relevance: This decision analytical modeling study of a synthetic population of individuals in Ontario, Canada, found that most COVID-19 cases in schools were due to acquisition in the community rather than transmission within schools and that the changes in COVID-19 case numbers associated with school reopenings were relatively small compared with the changes associated with community-based nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Naimark, David; Mishra, Sharmistha; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Sander, Beate",JAMA Netw Open,610,15

However, caregivers may be or feel unable to cope with their role and, despite the needs of caregivers are often assessed in the literature, their opinions and feelings about these needs are not widely explored yet. This study aimed at exploring the opinions and feelings about their educational needs and role of familial caregivers of Parkinson's Disease patients. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from October to December 2017 in a polyclinic of central Italy. Fourteen caregivers voluntarily participated in the study; semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted, and audio recorded until data saturation. Two investigators reviewed the transcribed notes, created Meaning Units, Sub-categories and finally the Categories with emerged themes. RESULTS: The analysis of the 14 interviews generated three categories: supportiveness of healthcare educational programs; sense of inability to manage caregiver tasks; need for interaction with other familial caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: The caregivers declared their belief that healthcare educational courses can be useful in helping them live and understand the caregiving tasks and expressed their need to share their experiences with other caregivers. In fact, they often they felt abandoned and poorly trained for the patient's management at the home.

In the absence of effective treatments, they have led to significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. We reported that indoles exerted potent activity against swine coronaviruses, the molecules used included melatonin, indole, tryptamine, and L-tryptophan. Herein, we did further systematic studies with melatonin, a ubiquitous and versatile molecule, and found it inhibited TGEV, PEDV, and PDCoV infection in PK-15, Vero, or LLC-PK1 cells by reducing viral entry and replication, respectively.

Behavioral teleporting consists of real-time transfer of the complete ethogram of a live zebrafish onto a remotely-located robotic replica. Through parallel and simultaneous behavioral teleporting, we studied the interaction between two live fish swimming in remotely-located tanks: each live fish interacted with an inanimate robot that mirrored the behavior of the other fish, and the morphology of each robot was independently tailored. Our results indicate that behavioral teleporting can preserve natural interaction between two live animals, while allowing fine control over morphological features that modulate social behavior.","Karakaya, Mert; Macrì, Simone; Porfiri, Maurizio",iScience,610,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The open data on the number of COVID-19 cases reported at daily basis form the globe were used to assess the evolution of outbreaks with international air link on the same latitude and also including Taiwan. The dynamic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model was used to evaluate continental transmission from December 2019 to March 2020 before the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic with basic reproductive number and effective reproductive number before and after containment measurements. RESULTS: For the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, the estimated reproductive number was reduced from 2.84 during the overwhelming outbreaks in early January to 0.43 after the strict lockdown policy. It is very surprising to find there were three countries (including South Korea, Iran, and Italy) and the Washington state of the USA on the 38° North Latitude involved with large-scale community-acquired outbreaks since the first imported COVID-19 cases from China. The propagation of continental transmission was augmented from hotspot to hotspot with higher reproductive number immediately before the declaration of pandemic. By contrast, there was not any large community-acquired outbreak in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: The propagated spatiotemporal transmission from China to other hotspots may explain the emerging pandemic that can only be exempted by timely border control and preparedness of containment measurements according to Taiwan experience.","Ku, Mei-Sheng; Huang, Li-Min; Chiu, Sherry Yueh-Hsia; Wang, Wei-Chun; Jeng, Ya-Chung; Yen, Mu-Yong; Lai, Chao-Chih",J Formos Med Assoc,610,16

This increase coincided with the spread of more transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including B.1.1.7 (1,3) and relaxation of COVID-19 prevention strategies such as those for businesses, large-scale gatherings, and educational activities. To provide long-term projections of potential trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub teams used a multiple-model approach comprising six models to assess the potential course of COVID-19 in the United States across four scenarios with different vaccination coverage rates and effectiveness estimates and strength and implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (public health policies, such as physical distancing and masking) over a 6-month period (April-September 2021) using data available through March 27, 2021 (4). Among the four scenarios, an accelerated decline in NPI adherence (which encapsulates NPI mandates and population behavior) was shown to undermine vaccination-related gains over the subsequent 2-3 months and, in combination with increased transmissibility of new variants, could lead to surges in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. A sharp decline in cases was projected by July 2021, with a faster decline in the high-vaccination scenarios. High vaccination rates and compliance with public health prevention measures are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent surges in hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months.","Borchering, Rebecca K; Viboud, Cécile; Howerton, Emily; Smith, Claire P; Truelove, Shaun; Runge, Michael C; Reich, Nicholas G; Contamin, Lucie; Levander, John; Salerno, Jessica; van Panhuis, Wilbert; Kinsey, Matt; Tallaksen, Kate; Obrecht, R Freddy; Asher, Laura; Costello, Cash; Kelbaugh, Michael; Wilson, Shelby; Shin, Lauren; Gallagher, Molly E; Mullany, Luke C; Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Dent, Juan; Grantz, Kyra H; Kaminsky, Joshua; Lauer, Stephen A; Lee, Elizabeth C; Meredith, Hannah R; Perez-Saez, Javier; Keegan, Lindsay T; Karlen, Dean; Chinazzi, Matteo; Davis, Jessica T; Mu, Kunpeng; Xiong, Xinyue; Pastore Y Piontti, Ana; Vespignani, Alessandro; Srivastava, Ajitesh; Porebski, Przemyslaw; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Adiga, Aniruddha; Lewis, Bryan; Klahn, Brian; Outten, Joseph; Schlitt, James; Corbett, Patrick; Telionis, Pyrros Alexander; Wang, Lijing; Peddireddy, Akhil Sai",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,610,24

The aim of this survey is to evaluate knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, disease management, prevention measures, and anxiety level during pandemic among patients with IBD. Material and methods: From 15th March to 15th April 2020, a questionnaire survey was administered to 200 patients with IBD by email or phone application. The questionnaire consisted of five sections: (1) anthropometric, demographic and clinical characteristics, (2) knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, (3) IBD management, (4) prevention measures, (5) anxiety level during pandemic. Results: One hundred forty two questionnaires were completed. Ninety-seven patients (68.3%) were males with a mean age of 46 years (SD 13; range 17-76). Fifty-four individuals (38%) were affected by Crohn disease and 88 (62%) by Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients reported high knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (80%), IBD management (72%), and prevention measures (97%). Sixty-two percent of them showed moderate-high level of anxiety. High education level was independently associated with high knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-16.6, p = 0.009) and older age (OR 1, 95%, CI 1.01-1.1, p = 0.01), while the receipt of e-format educational material with low knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19 (OR 3, 95%, CI 1.08-9.3, p = 0.03). Displaying an active disease appeared to be independently associated with low knowledge of IBD management (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.4-22.8, p = 0.01) and no variables other than an older age was independently associated with higher level of anxiety (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.009-1.09, p = 0.01). Conclusions: High educational level and aging promote knowledge about clinical importance of COVID-19, while e-format educational material does not. Taken together with findings that an active disease status compromises knowledge of IBD management and the high level of anxiety related to increasing age, these data suggest the need of further supporting patient-oriented strategies in IBD during Covid-19 pandemic.","Spagnuolo, Rocco; Larussa, Tiziana; Iannelli, Chiara; Cosco, Cristina; Nisticò, Eleonora; Manduci, Elena; Bruno, Amalia; Boccuto, Luigi; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Luzza, Francesco; Doldo, Patrizia",Medicina (Kaunas),610,24

The majority of approved antiviral agents are inhibitors of virus-specific targets that are encoded by individual viruses. These inhibitors are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents. As there are a large number of FDA approved kinase inhibitors for various indications, their repurposing for viral infections is an attractive and time-sparing strategy.

Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (""COVID-19-Pregnancy""). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority. This review summarizes the intricate virulence factors of COVID-19 and elucidate its pathobiological spectrum during pregnancy and postpartum periods with a focus on the putative and complex roles of endogenous and exogenous lactoferrin in conferring immunological advantage to the host.","Naidu Ms PharmD, Sreus A G; Clemens DrPH Fift Cfs Fasn Facn Cns Fiafst, Roger A; Pressman Md Ms Facn, Peter; Zaigham BSc Md PhD, Mehreen; Kadkhoda PhD Sm Ascp D Abmm D Abmli, Kamran; Davies PhD DSc Mae Frsc Frcp Fls Fri, Kelvin J A; Naidu PhD Facn Fls Fissvd, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,610,21

Biolegitimacy and harm reduction during COVID-19,16.821062,3.6474118,2021,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 has continuously spread across the globe briskly. However, since its existence, the symptoms of the disease have been varying widely; thus, developing an urgent need to stratify high-risk categories of people who show more propensity to be affected by this deadly virus will be beneficial for health care. Using the open-access data and machine learning algorithms, this paper aims to cluster countries in groups with similar profiles with respect to the country level pre COVID-19 pandemic parameters. The purpose of performing the data analysis is to measure the extent to which these major risk factors determine the mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease 2019. An unsupervised machine learning model (k-means) was employed for two hundred and eight countries to define data-driven clusters based on thirteen country-level parameters. After performing the one-way ANOVA for comparing the clusters in terms of total cases, total deaths, total cases per population, total deaths per population, and death rate, the paradigm with four and seven clusters showed the best ability to stratify the countries according to total cases per population and death rate with p-values of less than 0.05 and 0.001, respectively. However, the model could not stratify countries in total deaths/cases and total deaths per population.","Garg, Poojita; Joshi, Deepak",J Med Eng Technol,610,24

Biolegitimacy and harm reduction during COVID-19,16.570967,3.9397752,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the relative effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy (RS) in the diagnosis of suspected kidney cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a complete systematic review based on studies from PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We identified 2413 spectra with strict criteria in 6 individual studies published between January 2008 and November 2018 in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We summarized the test performance using random effects models. RESULTS: General pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RS to kidney cancer were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.97) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.92). The pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 9.57 (95% CI 5.73-15.46) while the negative LR was 0.04 (95% CI 0.02-0.11). The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 238.06 (95% CI 77.79-728.54). The area under curve of summary receiver operator characteristics was 0.9466. CONCLUSION: Through this meta-analysis, we found a promisingly high sensitivity and specificity of RS in the diagnosis of suspected kidney masses and tumors. Other parameters like positive LR, negative LR, diagnostic odds ratio and area under curve of the summary receiver operator characteristics curve all helped to illustrate the high efficacy of RS in the diagnosis of kidney cancer.","Jin, Hongyu; He, Xiao; Zhou, Hui; Zhang, Man; Tang, Qingqing; Lin, Lede; Hao, Jianqi; Zeng, Rui",Medicine (Baltimore),610,20

Bruce Aylward: It has absolutely turned it around [But] governors, mayors and others that I talked to in China would never say things were “under control” When I asked them if they felt good about falling cases, they said no They said they were building more beds and buying more ventilators because they were worried that they might never get something like this – a new virus that we don't understand – under control Now they are planning to open up all the travel restrictions, get people back to work and get students back to school But their feeling was that this is going to remain in the population and raise its ugly head, and they have to be able to respond rapidly How did China get to this point? China did something that most other countries would not even have tried, and many people thought would have been impossible It used fundamental public health approaches – such as case finding and contact tracing – to stop a respiratory virus That seemed almost impossible as a premise because respiratory viruses transmit so effectively and efficiently – typically the only way you can stop them is with a vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment What China did provides a lesson for infectious disease epidemiologists Does that mean China's extreme lockdowns were the right way to go? Everyone always starts at the wrong end of the China response The first thing it did was try to prevent the spread as much as it could, and make sure people knew about the disease and how to get tested To actually stop the virus, it had to do rapid testing of any suspect case, immediate isolation of anyone who was a confirmed or suspected case, and then quarantine the close contacts for 14 days so that they could figure out if any were infected Those were the measures that stopped transmission in China, not the big travel restrictions and lockdowns 14% Roughly how many people in South Korea are 65 or older Stopping the movement of people doesn't stop the virus jumping from person to person, it just prevents those people from moving to other places The travel restrictions and lockdowns were to give them time to get the other things in place and actually stop transmission When I spoke to Italy the other day, they said: “We've got these lockdowns in place ” I said: “Great, you've done the hard part, now you have to do the really hard part, and that is making sure the cases are effectively isolated ” Italy is the most affected country in Europe What's happening there? What's happening in Italy, and in many other countries in Europe, is that they are treating the mild cases at home In some countries they are not even testing them They are saying if you have a cough and high fever, stay at home But the problem then is that [people] don't know that they have the disease, they haven't had it confirmed After a couple of days people get bored, go out for a walk and go shopping and get other people infected If you know you are infected you are more likely to isolate yourself Generally in a population, around 60 to 80 per cent of those affected are going to have mild or moderate disease If those people are all out of hospital, most of your cases are at home, but not isolated In China, they found that didn't work They had to get them isolated in hospitals or dormitories or stadiums The main goal was to keep them from getting bored Which countries have responded well to the outbreak? There are lots Look at South Korea – it has been pretty rigorous about testing all the suspect cases and finding all the contacts In the past couple of days, we have seen that, instead of that relentless upward creep in cases, it seems to have turned a corner, which is positive Singapore is another country that has been hit with importations again and again, and they are jumping on them, tracing all the cases, tracing all the contacts, professionally isolating them all It seems to be doing pretty well, even though it has got relatively big numbers Canada had importations into four or five different provinces And in almost all of those it has been able to keep the numbers fairly low, following a very similar rapid test approach And in all those places, it's very easy to get tested as well Do you think these countries have learned lessons from other, past outbreaks? Oh absolutely When you look at Singapore, South Korea, China – why are they so aggressive in terms of case finding and contact tracing for coronavirus? Well they were all hit by SARS Similarly, if you look at Canada, it had a big SARS outbreak back in 2003, with hundreds of cases [These countries] saw the devastation a coronavirus can cause – they jumped right on it Why has the case fatality rate been lower in South Korea than in other countries? It has a relatively young population The population aged over 65 in South Korea is something like 14 per cent – half that of Japan and much lower than Italy A case fatality rate of around 1 per cent – close to what we are seeing in South Korea now – is what we see in a young population But the case fatality rate has been creeping up over time The thing that I would remember, even right now in South Korea, is that [the fatality rate] is still tenfold higher than seasonal flu Is that why it has been so bad in Italy, because the population is older? We are not sure I saw some data from the north [of Italy] that suggests around one-third of cases are being managed at home Some of the milder cases just aren't being tested and officially diagnosed That's part of the problem The second is the older population The third is it is also very early in their outbreak, and that can sometimes be where you see higher mortality among older people, and it distorts the picture What do you think of the UK, which hasn't been taking as strong measures as some countries? People have different reasons for taking different measures at different times in an outbreak Chris [Whitty, chief medical adviser to the UK] is one of the brightest, most sensible and careful people I know I'm not going to second-guess anybody at this time How effective is closing schools? That's a tough one The data [on this is] for a different disease – it's for flu Kids get these rip-roaring flus, and the whole classroom gets sick The kids get their families infected Parents have to stay at home with the kids, and then they get sick, go to work and infect others But one of the curious things with [covid-19] is that we have not seen school outbreaks I talked to my colleagues in South Korea, in China, in Italy, everywhere – no one has seen school outbreaks They have seen situations where a teacher is infected and they have infected kids, but that is different to the kids all getting each other infected When you talk about school closures, you want to know, is it going to reduce the intensity of transmission? We know that it probably won't reduce the number of sick people very much, because not many kids get sick But what we don't know is, are kids getting infected and we just can't see it? And if they are, are they carrying it back to their families? Even there we don't have a lot of data to suggest that kids are infecting their families So as a result, countries have done things differently Lockdown is the hard part Making sure cases are effectively isolated is the really hard part There is a chance that when cases decline in countries and restrictions loosen, we will see more infections What happens then? China decided that it cannot afford to wait for cases to go to absolute zero – not knowing if they ever will – so it decided to strengthen its whole system so that it could live with the disease if it had to It is building additional capacity to isolate people, and it is building additional ventilators It is planning to be able to manage low-level disease and prevent large outbreaks It's a very sensible way to plan It's wishful thinking to think that the virus is going to disappear altogether People keep saying that maybe in the warm season it will Last time I checked, Singapore was very warm, and it's roaring away there","Hamzelou, Jessica",New Scientist,610,20

Reports about KS infection in children are limited. We performed a short-review of literature and described a case of catheter related-bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) caused by KS. Methods and procedures Electronic search through PubMed was conducted using the keywords: “Kocuria” AND “children” AND “sepsis”. The earliest publication date was of 2008, the latest of 2017 Results We analyzed 7 articles with 15 cases described. KS were responsible of endocarditis in 1 child, CR-BSI in 13 children and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 2 children. Most were immunocompromised hosts and CVC-carriers (2 short-bowel syndrome, 2 tumor, 1 congenital tufting-enteropathy, 1 Hirschsprung's disease, 1 methylmalonic-aciduria, 6 prematurity). Only 1 was an otherwise healthy child. Case report: during the COVID-19 lockdown, a 17yeas-old boy affected by Hirschsprung's disease and CVC-carrier developed fever, chills, vomit and hematuria. Due to “hospital fear”, he began empirical therapy with ceftriaxone at home, without symptoms resolution. Once admitted to the department, blood exams showed: normal lymphocyte immunophenotyping, thrombocytopenia, increased CRP and hyperbilirubinaemia. Haematuria, proteinuria and glycosuria also occurred. Culturing blood samples showed KS infection. Echocardiography was normal. Basing on the antibiogram, we started treatment with vancomycin with rapid patient recovery. Conclusion The use of CVCs in immunocompromised patients represents the most important risk factor for KS-BSI. Due to the limited number of reports about this infection, there are no guidelines to manage it.In patients with a chronic disease, opportunistic pathogens as KS must be considered, also because symptoms and complications are still unknown.","Candia, F.

We aimed to investigate temporal trends in COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases over the course of the pandemic. Methods: Using a large, multicentre, electronic health record network (TriNetX), we did a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code or positive PCR test) during the first 90 days of the pandemic (early cohort) compared with the second 90 days of the pandemic (late cohort), matched (1:1) for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, glucocorticoid use, and previous hospitalisations using an exposure score method. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, including hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal failure, and death. We did a subgroup analysis among patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were hospitalised with COVID-19. Findings: We identified 8540 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 6-month study period, including 2811 in the early cohort and 5729 in the late cohort. In the exposure score matched analysis, the risk of hospitalisation was lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (874 [32·4%] of 2701 patients vs 1227 [45·4%] of 2701 patients; relative risk [RR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·67-0·76). The risks of intensive care unit admission (214 [7·9%] vs 385 [14·3%]; RR 0·56, 95% CI 0·47-0·65), mechanical ventilation (96 [3·6%] vs 247 [9·1%]; 0·39, 0·31-0·49), acute kidney injury (372 [13·8%] vs 560 [20·7%]; 0·66, 0·59-0·75), renal replacement therapy (17 [0·6%] vs 32 [1·2%]; 0·53, 0·30-0·96), and death (122 [4·5%] vs 252 [9·3%]; 0·48, 0·39-0·60) were lower in the late cohort compared with the early cohort. Among the hospitalised subgroup, the risk of the composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death was lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (334 [30·7%] of 1089 patients vs 450 [41·3%] of 1089 patients; RR 0·74, 95% CI 0·67-0·83). Interpretation: The risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes have improved over time in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease but remain substantial. These findings might reflect ascertainment of milder cases in the later cohort and improvements in treatment and supportive care.

PURPOSE: A barrier to using organs from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic donors is the high cost of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and concerns about access for recipients after transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate access, cost, and timing for HCV DAAs following transplantation. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study of HCV-negative adult transplant recipients from June 2017 to December 2019 who received grafts from HCV-viremic and/or HCV-seropositive individuals and became HCV viremic after transplantation. RESULTS: Between June 2017 and December 2019, there were 60 HCV-negative transplant recipients who became viremic after receiving grafts from HCV-viremic or HCV-seropositive donors. Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria (n = 25 with liver transplants, n = 6 with lung transplants, n = 4 with simultaneous liver and kidney transplants, and n = 3 with kidney transplants). Of these patients, 23 had commercial insurance, 13 had Medicare, and 2 had Medicaid. All patients ultimately received insurance coverage for treatment; however, 36 (95%) required prior authorization and 9 (24%) required appeals to obtain insurance coverage. The median time from DAA prescription to insurance approval was 6 days. The median time from transplantation to start of treatment was 29 days (range, 0-84 days). Patients with Medicaid insurance had a significantly longer time to insurance approval (31.5 vs 6 days, P = 0.007). The average out-of-pocket cost to patients was less than $10 a month after patient assistance.All patients who completed treatment and 12-week follow-up after treatment achieved a sustained virologic response (n = 36). CONCLUSION: In this study, all HCV-negative recipients who developed HCV following transplantation had access to DAA therapy, with the majority starting treatment in the first month after transplantation.","Bova, Sarah; Cameron, Andrew; Durand, Christine; Katzianer, Jennifer; LeGrand, Meighan; Boyer, Lauren; Glorioso, Jaime; Toman, Lindsey P",Am. j. health system pharm,610,16

We investigated if an interaction existed between vitamin D levels and social deprivation in those with and without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Upper or lower respiratory tract samples from 104 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in accordance with Public Health England criteria (January-May 2020) using RT-PCR. The latest serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25-OHD) levels, quantified by LC-MS/MS, was obtained for each patient (September 2019-April 2020). Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was generated for each patient. Univariate and logistic regression analyses examined associations between age, gender, 25-OHD, IMD score and SARS-CoV-2 result in the total cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: In the total cohort, a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was significantly associated with lower 25-OHD levels and higher IMD. A positive test was associated with higher IMD in the male subgroup and with lower 25-OHD levels in those aged >72 years. Low 25-OHD and IMD quintile 5 were separately associated with positive COVID-19 outcome in the cohort. Patients in IMD quintile 5 with vitamin D levels &#8804; 34.4 nmol/L were most likely to have a positive COVID-19 outcome, even more so if aged >72 years (OR: 19.07, 95%CI: 1.71-212.25; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, combined low vitamin D levels and higher social deprivation were most associated with COVID-19 infection. In older age, this combination was even more significant. Our data support the recommendations for normalising vitamin D levels in those with deficient / insufficient levels and in groups at high risk for deficiency.","Livingston, Mark; Plant, Aiden; Dunmore, Simon; Hartland, Andrew; Jones, Stephen; Laing, Ian; Ramachandran, Sudarshan",Int J Clin Pract,610,2

It draws on a series of focus group interviews with school principals from all school types in Northern Ireland. Results derived from the study shows that despite the benefits of various modes of leadership such as distributed leadership and a consensus-based approach to educational provision that is increasingly promoted across many education systems;school leaders spoke of the need to revert to other modes of leadership in the form of situational leadership that quite frequently became the default strategy to cope with the multitude of challenges for school personnel during this period.While the theory and subsequent benefits of distributed and networked leadership are not disputed, what is questioned is the fragmentary ways in which various modes of leadership are advocated across education systems. This leads to a more succinct question that we suggest should be considered in Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions;that is, what conditions, resources and supports are necessary to ensure that distributed leadership is not only perceived as yet another leadership strategy that can in the main, be implemented in unchallenging as opposed to challenging times.

In patients with advanced disease, tumor growth control, and sometimes also syndrome control are the main goals of systemic therapy. Unfortunately, no standard therapies are available in clinical practice; therefore, clinical studies are strongly recommended. Axitinib (AXI) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently under investigation in an international phase II/III trial including thymic neuroendocrine tumors. Over the past 5 months, the entire world has been facing a devastating medical emergency brought about by a pandemic due to a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Since then, health professionals have been expending all their efforts on trying to provide the best available treatments for patients involved. Patients with cancer, especially those with thoracic involvement, are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its complications because of their immunosuppressive status caused by the cancer and the anticancer therapies. As it remains unclear how to optimally manage such patients, we wished to report our experience with a patient with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of the thymus infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the hope that it may provide some insights and reflections on the management of cancer patients during this challenging time in our history.","Spada, F; Pellicori, S; Zampino, G; Funicelli, L; Gervaso, L; Laffi, A; Rubino, M; Garcia-Carbonero, R; Fazio, N",Endocrine,610,20

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1ß and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1ß or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1ß and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1ß and IL-6 transcriptional response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Bell, Lucy Ck; Meydan, Cem; Kim, Jacob; Foox, Jonathan; Butler, Daniel; Mason, Christopher E; Shapira, Sagi D; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pollara, Gabriele",iScience,610,16

The mortality rates and detailed clinical characteristics of natives and migrants dying with COVID-19 were explored by considering the medical charts of a representative sample of patients deceased in Italian hospitals (n = 2,687) between February 21st and April 29th, 2020. The migrant or native status was assigned based on the individual's country of birth. The expected all-cause mortality among natives and migrants living in Italy was derived by the last available (2018) dataset provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. Overall, 68 individuals with a migration background were identified. The proportions of natives and migrants among the COVID-19-related deaths (97.5% and 2.5%, respectively) were similar to the relative all-cause mortality rates estimated in Italy in 2018 (97.4% and 2.6%, respectively). The clinical phenotype of migrants dying with COVID-19 was similar to that of natives except for the younger age at death. International migrants living in Italy do not have a mortality advantage for COVID-19 and are exposed to the risk of poor outcomes as their native counterparts.","Canevelli, Marco; Palmieri, Luigi; Raparelli, Valeria; Punzo, Ornella; Donfrancesco, Chiara; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Vanacore, Nicola; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",Ann Ist Super Sanita,610,16

METHODS: To analyze initial and long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Our analysis included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71%) were male and 28 (34%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74 patients (89%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81%) with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25%) of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of 14 (21%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97% of antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster decay of IgG antispike antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients on hemodialysis and identifies factors that are associated with lack of seroconversion and with IgG titer decay.","Sakhi, Hamza; Dahmane, Djamal; Attias, Philippe; Kofman, Thomas; Bouvier, Magali; Lapidus, Nathanael; Fourati, Slim; El Karoui, Khalil",J Am Soc Nephrol,610,21

Although the aggressive nature of a cancer is a matter of concern, our exact role as oncologists in this time of restricted resources is not fully clarified. Regarding some consensus recommendation for postponing surgery, there is still an essential need for a single approved protocol regarding each type of malignancy. Iran, as one of the first involved countries in this crisis in Asia, which also has a high prevalence of gynecological malignancies, will certainly require an individualized decision-making schedule based on the most accepted global consensus opinion. Considering our restricted health system resources, herein we tried to introduce a logical gynecologic cancer management protocol based on the stage and survival expectancy of each tumor, along with reviewing all recent recommendations. The limited statistics published in this short period of time have obliged us to mainly focus on expert opinions, and the individualized clinical judgments should be agreed upon by multidisciplinary tumor board consensus.

To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability, an efficient method is urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We evaluated pooling approach on both direct clinical and NA samples. The standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 was employed targeting the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. The experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples and extracted RNA spiked with up to 9 negative samples. For the direct clinical samples viral NA was extracted from each pool to a final extraction volume of 200µL, and subsequently both samples tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the original sample, corresponding to high, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies per reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend pooling of 4/5 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 5 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the Ct value samples spiked, and result in a 137% increase in testing efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community. We recommend clinical sample pooling of 4 or 5 in 1. However, we don't advise pooling of clinical samples when disease prevalence is greater than 7%; particularly when sample size is large.","Mulu, Andargachew; Alemayehu, Dawit Hailu; Alemu, Fekadu; Tefera, Dessalegn Abeje; Wolde, Sinknesh; Aseffa, Gebeyehu; Seyoum, Tamrayehu; Habtamu, Meseret; Abdissa, Alemseged; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Beyene, Getachew Tesfaye",PLoS One,610,1

Objectives: To summarize our 13-year experience in the design of multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps for extensive head and neck defect reconstruction, with vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination. To discuss the strategy for judicious selection between these techniques in the design of multipedicle flaps at different donor sites. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective study was performed in patients with severe head and neck deformities and treated with multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps between May 2005 and May 2018. Intraoperative indocyanine green angiography was utilized for visualization of flap perfusion and analysis of the hemodynamics of pre-existing perforator and prefabricated vessels. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes measured were (1) features of deformities, (2) multipedicle flap designs, and (3) postoperative complications and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Results: Seventy-five multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps were harvested, including 44 supercharged, 26 prefabricated, and 5 tripedicle, combining both techniques, with sizes ranging from 22 × 12 to 45 × 27 cm2. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated slower arterial inflow (0.60 ± 0.29 U/s vs. 2.65 ± 1.29 U/s, p < 0.05) and venous outflow (0.10 U/s vs. 0.23 ± 0.11 U/s) in prefabricated vessels, compared to the pre-existing perforator, namely the internal mammary arterial perforator. Partial necroses were observed in three patients with only one requiring skin grafting. The aesthetic and functional outcomes were satisfying after reconstruction. Conclusions and Relevance: Multipedicle pre-expanded perforator flaps fabricated by vascular supercharge and flap prefabrication, either solely or in combination in various donor sites, are powerful reconstructive tools for extensive head and neck defects. For a more reliable design, vascular supercharging should be considered a priority strategy, and flap prefabrication an alternative when suitable supercharging vessels are unavailable.","Zan, Tao; Li, Haizhou; Huang, Xin; Gao, Yashan; Gu, Bin; Pu, Lee L Q; Xu, Xiangwen; Gu, Shuchen; Khoong, Yimin; Li, Qingfeng",,610,17

Although evidence suggests that masks help to curb the spread of the disease, there is little empirical research at the population level. We investigate the association between self-reported mask-wearing, physical distancing, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA, along with the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered via a web platform to randomly surveyed US individuals aged 13 years and older, to query self-reports of face mask-wearing. Survey responses were combined with instantaneous reproductive number (Rt) estimates from two publicly available sources, the outcome of interest. Measures of physical distancing, community demographics, and other potential sources of confounding (from publicly available sources) were also assessed. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask-wearing and community transmission control (Rt<1). Additionally, mask-wearing in 12 states was evaluated 2 weeks before and after statewide mandates. FINDINGS: 378â207 individuals responded to the survey between June 3 and July 27, 2020, of which 4186 were excluded for missing data. We observed an increasing trend in reported mask usage across the USA, although uptake varied by geography. A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 3·53, 95% CI 2·03-6·43). We found that communities with high reported mask-wearing and physical distancing had the highest predicted probability of transmission control. Segmented regression analysis of reported mask-wearing showed no statistically significant change in the slope after mandates were introduced; however, the upward trend in reported mask-wearing was preserved. INTERPRETATION: The widespread reported use of face masks combined with physical distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Self-reported mask-wearing increased separately from government mask mandates, suggesting that supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximise adoption and help to curb the ongoing epidemic.

In this study, we investigated the pulmonary function and computed tomography (CT) findings of critical COVID-19 patients approximately 100 days after symptom onset. METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data on critical COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from April to December 2020 and evaluated their pulmonary function, residual respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities on CT. RESULTS: We extracted 17 patients whose median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR], 59-67) years. The median lengths of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were 23 (IQR, 18-38) and 9 (IQR, 6-13) days, respectively. At 100 days after symptom onset, the following pulmonary function abnormalities were noted in 8 (47%) patients: a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) of <80% for 6 patients (35%); a percent vital capacity (%VC) of <80% for 4 patients (24%); and a forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1%) of <70% for 1 patient (6%) who also presented with %DLCO and %VC abnormalities. Twelve (71%) patients reported residual respiratory symptoms and 16 (94%) showed abnormalities on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of the critical COVID-19 patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation continued presenting with abnormal imaging studies and 47% of the patients presented with abnormal pulmonary function 100 days after symptom onset. The extent of the residual CT findings might be associated with the degree of abnormal pulmonary function in critical COVID-19 survivors.","Miwa, Maki; Nakajima, Mikio; Kaszynski, Richard H; Hamada, Shoichiro; Ando, Hitoshi; Nakano, Tomotsugu; Shirokawa, Masamitsu; Goto, Hideaki",Respiratory investigation (Online),610,1

METHODS: We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay, targeting 6 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions, and evaluated it on nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples collected from 130 COVID-19 positive or negative ambulatory individuals, who presented symptoms suggestive of mild or moderate SARS-CoV2 infection. RESULTS: For the nasopharyngeal swab samples, the results obtained using the 6-plex RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays were all concordant. The 6-plex RT-ddPCR assay was more sensitive than RT-qPCR (85% versus 62%) on saliva samples from patients with positive nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: Multiplex RT-ddPCR represents an alternative and complementary tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular to control RT-qPCR ambiguous results. It can also be applied to saliva for repetitive sampling and testing individuals for whom nasopharyngeal swabbing is not possible.","Cassinari, K.; Alessandri-Gradt, E.; Chambon, P.; Charbonnier, F.; Gracias, S.; Beaussire, L.; Alexandre, K.; Sarafan-Vasseur, N.; Houdayer, C.; Etienne, M.; Caron, F.; Plantier, J.

To address some of the pertinent issues with these assessments, the end-of-life decision-making capacity of a 72-year-old female with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and terminal cancer is discussed, as are the role of the treating clinician and the importance of health-related values. There is a recommendation that the focus of these assessments can rather be on practical outcomes, especially when capacity issues arise. This implies that the decision-making capacity of the patient is only practically important when the treatment team is willing to proceed against the patient's wishes. This shifts the focus from a potentially difficult assessment to the simpler question of whether the patient's capacity will change the treatment approach. Clinicians should attend to any possible underlying issues, instead of focusing strictly on capacity. Compared to the general populations people with serious mental illness (SMI) have higher rates of physical illness and die at a younger age, but they do not commonly access palliative care services. Conversations about end-of-life care can occur without fear that a person's psychiatric symptoms or related vulnerabilities will undermine the process. More research about palliative care and advance care planning for people with SMI is needed. This is even more urgent in light of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and South African health services should consider recommendations that advanced care planning should be routinely implemented. These recommendations should not only focus on the general population and should include patients with SMI.","Kotze, Carla; Roos, Johannes L",S Afr Fam Pract (2004),610,16

To gain entry, the virus uses its Spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involve significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the Spike/hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of Spike RBD/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.","Silva de Souza, Anacleto; Rivera, Jose David; Almeida, Vitor Medeiros; Ge, Pingju; de Souza, Robson Francisco; Farah, Chuck Shaker; Ulrich, Henning; Marana, Sandro Roberto; Salinas, Roberto Kopke; Guzzo, Cristiane Rodrigues",J Phys Chem Lett,610,16

However, molecular diagnostic capabilities are poorly developed in many African countries. Efforts by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and other public health agencies to scale up facilities for molecular testing across the continent are well documented, but there are few accounts from the laboratories at the frontline. Intervention: As part of an institutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, signed a memorandum of understanding with a World Bank-supported institution to obtain a non-proprietary testing platform, renovated an existing molecular virology laboratory and validated the test process to make SARS-CoV-2 testing readily available for decision-making by frontline health workers. These efforts resulted in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital’s inclusion in the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control COVID-19 molecular laboratory network. The laboratory achieved a turnover of 12 123 tests within 7 months of operation. Challenges faced and dealt with include incompatible equipment, limited skilled manpower, unstable (unreliable) electric power supply, disrupted procurement and supply chain, and significant overhead costs. Lessons learnt: Molecular diagnostic capability is essential in laboratory preparedness for pandemic response and can be achieved by establishing collaborative networks in low-resource settings. Recommendations: Molecular diagnostic capabilities attained during the COVID-19 pandemic should be maintained by governmental support of the local biotechnology sector, collaboration with partners and stakeholders and the expansion of diagnostics to include other diseases of public health importance. © 2021.

Computed tomography (CT) showed a ground glass opacity in both lungs, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital and started to receive oxygen and favipiravir. After that, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he was intubated and ventilated on day 9 of onset, and ECMO was introduced on day 12. Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2 decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO. At this time, the viral load by RT-PCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750. We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset. In conclusion, viral load measurement by RT-PCR may be one of the indicators for promoting the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Sakamaki, Ippei; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Tani, Hideki; Takegoshi, Yusuke; Fukui, Yasutaka; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Wakasugi, Masahiro; Kawagishi, Toshiomi; Kuwano, Hroyuki; Hatano, Tomoya; Shibuya, Tadaki; Okudera, Hiroshi; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",J Infect Chemother,610,1

Application of assessment tools that support a fuller understanding of individual immune system status is next-level care that providers must prepare for and deliver. Commonly used biometric devices already gather data that can be relevant and useful to a phenotypic evaluation of immune function. These variables include pulse rate, blood oxygenation, sleep cycles, respiration rate, heart rate variability, continuous blood glucose monitoring, and ambulatory blood pressure. When coupled with traditional blood analytes and measurements of nutrient status, a more complete picture of immunological function may be revealed. Innovative questionnaires and algorithms can also be helpful additions to a clinician's toolkit.

This gap needs to be addressed since FDAs represent a fast-growing segment of the hospitality sector, which is already considered to be a key food waste generator globally. Even more critically, FDAs have become a prominent source of ordering food during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the growing usage of FDAs warrants an improved understanding of the complexities of consumer behavior toward them, particularly during a health crisis. The present study addresses this need by examining the antecedents of FDA users’ food ordering behavior during the pandemic that can lead to food waste. The study theorizes that hygiene consciousness impacts the enablers and barriers to FDA usage, which, in turn, shape the attitude toward FDAs and the tendency to order more food than required, i.e., shopping routine. The conceptual model, based on behavioral reasoning theory, was tested using data collected from 440 users of FDAs during the pandemic. The results support a positive association of trust and price advantage with attitude, but only of trust with shopping routine.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG, or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate, and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. A review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not unique for SARS-CoV-2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such ""atypical"" serological constellations.

Posttraumatic symptoms, posttraumatic growth, resilience, and coping strategies were assessed. Different population subgroups suffered the impact of lockdown disproportionately. Healthcare workers, females, younger, less educated, and those living alone reported higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Females achieved more posttraumatic growth and were using coping strategies more frequently than men. Men, older, healthcare workers, and those with a partner were more resilient. Interventions need to be developed to target personal resources, protect vulnerable populations, facilitate posttraumatic growth, and ameliorate wellbeing and quality of life.","Kalaitzaki, Argyroula",,610,1

Preventive methods like the use of personal protective equipment, isolation, social distancing, and chemoprophylaxis show limited benefit. Despite standard prophylaxis, many of the HCWs develop COVID-19. Medical ozone therapy has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral effect, and, therefore, it can be explored as prophylaxis for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective controlled cohort study. IV ozonized saline was administered once a day for a total of 4 days in one month in addition to standard prophylaxis for COVID-19 to HCWs in a dedicated COVID hospital. Fresh ozonized saline was prepared for every administration and was given over 1 hour. RESULTS: There were 235 HCWs, 64 received the ozone prophylaxis and 171 did not. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.04) lesser in HCWs that received ozone prophylaxis (4.6%) as compared to those who did not (14.03%). The benefit was seen irrespective of the risk of exposure. In the red zone, 8.69% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive as opposed to 15.3% of those who did not. In the orange zone, 4.34% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive, remarkably lesser than those who did not (20%). In the green zone, none of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive; however, 3.4% of the HCWs who did not receive ozone prophylaxis tested positive. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: IV ozonized saline can be used in addition to the standard prophylactic regimen for the prevention of COVID-19 in HCWs. Prospective larger studies are required to establish the potency of IV ozonized saline as prophylaxis.","Sharma, A; Shah, M; Sane, H; Gokulchandran, N; Paranjape, A; Khubchandani, P; Captain, J; Shirke, S; Kulkarni, P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,610,19

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19. Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19 are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.","Skorburg, Joshua August; Yam, Josephine",AJOB Neurosci,610,17

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. All women aged up to 24 years, who delivered between April 25, 2020, and June 24, 2020, at Women's Hospital, University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil were considered. The ENG-implant or other contraceptive methods were offered prior to hospital discharge. The participants were split into two groups: (1) those who chose the ENG-implant and (2) those that refused the implant. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: 151 women were included, with 76.2% selecting the ENG-implant. The average age was 19.5 years; 73.2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32.5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75.5% were not in full time education. Further, 70.5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89.1% unsatisfied with their previous method that opted for the ENG-implant (P = 0.07).

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to apply infection prevention and control measures, including interpersonal distancing and the use of personal protective equipment. These measures may impact communication and relationship between nurses, patients and caregivers especially in a complex environment, such as a paediatric setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was adopted. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two wards of a maternal and child health hospital in north-east Italy. Data were collected between September and November 2020. Transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen caregivers and 17 nurses were recruited using convenience sampling. Three themes were identified, namely: ""Impact on a trustworthy relationship""; ""Impact on common communication resources""; and ""Strategies to overcome barriers"". Participants agreed Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures impacted key elements of family-centred and compassionate care. Communication strategies and play were critical to overcoming the barriers encountered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 containment measures impact communication and family-centred care in paediatric hospital settings. There is a need for stakeholders to consider family needs in interventions aimed at controlling pandemics' impact. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While COVID-19 pandemic urgency intensified the use of PPE and social distancing, strategies to overcome issues related to family-centred care should be considered in those wards such as oncology or infectious disease paediatric departments where these measures are continuously adopted. Beyond a greater communication awareness, strategies may comprise the implementation of virtual care to guarantee support, continuity of care and information between the child, the healthcare team and the family members that are not admitted to the hospital for safety reasons.","Ferrari, Giada; Dobrina, Raffaella; Buchini, Sara; Rudan, Iva; Schreiber, Silvana; Bicego, Livia",J. clin. nurs,610,27

Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students' perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact&#8482;) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient's bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues.

METHODS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. RESULTS: We analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above four points. CONCLUSION: A clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making in emergency care.

SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. While both ACE inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue ACE2, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) to enable binding to cellular ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serine E2 (PN1) that is upregulated by angiotensin II but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema while plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by PN1 could be a further benefit of MRAs beyond their well established organ protection. We review the evidence that spironolactone may be the preferred RASSi to increase PN1 and decrease TMPRSS2, furin and plasmin activities and thereby to reduce viral cell binding, entry, infectivity and bad outcomes. This hypothesis requires direct investigation.","Wilcox, Christopher S; Pitt, Bertram",J. cardiovasc. pharmacol,610,24

We use the recently developed susceptible-unidentified infected-confirmed (SUC) epidemic model. The unidentified infected population is defined as the infected people who are not yet identified and isolated and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals. It is important to quickly identify and isolate infected people among the unidentified infected population to prevent the infectious disease from spreading. Considering financial incentives as a strategy to control the spread of disease, we predict the effect of the strategy through a mathematical model. Although incentive costs are required, the duration of the disease can be shortened. First, we estimate the unidentified infected cases of COVID-19 in South Korea using the SUC model, and compute two parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the inverse of the average time for confirming infected individuals. We assume that when financial incentives are provided, there are changes in the proportion of confirmed patients out of unidentified infected people in the SUC model. We evaluate the numbers of confirmed and unidentified infected cases with respect to one parameter while fixing the other estimated parameters. We investigate the effect of the incentives on the termination time of the spread of the disease. The larger the incentive budget is, the faster the epidemic will end. Therefore, financial incentives can have the advantage of reducing the total cost required to prevent the spread of the disease, treat confirmed patients, and recover overall economic losses.","Lee, Chaeyoung; Kwak, Soobin; Kim, Junseok",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,23

RECENT FINDINGS: Radiomics involves the high-throughput extraction of radiologic features from clinical imaging, using a panel of sophisticated data-characterization algorithms to make an objective and quantitative determination of diagnoses and clinical characteristics. Radiomics evaluation of existing clinical images would increase their clinical value in many cancer management pathways, including PCa. However, a consensus on the implementation of radiomics has not been established across different sites, delaying its implementation in clinical practice. There are many potential advantages to radiomics. The ability to extract features from existing clinical imaging is one such advantage. A second is the empiric nature of the analysis. The third lies in the application of new technologies, such as machine learning, to be able to evaluate large quantities of data to make clinical conclusions. In this systematic review, we identify publications regarding the role of radiomics in PCa detection and evaluation. Many of these studies noted that radiomics, when incorporated into predictive models, had an advantageous impact on detection of PCa, clinically significant PCa, and extracapsular extension. This may assist in individualized decision making not only for diagnosis of PCa, but also for surveillance and surgical planning. With additional validation in large sample sizes, and randomized, multicenter studies using a consensus driven methodology, radiomics has the potential to alter the landscape of PCa detection and management, necessitating further prospective randomized investigation. SUMMARY: Radiomics is a promising new field, allowing for high-throughput analysis of imaging features for PCa detection and evaluation. These features can be extracted from existing data; therefore, the potential for future study is immense.","Sugano, Dordaneh; Sanford, Daniel; Abreu, Andre; Duddalwar, Vinay; Gill, Inderbir; Cacciamani, Giovanni E",Curr Opin Urol,610,16

A total of 16 studies were included for the review and meta-analysis. There were conflicting findings reported in the rates of severity and mortality in several studies. In a pooled analysis of four studies, there was a statistically non-significant association of ACEI/ARB use with lower odds of developing severe disease vs. non-users [odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41-1.58, I2=50.52, P-value = 0.53). In a pooled analysis of six studies, there was a statistically non-significant association of ACEI/ARB use with lower odds of mortality as compared with non-users (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.53-1.41, I2 = 79.12, P-value = 0.55). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that ACEIs and ARBs should be continued in COVID-19 patients, reinforcing the recommendations made by several medical societies. Additionally, the individual patient factors such as ACE2 polymorphisms which might confer higher risk of adverse outcomes need to be evaluated further.","Grover, Abhinav; Oberoi, Mansi",Eur.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have be constrained by infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. METHODS: The two aiTBS courses consisted of eight daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1,800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). RESULTS: Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. CONCLUSION: The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation, but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Konstantinou, Gerasimos N; Downar, Jonathan; Daskalakis, Zafiris J; Blumberger, Daniel M",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,610,16

This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost. With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual learning environments. Collaboration to identify and implement best practices has the potential to improve education for all learners.","Martinelli, Susan M; Chen, Fei; Isaak, Robert S; Huffmyer, Julie L; Neves, Sara E; Mitchell, John D",,610,23

In older adults and atypical presentations, testing strategies for Covid-19, potential drug interactions of experimental Covid-19 therapies, and ageism are important issues in the course of the disease. Therefore, health-care professionals should be aware of these, and screening policies for Covid-19 should also include atypical presentations with or without classical symptoms of the illness in older adults. Furthermore, evaluation of individuals > 65 years of age from a geriatrician's perspective is very important, because Covid-19 is severe and fatal in seniors.","Isik, Ahmet Turan",Clin Interv Aging,610,3

Thus, anti-inflammatory therapies are attractive agents for potentially combating the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade in these patients. We designed a trial testing tocilizumab versus standard of care intending to improve the outcomes by inhibiting interleukin-6, an important inflammatory mediator in COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial will compare clinical outcomes of tocilizumab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Two of the following four criteria are required for protocol enrolment: D-dimer > 1,000ng/mL; C reactive protein > 5mg/dL, ferritin > 300mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal. The primary objective will be to compare the clinical status on day 15, as measured by a 7-point ordinal scale applied in COVID-19 trials worldwide. The primary endpoint will be assessed by an ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables (age and sex). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The TOCIBRAS protocol was approved by local and central (national) ethical committees in Brazil following current national and international guidelines/directives. Each participating center had the study protocol approved by their institutional review boards before initiating protocol enrolment. The data derived from this trial will be published regardless of the results. If proven active, this strategy could alleviate the consequences of the inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients and improve their clinical outcomes.","Farias, Danielle Leão Cordeiro de; Prats, João; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; Rosa, Regis Goulart; Machado, Flávia Ribeiro; Berwanger, Otávio; Azevedo, Luciano César Pontes de; Lopes, Renato Delascio; Avezum, Álvaro; Kawano-Dourado, Leticia; Damiani, Lucas Petri; Rojas, Salomón Soriano Ordinola; Oliveira, Cleyton Zanardo de; Andrade, Luis Eduardo Coelho; Sandes, Alex Freire; Pintão, Maria Carolina; Castro Júnior, Claudio Galvão de; Scheinberg, Phillip; Veiga, Viviane Cordeiro",Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,610,16

We find that the 4f electrons in CeN are highly itinerant and mixed-valence, showing a prominent quasi-particle peak near the Fermi level. On the contrary, they become well localized and display weak valence fluctuation in CeBi. It means that a 4f itinerant-localized crossover could emerge upon changing the X atom from N to Bi. Moreover, according to the low-energy behaviors of 4f self-energy functions, we could conclude that the 4f electrons in CeX also demonstrate interesting orbital-selective electronic correlations, which are similar to the other cerium-based heavy fermion compounds.","Lu, Haiyan; Huang, Li",,610,2

This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format). Methods: Young adults (n = 82) were recruited from a university introductory course and experienced a 360° video-guided meditation via HMD (VR condition, 3D format). They were also randomly assigned to practice the same meditation either via scripted face-to-face instruction (in vivo [IV] format) or when viewed on a standard laptop display (non-VR condition, 2D format). Positive and negative affect and meditative experience ratings were self-reported and participants' maintenance of focused attention to breathing (i.e., meditation breath attention scores [MBAS]) were recorded during each meditation. Results: Meditating in VR (3D format) was associated with a heightened experience of awe overall. When compared to face-to-face instruction (IV format), VR meditation was rated as less embarrassing but also less enjoyable and more tiring. When compared to 2D format, VR meditations were associated with greater experiences of relaxation, less distractibility from the process of breathing, and less fatigue. No differences were found between VR and non-VR meditation in concentration (MBAS). Baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms were risk factors for experiencing distress while meditating in either (VR and non-VR) instructional format. Of those who reported a preference for one format, approximately half preferred the VR format and approximately half preferred the IV format. Conclusions: Recorded 360° video instruction in meditation viewed with a HMD (i.e., VR/3D format) appears to offer some experiential advantage over instructions given in 2D format and may offer a safe-and for some even preferred-alternative to teaching meditation face-to-face.

This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes. OBJECTIVE: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. METHODS: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. RESULTS: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","Freisthler, Bridget; Gruenewald, Paul J; Tebben, Erin; Shockley McCarthy, Karla; Price Wolf, Jennifer",Soc Sci Med,610,1

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with comorbidities and novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may have poor survival outcomes. However, the risk of these coexisting medical conditions in severe and non-severe cases has not been systematically reported. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to estimate the association of chronic comorbidities in severe and non-severe cases. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Full-text Database (CQVIP) from the inception dates to April 1, 2020, to identify cohort studies assessing comorbidity and risk of adverse outcome. Either a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies involving 3286 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Overall, compared with the patients with non-severe cases, the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases in patients with severe cases were 2.79 (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.66-4.69), 1.64 (95% CI: 2.30-1.08), 1.79 (95% CI: 1.08-2.96), 3.92 (95% CI: 2.45-6.28), and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.12), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the finding that chronic comorbidities may contribute to severe outcome in patients with COVID-19. According to the findings of the present study, old age and 2 or more comorbidities are significantly impactful to COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in China.","Cheng, Sixiang; Zhao, Yuxin; Wang, Fenxiao; Chen, Yan; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Xu, Huilan",Medicine (Baltimore),610,24

The pathogenicity of Candida is witnessed as opportunistic when immune status is compromised. Oral fungal infections are uncommon, but when identified, these infections are associated with greater discomfort and are sometimes destruction of tissues. Cytology and tissue biopsy are helpful in confirming the clinical diagnosis. The management of oral fungal infections must strategically focus on signs, symptoms, and culture reports.

They have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated Spike than the original virus. It is possible that novel variants with abilities of enhanced transmissibility and/or immunoevasion will appear in the near future and perfectly escape from vaccine-elicited immunity. Therefore, the current vaccines may need to be improved to compensate for the viral evolution. For this purpose, it may be beneficial to take advantage of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of CTLs on the viral control in COVID-19, and CTLs target a wide range of proteins involving comparatively conserved non-structural proteins. Here, we identified twenty-two HLA-A*24:02-restricted CTL candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV-2 using computational algorithms, HLA-A*24:02 transgenic mice and the peptide-encapsulated liposomes. We focused on pp1a and HLA-A*24:02 because pp1a is relatively conserved and HLA-A*24:02 is predominant in East Asians such as Japanese. The conservation analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of 7 out of the 22 epitopes were hardly affected by a number of mutations in the Sequence Read Archive database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The information of such conserved epitopes might be useful for designing the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that is universally effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variants by the induction of both anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies and CTLs specific for conserved epitopes.

Three quarters of tourists travel to and from Austria by car and approximately 10% by plane, contributing significantly to the sector's GHG emissions. Should pre-COVID 19 trends continue, an expansion of further distant home markets and an increase of guests arriving by plane can be expected. Low-carbon technologies, intelligent mobility management and societal trends towards shared mobility solutions can improve the environmental performance of tourist travel but will not suffice to achieve the Paris Agreement's climate targets. Further strong incentives will be necessary to avoid these unsustainable forms of mobility and shift trips to climate-friendly modes of transport and the number and distance of tourism trips can be reduced by focussing marketing on closer rather than long-distance home markets and promotion of longer stays. Local tourism stakeholders in Austria can contribute by awareness-raising campaigns and promoting sustainable mobility solutions at the destinations. Politics need enable this shift by setting framework conditions such as full incorporation of climate costs for all modes of travel. Management implications: To reduce travel related GHG emissions significantly, tourism cannot only rely on technological solutions (electric vehicles) and trends (sharing) but must also initiate a shift from air and private road transport to rail and public transport. This requires measures that offer incentives (fast and direct train and bus connections, climate-friendly local transport, luggage services, attractive all-in packages, etc.), but also a focus on closer rather than long-distance home markets, promotion of longer stays and awareness-raising campaigns for local stakeholders and tourists. The awareness created by the COVID-19 and climate crises can be seen as an opportunity to take these measures.","Gühnemann, Astrid Kurzweil Agnes Mailer Markus",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,610,23

There is controversy about whether their immunosuppressive status is a risk factor or a protective factor for developing severe disease. We report herein the clinical outcome of three family members that had COVID-19 infection, presenting with and without different risk factors that have been described in more severe disease. Paradoxically, the patient with more risks of developing a severe disease, a 64-year-old woman, 2-years liver transplant recipient under treatment with tacrolimus, presented a similar outcome compared to the two other members of the family. She showed shorter hospitalization time, similar clinical outcome with fewer oxygen needs. The present clinical observation raises the question about the possible beneficial effect of tacrolimus in patients with COVID-19. Indeed, tacrolimus (FK-506) have an inhibitory effect on human coronaviruses by: 1) an antiviral effect by binding to the FK-506-binding proteins (FKBP) with a subsequent inhibition of their peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which seems to be important for the coronavirus life cycle; and 2) regulating the immune response by the inhibition of the activity of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) required for immunosuppression. The present observation states that liver recipients' patients with COVID-19 may not have worse outcomes when compared with other patients that have COVID-19 risk factors and puts in evidence the two mechanisms related to tacrolimus.","García-Juárez, I; Campos-Murguía, A; Tovar-Méndez, V H; Gabutti, A; Ruiz, I",Rev Gastroenterol Mex,610,29

Emergency departments (EDs) are often the first point of care for children experiencing mental health emergencies, particularly when other services are inaccessible or unavailable (3). During March 29-April 25, 2020, when widespread shelter-in-place orders were in effect, ED visits for persons of all ages declined 42% compared with the same period in 2019; during this time, ED visits for injury and non-COVID-19-related diagnoses decreased, while ED visits for psychosocial factors increased (4). To assess changes in mental health-related ED visits among U.S. children aged <18 years, data from CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) from January 1 through October 17, 2020, were compared with those collected during the same period in 2019. During weeks 1-11 (January 1-March 15, 2020), the average reported number of children's mental health-related ED visits overall was higher in 2020 than in 2019, whereas the proportion of children's mental health-related visits was similar. Beginning in week 12 (March 16) the number of mental health-related ED visits among children decreased 43% concurrent with the widespread implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures; simultaneously, the proportion of mental health-related ED visits increased sharply beginning in mid-March 2020 (week 12) and continued into October (week 42) with increases of 24% among children aged 5-11 years and 31% among adolescents aged 12-17 years, compared with the same period in 2019. The increased proportion of children's mental health-related ED visits during March-October 2020 might be artefactually inflated as a consequence of the substantial decrease in overall ED visits during the same period and variation in the number of EDs reporting to NSSP. However, these findings provide initial insight into children's mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of continued monitoring of children's mental health throughout the pandemic, ensuring access to care during public health crises, and improving healthy coping strategies and resiliency among children and families.","Leeb, Rebecca T; Bitsko, Rebecca H; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Martinez, Pedro; Njai, Rashid; Holland, Kristin M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,610,24

OBJECTIVE: With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether recent historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. METHODS: Weekly surveillance data reported by the World Health Organization from January 2017 to December 2019 for influenza and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020, for COVID-19 were used to assess seasonal and temporal trends for influenza and COVID-19 cases across the seven World Bank regions. RESULTS: In regions with more pronounced influenza seasonality, COVID-19 epidemics have largely followed trends similar to those seen for influenza from 2017 to 2019. COVID-19 epidemics in countries across Europe, Central Asia, and North America have been marked by a first peak during the spring, followed by significant reductions in COVID-19 cases in the summer months and a second wave in the fall. In Latin America and the Caribbean, COVID-19 epidemics in several countries peaked in the summer, corresponding to months with the highest influenza activity in the region. Countries from regions with less pronounced influenza activity, including South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, showed more heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemics seen to date. However, similarities in COVID-19 and influenza trends were evident within select countries irrespective of region. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological consistency in COVID-19 trends seen to date with influenza trends suggests the potential for shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of nonpharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information.","Baral, Stefan David; Rucinski, Katherine Blair; Twahirwa Rwema, Jean Olivier; Rao, Amrita; Prata Menezes, Neia; Diouf, Daouda; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy; Mishra, Sharmistha",JMIR Public Health Surveill,610,26

Further, understanding the challenges faced by teachers empowers the profession to make agricultural education more resilient to broader, social forces in the future. In this study, a national sample of agriculture teachers were asked to identify the three most pressing challenges they experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using qualitative research methods, eight challenge themes emerged: (a) Communication, (b) FFA (i.e., student leadership organization previously named the ?Future Farmers of America?), (c) Instructional Quality, (d) Program Facilities and Activities, (e) Supervised Agricultural Experiences (SAE), (f) Student Motivation, (g) Technology and the Internet, and (h) Work-Life Balance. Using quasi-statistical methods, the most commonly reported challenges were identified - Instructional Quality, FFA, and Student Motivation. Analysis of all the challenges suggested permeation across each aspect of the three-component model of agricultural education. Furthermore, many challenges appeared to be related to each other. Finally, analysis of the results illuminated responding teachers, and their students, each experienced the challenges brought about by COVID-19 differently, including evidence of exacerbated educational inequality for students from lower income households.

We evaluate our video-based keystroke inference framework using different experimental settings and parameters, including different webcams, video resolutions, keyboards, clothing, and backgrounds. Our relatively high keystroke inference accuracies under commonly occurring and realistic settings highlight the need for awareness and countermeasures against such attacks.

The main objective is to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco and to estimate the time needed for its disappearance. For these reasons, we have highlighted the role of mathematical models in understanding the transmission chain of this virus as well as its future evolution. Then we used the SIR epidemiological model, which proves to be well suited to address this issue. It shows that identification of the key parameters of this pandemic, such as the probability of transmission, should help to adequately explain its behaviour and make it easier to predict its progress. As a result, the measures and actions taken by the public authorities in Morocco allowed to record lower number of virus reproduction than many countries. So, in the case of Morocco, we were able to predict that the Covid-19 pandemic should disappear in a shorter time and without registering a larger number of infected individuals compared to other countries.","Lotfi, Bilal; Lotfi, Ismail; Aoun, Oussama",Epidemiol.

In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis.","Llau, J V; Ferrandis, R; Sierra, P; Hidalgo, F; Cassinello, C; Gómez-Luque, A; Quintana, M; Amezaga, R; Gero, M; Serrano, A; Marcos, P",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,610,6

We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D3, vitamin D2, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 25·0-49·9 nmol/L vs 50·0-74·9 nmol/L vs >75·0 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (&#8804;12 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<1·00 years vs 1·00-15·99 years vs 16·00-64·99 years vs &#8805;65·00 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633. FINDINGS: We identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (98·1%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [61·3%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [62·3%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 0·92 (95% CI 0·86-0·99; 37 studies; I2=35·6%, pheterogeneity=0·018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 0·78 [95% CI 0·65-0·94]; 19 studies; I2=53·5%, pheterogeneity=0·003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; ten studies; I2=31·2%, pheterogeneity=0·16), for a duration of 12 months or less (0·82 [0·72-0·93]; 29 studies; I2=38·1%, pheterogeneity=0·021), and to participants aged 1·00-15·99 years at enrolment (0·71 [0·57-0·90]; 15 studies; I2=46·0%, pheterogeneity=0·027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (0·97 [0·86-1·07]; 36 studies; I2=0·0%, pheterogeneity=0·99). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. INTERPRETATION: Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 1·00-15·99 years. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires further investigation.

Data are drawn from a UK-wide online survey of health and social care workers, completed in May to July 2020. The survey received 3,425 responses of which 2,541 were analysed; free-text comments were categorised. One question asked specifically: 'Do you think the ""Clap for Carers"" was a helpful response from the public?', and 815 comments were provided. Responses were extracted from these 815 free-text comments and categorised as follows: unequivocally Yes, predominantly Yes, mixed feelings, predominantly No and unequivocally No. Most comments revealed mixed feelings about the helpfulness of Clapping with only a minority being entirely supportive. The free-text comments offer some explanations for these views with many feeling that Clapping distracted from the severity of the pandemic and the inadequate resources. The free-text comments reveal workforce concerns that the support demonstrated for the frontline workforce in Clapping might be transitory and that it may not translate into workforce improvements and political commitment to further funding of health and social care. Some saw the value of Clapping as illustrative of community cohesion. There was little mention of Clapping for heroes, and where it was the notion of heroism was rejected. The demonstration of public support in Clapping for Carers may have directly benefitted the public, but only indirectly the workforce. Future recruitment data may help discern if public support has translated into a desire to join the workforce.","Manthorpe, Jill; Iliffe, Steve; Gillen, Patricia; Moriarty, John; Mallett, John; Schroder, Heike; Currie, Denise; Ravalier, Jermaine; McFadden, Paula",Heal. soc. care community,610,25

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT scans on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the manual positioning (MP group) for the initial scan and an AI-based automatic positioning method (AP group) for the follow-up scan. Radiation dose, patient positioning time, and off-center distance of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP 1.56 cm ± 0.83 vs. MP 4.05 cm ± 2.40, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP 99% vs. MP 92%), resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP 6.1 mSv ± 1.3 vs. MP 7.3 mSv ± 1.2, p < 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas. CONCLUSION: The AI-based automatic positioning and centering in CT imaging is a promising new technique for reducing radiation dose and optimizing imaging workflow and image quality in imaging the chest. KEY POINTS: â¢ The AI-based automatic positioning (AP) operation was successful for all patients in our study. â¢ AP method reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the manual positioning (MP). â¢ AP method had less patient off-center distance and higher proportion of positioning accuracy than MP method, resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae.","Gang, Yadong; Chen, Xiongfeng; Li, Huan; Wang, Hanlun; Li, Jianying; Guo, Ying; Zeng, Junjie; Hu, Qiang; Hu, Jinxiang; Xu, Haibo",Eur. radiol,610,1

This crisis offers us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of emission reductions in terms of air quality. Here we use the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) in combination with surface observations to study the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on air quality in southern California. Based on activity level statistics and satellite observations, we estimate the sectoral emission changes during the lockdown. Due to the reduced emissions, the population-weighted concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decrease by 15 % in southern California. The emission reductions contribute 68 % of the PM2.5 concentration decrease before and after the lockdown, while meteorology variations contribute the remaining 32 %. Among all chemical compositions, the PM2.5 concentration decrease due to emission reductions is dominated by nitrate and primary components. For O3 concentrations, the emission reductions cause a decrease in rural areas but an increase in urban areas;the increase can be offset by a 70 % emission reduction in anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These findings suggest that a strengthened control on primary PM2.5 emissions and a well-balanced control on nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions are needed to effectively and sustainably alleviate PM2.5 and O3 pollution in southern California.","Jiang, Zhe Shi Hongrong Zhao Bin Gu Yu Zhu Yifang Miyazaki Kazuyuki Lu Xin Zhang Yuqiang Bowman Kevin W.; Sekiya, Takashi Kuo-Nan Liou",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,610,1

OBJECTIVE: This single centre cross-section study aimed to grade the severity of pneumonia by bed-side lung ultrasound (LUS). METHODS: A scoring system discriminates 5 levels of lung opacities: A-lines (0 points),&#8805;3 B-Line (1 point), coalescent B-Lines (2 points), marked pleural disruptions (3 points), consolidations (4 points). LUS (convex 1-5âMHz probe) was performed at 6 defined regions for each hemithorax either in supine or prone position. A lung aeration score (LAS, maximum 4 points) was allocated for each patient by calculating the arithmetic mean of the examined lung areas. Score levels were correlated with ventilation parameters and laboratory markers. RESULTS: LAS of 20 patients with ARDS reached from 2.58 to 3.83 and was highest in the lateral right lobe (Mean 3.67). Ferritin levels (Mean 1885µg/l; râ=â0.467; pâ=â0.051) showed moderate correlation in spearman roh calculation. PaCO2 level (Mean 46.75 mmHg; râ=â0.632; pâ=â0.005) correlated significantly with LAS, while duration of ventilation, Horovitz-Index, CRP, LDH and IL-6 did not. CONCUSIONS: The proposed LAS describes severity of lung opacities in COVID-19 patients and correlates with CO2 retention in patients with ARDS.","Peschel, G; Jung, E M; Fisser, C; Putz, F J; Wertheimer, T; Sinner, B; Lunz, D; Jung, F; Müller, M",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,610,1

No clean-up procedure was needed. The method was validated according to the current European guidelines for pesticide residue analysis in food and feed and linearity, limits of detection and quantification, matrix effects, trueness and precision were assessed. For plant-based milk, wine and beer samples, 10, 11 and 12 analytes, respectively, out of 14 were fully validated at 10 µg kg-1, the lowest spike level tested. The matrix effect was negative in most of the cases, showing for some compounds, such as HEPA, up to 80% suppression when compared to the response from standards in solvent. The use of isotopically labelled internal standards is required for the optimal quantification, as it compensates for high and varying matrix effects and also for recovery losses during extraction.","Lopez, Sonia Herrera; Dias, Jonatan; Mol, Hans; de Kok, André",J Chromatogr A,610,16

We determined whether COVID-19 has resulted in delays in stroke presentation and affected the delivery of acute stroke services in a comprehensive stroke center in Hong Kong. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke admitted via the acute stroke pathway of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, during the first 60 days since the first diagnosed COVID-19 case in Hong Kong (COVID-19: January 23, 2020-March 24, 2020). We compared the stroke onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door) time and timings of inpatient stroke pathways with patients admitted during the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19: January 23, 2019-March 24, 2019). RESULTS: Seventy-three patients in COVID-19 were compared with 89 patients in pre-COVID-19. There were no significant differences in age, sex, vascular risk factors, nor stroke severity between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The median stroke onset-to-door time was &#8776;1-hour longer in COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 (154 versus 95 minutes, P=0.12), and the proportion of individuals with onset-to-door time within 4.5 hours was significantly lower (55% versus 72%, P=0.024). Significantly fewer cases of transient ischemic attack presented to the hospital during COVID-19 (4% versus 16%, P=0.016), despite no increase in referrals to the transient ischemic attack clinic. Inpatient stroke pathways and treatment time metrics nevertheless did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: During the early containment phase of COVID-19, we noted a prolongation in stroke onset to hospital arrival time and a significant reduction in individuals arriving at the hospital within 4.5 hours and presenting with transient ischemic attack. Public education about stroke should continue to be reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teo, Kay-Cheong; Leung, William C Y; Wong, Yuen-Kwun; Liu, Roxanna K C; Chan, Anna H Y; Choi, Olivia M Y; Kwok, Wing-Man; Leung, Kung-Ki; Tse, Man-Yu; Cheung, Raymond T F; Tsang, Anderson Chun-On; Lau, Kui Kai",Stroke,610,26

WHO declared a state of pandemic (11th March, 2020), which has caused more than 1 million infected and more than 110,000 deaths; it was observed that up to 29% of those infected were health care personnel. The main route of transmission of SARS-CoV2 is through respiratory secretions and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and material. The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all. Based on the different healthcare systems, human resources, infrastructure and medical emergencies that will warrant the conduct of clinical neurophysiology studies and the lack of a guide for the management of the situation, it was decided by an expert task force of the Latin American Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to carry out these guidelines for the protection of patient and healthcare professionals conducting clinical neurophysiological studies.","San-Juan, Daniel; Jiménez, Christian Ramos; Camilli, Cecilia Ximénez; de la Cruz Reyes, Luis Adrián; Galindo, Enya Gabriela Aguirre; Burbano, Gustavo Eduardo Ramos; Penela, Maria Magdalena; Perassolo, Monica Beatriz; Valdéz, Armando Tello; Godoy, Jorge Gutierrez; Moreira, Ana Lucila; Kimaid, Paulo Andre Teixeira",Clin Neurophysiol,610,16

Here, we provide a detailed evaluation of the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain in mice. We demonstrate that a single dose of these vaccines induces strong type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, as well as long-lived plasma and memory B cell responses. Additionally, we detect robust and sustained neutralizing antibody responses and the antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines do not show antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook interviews with 44 healthcare professionals with a background in informatics from six hospitals internationally. Interviews were informed by a topic guide and were conducted via videoconferencing software. Thematic analysis was employed to develop a coding framework and identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Three themes and six sub-themes were identified. HITs were employed to manage time and resources during a surge in patient numbers through fast-tracked governance procedures, and the creation of real-time bed capacity tracking within electronic health records. Improving the integration of different hospital systems was identified as important across sites. The use of hard-stop alerts and order sets were perceived as being effective at helping to respond to potential medication shortages and selecting available drug treatments. Utilizing information from multiple data sources to develop alerts facilitated treatment. Finally, the upscaling/optimization of telehealth and remote working capabilities was used to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection within hospitals. DISCUSSION: A number of the HIT-related changes implemented at these sites were perceived to have facilitated more effective patient treatment and management of resources. Informaticians generally felt more valued by hospital management as a result. CONCLUSIONS: Improving integration between data systems, utilizing specialized alerts, and expanding telehealth represent strategies that hospitals should consider when using HIT for delivering hospital care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malden, Stephen; Heeney, Catherine; Bates, David W; Sheikh, Aziz",J. am. med. inform. assoc,610,14

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ß=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, YuanYuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Peng, Ke; Li, Dan; Ou, Jianjun; Wilson, Amanda; Wang, Nan; Si, Lei; Chen, Runsen",Psychosom. med,610,11

This psychological impact might vary in different countries, and thus we compared the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among young people in the United Kingdom (UK) and China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data of this study came from two sources. One source was the first wave of COVID-19 study in Understanding Society, a special wave of the UK household longitudinal study, which provided the high-quality, national-wide representative panel data. The sample comprised 1054 young people. The other source was an online survey on the mental health of 1033 young people from Shanghai, a highly developed area in China. The questionnaire included questions on the prevalence of common mental disorders (cut-off score &#8805; 4), loneliness and potential PTSS (cut-off &#8805; 33). Univariable analyses were conducted to test the differences in the self-reported prevalence of psychological distress and loneliness between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were run to explore the predictors of psychological distress and loneliness among all the young people from England and Shanghai.. RESULTS: Among the samples with self-reported psychological distress, the UK sample accounted for 34.4% (n=1054) and the Chinese sample accounted for 14.1%(n=1033). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Additionally, 57.1% of people in the UK and 46.7% in China reported that they sometimes or often felt lonely, of which the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Regression analysis of the entire samples showed that nationality, gender, psychotherapy and loneliness were significant predictors of 12-item General Health Questionnaire scores, while the variables of age and living alone were not. Significant predictors of self-reported loneliness were the nationality, gender, age, living alone and psychotherapy. In China, 123 (12.3%) young people, 49 men (11.3%) and 74 women (13.0%), met the criteria of PTSS symptoms (cut-off scores &#8805; 33). These scores were only collected in China. CONCLUSION: This evidence suggests that mental health and loneliness reported by young people were lower in China than that in the UK during the studied period. More research is needed to understand these differences. If the differential negative psychological impacts are confirmed, country-specific measures of prevention and intervention should be adopted to improve the mental health of young people under the ongoing impact of the pandemic.","Liu, Ming-Bo; Dufour, Géraldine; Sun, Zhuo-Er; Galante, Julieta; Xing, Chen-Qi; Zhan, Jing-Ye; Wu, Li-Li",Chin. j. traumatol,610,10

DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional research study involving 736 nurses working in COVID-19 designated hospitals and health units in Region 8, Philippines. Four structured self-report scales were used, including the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and the single-item measure for perceived health. RESULTS: The prevalence of coronaphobia was 54.76% (n = 402): 37.04% (n = 130) in hospital nurses and 70.91% (n = 273) in public health nurses. Additionally, nurses' gender (ß = 0.148, p < .001), marital status (ß = 0.124, p < .001), job status (ß = 0.138, p < .001), and personal resilience (ß = -0.167, p = .002) were identified as predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. A small proportion of nurses were willing (19.94%, n = 70) and fully prepared (9.40%, n = 33) to manage and care for coronavirus patients. CONCLUSION: Coronaphobia is prevalent among frontline Filipino nurses, particularly among public health nurses. Interventions to address coronaphobia among frontline nurses in the hospital and community should consider the predictors identified. By increasing personal resilience in nurses through theoretically driven intervention, coronaphobia may be alleviated.","Labrague, Leodoro J; De Los Santos, Janet Alexis A",Public health nurs,610,7

But the new viral variants can reduce the efficacy of the currently available antibodies, as well as diminish the vaccine induced immunity. Here, we demonstrate how the microscopic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, can be modulated by the mutations present in the spike proteins of the variants currently circulating in the world population. We show that the dynamical perturbation in the antibody structure can be diverse, depending both on the nature of the antibody and on the location of the mutation. The correlated motion between the antibody and the receptor binding domain (RBD) can also be changed, altering the binding affinity. By constructing a protein graph connectivity network, we could delineate the mutant induced modifications in the allosteric information flow pathway through the antibody, and observed the presence of both localized and long distance effects. We identified a loop consisting of residues 470-490 in the RBD which works like an anchor preventing the detachment of the antibodies, and individual mutations in that region can significantly affect the antibody binding propensity. Our study provides fundamental and atomistically detailed insight on how virus neutralization by monoclonal antibody can be impacted by the mutations in the epitope, and can potentially facilitate the rational design of monoclonal antibodies, effective against the new variants of the novel coronavirus.","Ray, Dhiman; Quijano, Riley Nicolas; Andricioaei, Ioan",,610,24

Classroom Action Research (CAR) was used in this study. The research subjects consisted of 32 Grade 10 Mining Geology students of SMK Negeri 1 Binuang in the 2019/2020 academic year. Data analysis was carried out using quantitative descriptive analysis, namely by observing the research data which was then followed by synthesis using a literature review. From the results of research during the Pre-Cycle, it was known that the number of students who met the Minimum Completeness Criteria (KKM) was 18.75%, while in Cycle I it is 84.374%, and Cycle II was 77.78%. These results indicated that there was an increase from Pre-Cycle to Cycle I, but there was a decrease in Cycle I to Cycle II. The results obtained in this CAR showed that blended learning integrated fieldwork has the potential to be effective as a learning model for the Fundamentals of Geology during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Some things that need to be considered so that blended learning integrated fieldwork can be effective in learning is by paying attention to scientific steps during learning, choosing fieldwork locations that are accessible to accessibility and there are communication and internet signals, as well as intensive guidance from the teacher.

As was demonstrated during Ebola, preparedness is key to limiting a health crisis' spread and impact on health systems and ensuring continued care for vulnerable populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess COVID-19 preparedness and inform interventions to ensure continuity of HIV services at health facilities (HFs) and community service points (CSPs), we conducted site readiness assessments in Freetown, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. Data were collected at nine high-volume HIV HFs and seven CSPs in April 2020, a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CSPs comprised three community drop-in centers providing HIV counseling and testing services as well as HIV prevention services (e.g., condoms and lubricants) for key and priority populations and four community-based support groups serving PLHIV. At the time of assessment, CSPs did not provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) but were considered potential sites for expansion of differentiated service delivery (DSD)-a client-centered approach to HIV care-in the context of COVID-19. Overall, 5/9 HFs had trained staff on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most had access to masks (5/9) and gloves (7/9) for management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 4/9 HFs had triage procedures for isolation of suspected cases. Conversely, few CSPs had access to masks (2/7) or gloves (2/7) and no staff were trained on PPE use or COVID-19 transmission. 7/9 HFs had adequate ART stock for multi-month dispensing though few had procedures for (3/9) or had trained staff in providing DSD (2/9). Among CSPs where measures were applicable, 2/4 had procedures for DSD, 1/3 had staff trained on DSD and none had adequate ART stock. Identification of gaps in COVID-19 preparedness is a critical step in providing support for infection control and modified service delivery. Findings from this assessment highlight gaps in COVID-19 preparedness measures at sites supporting PLHIV in Sierra Leone and indicate CSPs may require intensive supervision and training to ensure HIV services are uninterrupted while minimizing COVID-19 risk, especially if used as sites to scale up DSD.","Parmley, Lauren E; Hartsough, Kieran; Eleeza, Oliver; Bertin, Akopon; Sesay, Bockarie; Njenga, Amon; Toure, Mame; Egesimba, Ginika; Bah, Haja; Bayoh, Alex; Yakubu, Abdulraheem; Morrison, Ellen A B; Michaels-Strasser, Susan",PLoS One,610,5

The characteristics of this virus, as well as its short- and long-term implications, are not yet well understood. The objective of the current paper was to provide a critical review of the emerging literature on COVID-19 and its implications for neurological, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive functioning. METHOD: A critical review of recently published empirical research, case studies, and reviews pertaining to central nervous system (CNS) complications of COVID-19 was conducted by searching PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, and bioRxiv. RESULTS: After considering the available literature, areas thought to be most pertinent to clinical and research neuropsychologists, including CNS manifestations, neurologic symptoms/syndromes, neuroimaging, and potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection, were reviewed. CONCLUSION: Once thought to be merely a respiratory virus, the scientific and medical communities have realized COVID-19 to have broader effects on renal, vascular, and neurological body systems. The question of cognitive deficits is not yet well studied, but neuropsychologists will undoubtedly play an important role in the years to come.","Hewitt, Kelsey C; Marra, David E; Block, Cady; Cysique, Lucette A; Drane, Daniel L; Haddad, Michelle M; Lojek, Emilia; McDonald, Carrie R; Reyes, Anny; Eversole, Kara; Bowers, Dawn",J Int Neuropsychol Soc,610,14

Based on a caseness measure, the prevalence of psychological distress increased from 18.5% to 27.7% between the 2019 Wave and April 2020 with some reversion to earlier levels in subsequent months. Also, there was a systematic increase in total inequality in the Likert GHQ-12 score. However, measures of relative socioeconomic inequality have not increased. A Shapley-Shorrocks decomposition analysis shows that during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020) other socioeconomic factors declined in their share of socioeconomic inequality, while age and gender account for a larger share. The most notable increase is evident for younger women. The contribution of working in an industry related to the COVID-19 response played a small role at Wave 9 and the Interim 2019 Wave, but more than tripled its share in April 2020. As the first wave of COVID-19 progressed, the contribution of demographics declined from their peak level in April and chronic health conditions, housing conditions, and neighbourhood characteristics increased their contributions to socioeconomic inequality.","Davillas, Apostolos; Jones, Andrew M",Health Econ,610,16

The assumption is that if professionals together from different disciplines share their knowledge and skills this will lead to better outcomes for children and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the ""normal practice"" of such arrangements. This research explored how the pandemic's disruption led to new ways of communicating and professional behaviour, while exploring the potential for longer-term impact in England and other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approach Case studies were conducted in 2020 in five English local authorities to explore how schools worked with Children's Social Care and other professionals during the COVID-19 period. It was supplemented by a survey of schools and discussions with and reflections from those with relevant experience in five other countries. Findings Many schools played an extended role in supporting vulnerable and ""in need"" families during this period. Children's Social Care recognised their contributions and the improved communication achieved, although schools were divided over whether relationships had improved. Most communication and meetings were online;while benefits were noted there were concerns for families who were digitally disadvantaged. Originality/value The work provides a contemporary picture of multiagency work during the 2020 pandemic and identifies factors which may shape this work in the future in England and internationally.","Baginsky, M.; Manthorpe, J.",Journal of Integrated Care,610,16

Cells in the oral cavity express viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 that allows viral replication and may cause tissue inflammation and destruction. Recent studies have reported that Covid-19 patients present oral manifestations with multiple clinical aspects. In this review, we aim to summarise main signs and symptoms of Covid-19 in the oral cavity, its possible association with oral diseases, and the plausible underlying mechanisms of hyperinflammation reflecting crosstalk between Covid-19 and oral diseases. Ulcers, blisters, necrotising gingivitis, opportunistic coinfections, salivary gland alterations, white and erythematous plaques and gustatory dysfunction were the most reported clinical oral manifestations in patients with Covid-19. In general, the lesions appear concomitant with the loss of smell and taste. Multiple reports show evidences of necrotic/ulcerative gingiva, oral blisters and hypergrowth of opportunistic oral pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits tropism for endothelial cells and Covid-19-mediated endotheliitis can not only promote inflammation in oral tissues but can also facilitate virus spread. In addition, elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators in patients with Covid-19 and oral infectious disease can impair tissue homeostasis and cause delayed disease resolution. This suggests potential crosstalk of immune-mediated pathways underlying pathogenesis. Interestingly, few reports suggest recurrent herpetic lesions and higher bacterial growth in Covid-19 subjects, indicating SARS-CoV-2 and oral virus/bacteria interaction. Larger cohort studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive subjects will reveal oral manifestation of the virus on oral health and its role in exacerbating oral infection.","Brandini, Daniela A; Takamiya, Aline S; Thakkar, Pari; Schaller, Samantha; Rahat, Rani; Naqvi, Afsar R",Rev. med. virol,610,26

We analyzed the actions taken by city halls of the 52 Brazilian municipalities at least thirty days since the first confirmed case of COVID-19. We used a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to identify the combinations of contextual factors and public actions that reduced COVID-19 transmission during the critical initial stage. The empirical results show three main paths to guide policy-making: (1) a plural collaboration path involving public and private sectors, operating in a fragile health system; (2) a public action path providing aid programs through intense collaboration inside public bureaucracy; and (3) a resource-based path relying on a well-structured health system.","Ito, Nobuiuki Costa; Pongeluppe, Leandro Simões",Rev. adm. pública (Online),610,16

However, its integration into curricula varies widely. Our study will help medical colleges develop, implement and evaluate their EBM courses. We assessed the effectiveness of workshops in improving critical appraisal skills among medical students. METHODS: A before-and-after study design without a control group was used. A 5-week short EBM module including lectures, workshops, and online search sessions was conducted with 52 fourth-year medical students during their primary healthcare course at the College of Medicine, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 20, SPSS Inc., Chicago, US). Parametric tests as well as Student's paired t-test for pre- and post-test comparisons were used. RESULTS: Forty-nine (49) participants completed the pre- and post-training Fresno tests, and 44.9% of the participants had a GPA of 4.0 or higher. The mean Fresno test score increased from 45.63 (SD 21.89) on the pre-test to 64.49 (SD 33.31) on the post-test, with significant improvements in the following items: search strategies, relevance, internal validity, magnitude and significance of results, statistical values of diagnosis studies (sensitivity, specificity, and LR), statistical values of therapy studies (ARR, RRR, and NNT), and best study design for diagnosis and prognosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study supports that a short course in EBM that is incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum, especially in the clinical years, might be effective in improving medical students' knowledge and skills in EBM. However, prospective studies are necessary to assess the long-term impact of these interventions and ultimately their effectiveness for clinical decision making.","Al Shahrani, Abeer Salem",BMC Med Educ,610,1

Newly developed vaccines promise relief to people who live in high-income countries, although vaccines and expensive new treatments are unlikely to arrive in time to help people who live in low-and middle-income countries. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.69). These findings were in general agreement with other published studies. Additional observational studies and clinical trials are needed to convincingly show that in-hospital treatment with statins, ACEIs/ARBs, and especially their combination saves lives.","Byttebier, Geert; Belmans, Luc; Alexander, Myriam; Saxberg, Bo E H; De Spiegeleer, Bart; De Spiegeleer, Anton; Devreker, Nick; Van Praet, Jens T; Vanhove, Karolien; Reybrouck, Reinhilde; Wynendaele, Evelien; Fedson, David S",Hum Vaccin Immunother,610,24

However, due to coronavirus disease 2019, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted, with uncertain implications for the programmes. METHODS: We use mathematical modelling to explore how postponement of MDA and various mitigation strategies affect achievement of the EPHP goal for Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. RESULTS: For both S. mansoni and S. haematobium in moderate- and some high-prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to 2 y. In some high-prevalence settings, EPHP is not achievable with current strategies and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and the stage of the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Schistosomiasis MDA programmes in medium- and high-prevalence areas should restart as soon as is feasible and mitigation strategies may be required in some settings.","Kura, Klodeta; Ayabina, Diepreye; Toor, Jaspreet; Hollingsworth, T Deirdre; Anderson, Roy M",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,610,1

Morganella morganii which belongs to the Proteae tribe of the Enterobacteriaceae family is a Gram-negative bacillus. Gram-negative bacteria are the key problematic agents among the human population in overexpressing resistance against ß-lactam antibiotics. These ß-lactam antibiotics being experimentally well studied still lack the key information and mechanism for their resistance. The structural information of the ampC protein is unknown and poorly studied; hence, it is the need of the hour to find effective inhibitors against it. In our study, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ampC protein from Morganella morganii was performed using a comparative modelling approach. The predicted structure was energetically stabilized and functional conformations were mapped through 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation runs. Also, Ramachandran plot shows the model to be stereo-chemically stable with most residues found under core allowed regions. Drug screening with several experimentally tested inhibitors was then confirmed to check the activity against ampC protein using an AutoDock tool. The results suggested OncoglabrinolC molecule as the best inhibitor (out of 21 drug molecules) with a binding affinity of - 11.44 kcal/mol. Anti-bacterial/anti-parasitic inhibitors have not only been used against bacterial infections, but later reports have also shown them to work against deadly viruses such as SARS-CoV2. This key structural and inhibitory information is certain to help in the discovery of specific and potent substitute therapeutic drugs and the development of experimental procedures against human infection.","Alazmi, Meshari",J Mol Model,610,26

METHODS: Ten patients, part of an ongoing study of patients admitted in three centres in Lagos, Nigeria, with COVID-19 diagnosed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology were retrospectively studied for cardiac manifestations. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 52.5 ± 18.79 years (with a minimum of 17 years and maximum of 79 years). Six patients were female and four were male. Hypertension was seen in 70%, diabetes in 50% and obesity in 60% of patients. All had elevated inflammatory markers. Only four patients had bilateral pneumonia. The rest had only cardiac manifestations. Six patients presented with de novo heart failure and one had decompensated heart failure. A set of three patients had individually fulminant myocarditis, probable pulmonary embolism and stress cardiomyopathy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that co-morbidities are common in patients with COVID-19 and cardiac complications.

This paper compares three survey instruments for the assessment of life in pregnancy/postpartum and investigates the effects of the timing of early-life stress for emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBD) of offspring during mid/late childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Observational data were obtained from the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ), which included 4811 pregnancies in two Czech metropolitan areas. We used data collected between 1991 and 2010 at 20 weeks of pregnancy (T1), after delivery (T2), at 6 months postpartum (T3), and at child's age of 7 years (T4), 11 years (T5), 15 years (T6), and 18 years (T7). Life stress was assessed with (1) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), (2) a stressful life events (SLE) count based on 42-item inventory, and (3) the SLE measure weighted by perceived stressfulness (PS). Each stress measure was administered at T1, T2, and T3. Child's EBD were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at T4, T5, T6, and T7. RESULTS: Each stress measure independently predicted long-term EBD. The best data fit was obtained in a model combining EPDS and SLE. Effect sizes for SLEs decreased between the first half of pregnancy and postpartum, while the effect of EPDS increased. DISCUSSION: SLE-based methods capture an aspect of perinatal stress not adequately assessed by EPDS. Combination of psychological distress measures and SLE-based measures is optimal in predicting EBD of the child. Stress measures based on SLE are suitable for early pregnancy, while self-reports of depressive symptoms may perform better in postpartum.","Stepáníková, Irena; Baker, Elizabeth; Oates, Gabriela; Bienertova-Vasku, Julie; Klánová, Jana",Matern. child health j,610,10

Participants were randomised in a 2 × 2 between-subjects design to test the effects of two interventions on the ED of shopping basket selections: labelling lower-ED products as healthier choices and increasing the relative availability of lower-ED products within a range (referred to as proportion). Labelling of lower-ED products resulted in a small but significant decrease (-4.2 kcal/100 g, 95% CIs -7.8 to -0.6) in the ED of the shopping basket. Increasing the proportion of lower-ED products significantly decreased the ED of the shopping basket (-17 kcal/100 g, 95% CIs -21 to -14). There was no evidence that the effect of either intervention was moderated by SEP. Thus, both types of intervention decreased the ED of foods selected in an online experimental supermarket.

In an attempt to reduce admissions and enable safe early discharge, a COVID virtual ward (CVW) care pathway has been supported by NHS England. This includes discharging people who meet objective criteria based on acuity scores and oxygen saturations, with pulse oximeters and daily phone calls for up to 14 days. Observational studies have reported the safety of this system, but without describing the outcomes from usual care. MethodsA retrospective study using routinely collected health data from all adults with a confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab result between 1st June 2020 and 31st Jan 2021 who attended the Emergency Department or Acute Medical Unit at QEHB, which does not have a CVW service. Criteria for CVW were applied using data from the first 24 hours of presentation to hospital and subsequent health outcomes were included for 28 days, including re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation and death. Results were compared to reported studies based in secondary care. ResultsDuring the study period, 26,127 patients presented to QEHB hospital. 2301 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. Of these, 1730 (75.2%) did not meet the criteria for the CVW and 571 (24.8%) did. Of the 571, 325 (56.9%) were discharged home within 24 hours and 246 (43.1%) were admitted for 24 hours or longer. Those admitted were older, with increased co-morbidities, 80.9% required hospital-supported acute therapies after the first 24 hours and 10.6% died. Of the 325 discharged, 44 were readmitted (13.5%), 30 (9.2%) with COVID-related symptoms, 5 (1.5%) required ITU and 1 patient (0.3%) died. These results were comparable to published studies with a CVW service. DiscussionIn the current study, discharging patients without a CVW did not confer a greater risk of re-presentation, re-admission, ITU escalation or death. The majority of patients who remained in hospital despite meeting the CVW criteria did so for the provision of treatments or acute assessments. It remains uncertain whether a CVW delivers improvements in hard outcomes, and further research is needed.","Gallier, Suzy; Atkin, Catherine; Reddy-Kolanu, Vinay; Parekh, Dhruv; Zou, Xiaoxu; Evison, felicity; Ball, Simon; Sapey, Elizabeth",,610,26

Although severe COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of active viral replication, the immune response to asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 remains unknown. Here, we assessed immunological adaptations in both blood and term decidua from 9 SARS-exposed pregnant women with asymptomatic/mild disease and 15 pregnant SARS-naive women. In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages. On the other hand, infection was associated with remodeling of the T cell compartment with increased frequencies of activated CD69+ tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of Tregs. Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood. The resulting aberrant immune activation in the placenta, even with asymptomatic disease may alter the exquisitely sensitive developing fetal immune system, leading to long-term adverse outcomes for offspring.","Sureshchandra, Suhas; Zulu, Michael Z.; Doratt, Brianna; Jankeel, Allen; Tifrea, Delia; Edwards, Robert A; Rincon, Monica; Marshall, Nicole E.; Messaoudi, Ilhem",,610,16

METHODS: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. RESULTS: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). CONCLUSIONS: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Linton, Natalie M; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R",Int J Infect Dis,610,23

Learners therefore need to be equipped with skills to be autonomous and strategic about their own skill development. Subsequently, high-quality, on-line, personalized educational content and services are also essential to serve this high demand for learning content. Open Educational Resources (OERs) have high potential to contribute to the mitigation of these problems, as they are available in a wide range of learning and occupational contexts globally. However, their applicability has been limited, due to low metadata quality and complex quality control. These issues resulted in a lack of personalised OER functions, like recommendation and search. Therefore, we suggest a novel, personalised OER recommendation method to match skill development targets with open learning content. This is done by: 1) using an OER quality prediction model based on metadata, OER properties, and content; 2) supporting learners to set individual skill targets based on actual labour market information, and 3) building a personalized OER recommender to help learners to master their skill targets. Accordingly, we built a prototype focusing on Data Science related jobs, and evaluated this prototype with 23 data scientists in different expertise levels. Pilot participants used our prototype for at least 30 minutes and commented on each of the recommended OERs. As a result, more than 400 recommendations were generated and 80.9% of the recommendations were reported as useful.","Tavakoli, Mohammadreza; Faraji, Ali; Mol, Stefan T.; Kismih'ok, G'abor",,610,16

The age-related prevalence of PD, combined with increased vulnerability due to age-related comorbidities, makes PD patients protection a priority. Methodology: We reviewed potentials and limitations of teleneurology in PD and suggested a specific battery of tests, including patient-reported outcomes, smartphone applications, and neurological examination through telemedicine. Conclusions: These tools can provide full neurological consultations, with the engagement of both patients and caregivers, and can support clinicians in defining whether patients need to access diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine will also carry a value in the future, within conventional health care, to support clinicians in decision making, enabling more efficacious follow-up, reducing burden for caregivers, and delivering neurological expertise to local realities. These advantages are very important when there is physical distance between patients and neurologists, and when patients are not recommended to attend in-person consultations.","Miele, Giuseppina; Straccia, Giulia; Moccia, Marcello; Leocani, Letizia; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Bonavita, Simona; Lavorgna, Luigi",Telemed. j. e. health,610,16

Thus, sustaining the quality in education has become a challenge during this transitional period. Within this context, the aim of this study was to explore the impact of EDE on language skills development (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) of Turkish pre-service teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL). In this qualitative study, data were gathered from 118 pre-service EFL teachers about the advantages and disadvantages of EDE for their language skills development. Thematic analysis was used as a research design, and nine themes emerged for both advantages and disadvantages. The most important theme for both categories is content and implementation of online courses. This study pinpointed the eminence of this theme, for if it is emphasized enough and handled efficiently, it plays a huge role in developing language skills. The themes and sub-themes generated through thematic analysis showed the advantages and disadvantages of EDE for each skill in detail and also proved that EDE was most advantageous for writing skill and least advantageous for speaking skill. The participants stated that, since writing skill was constantly used for almost all homework, assignments and projects, that skill was nurtured the most. Nevertheless, speaking skill was ignored during online courses, and writing became the new mode of communication by replacing speaking. The outcome of the present study encourages preparedness for EDE against a possible second wave. Thus, the study is hoped to pave the way for anticipating issues and developing solutions for EDE contexts to preserve sustainability in higher education.","Karatas, T.

The survey inquired about attitudes toward the residency interview process in the era of COVID-19 and which interview elements could be replicated virtually. Descriptive statistics were utilized. RESULTS: 80% of urology applicants from the 2019/2020 matches received our survey. 156 people (24% of recipients) responded. 34% preferred virtual interviews, while 41% in-person interviews at each program, and 25% regional/centralized interviews. 64% said that interactions with residents (pre/post-interview social and informal time) were the most important interview day component and 81% said it could not be replicated virtually. Conversely, 81% believed faculty interviews could be replicated virtually. 87% believed that city visits could not be accomplished virtually. A plurality felt that away rotations and second-looks should be allowed (both 45%). COMMENT: Applicants feel that faculty interviews can be replicated virtually, while resident interactions cannot.

Imaging localization of single-gland disease allows for a focused operation. We sought to determine the accuracy of imaging for localizing a solitary parathyroid adenoma. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review was performed of adult patients with PHP undergoing parathyroidectomy from January 2017 through December 2018. Surgeon-performed ultrasound (US), four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), and sestamibi were assessed for localization of a parathyroid adenoma yielding a single-gland parathyroidectomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each imaging modality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients underwent parathyroidectomy for PHP during the study period, with 100 patients meeting inclusion criteria with a mean age of 61.1 (SD 10) y and 80% women. Mean calcium was 11.1 mg/dL (SD 0.7) and mean PTH was 116 pg/mL (SD 66). All 100 patients had surgeon-performed US with 17 localized, 51 patients had 4DCT with 41 (80%) localized, and 69 patients had sestamibi with 53 (77%) localized.

The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O- glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","Shajahan, Asif; Supekar, Nitin T; Gleinich, Anne S; Azadi, Parastoo",Glycobiology,610,24

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification (Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score, respectively.","Rashid, Nafiul; Chen, Luke; Dautta, Manik; Jimenez, Abel; Tseng, Peter; Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah Al",,610,32

Using a global federated research network, the objectives were to determine: 1) if COVID-19 is associated with 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality for people with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications; and 2) if the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX, a global federated health research network. The network was searched for people aged &#8805;â¯65 years with dementia, COVID-19 and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days prior to COVID-19 recorded in electronic medical records between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020. These individuals were compared to historical controls from 2019 with dementia and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days before a visit to a participating healthcare organisation. Propensity score matching for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was used to balance cohorts with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Within the TriNetX network, 8414 individuals with COVID-19, dementia and use of antipsychotics and 31,963 historical controls were identified. After propensity score matching there were 8396 individuals with COVID-19 and 8396 historical controls. The cohorts were well balanced for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants. The odds of 30-day thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality were significantly higher in adults with COVID-19 (Odds Ratios: 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.52) and 1.93 (1.71-2.17), respectively). The number of people with dementia with a visit to a participating healthcare organisation was lower between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020 (nâ¯=â¯165,447) compared to the same period in 2019 (nâ¯=â¯217,391), but the proportion receiving antipsychotics increased from 14.7% (95%CI: 14.6-14.9%) to 16.4% (95%CI: 16.2-16.5%), Pâ¯<â¯.0001. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the evidence base that during the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight hospitals in Southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: 3219 hospitalised patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal PCR test from 13 March 2020 until 29 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were discharge from the hospital or in-hospital death. Examined predictors included patient demographics, chronic diseases, home medications, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital medications and timeframe of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 3219 (90.4%) patients were discharged or died in the hospital. The median age was 65.2 (IQR 52.6-77.2) years, the median length of stay in the hospital was 6.0 (IQR 3.2-10.1) days, and 51% were female. Hypertension was the most common chronic disease, occurring in 2386 (74.1%) patients. Overall mortality rate was 16.0%. Blacks represented 52.3% of patients and had a mortality rate of 13.5%. Mortality was highest at 18.5% in the prepeak hospital COVID-19 volume, decreasing to 15.3% during the peak period and to 10.8% in the postpeak period. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05, p<0.001) for every increase in 1 year of age and being male (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.81, p<0.001). Certain chronic diseases increased the odds of in-hospital mortality, especially chronic kidney disease. Administration of vitamin C, corticosteroids and therapeutic heparin in the hospital was associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality was highest in early admissions and improved as our experience in treating patients with COVID-19 increased. Blacks were more likely to get admitted to the hospital and to receive mechanical ventilation, but less likely to die in the hospital than whites.","Mulhem, Elie; Oleszkowicz, Andrew; Lick, David",BMJ Open,610,26

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the clinical performance of the CE-labeled variplexTM real time SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay in comparison to commercial RT-PCRs. STUDY DESIGN: RNA extracted from pharyngeal swabs was tested by variplex&#8482; RT-LAMP and Corman's LightMix&#8482; E gene RT-PCR as reference. Samples of respiratory secretions from Coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) and negative control patients were analyzed by variplex&#8482; without RNA extraction and tested in parallel with the Allplex&#8482; and VIASURE BD MAX RT-PCRs. RESULTS: Using isolated RNA variplex&#8482; RT-LAMP showed a sensitivity of 75 % compared to LightMix E gene RT-PCR but contrary to the latter it produced no false-positive results. For the evaluation of samples from respiratory secretions concordance analysis showed only a moderate agreement between the variplex&#8482; RT-LAMP conducted on unprocessed samples and Allplex&#8482; and VIASURE RT-PCRs (Cohen's &#954; ranging from 0.52-0.56). Using the approach to define a sample as true-positive when at least two assays gave a positive result the clinical sensitivities were as follows: 76.3 % for variplex&#8482;, 84.2 % for Allplex&#8482; and 68.4 % for VIASURE. However, when results of RT-PCR and RT-LAMP were combined diagnostic sensitivity was increased to 92-100 %. CONCLUSION: The variplex RT-LAMP may serve as a rapid test to be combined with a RT-PCR assay to increase the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection.","Rödel, Jürgen; Egerer, Renate; Suleyman, Aynur; Sommer-Schmid, Beatrice; Baier, Michael; Henke, Andreas; Edel, Birgit; Löffler, Bettina",J Clin Virol,610,20

This study was a single-center, observational before-and-after study of 934 adult (&#8805;18 years old) patients who underwent ETI in the academic ED. The study period was divided into a control period (from 20 January 2019, to 30 September 2019, and from 20 January 2018, to 30 September 2018) and an intervention period (from 20 January 2020, to 30 September 2020). Extensive PPE was not donned during the control period (control group, n = 687) but was donned during the intervention period (PPE group, n = 247). The primary outcome was the FPS rate. We used propensity score matching between the PPE and control groups to reduce potential confounding. Propensity score matching identified 247 cases in the PPE group and 492 cases in the control group. In the matched cohort, no significant difference was found in the FPS rate between the PPE and control groups (83.8% (n = 207) vs. 81.9% (n = 403); p = 0.522). In multivariable analysis, wearing PPE was not associated with the FPS rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.40; p = 0.629) after adjusting for the level of the intubator (junior resident, senior resident, or emergency medicine (EM) specialist).

Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is predominantly mediated by viral infection, but can also be induced by bacterial, protozoal or fungal infections as well as a wide variety of toxic substances and drugs and systemic immune-mediated diseases. Despite extensive research, inflammatory cardiomyopathy complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure or arrhythmia is associated with a poor prognosis. At present, the reason why some patients recover without residual myocardial injury whereas others develop dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. The relative roles of the pathogen, host genomics and environmental factors in disease progression and healing are still under discussion, including which viruses are active inducers and which are only bystanders. As a consequence, treatment strategies are not well established. In this Review, we summarize and evaluate the available evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, with a special focus on virus-induced and virus-associated myocarditis. Furthermore, we identify knowledge gaps, appraise the available experimental models and propose future directions for the field.

Considering their unfavourable features, the process of searching for new antidepressant drugs with better safety and tolerability requires consistent efforts and many complementary studies. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is considered as an interesting target of antidepressant therapy. In the present study, the intrinsic activity at different signaling pathways coupled to serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, antidepressant-like and pharmacokinetic properties, and the safety profile of two novel imidazopurine-2,4-dione derivatives, namely compounds AZ-853 (8-(4-(4-(2-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H- imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione) and AZ-861 (1,3-dimethyl-8-(4-(4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1H-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione), were studied in animal models through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We demonstrated that AZ-853 and AZ-861, which structurally differ by one substituent and its placement in the phenyl ring, showed varied functional, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties as well as side effect profiles. AZ-861 exhibited stronger agonistic action in all functional assays. After acute and repeated administration in mice, both compounds showed antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test, which was partially mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation. AZ-853 showed a more potent antidepressant-like effect, presumably due to its better penetration into brain structures. Both compounds did not show anticholinergic properties, but after repeated administration, they induced weak sedation and lipid metabolism disturbances without affecting serum glucose level. The stronger &#945;1-adrenolytic effect of AZ-853 is responsible for decreased systolic blood pressure, and in contrast to AZ-861, AZ-853 induced weight gain in mice. The interesting comparative pharmacological profiles of AZ-853 and AZ-861 encourage to conduct further experiments to fully understand their mechanisms and differences in action.","Partyka, Anna; Zagórska, Agnieszka; Kotanska, Magdalena; Walczak, Maria; Jastrzebska-Wiesek, Magdalena; Knutelska, Joanna; Bednarski, Marek; Gluch-Lutwin, Monika; Mordyl, Barbara; Janiszewska, Paulina; Wesolowska, Anna",PLoS One,610,21

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been shown to affect respiratory function in a sex-dependent manner; however, the effect of IUGR on diaphragm function is unknown. AIM: This study used a maternal hypoxia-induced mouse model of IUGR to investigate the impact of IUGR on diaphragm function and structure in male and female adult offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant BALB/c mice were housed under hypoxic conditions (10.5% O2 ) from gestational days 11 to 17.5 and then returned to normoxic conditions. Control mice were housed under normoxic conditions throughout pregnancy. At 8 weeks of age, offspring were euthanized and diaphragms isolated for functional assessment in organ bath experiments and for histological analysis. RESULTS: IUGR offspring were lighter at birth and remained lighter at 8 weeks of age compared to Controls. While diaphragm force (maximal or twitch) was not affected by treatment or sex, the IUGR group exhibited a longer half-relaxation time after twitch contractions compared to Control. Female offspring had a lower maximum rate of force development and higher fatigue resistance compared to males, independent of IUGR. There was no difference in the diaphragm myofibre cross-sectional area between groups or sexes. CONCLUSION: Sex and IUGR independently affect diaphragm contraction in adult mice without changes in structure. This study demonstrates that IUGR affects diaphragm contractile function in later life and could impair respiratory function if exacerbated under conditions of increased respiratory load.","Francis, Maddison R; Pinniger, Gavin J; Noble, Peter B; Wang, Kimberley C W",Pediatr Pulmonol,610,29

Like previous coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to have wildlife origins and was possibly transmitted to humans via wet markets selling bushmeat (aka harvested wild meat). Thus, an interdisciplinary framework is vital to address the nexus between bushmeat, wet markets, and disease. We reviewed the contemporary scientific literature to: (1) assess disease surveillance efforts within the bushmeat trade and wet markets globally by compiling zoonotic health risks based on primarily serological examinations;and (2) gauge perceptions of health risks associated with bushmeat and wet markets. Of the 58 species of bushmeat investigated across 15 countries in the 52 articles that we analyzed,one or more pathogens (totaling 60 genera of pathogens) were reported in 48 species, while no zoonotic pathogens were reported in 10 species based on serology. Burden of disease data was nearly absent from the articles resulting from our Scopus search, and therefore was not included in our analyses. We also found that perceived health risks associated with bushmeat was low, though we could not perform statistical analyses due to the lack of quantitative perception-based studies. After screening the literature, our results showed that the global distribution of reported bushmeat studies were biased towards Africa, revealing data deficiencies across Asia and South America despite the prevalence of the bushmeat trade across the Global South. Studies targeting implications of the bushmeat trade on human health can help address these data deficiencies across Asia and South America. We further illustrate the need to address the nexus between bushmeat, wet markets, and disease to help prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases under the previously proposed “One Health Framework”, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health. By tackling these three pillars, we discuss the current policy gaps and recommend suitable measures to prevent future disease outbreaks.","Peros, Colin Scott Dasgupta Rajarshi Kumar Pankaj Johnson Brian Alan",Environmental Science &amp; Policy,610,21

We describe a nurse practitioner (NP) and physician assistant (PA)-led initiative to implement telemonitoring (TM) of noncritical patients with COVID-19 by critical care NPs and PAs (C19TM) for early detection of decompensation and early transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). Every hospitalized patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 received an initial telemedicine consult with a critical care NP or PA. Patients were subsequently monitored via electronic health record once every 12-hour shift for the following indicators: oxygen modality and flow, increase in oxygen requirements, sustained tachypnea, and hemodynamic instability. If signs of decompensation were noted, the NP/PA would remotely reassess the patient, provide recommendations to the hospital internal medicine team, and transfer the patient to the ICU. The primary goal was to avoid cardiopulmonary deterioration requiring aerosol-generating procedures outside of the ICU. Over 65 days, 113 patients (86 suspected and 27 confirmed) were enrolled in C19TM. As a result, there were 13 transfers to the ICU, none of which required an aerosol-generating procedure outside of the ICU.","Santos, Christan D; Grek, Ami A; Ojard, Michelle M; Propst, Joshua A; Hastings, Jacquelyn J; Krider, Tina L; Villar, Dolores C; Sanghavi, Devang K; Freeman, William D; Siegel, Jason L",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),610,18

No previous meta-analysis has evaluated its side effects versus placebo. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the safety of HCQ versus placebo. METHODS: Two authors independently searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults comparing the adverse events (AEs) of HCQ versus placebo for any indication. Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated based on random-effects models. The heterogeneity (I2) was assessed using Cochran's Q test. RESULTS: Nine RCTs (eight were double-blind) with a total of 916 patients were included. HCQ caused significantly more skin pigmentation than placebo (Peto OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.13 to 19.00; P-value = 0.033; I2 = 0%). The increase in other AEs did not reach statistical significance: rash (Peto OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.77; P-value = 0.03; I2 = 0%); gastrointestinal AEs (Peto OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.55 to 3.72; P-value = 0.46; I2 = 15.17%); headache (Peto OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.65 to 5.78; P-value = 0.23; I2 = 9.99%); dizziness (Peto OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.49 to 3.52; P-value = 0.58; I2 = 0%); fatigue (Peto OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 0.76 to 5.98; P-value = 0.15; I2 = 0%); and visual AEs (Peto OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.76 to 3.41; P-value = 0.22; I2 = 0%). Cardiac toxicity was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of RCTs found a significantly higher risk of skin pigmentation in HCQ users versus placebo. More data are needed to evaluate HCQ in the context of COVID-19 treatment.","Eljaaly, Khalid; Alireza, Kasim Huseein; Alshehri, Samah; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A",Travel Med Infect Dis,610,24

METHODS: A national registry of UK ENT surgeons with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 was created with the support of ENT UK. Voluntary entry was made by either the affected individual or a colleague, using a web-based platform. RESULTS: A four-month data collection period is reported, comprising 73 individuals. Coronavirus disease 2019 was test-confirmed in 35 respondents (47.9 per cent). There was a need for hospitalisation in two cases (2.7 per cent) and tragically one individual died. Symptom onset peaked in March. The majority suspected their exposure to have been in the workplace, with a significant proportion attributing their disease to a lack of personal protective equipment at a time before formal guidance had been introduced. CONCLUSION: The registry suggests that a significant number of ENT clinicians in the UK have contracted coronavirus disease 2019, and supports the need for tailored personal protective equipment guidance and service planning.","Stephenson, K; Sowerby, L J; Hopkins, C; Kumar, N",J Laryngol Otol,610,9

Identification of the features of lung lesions in such diseases is relevant during the spread of seasonal respiratory infections. The comparative study of the dynamics of hematological and hemostasiological parameters of blood in patients with pneumonia of various origins is of interest in terms of searching for predictors of the prognosis of the diseases development. Aim. To compare the features of clinical symptoms, hematological and hemostasiological parameters in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Materials and methods. During cross-sectional study two groups were formed: group 1 consisted of 92 patients diagnosed with moderate community-acquired pneumonia caused by COVID-19 infection;group 2 included 40 patients diagnosed with moderate community-acquired bilateral polysegmental pneumonia. Results. It was found that patients with COVID-19 had an older age (69 vs 39.3 years), a lower body temperature at admission (37.5 vs 38.85 °C), a lower percentage of reduced oxygen saturation (less than 89 % in 5.4 % of cases vs 10 % of cases). In most cases, the average values of some hematological parameters in patients with COVID-19 did not go beyond the reference range. Leukopenia (below 4 × 109 cells/l) and lymphopenia (below 1.1 × 109 cells/l) were observed in 26 % and 38 % of cases respectively;thrombocytopenia (less than 100 × 109 cells/l) - in 12.2 % of cases;hyperfibrinogenemia (more than 4 g/l) - in 65.3 % of cases. A direct correlation was found between platelet levels and leukocytes (R = 0.53;p &lt; 0.001) and lymphocytes (R = 0.29;p = 0.06). Compared with the patients of the group 2, on average, patients with COVID-19 had significantly lower levels of leukocytes and lymphocytes (2.5 times each;p &lt; 0.001) and an increased level of fibrinogen (by 45 %;p &lt; 0.001).

We examined the frequency of acute intracranial abnormalities seen on CT and/or MR imaging in patients with COVID-19 and investigated possible associations between these findings and clinical parameters, including length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study performed at a large academic hospital in the United States. A total of 641 patients presented to our institution between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019, of whom, 150 underwent CT and/or MR imaging of the brain. CT and/or MR imaging examinations were evaluated for the presence of hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. The frequency of these findings was correlated with clinical variables, including body mass index, length of hospital stay, requirement for intubation, and development of acute kidney injury as documented in the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Of the 150 patients, 26 (17%) had abnormal CT and/or MR imaging findings, with hemorrhage in 11 of the patients (42%), infarction in 13 of the patients (50%), and leukoencephalopathy in 7 of the patients (27%). Significant associations were seen between abnormal CT/MR imaging findings and intensive care unit admission (P = .039), intubation (P = .004), and acute kidney injury (P = .030). CONCLUSIONS: A spectrum of acute neuroimaging abnormalities was seen in our cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, including hemorrhage, infarction, and leukoencephalopathy. Significant associations between abnormal neuroimaging studies and markers of disease severity (intensive care unit admission, intubation, and acute kidney injury) suggest that patients with severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 may have higher rates of neuroimaging abnormalities.","Yoon, B C; Buch, K; Lang, M; Applewhite, B P; Li, M D; Mehan, W A; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Rincon, S P",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,610,16

This problem of gender-based violence is currently exacerbated due to the lockdown restrictions. Women and children are targets for Covid-19 related frustrations as gender-based violence reports increase during the lockdown period. Across the country, civil society groups, gender-based violence advocacy organisations, religious groups, and other social justice groups have reported an increase in incidences related to violence against women and children and heightened demand for emergency shelters. Moreover, at the beginning of June 2020, Nehawu mentioned that reports suggested that the number of gender-based violence cases had risen by 500 per cent since the start of the Covid-19 lockdown. Employing the literature review, the paper elaborates on the nature of gender-based violence reported in South Africa and further highlights how gender-based violence has increased during the lockdown period. In this paper, I use the social dominance theory to understand the escalation of gender-based violence when people ought to be focusing on curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Observing COVID-19 protocols and encouraging one another to adhere to protocols in the endeavour to reduce the spread of the pandemic ought to be the focus of everyone irrespective of their gender.

Masks and disinfectants are usually sold in community pharmacies that are supposed to undertake extreme precautions to avoid cross infection among clients. It is also their responsibility to play a prominent role in educating the community regarding this outbreak. Objectives: To investigate the preparedness of private community pharmacies in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, for the COVID-19 outbreak with regard to safety measures, customer education, and quality of preventive aids sold by them. Methods: One hundred pharmacies were visited by simulated clients. The availability of free hand disinfectants, masks, gloves, and customer educational aids as well as the measures employed to ensure maintenance of safe distances between customers were documented. The adherence of pharmacists and customers to safety precautions and the behavior of pharmacists against violators of regulations were also observed. Finally, the availability and quality of facial masks and hand disinfectants sold by these pharmacies was documented. Results: Fifty-five pharmacies offered free hand disinfectants but only in three of them all customers used them. Only two pharmacies offered free disposable masks and temperature screening was available in only one pharmacy. Educational aids were found in 31 pharmacies and only 53 pharmacies used visual indicators for social distancing. Violation of wearing masks by pharmacy personnel and customers was seen in 34 and 87 pharmacies, respectively. Social distancing was violated in 64 pharmacies and intervention by staff was seen in only three of them. Finally, facial masks were available for sale in only 35 pharmacies, and in 23 of these, the quality was questionable; hand disinfectants were available in 84 pharmacies, and in 14 of these, the quality was unknown. Conclusions: Community pharmacies in Madinah were short of registered, high-quality facial masks during the survey. Means to control the transmission of infection inside pharmacies were unsatisfactory. Society has shown poor compliance to preventive measures against COVID-19 infection and the role of community pharmacists in promoting compliance was found to be poor. The study reveals an unsatisfactory level of preparedness of Madinah community pharmacies for the pandemic.","Khojah, Hani M J",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,610,30

And yet, this body of work remains stubbornly and peculiarly focussed upon the views and actions of relatively small numbers of people within North America and Western Europe, even when the events and activities being described relate to regions and countries further afield. The biggest problem in this body of work is rooted in unmov-ing assumptions about the importance of a small set of nations in the post-war era and insufficiently tested presumptions about their dominance over the negotiations that led to the creation of new post-war institutions (such as the United Nations). Post-war agencies are, in turn, described simplisti-cally, where their Europe-and USA-based headquarters are presented as all powerful and capable of dictating actions of representatives located all over the world;this is done with suspiciously limited research, with almost no attention being paid to the birth of regional and national branches of UN organisations, and their intricate negotiations with governments of newly independent, assertive countries who were willing to invest heavily, both financially and through new international alliances, in the modernisation of health, science and technology.

A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) using a nasopharyngeal swab sample. After he returned home and a telephone follow-up, he was found deceased 9 days after first showing symptoms. Whole-body, non-enhanced, post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and a forensic autopsy were performed approximately 48 h after death, with sanitary precautions. The PMCT showed bilateral and diffuse crazy-paving lung opacities, with bilateral pleural effusions. Post-mortem virology studies detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1 lineage) in the nasopharynx, plasma, lung biopsies, pleural effusion and faeces confirming the persistence of viral ribonucleic acid 48 h after death. Microscopic examination showed that severe lung damage was responsible for his death. The main abnormality was diffuse alveolar damage, associated with different stages of inflammation and fibrosis. This case is one of the first to describe complete post-mortem data for a COVID-19 death and highlights the ability of PMCT to detect severe involvement of the lungs before autopsy in an apparently natural death. The present pathology results are concordant with previously reported findings and reinforce the disease pathogenesis hypothesis of combined viral replication with an inappropriate immune response.","Ducloyer, Mathilde; Gaborit, Benjamin; Toquet, Claire; Castain, Louise; Bal, Antonin; Arrigoni, Pierre Paul; Lecomte, Raphaël; Clement, Renaud; Sagan, Christine",Int J Legal Med,610,24

METHODS: We created a gender-neutral, 2-page comic to augment text-only ED concussion discharge instructions. A sample of patients evaluated at a sports neurology clinic and their parents/guardians participated. Patients and their parents were randomized to view either the comic only or both the comic and publicly available comic-based video. Patients and parents completed preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess likeability and concussion knowledge including concussion definition, symptoms, return-to-ED criteria, and resuming normal activity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (47.4% female; mean age, 15 years) and 37 guardians were enrolled. Most (73%) concussions were sports related, with the majority having sought care within 24 hours in an ED (80%). Over half (51%) had experienced 2 or more prior concussions. Overall, 31 adolescents and 20 guardians viewed both comic and video, whereas 26 adolescents and 17 guardians viewed the comic only. Both comic and video were favorably reviewed, but a higher proportion of respondents rated the video more positively than the comic for likability (P < 0.01), comprehensibility (P < 0.05), and increasing understanding (P < 0.05).

METHODS: To describe the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of patients with rare diseases, a retrospective analysis of the Campania Region Rare Disease Registry was performed. A tailored questionnaire was sent to rare disease experts to investigate major issues during the emergency period. RESULTS: Prevalence of new diagnoses of rare disease in March and April 2020 was significantly lower than in 2019 (117 versus 317, P < 0.001 and 37 versus 349, P < 0.001, respectively) and 2018 (117 versus 389, P < 0.001 and 37 versus 282, P < 0.001, respectively). Eighty-two among 98 rare disease experts completed the questionnaire. Diagnostic success (95%), access to diagnosis (80%) and follow-up (72%), lack of Personal Protective Equipment (60%), lack of Covid-19 guidelines (50%) and the need for home therapy (78%) were the most important issues raised during Covid-19 outbreak.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved third- and fourth-year pharmacy students at the International Islamic University Malaysia. A validated self-administered questionnaire was distributed to students who had taken a vOSCE a week before. RESULTS: Out of the 253 students who were approached, 231 (91.3%) completed the questionnaire. More than 75% of the participants agreed that the instructions and preparations were clear and helpful in familiarizing them with the vOSCE flow. It was found that 53.2% of the respondents were satisfied with the flow and conduct of the vOSCE. However, only approximately one-third of the respondents believed that the tasks provided in the vOSCE were more convenient, less stressful, and easier to perform than those in the conventional OSCE. Furthermore, 49.7% of the students favored not having a vOSCE in the future when conducting a conventional OSCE becomes feasible again. Internet connection was reported as a problem hindering the performance of the vOSCE by 51.9% of the participants. Students who were interested in clinical pharmacy courses were more satisfied than other students with the preparation and operation of the vOSCE, the faculty support, and the allocated time. CONCLUSION: Students were satisfied with the organization and operation of the vOSCE. However, they still preferred the conventional OSCE over the vOSCE. These findings might indicate a further need to expose students to telehealthcare models.","Elnaem, Mohamed Hassan; Akkawi, Muhammad Eid; Nazar, Nor Ilyani Mohamed; Ab Rahman, Norny Syafinaz; Mohamed, Mohamad Haniki Nik",J Educ Eval Health Prof,610,24

Regarding this matter, a web-based survey was performed. Data were collected from the following 1,668 self-selected volunteers: 800 athletes (28.30 ± 10.93 years old); 558 coaches (36.91 ± 11.93 years old); and 310 sports managers (42.07 ± 13.38 years old). To assess the level of psychological stress, an Impact of the Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire was used. The results indicated that 34.4% of the participants who were interviewed were affected by subjective distress while 26.4% rated their psychological impact from the sports activity interruption as severe. Separated one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests showed significant differences in the IES-R total score (TS), indicating that the level of stress in terms of gender revealed that women were more stressed than men (p = 0.000), for ""sports roles"" in which the manager and coaches were more stressed than the athletes (p < 0.05), and ""type of sport"" in which fitness and individual athletes were more stressed than team athletes (p < 0.01). The middle-level athletes showed significantly more hyperarousal levels than high-level athletes (p = 0.012). The results of this survey may raise awareness of this problem and help athletic associations to have appropriate guidelines in order to better sustain their memberships and organize an optimal resumption of their sports activities. Along these lines, social interactions, which are typical of team sports, are crucial to warrant resilience and psychological health. The athletes by managing independently the new rules and measures, thanks to a clear communication, could improve their adaptive stress reaction.","Fiorilli, Giovanni; Grazioli, Elisa; Buonsenso, Andrea; Di Martino, Giulia; Despina, Tsopani; Calcagno, Giuseppe; di Cagno, Alessandra",PLoS One,610,16

METHODS: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset, were compared between PE and non-PE patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD 13.7) vs 69.9 (SD 12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD 8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). No patients met ISTH DIC criteria. Any parameter was statistically significant or clinically relevant except for D-Dimer when comparing both groups. Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p = 0.004); week 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p = 0.003); and week 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p = 0.01).

Temporal radiographic changes and viral clearance were explored using appropriate statistical methods. Radiographic features from HRCT scans included ground-glass opacity, consolidation, air bronchogram, nodular opacities and pleural effusion. The HRCT scores (peak) during disease course in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia (median: 24.5) were higher compared to those with pneumonia (median: 10) (p = 3.56 × 10 -12), with more frequency of consolidation (p = 0.025) and air bronchogram (p = 7.50 × 10-6). The median values of days when the peak HRCT scores were reached in pneumonia or severe pneumonia patients were 12 vs. 14, respectively (p = 0.048). Log-rank test and Spearman's Rank-Order correlation suggested temporal radiographic changes as a valuable predictor for viral clearance.

Important for the conservation of this species is understanding the physiological and ecological impacts contributing to their population decline, and current studies lack information on embryonic development. Changes in patterns of salinity across the SFBD may be a particularly important environmental stressor contributing to the recruitment and survival of the species. Throughout their ontogeny, delta smelt may exhibit unique requirements and tolerances to environmental conditions including salinity. Here, we describe 22 stages of embryonic development of H. transpacificus that characterize early differentiation from the fertilized egg until hatching, allowing the identification of critical morphological features unique to this species. Additionally, we investigated aspects of physiological tolerance to environmental salinity during development. Embryos survived incubation at salinity treatments between 0.4 and 20 ppt, yet had lower hatch success at higher salinities. Prior to hatching, embryos exposed to higher salinities had increased osmolalities and reduced fractions of yolk implying that the elevated external salinity altered the physiology of the embryo and the environment internal to the chorion. Lastly, egg activation and fertilization appear to also be impacted by salinity. Altogether, we suggest that any potential tolerance to salinity during embryogenesis, a common feature in euryhaline teleost species, impacts life cycle transitions into, and out of, embryonic development. Results from this investigation should improve conservation and management practices of this species and further expand our understanding of the intimate relationship between an embryo and its environment.","Romney, Amie L T; Yanagitsuru, Yuzo R; Mundy, Paige C; Fangue, Nann A; Hung, Tien-Chieh; Brander, Susanne M; Connon, Richard E",Aquaculture,610,16

In low-dimensional regimes, where the number of observations far exceeds the number of variables, the optimality of the sample covariance matrix as an estimator of this parameter is well-established. High-dimensional regimes do not admit such a convenience, however. As such, a variety of estimators have been derived to overcome the shortcomings of the sample covariance matrix in these settings. Yet, the question of selecting an optimal estimator from among the plethora available remains largely unaddressed. Using the framework of cross-validated loss-based estimation, we develop the theoretical underpinnings of just such an estimator selection procedure. In particular, we propose a general class of loss functions for covariance matrix estimation and establish finite-sample risk bounds and conditions for the asymptotic optimality of the cross-validated estimator selector with respect to these loss functions. We evaluate our proposed approach via a comprehensive set of simulation experiments and demonstrate its practical benefits by application in the exploratory analysis of two single-cell transcriptome sequencing datasets.

Methods: This study was a multi-center retrospective cohort study. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 were recruited in three medical centers located in Beijing, Wuhan and Nanchang from January 27, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Demographics, clinical data, and CT images were collected. CT were analyzed by two emergency physicians of more than ten years' work experience independently through a modified scoring system. Final score was determined by average score from the two reviewers if consensus was not reached. The lung was divided into 6 zones (upper, middle, and lower on both sides) by the level of trachea carina and the level of lower pulmonary veins. The target lesion types included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, overall lung involvement, and crazy-paving pattern. Bronchiectasis, cavity, pleural effusion, etc., were not included in CT reading and analysis because of low incidence. The reviewers evaluated the extent of the targeted patterns (GGO, consolidation) and overall affected lung parenchyma for each zone, using Likert scale, ranging from 0-4 (0=absent; 1=1%-25%; 2=26%-50%; 3=51%-75%; 4=76%-100%). Thus, GGO score, consolidation score, and overall lung involvement score were sum of 6 zones ranging from 0-24. For crazy-paving pattern, it was only coded as absent or present (0 or 1) for each zone and therefore ranging from 0-6. Results: A total of 197 patients from 3 medical centers and 522 CT scans entered final analysis. The median age of the patients was 64 years, and 54.8% were male. There were 76(38.8%) patients had hypertension and 30(15.3%) patients had diabetes mellitus. There were 75 of the patients classified as moderate cases, as well as 95 severe cases and 27 critical cases. As initial symptom, dry cough occurred in 170 patients, 134 patients had fever, and 125 patients had dyspnea. Reparatory rate, oxygen saturation, lymphocyte count and CURB 65 score on admission day varied among patients with different disease severity scale. There were 50 of the patients suffered from deterioration during hospital stay. The median time consumed for each CT by clinicians was 86.5 seconds. Cronbach's alpha for GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement between two clinicians were 0.809, 0.712, 0.678, and 0.906, respectively, showing good or excellent inter-rater correlation. There were 193 (98.0%) patients had GGO, 147 (74.6%) had consolidation, and 126(64.0%) had crazy-paving pattern throughout clinical course. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 183(92.9%) patients. Median time of interval for CT scan in our study was 7 days so that the whole clinical course was divided into stages by week for further analysis. From the second week on, the CT scores of various types of lesions in severe or critically patients were higher than those of moderate cases. After the fifth week, the course of disease entered the recovery period. The CT score of the upper lung zones was lower than that of other zones in moderate and severe cases. Similar distribution was not observed in critical patients. For moderate cases, the ground glass opacity score at the second week had predictive value for the escalation of the severity classification during hospitalization. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.849, the best cut-off value was 5 points, with sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 75.0%. Conclusions: It is feasible for clinicians to use the modified semi-quantitative CT scoring system to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Severe/critical patients had higher scores for ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and overall lung involvement than moderate cases. The ground glass opacity score in the second week had an optimal predictive value for escalation of disease severity during hospitalization in moderate patients on admission. The frequency of CT scan should be reduced after entering the recovery stage.","Li, S; Liu, S Y; Zhao, Y Q; Li, Q Y; Liu, D Y; Liu, Z C; Li, D S; Zeng, L; Ge, Q G; Ma, Q B; Shen, N",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,610,15

Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to study the humoral immune response in Saudis who are Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We created three types of enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) to reveal IgG and IgM antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2. The developed ELISAs were designed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2â¯N, S and Nâ¯+â¯S proteins. A number of Covid-19 symptomatic (1 5 3) and asymptomatic (84) RT-PCR-confirmed patient sera were used to evaluate the ELISAs and to determine the IgG and IgM antibody profile in those patients. The sensitivity and specificity of these ELISAs were evaluated using pre-Covid-19 pandemic serum samples. The results revealed the existence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM Abs in Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic Saudi persons. The use of SARS-CoV-2â¯N and S proteins in the same ELISA greatly increased the detectability of infection. In conclusion, the Covid-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic Saudi persons demonstrated both IgG and IgM antibody profile with higher titer in symptomatic patients.

Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, finetuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets.","Pergola, Gabriele; Kochkina, Elena; Gui, Lin; Liakata, Maria; He, Yulan",,610,24

Human genetic polymorphisms in Ide have been linked to increased risk for T2DM. In mice, hepatic Ide ablation causes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when mice are fed a regular diet. OBJECTIVE: These studies were undertaken to further investigate its regulatory role in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity. METHODS: To this end, we have compared the metabolic effects of loss versus gain of IDE function in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). RESULTS: We demonstrate that loss of IDE function in liver (L-IDE-KO mouse) exacerbates hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance without changes in insulin clearance but in parallel to an increase in pancreatic ß-cell function. Insulin resistance was associated with increased FoxO1 activation and a ~2-fold increase of GLUT2 protein levels in the liver of HFD-fed mice in response to an intraperitoneal injection of insulin. Conversely, gain of IDE function (adenoviral delivery) improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, in parallel to a reciprocal ~2-fold reduction in hepatic GLUT2 protein levels. Furthermore, in response to insulin, IDE co-immunoprecipitates with the insulin receptor in liver lysates of mice with adenoviral-mediated liver overexpression of IDE. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that IDE regulates hepatic insulin action and whole-body glucose metabolism in diet-induced obesity via insulin receptor levels.","Merino, Beatriz; Fernández-Díaz, Cristina M; Parrado-Fernández, Cristina; González-Casimiro, Carlos M; Postigo-Casado, Tamara; Lobatón, Carmen D; Leissring, Malcolm A; Cózar-Castellano, Irene; Perdomo, Germán",Metabolism,610,1

Despite the significant difference in the occurrences of stance markers between the two sub-corpora, similarities of the most frequent stance markers in two genres were also highlighted. The study indicated that the topic content seems to play an important role in shaping the way of how writers construct their stance.

Cardiac monitoring is recommended for at risk patients; however, the availability of telemetry capable hospital beds is limited. We sought to evaluate a patch-based mobile telemetry system for inpatient cardiac monitoring during the pandemic. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed of inpatients hospitalized during the pandemic who had mobile telemetry devices placed; patients were studied up until the time of discharge or death. The primary outcome was a composite of management changes based on data obtained from the system and detection of new arrhythmias. Other clinical outcomes and performance characteristics of the mobile telemetry system were studied. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients underwent mobile telemetry device placement, of which 31 (37.8%) met the primary outcome, which consisted of 24 (29.3%) with new arrhythmias detected and 18 (22.2%) with management changes. Twenty-one patients (25.6%) died during the study, but none from primary arrhythmias. In analyses, age and heart failure were associated with the primary outcome. Monitoring occurred for an average of 5.3 ± 3.4 days, with 432 total patient-days of monitoring performed; of these, QT-interval measurements were feasible in 400 (92.6%). CONCLUSION: A mobile telemetry system was successfully implemented for inpatient use during the COVID-19 pandemic and was shown to be useful to inform patient management, detect occult arrhythmias, and monitor the QT-interval. Patients with advanced age and structural heart disease may be more likely to benefit from this system.","Braunstein, Eric D; Reynbakh, Olga; Krumerman, Andrew; Di Biase, Luigi; Ferrick, Kevin J",J. cardiovasc. electrophysiol,610,1

However, abundant ammonium nutrition impairs growth, i.e., ammonium toxicity, the primary cause of which remains to be determined. Here, we show that ammonium assimilation by GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 2 (GLN2) localized in the plastid rather than ammonium accumulation is a primary cause for toxicity, which challenges the textbook knowledge. With exposure to toxic levels of ammonium, the shoot GLN2 reaction produced an abundance of protons within cells, thereby elevating shoot acidity and stimulating expression of acidic stress-responsive genes. Application of an alkaline ammonia solution to the ammonium medium efficiently alleviated the ammonium toxicity with a concomitant reduction in shoot acidity. Consequently, we conclude that a primary cause of ammonium toxicity is acidic stress.","Hachiya, Takushi; Inaba, Jun; Wakazaki, Mayumi; Sato, Mayuko; Toyooka, Kiminori; Miyagi, Atsuko; Kawai-Yamada, Maki; Sugiura, Daisuke; Nakagawa, Tsuyoshi; Kiba, Takatoshi; Gojon, Alain; Sakakibara, Hitoshi",Nat Commun,610,5

This study introduces a GPS-based tool, i.e., lockdown breaching index (LBI), which helps to determine the extent of breaching activities during the lockdown period. It is evaluated using the community mobility reports. This index ranges between 0 and 100, which implies the extent of following the lockdown policies. A score of 0 indicates that civilians strictly adhered to the guidelines while a score of 100 points to complete violation. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is modified to compute the LBI. We considered fifteen states of India, where the spread of coronavirus is relatively dominant. A significant breaching activity is observed during the first phase of lockdown, and the intensity increased in the third and fourth phases of lockdown. Overall breaching activities are dominant in Bihar with LBI of 75.28. At the same time, it is observed that the majority of the people in Delhi adhered to the lockdown policies strictly, as reflected with an LBI score of 47.05, which is the lowest. Though an average rise of 3% breaching activities during the second phase of lockdown (L2.0) with reference to the first phase of lockdown (L1.0) is noticed in all the states, a decreasing trend is noticed in Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Since the beginning of third phase of lockdown L3.0, a significant rise in breaching activities is observed in every state considered for the analysis. The average LBI rise of 16.9% and 27.6% relative to L1.0 is observed at the end of L3.0 and L4.0, respectively. A positive spearman rank correlation of 0.88 is noticed between LBI and the cumulative confirmed cases. This correlation serves as evidence and enlightens the fact that the breaching activities could be one of the possible reasons that contributed to the rise in COVID-19 cases throughout lockdown.","Puppala, Harish; Bheemaraju, Amarnath; Asthana, Rishi",J Healthc Inform Res,610,24

Here we show that adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects naïve recipient rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.

Since December 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is the causative agent of COVID-19, has invaded the world causing high numbers of infections and deaths. The infection with SARS-COV-2 virus shows an abnormality in lung parenchyma that can be effectively detected using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In this paper, a novel computer aided framework (COV-CAF) is proposed for classifying the severity degree of the infection from 3D Chest Volumes. COV-CAF fuses traditional and deep learning approaches. The proposed COV-CAF consists of two phases: the preparatory phase and the feature analysis and classification phase. The preparatory phase handles 3D-CT volumes and presents an effective cut choice strategy for choosing informative CT slices. The feature analysis and classification phase incorporate fuzzy clustering for automatic Region of Interest (RoI) segmentation and feature fusion. In feature fusion, automatic features are extracted from a newly introduced Convolution Neural Network (Norm-VGG16) and are fused with spatial hand-crafted features extracted from segmented RoI. Experiments are conducted on MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings with COVID-19 severity classes and SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan benchmark datasets.

This paper attempts to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published articles, to evaluate the association of inflammatory parameters with the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search of medical electronic databases including Pubmed/Medline, Europe PMC, and Google Scholar was performed for relevant data published from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. Observational studies reporting clear extractable data on inflammatory parameters in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two authors independently. Standardized mean difference (SMD)/mean difference (MD/WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random or fixed-effects models. Results: A total of 83 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of which, 54 studies were grouped by severity, 25 studies were grouped by mortality, and 04 studies were grouped by both severity and mortality. Random effect model results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 group had significantly higher levels of C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-2R (IL-2R), serum amyloid A (SAA) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to those in the non-severe group. Similarly, the fixed-effect model revealed significant higher ferritin level in the severe group when compared with the non-severe group. Furthermore, the random effect model results demonstrated that the non-survivor group had significantly higher levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, ferritin, and NLR when compared with the survivor group. Conclusion: In conclusion, the measurement of these inflammatory parameters could help the physicians to rapidly identify severe COVID-19 patients, hence facilitating the early initiation of effective treatment.

This paper presents: a) the results of a quality improvement project examining the feasibility of in-person evaluation in the context of safety measures that alter test standardization, b) the impact such changes had upon neuropsychological test scores, and c) how using a hybrid model of clinical service delivery affected access to care. METHOD: We compared demographic and outcome variables between patients seen during the pandemic (N = 87) to a group of patients seen in our service immediately prior to COVID-19 (N = 87). A subset of those patients were case-matched for age and diagnosis (N = 39 per group). Children seen for neuropsychological re-evaluation during the pandemic (N = 10) were examined using pairwise comparison. RESULTS: Groups did not differ on age, sex, or FSIQ. Despite changes to standardized administration, no group differences were found for any selected neuropsychological test variables in the larger sample or subsamples. In fact, all variables were moderately to highly correlated in the re-evaluation subgroup. The hybrid model expedited feedback sessions and increased face-to-face (telehealth) feedbacks. CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid model incorporating modified in-person testing and intake and feedback encounters via telehealth may be a feasible and effective way to provide pediatric neuropsychological services.

The present study is based on comprehensive monitoring of 576 COVID-19 patients. Different statistical approaches were applied to gain a comprehensive insight in terms of both the identification of risk factors and the analysis of dependency structure among clinical and demographic characteristics. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but whether or not renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases remains controversial. The survival tree approach was applied to define a multilayer risk stratification and better profile patient survival with respect to drug regimens, showing a significant protective effect of RAASi with a reduced risk of in-hospital death. Bayesian networks were estimated, to uncover complex interrelationships and confounding effects. The results confirmed the role of RAASi in reducing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. De novo treatment with RAASi in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should be prospectively investigated in a randomized controlled trial to ascertain the extent of risk reduction for in-hospital death in COVID-19.","Cippà, Pietro E; Cugnata, Federica; Ferrari, Paolo; Brombin, Chiara; Ruinelli, Lorenzo; Bianchi, Giorgia; Beria, Nicola; Schulz, Lukas; Bernasconi, Enos; Merlani, Paolo; Ceschi, Alessandro; Di Serio, Clelia",Proc.

Even if important improvements have been achieved worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for NOx and SOx release; instead, the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for NH3 emissions. Due to the emergency of coronavirus disease, in Italy schools and universities have been locked down from late February 2020, followed in March by almost all production and industrial activities as well as road transport, except for the agricultural ones. This study aims to analyze NH3, PM2.5 and NOx emissions in principal livestock provinces in the Lombardy region (Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, and Mantua) to evaluate if and how air emissions have changed during this quarantine period respect to 2016-2019. For each province, meteorological and air quality data were collected from the database of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment, considering both data stations located in the city and the countryside. In the 2020 selected period, PM2.5 reduction was higher compared to the previous years, especially in February and March. Respect to February, PM2.5 released in March in the city stations reduced by 19%-32% in 2016-2019 and by 21%-41% in 2020. Similarly, NOx data of 2020 were lower than in the 2016-2019 period (reduction in March respect to February of 22-42% for 2016-2019 and of 43-62% for 2020); in particular, this can be observed in city stations, because of the current reduction in anthropogenic emissions related to traffic and industrial activities. A different trend with no reductions was observed for NH3 emissions, as agricultural activities have not stopped during the lockdown. Air quality is affected by many variables, for which making conclusions requires a holistic perspective. Therefore, all sectors must play a role to contribute to the reduction of harmful pollutants.","Lovarelli, Daniela; Conti, Cecilia; Finzi, Alberto; Bacenetti, Jacopo; Guarino, Marcella",Environ Res,610,1

Therapeutic options remain limited, and vaccines may exhibit narrow efficacy, due to short supplies, delays in distribution and the emergence of new resistant strains. It is mandatory to study new therapeutic approaches that modulate the strong inflammatory response observed in the lung, prevent respiratory failure and improve outcomes. The study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in vivo is challenging due to the necessary biosafety laboratory regulations. Thus, we developed an acute lung injury model by intratracheally instilling the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S protein (400 µg/kg, 2 ml/kg body weight) in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that overexpress the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S, ACE2, and investigated outcomes 72 hours later. Mice exhibited an acute decline in body weight during the first 48 hours following instillation, compared to saline-instilled controls. At 72 hours, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated a dramatic increase in white blood cell content, particularly neutrophils, and marked proteinosis compared to controls. Histologic examination of lung tissue revealed hyaline membranes, alveolar septal thickening, and a large number of neutrophils in the interstitial and alveolar spaces of Spike protein S exposed mice. We propose that a single exposure of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S subunit S1 may represent a valid model of COVID-19, allow the study of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung injury and be useful in the investigation of potential new therapeutic approaches to the management of COVID-19 as well as future coronavirus-dependent respiratory diseases.","Solopov, Pavel Colunga Biancatelli Ruben Sharlow Elizabeth Lazo John Catravas John",The FASEB Journal,610,25

PCD diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to challenges with different diagnostic modalities. Ciliary videomicroscopy, using Digital High-Speed Videomicroscopy (DHSV), one of the diagnostic tools for PCD, is considered the optimal method to perform ciliary functional analysis (CFA), comprising of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and beat pattern (CBP) analysis. However, DHSV lacks standardized, published operating procedure for processing and analyzing samples. It also uses living respiratory epithelium, a significant infection control issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. To continue providing a diagnostic service during this health crisis, the ciliary videomicroscopy protocol has been adapted to include adequate infection control measures. Here, we describe a revised protocol for sampling and laboratory processing of ciliated respiratory samples, highlighting adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control measures. Representative results of CFA from nasal brushing samples obtained from 16 healthy subjects, processed and analyzed according to this protocol, are described. We also illustrate the importance of obtaining and processing optimal quality epithelial ciliated strips, as samples not meeting quality selection criteria do now allow for CFA, potentially decreasing the diagnostic reliability and the efficiency of this technique.","Bricmont, Noemie; Benchimol, Lionel; Poirrier, Anne-Lise; Grignet, Christine; Seaton, Claire; Chilvers, Mark A; Seghaye, Marie-Christine; Louis, Renaud; Lefebvre, Philippe; Kempeneers, Celine",J. vis. exp,610,3

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective international survey, we captured echocardiography findings in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 between 3 and 20 April 2020. Patient characteristics, indications, findings, and impact of echocardiography on management were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of echocardiographic abnormalities. A total of 1216 patients [62 (52-71) years, 70% male] from 69 countries across six continents were included. Overall, 667 (55%) patients had an abnormal echocardiogram. Left and right ventricular abnormalities were reported in 479 (39%) and 397 (33%) patients, respectively, with evidence of new myocardial infarction in 36 (3%), myocarditis in 35 (3%), and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in 19 (2%). Severe cardiac disease (severe ventricular dysfunction or tamponade) was observed in 182 (15%) patients. In those without pre-existing cardiac disease (n = 901), the echocardiogram was abnormal in 46%, and 13% had severe disease. Independent predictors of left and right ventricular abnormalities were distinct, including elevated natriuretic peptides [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-5.05) and cardiac troponin (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.13-2.53) for the former, and severity of COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.73-6.10) for the latter.

Schools were closed and contact with other people was limited. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we aimed to investigate the mental/social health of children/adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Two representative samples of Dutch children/adolescents (8-18 years) before COVID-19 (2018, N = 2401) and during lockdown (April 2020, N = 844) were compared on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: global health, peer relationships, anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger, sleep-related impairment by linear mixed models and calculating relative risks (RR (95% CI)) for the proportion of severe scores. Variables associated with worse mental/social health during COVID-19 were explored through multivariable regression models. The impact of COVID-19 regulations on the daily life of children was qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Participants reported worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before (absolute mean difference range 2.1-7.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.9). During lockdown, more children reported severe Anxiety (RR = 1.95 (1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (RR = 1.89 (1.29-2.78) and fewer children reported poor Global Health (RR = 0.36 (0.20-0.65)). Associated factors with worse mental/social health were single-parent family, &#8805; three children in the family, negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and a relative/friend infected with COVID-19.

Association of cutaneous signs and symptoms with COVID-19 is being studied worldwide, principally, to determine if these dermatoses can help in early recognition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These dermatological manifestations can range from erythematous rash, urticaria to livedo reticularis, and acrocyanosis in patients of all age groups. Correspondingly, dermatologists treating COVID-19 patients, suffering from inflammatory dermatoses, with biologics or immunomodulators should exert caution and use specific protocols to adjust the doses of these medications. Prevention of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 is being promoted universally, with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand washes, and hand sanitizers around the clock.

Although the RBD peptide subunit is easily manufactured and highly stable, RBD-based subunit vaccines have been hampered by its poor inherent immunogenicity. We hypothesize that this limitation can be overcome by sustained co-administration alongside a potent and optimized adjuvant. The innate immune second messenger, cGAMP, holds promise as it activates the potent anti-viral STING pathway, but has exhibited poor performance as a therapeutic due to its nonspecific pharmacodynamic profiles when administered systemically and its poor pharmacokinetics arising from rapid excretion and degradation by its hydrolase ENPP1. To overcome these limitations, we sought to mimic the natural scenario of viral infections by creating an artificial immunological niche that enables slow release of cGAMP and the RBD antigen. Specifically, we co-encapsulated cGAMP and RBD in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system. This cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel vaccine elicited more potent, durable, and broad antibody responses and improved neutralization than both dose-matched bolus controls and a hydrogel-based vaccine lacking cGAMP. The cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel platform developed is suitable for delivery of other antigens and may provide enhanced immunity against a broad range of pathogens.","Gale, Emily C; Lahey, Lauren J; Böhnert, Volker; Powell, Abigail E; Ou, Ben S; Carozza, Jacqueline A; Li, Lingyin; Appel, Eric",,610,30

In the present study, chemopreventive effects of oat and barley (beta®barley) kernels were investigated. In order to address the impact of thermal processing on these effects, kernels were roasted (150-180 °C, approx. 20 min), digested and fermented using an In Vitro human digestion model. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia were determined in fermentation supernatants (FS). Growth inhibition, apoptosis, DNA integrity and gene expression of catalase were analyzed in LT97 colon adenoma cells. Concentrations of SCFA, particularly butyrate, were higher in oat/barley FS (2.2-fold, on average), while ammonia levels were significantly lower (0.7-fold, on average) than in the fermentation control. Treatment of LT97 cells with FS of oat/barley kernels led to a significant time- and dose-dependent growth reduction, a significant increase in caspase-3 activity and enhanced levels of catalase mRNA, without exhibiting genotoxic effects. In general, the results indicate a chemopreventive potential of In Vitro fermented oat and waxy winter barley mediated mainly by growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects, which are preserved after thermal processing.","Schlörmann, Wiebke; Atanasov, Julia; Lorkowski, Stefan; Dawczynski, Christine; Glei, Michael",Nutr Cancer,610,20

Papain-like protease (PLpro) is one of two SARS-CoV-2 proteases potentially targetable with antivirals. PLpro is an attractive target because it plays an essential role in cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex, and disruption of host responses. We report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme. We determined the high resolution structure of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors. This collection of structures details inhibitors recognition and interactions providing fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight into PLpro. All compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, some block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These findings will accelerate structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro to identify high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value.","Osipiuk, Jerzy; Azizi, Saara-Anne; Dvorkin, Steve; Endres, Michael; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Jones, Krysten A; Kang, Soowon; Kathayat, Rahul S; Kim, Youngchang; Lisnyak, Vladislav G; Maki, Samantha L; Nicolaescu, Vlad; Taylor, Cooper A; Tesar, Christine; Zhang, Yu-An; Zhou, Zhiyao; Randall, Glenn; Michalska, Karolina; Snyder, Scott A; Dickinson, Bryan C; Joachimiak, Andrzej",Nat Commun,610,16

However, SCADA system has become the most profitable and alluring target for ransomware attackers. This paper proposes the deep learning-based novel ransomware detection framework in the SCADA controlled electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) with the performance analysis of three deep learning algorithms, namely deep neural network (DNN), 1D convolution neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. All three-deep learning-based simulated frameworks achieve around 97% average accuracy (ACC), more than 98% of the average area under the curve (AUC), and an average F1-score under 10-fold stratified cross-validation with an average false alarm rate (FAR) less than 1.88%. Ransomware driven distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack tends to shift the SOC profile by exceeding the SOC control thresholds. The severity has been found to increase as the attack progress and penetration increases. Also, ransomware driven false data injection (FDI) attack has the potential to damage the entire BES or physical system by manipulating the SOC control thresholds. It's a design choice and optimization issue that a deep learning algorithm can deploy based on the tradeoffs between performance metrics.","Basnet, Manoj; Poudyal, Subash; Ali, Mohd.

Recent studies have revealed that diverse types of assays bear limited predictive power for COVID-19 outcomes. Here, we harness the predictive power of chest CT in combination with plasma cytokines using a machine learning approach for predicting death during hospitalization and maximum severity degree in COVID-19 patients. Patients (n=152) from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York with plasma cytokine assessment and a chest CT within 5 days from admission were included. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory variables, including plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-) were collected from the electronic medical record. We found that chest CT combined with plasma cytokines were good predictors of death (AUC 0.78) and maximum severity (AUC 0.82), whereas CT quantitative was better at predicting severity (AUC 0.81 vs 0.70) while cytokine measurements better predicted death (AUC 0.70 vs 0.66). Finally, we provide a simple scoring system using plasma IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, GGO to aerated lung ratio and age as novel metrics that may be used to monitor patients upon hospitalization and help physicians make critical decisions and considerations for patients at high risk of death for COVID-19.","Carbonell, Guillermo; Valle, Diane Marie Del; Gonzalez-Kozlova, Edgar E; Marinelli, Brett; Klein, Emma; Homsi, Maria El; Stocker, Daniel; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Simons, Nicole; Xiang, Jiani; Nirenberg, Sharon; Kovatch, Patricia; Lewis, Sara; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha; Taouli, Bachir",,610,16

A direct home-delivery service of the RM communicator has been implemented at 49 Italian arrhythmia centers. METHODS: According to individual patient preference or the organizational decision of the center, patients were assigned to the home-delivery group or the standard in-clinic delivery group. In the former case, patients received telephone training on the activation process and use of the communicator. In June 2020, the centers were asked to reply to an ad hoc questionnaire to describe and evaluate their experience in the previous 3 months. RESULTS: RM was activated in 1324 patients: 821 (62%) received the communicator at home and the communicator was activated remotely. Activation required one additional call in 49% of cases, and the median time needed to complete the activation process was 15 min [25th-75th percentile: 10-20]. 753 (92%) patients were able to complete the correct activation of the system. At the time when the questionnaire was completed, 743 (90%) communicators were regularly transmitting data. The service was generally deemed useful (96% of respondents) in facilitating the activation of RM during the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Home delivery of the communicator proved to be a successful approach to system activation, and received positive feedback from clinicians. The increased use of a RM protocol will reduce risks for both providers and patients, while maintaining high-quality care.","Magnocavallo, Michele; Bernardini, Alessia; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Piro, Agostino; Marini, Massimiliano; Nicosia, Antonino; Adduci, Carmen; Rapacciuolo, Antonio; Saporito, Davide; Grossi, Stefano; Santarpia, Giuseppe; Vaccaro, Paola; Rordorf, Roberto; Pentimalli, Francesco; Giunta, Giuseppe; Campari, Monica; Valsecchi, Sergio; Lavalle, Carlo",Pacing clin. electrophysiol,610,30

This study investigates the antibiotic resistance patterns and APEC-associated virulence genes content in Escherichia coli isolated from non-healthy and healthy broiler chickens from a commercial poultry farm in Qatar. A total of 158 E. coli strains were isolated from 47 chickens from five different organs (air sac, cloacal, kidney, liver, and trachea).

The genes ompT, hlyF, iroN, tsh, vat, iss, cvi/cva, and iucD were significantly prevalent in all APEC strains. E. coli isolates showed 96% resistance to at least one of the 18 antibiotics, with high resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and fosfomycin. Our findings indicate high antibiotic resistance prevalence in non-healthy and healthy chicken carcasses. Such resistant E. coli can spread to humans.

In the case of staff, age > 50 years (2.10, p < 0.001), obesity (1.19, p = 0.01), being a health-aide (1.94, p < 0.001), working in a center with high seroprevalence in residents (3.49, p < 0.001), and contact with external cases of COVID-19 (1.52, p < 0.001) were factors associated with seropositivity. Past symptoms of COVID-19 were good predictors of seropositivity for residents (5.41, p < 0.001) and staff (2.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Level of dependency influences risk of COVID-19 among residents. Individual and work factors, and contacts outside the nursing home are associated with COVID-19 exposure in staff members. It is key to strengthen control measures to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into care facilities from the community.","Candel, F J; Barreiro, P; San Román, J; Carretero, M M; Sanz, J C; Perez-Abeledo, M; Ramos, B; Viñuela-Prieto, J M; Canora, J; Martínez-Peromingo, F J; Barba, R; Zapatero, A",Age ageing,610,6

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING:: Seven musculoskeletal care centers with New York City and Long Island. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 138 recent and 115 historical hip fracture patients. INTERVENTION: Patients with hip fractures occurring between February 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 or between February 1, 2019 and April 15, 2019 were prospectively enrolled in an orthopedic trauma registry and chart reviewed for demographic and hospital quality measures. Patients with recent hip fractures were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs) or COVID negative (C-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Hospital quality measures, inpatient complications and mortality rates. RESULTS: Seventeen (12.2%) patients were confirmed C+ by testing and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus but were never tested. The C+ cohort, when compared to Cs and C- cohorts, had: an increased mortality rate (35.3% vs 7.1% vs 0.9%), increased length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a devastating effect on the care of hip fracture patients during the pandemic. Although practice patterns generally remained unchanged, treating physicians need to understand the increased morbidity and mortality in hip fracture patients complicated by COVID-19.

We explored whether extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and a master regulator of innate immunity and inflammation, is a potential ARDS therapeutic target. METHODS: Wild type C57BL/6J or endothelial cell (EC)-cNAMPT -/- knockout mice (targeted EC NAMPT deletion) were exposed to either a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (""one-hit"") or a combined LPS/ventilator (""two-hit"")-induced acute inflammatory lung injury model. A NAMPT-specific mAb imaging probe (99mTc-ProNamptorTM) was used to detect NAMPT expression in lung tissues. Either an eNAMPT-neutralising goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) or a humanised monoclonal antibody (ALT-100â mAb) were utilised in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical, biochemical, and imaging studies validated time-dependent increases in NAMPT lung tissue expression in both preclinical ARDS models. Intravenous delivery of either eNAMPT-neutralising pAb/mAb significantly attenuated inflammatory lung injury (H & E staining, BAL protein, BAL PMNs, plasma IL-6) in both preclinical models. In vitro human lung EC studies demonstrated eNAMPT-neutralising antibodies (pAb, mAb) to strongly abrogate eNAMPT-induced TLR4 pathway activation and EC barrier disruption. In vivo studies in wild type and EC-cNAMPT -/- mice confirmed a highly significant contribution of EC-derived NAMPT to the severity of inflammatory lung injury in both preclinical ARDS models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight both the role of EC-derived eNAMPT and the potential for biologic targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway. In combination with predictive eNAMPT biomarker and NAMPT genotyping assays, this offers the opportunity to identify high-risk ARDS subjects for delivery of personalised medicine.","Quijada, Hector; Bermudez, Tadeo; Kempf, Carrie L; Valera, Daniel G; Garcia, Alexander N; Camp, Sara M; Song, Jin H; Franco, Evelyn; Burt, Jessica K; Sun, Belinda; Mascarenhas, Joseph B; Burns, Kimberlie; Gaber, Amir; Oita, Radu C; Reyes Hernon, Vivian; Barber, Christy; Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana; Sun, Xiaoguang; Cress, Anne E; Martin, Diego; Liu, Zhonglin; Desai, Ankit A; Natarajan, Viswanathan; Jacobson, Jeffrey R; Dudek, Steven M; Bime, Christian; Sammani, Saad; Garcia, Joe G N",Eur. respir. j,610,24

DESIGN: Time series study of high income countries. SETTING: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mortality data from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database for 2016-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess deaths (observed deaths versus expected deaths predicted by model) in 2020, by sex and age (0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model that accounts for temporal trends and seasonal variability in mortality. RESULTS: An estimated 979 000 (95% confidence interval 954 000 to 1 001 000) excess deaths occurred in 2020 in the 29 high income countries analysed. All countries had excess deaths in 2020, except New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. The five countries with the highest absolute number of excess deaths were the US (458 000, 454 000 to 461 000), Italy (89 100, 87 500 to 90 700), England and Wales (85 400, 83 900 to 86 800), Spain (84 100, 82 800 to 85 300), and Poland (60 100, 58 800 to 61 300). New Zealand had lower overall mortality than expected (-2500, -2900 to -2100). In many countries, the estimated number of excess deaths substantially exceeded the number of reported deaths from covid-19. The highest excess death rates (per 100 000) in men were in Lithuania (285, 259 to 311), Poland (191, 184 to 197), Spain (179, 174 to 184), Hungary (174, 161 to 188), and Italy (168, 163 to 173); the highest rates in women were in Lithuania (210, 185 to 234), Spain (180, 175 to 185), Hungary (169, 156 to 182), Slovenia (158, 132 to 184), and Belgium (151, 141 to 162). Little evidence was found of subsequent compensatory reductions following excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Approximately one million excess deaths occurred in 2020 in these 29 high income countries. Age standardised excess death rates were higher in men than women in almost all countries. Excess deaths substantially exceeded reported deaths from covid-19 in many countries, indicating that determining the full impact of the pandemic on mortality requires assessment of excess deaths. Many countries had lower deaths than expected in children <15 years. Sex inequality in mortality widened further in most countries in 2020.","Islam, Nazrul; Shkolnikov, Vladimir M; Acosta, Rolando J; Klimkin, Ilya; Kawachi, Ichiro; Irizarry, Rafael A; Alicandro, Gianfranco; Khunti, Kamlesh; Yates, Tom; Jdanov, Dmitri A; White, Martin; Lewington, Sarah; Lacey, Ben",BMJ,610,30

METHODS: A total of 2601 women living in Spain aged 14-35 years completed questionnaire measures of SNS use, self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. In the survey, participants were asked about their use of SNS at the moment of answering the survey and before lockdown. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase was found in the frequency of use of all studied SNS (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook) during lockdown, as well as in the number of women following appearance-focused Instagram accounts. Moreover, significant relationships were found between the frequency of Instagram use and body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and low self-esteem in the younger age group (14-24), and between the frequency of Instagram use and drive for thinness in the older age group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram was related to body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness in the younger group, and only to drive for thinness in the older group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram and a higher frequency of use of Instagram significantly predicted higher levels of drive for thinness. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lockdown has had an impact on SNS use, and this might be linked to increased drive for thinness and eating disorder risk among adolescent and young women.","Vall-Roqué, Helena; Andrés, Ana; Saldaña, Carmina",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,610,16

Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists with a transparent approach enable their analysands/patients to participate in the course of the analytic work. Transparency and participation jointly facilitate the shared reflection on internal and interactive processes. These processes may take the form of introjective identification. Transparency and participation create an atmosphere in which the dyad has a better grasp of unconscious aspects in the introjective identification. After clarification of the terms transparency and participation and the theoretical background, a case report is presented showcasing crucial interactions in which the mechanism of introjective identification and the internal dramaturgy of both participants is demonstrated. The case report is connected to the theoretical part in the concluding remarks. In the analytic situation the process of introjective identification bridges the gap between the analysand’s and the analyst’s unconscious themes: as a result the psychoanalyst can discover unconscious affects reaching the inner world originally stemming from the unconscious of the analysand/patient. A fertile interplay emerges within the analyst, which can be communicated to the analysand and is then present in the dyadic analytic experience. Transparency and participation are valuable technical means to discover and understand the unconscious part of introjective identification in all its ramifications.","Dreyer, Karl-Albrecht",Forum Psychoanal.,610,24

Objectives: This study aims to investigate the relationship between resilience and somatization, as well as the underlying possible mediating and moderating mechanism, in a large sample of Chinese participants receiving a crisis intervention during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Methods: Participants were invited online to complete demographic information and questionnaires. The Symptom Checklist-90 somatization subscale, 10-item Connor-Davidson resilience scale, and 10-item Perceived Stress Scale were measured. Results: A total of 2,557 participants were included. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that lower resilience was associated with more somatic symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). The conditional process model was proved (indirect effect = -0.01, 95% confidence interval = [-0.015, -0.002]). The interaction effects between perceived stress and sex predicted somatization (b = 0.05, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Resilience is a key predictor of somatization. The mediating effects of perceived stress between resilience and somatization work in the context of sex difference. Sex-specific intervention by enhancing resilience is of implication for alleviating somatization during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic.","Shangguan, F.; Zhou, C.; Qian, W.; Zhang, C.; Liu, Z.; Zhang, X.

We use a novel dataset from one of the largest online grocery retailers to look at the impact on product stockouts and prices. We find that product availability falls by 10% for vegetables, fruits, and edible oils, but there is a minimal impact on their prices. On the farm-gate side, it is matched by a 20% fall in quantity arrivals of vegetables and fruits. We then show that supply chain disruption is the main driver behind this fall. We compute the distance to production zones from our retail centers and find that the fall in product availability and quantity arrivals is larger for items that are cultivated or manufactured farther from the final point of sale. Our results show that long-distance food supply chains have been hit the hardest during the current pandemic with welfare consequences for urban consumers and farmers.","Mahajan, Kanika; Tomar, Shekhar",American journal of agricultural economics,610,21

The anxiety levels (measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale) of the HP and PCP groups were compared using data collected from a cross-sectional study. The secondary variables included demographic and health data, confinement factors, contact with COVID-19 patients, having suffered from COVID-19, perceptions of protection, caregiver overload, threat, and satisfaction with management. We found anxiety ""case"" (35.6%) and ""at-risk"" (21%), with statistically significant differences in the group ""at risk"", and higher scores in the PCP group. The factors associated with the perception of threat and protection were significant determinants of an increase in anxiety, with all of them showing statistically significant differences. There were greater symptoms of anxiety in the PCP group than the HP group (32% vs. 18%). The factors associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms were the perceptions of threat, protection, management, caregiver overload, and perceived degree of threat associated with COVID-19.","Londoño-Ramírez, Ana C; García-Pla, Sandro; Bernabeu-Juan, Purificación; Pérez-Martínez, Enrique; Rodríguez-Marín, Jesús; van-der Hofstadt-Román, Carlos J",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,0

As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field.","Mora, Simone; Duarte, Fábio; Ratti, Carlo",HardwareX,610,15

The aim of our study was to investigate in asthmatic children the level of asthma control and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown. METHODS: Among asthmatic children attending our clinic, we identified those who had been prescribed the same therapy in March-April 2019 and March-April 2020. The level of asthma control (GINA-score) and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown (March-April 2020) were compared with those of March-April 2019. We separately analyzed a small group of children with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab during the lockdown. RESULTS: We enrolled 92 asthmatic children (67 males). Compared to 2019, in 2020 a higher proportion of children modified their maintenance therapy (38% vs. 15.2%, p < .001), with a significant increase in both the proportion of children who increased (p = .033) and in that of children who decreased their therapy (p = .026). The level of control resulted as significantly higher in 2020 (March p = .023; April p = .007). Also, the 13 children treated with Omalizumab showed a good level of control in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatic children, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a significant impact on their asthma control and on their attitude toward maintenance therapy.","Ferraro, Valentina Agnese; Zamunaro, Andrea; Spaggiari, Silvia; Di Riso, Daniela; Zanconato, Stefania; Carraro, Silvia",Immun Inflamm Dis,610,26

This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19-free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared with hospitals with no defined pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19-free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS: Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19-free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19-free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score-matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76). CONCLUSION: Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19-free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Glasbey, James C; Nepogodiev, Dmitri; Simoes, Joana F F; Omar, Omar; Li, Elizabeth; Venn, Mary L; Abou Chaar, Mohammad K; Capizzi, Vita; Chaudhry, Daoud; Desai, Anant; Edwards, Jonathan G; Evans, Jonathan P; Fiore, Marco; Videria, Jose Flavio; Ford, Samuel J; Ganly, Ian; Griffiths, Ewen A; Gujjuri, Rohan R; Kolias, Angelos G; Kaafarani, Haytham M A; Minaya-Bravo, Ana; McKay, Siobhan C; Mohan, Helen M; Roberts, Keith J; San Miguel-Méndez, Carlos; Pockney, Peter; Shaw, Richard; Smart, Neil J; Stewart, Grant D; Sundar Mrcog, Sudha; Vidya, Raghavan; Bhangu, Aneel A",J Clin Oncol,610,16

Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). RESULTS: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). CONCLUSIONS: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.","Almeda, Nerea; García-Alonso, Carlos; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",BMC Psychiatry,610,29

Neither therapeutic agents nor vaccines have been developed to date, which is a major drawback in controlling the present global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in more than 20,439,814 cases and 744,385 deaths. Each of the 3C-like (3CL) proteases of the three CoVs is essential for the proliferation of the CoVs, and an inhibitor of the 3CL protease (3CLpro) is thought to be an ideal therapeutic agent against SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Among these, SARS-CoV is the first corona-virus isolated and has been studied in detail since the first pandemic in 2003. This article briefly reviews a series of studies on SARS-CoV, focusing on the development of inhibitors for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro based on molecular interactions with the 3CL protease.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using a nationally representative English primary care database comparing people aged >= 40 years who were recorded as being advised to shield using a fixed ratio of 1:1, matching to people with the same diagnoses not advised to shield (nâ¯=â¯77,360 per group). Time-to-death was compared using Cox regression, reporting the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between groups. A sensitivity analysis compared exact matched cohorts (nâ¯=â¯24,752 shielded, nâ¯=â¯61,566 exact matches). RESULTS: We found a time-varying HR of mortality between groups. In the first 21 days, the mortality risk in people shielding was half those not (HRâ¯=â¯0.50, 95%CI:0.41-0.59. p < 0.0001). Over the remaining nine weeks, mortality risk was 54% higher in the shielded group (HR=1.54, 95%CI:1.41-1.70, p < 0.0001). Beyond the shielding period, mortality risk was over two-and-a-half times higher in the shielded group (HR=2.61, 95%CI:2.38-2.87, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Shielding halved the risk of mortality for 21 days. Mortality risk became higher across the remainder of the shielding period, rising to two-and-a-half times greater post-shielding.

Methods: Patients and Methods Clinical characteristics of 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 5 patients with cHCoV pneumonia admitted to our institution and treated up to March 8, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Results: On admission, 10 patients had pneumonia, 5 of whom had pulmonary shadows detectable only via computed tomography (CT). During hospitalization, another patient with no pulmonary shadows on admission developed pneumonia. In total, 11 (78.6%) of the 14 patients developed pneumonia, indicating its high prevalence in COVID-19. During hospitalization, the patients' symptoms spontaneously relapsed and resolved, and gastrointestinal symptoms were frequently found. C-reactive protein values showed correlation with the patients' clinical courses. Ritonavir/lopinavir were administered to 5 patients whose respiratory conditions worsened during admission, all of whom improved. However, the pneumonia in the 6 other patients improved without antivirals. None of the 14 patients died, whereas 5 other patients with cHCoV pneumonia were in respiratory failure on admission, and one patient (20%) died. Conclusion: Both SARS-CoV-2 and cHCoV can cause severe pneumonia.

A multisite randomized clinical trial is testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM) for Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal disorders. This telephone-based intervention is delivered through a hub-and-spoke configuration. DESIGN: This study is a two-arm, parallel-group, 36-week, multisite randomized controlled single-blind trial. It will randomize 1,100 Veterans experiencing pain and seeking service-connection for musculoskeletal disorders to either SBIRT-PM or usual care across eight New England VA medical centers. The study balances pragmatic with explanatory methodological features. Primary outcomes are pain severity and number of substances misused. Nonpharmacological pain management and substance use services utilization are tracked in the trial. SUMMARY: Early trial enrollment targets were met across sites.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on severe COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammatory features admitted outside intensive care units (ICUs). Patients treated with intravenous TCZ in addition to standard of care were compared to patients treated with standard of care alone. Safety and efficacy were assessed over a 28-day follow-up. RESULTS: 65 patients were included. Among them, 32 were treated with TCZ. At baseline, all patients were on high-flow supplemental oxygen and most (78% of TCZ patients and 61% of standard treatment patients) were on non-invasive ventilation. During the 28-day follow-up, 69% of TCZ patients experienced a clinical improvement compared to 61% of standard treatment patients (p = 0.61). Mortality was 15% in the tocilizumab group and 33% in standard treatment group (p = 0.15).

It is a fact that prevention is better than cure and it is the first line of defence from infection. Traditional knowledge and practices which are very helpful to boost our body's immune system for the prevention of viruses are discussed in this paper. In this crisis, the traditional knowledge including culture and ethnomedicinal plants has long been and continues to be one of the strengths of indigenous communities. Further, many traditional healers, scientists, clinicians, experts have discussed various traditional herbs, which might be very effective against COVID-19. Ayurveda has spoken of very potent immune-booster plants such as Allium sativum, Andrographis paniculata, Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Withania somnifera, etc. These medicinal plants are also used in AIDS, respiratory diseases, influenza, and other viral diseases.

Recent analyses (ie, data from 2017 to 2019) show that only 11 countries are on track for meeting WHO's elimination targets. For a country to be truly on track, it is important that the majority of infected individuals be identified and treated. There is still a need for country and population-specific evaluations within the different HCV screening and treatment strategies available, in order to assess their cost-effectiveness and sustainability and support an evidence-based policy for HCV elimination. Any health policy model is affected by the diversity and quality of the available data and by gaps in data. Given the differences among countries, comparing progress based on fixed global targets will not necessarily be suitable in the same measure for each country. In a recent document, the European Collaborators of Polaris Observatory provide insight into the limitations of the current WHO targets. The absolute targets identified by each country in accordance with the measures set by WHO would be essential in reaching the HCV elimination. All analytic models to assess the progress towards HCV elimination are based on projections to 2030 not including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis-related services. With specific regard to the achievement of WHO hepatitis elimination goals, all measures that will be put in place during and after COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred in increasing diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.","Kondili, Loreta A; Craxì, Antonio; Aghemo, Alessio",Liver int,610,15

The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of postoperative mortality after emergent open colectomy for IC treatment. Additionally, we compared postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing emergent colectomy due to aortic surgery-related IC (AS-IC group) vs. other IC etiologies (Other-IC group). METHODS: We analyzed records of consecutive patients who underwent emergency open colectomy for IC between 2008 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and operative parameters associated with postoperative mortality. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups were compared for mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival. RESULTS: During the study period, 94 patients (mean age, 67.4 ± 13.7 years) underwent emergent open colectomy for IC. In the majority of cases, IC involved the entire colon (53.2%) and vasopressor agents were required preoperatively (63.8%) and/or intraoperatively (78.8%). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to AS-IC, whereas 60 due to Other-IC causes. In the AS-IC group, 9 patients had undergone endovascular aortic repair and 25 open aortic surgery; 61.8% of patients needed aortic surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). Overall, 66 patients (70.2%) died within 90 days from surgery. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups showed similar operative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. However, the duration of the ICU stay (19 days vs. 11 days; p = 0.003) and of the total hospital stay (22 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.016) was significantly longer for the AS-IC group than for the Other-IC group. The rate of intestinal continuity restoration at 1 year after surgery was higher for the Other-IC group than for the AS-IC group (58.8% vs. 22.2%; p = 0.05). In the multivariate model, preoperative increased lactate levels, a delay between signs/symptoms' onset and surgery > 12 h, and the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury were statistically associated with postoperative mortality. Neither IC etiology (aortic surgery vs. other etiology) nor ruptured AAA was associated with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Emergency open colectomy for IC is associated with high postoperative mortality, which appears to be unrelated to the IC etiology. Preoperative lactate levels, > 12-h delay to surgery, and postoperative acute kidney injury are independent predictors of postoperative mortality.","Beghdadi, Nassiba; Reitano, Elisa; Cochennec, Frederic; Desgranges, Pascal; Amiot, Aurelien; Sobhani, Iradj; Mongardon, Nicolas; Langeron, Olivier; Notarnicola, Margherita; Mulé, Sébastien; Luciani, Alain; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Laurent, Alexis; Sommacale, Daniele; Brunetti, Francesco; De039,; Angelis, Nicola",World J Emerg Surg,610,1

Unlike other decomposition methods, STR allows for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, covariates, seasonal patterns that may have non-integer periods, and seasonality with complex topology. It can be used for time series with any regular time index including hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly data. It is competitive with existing methods when they exist, but tackles many more decomposition problem than other methods allow. STR is based on a regularized optimization, and so is somewhat related to ridge regression. Because it is based on a statistical model, we can easily compute confidence intervals for components, something that is not possible with most existing decomposition methods (such as STL, X-12-ARIMA, SEATS-TRAMO, etc.).

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the predictive power of the decrease in LA strain in AF population and hypothesize that the difference in LA strain between reference values could be used in a stratified way for prognostication. METHODS: Echocardiography examination was performed using the GE system. The standard score of LA strain (ZLA) was calculated, and patients were classified into five groups: Z0 (0 to -1), Z-1 (-1 to -2), Z-2 (-2 to -3), Z-3, (-3 to -4), and Z-4 (&#8804;-4). The clinical end point was an ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1,364 subjects with AF (71.4 ± 12.1 years; 55.6%, men), 105 encountered ischemic strokes during a mean follow-up duration of 3.1 ± 1.6 years. No patients in the Z0 and Z-1 groups encountered ischemic stroke. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher rates of stroke in worse ZLA groups. Compared with the Z-2 group, a significantly increased risk of stroke was found in the Z-3 (hazard ratio [HR], 3.697; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.966-6.951; p < 0.001) and Z-4 (HR, 6.447; 95% CI, 2.990-13.904; p < 0.001) groups in univariate Cox regression analysis. The results remained consistent after multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The decrease of LA strain could be applied in a stratified manner and is significantly associated with the risk of stroke independent from baseline covariates.","Liao, Jo-Nan; Chao, Tze-Fan; Hung, Chung-Lieh; Chen, Shih-Ann",Heart rhythm,610,20

In all these dire situations, the accuracy of fluid delivered according to a prescribed dose can be critical. Microflow applications are growing in importance for a wide variety of scientific fields, namely drug development and administration, Organ-on-a-Chip, or bioanalysis, but accurate and reliable measurements are a tough challenge in micro-to-femto flow operating ranges, from 2.78×10-4 mL/s down to 2.78×10-7 mL/s (1000 μL/h down to 1 μL/h). Several sources of error have been established such as the mass measurement, the fluid evaporation dependent on the gravimetric methodology implemented, the tube adsorption and the repeatability, believed to be closely related to the operating mode of the stepper motor and drive screw pitch of a syringe pump. In addition, the difficulty in dealing with microflow applications extends to the evaluation of measurement uncertainty which will qualify the quality of measurement. This is due to the conditions entailed when measuring very small values, close to zero, of a quantity such as the flow rate which is inherently positive. Alternative methods able to handle these features were developed and implemented, and their suitability will be discussed.","Sousa, J.

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset.AimTo determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type.MethodsWe used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once.ResultsThe probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.ConclusionNP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","Wikramaratna, Paul S; Paton, Robert S; Ghafari, Mahan; Lourenço, José",Euro surveill,610,16

The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma.

Although several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. In addition, there are limited reports of saliva as the sample source, and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay from saliva using a two-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10 min RT step is performed with only B3 and backward inner primers before the final reaction. We show that while the one-step RT-LAMP demonstrates satisfactory results, the optimized two-step approach allows detection of only few molecules per reaction and performs significantly better than the one-step RT-LAMP and conventional two-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT step. We show control measurements with RT-PCR, and importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from viral transport media and saliva clinical samples.","Ganguli, Anurup; Mostafa, Ariana; Berger, Jacob; Lim, Jongwon; Araud, Elbashir; Baek, Janice; Stewart de Ramirez, Sarah A; Baltaji, Ali; Roth, Kelly; Aamir, Muhammad; Aedma, Surya; Mady, Mohamed; Mahajan, Pranav; Sathe, Sanjivani; Johnson, Mark; White, Karen; Kumar, James; Valera, Enrique; Bashir, Rashid",Anal Chem,610,1

This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the ICU. An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using RT-qPCR. Predictive models were constructed using LASSO regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI)â¯=â¯0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI)â¯=â¯0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, CRP or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variablesâ¯=â¯0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay.

SARS-CoV-2 shares both high sequence similarity and the use of the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have provided bioinformatic evidence of potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. However, whether the reproductive system is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined. Here, we investigate the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testes at the level of single-cell transcriptomes. The results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicates that Gene Ontology (GO) categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission are highly enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia, while male gamete generation related terms are downregulated. Cell-cell junction and immunity-related GO terms are increased in ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells, but mitochondria and reproduction-related GO terms are decreased. These findings provide evidence that the human testis is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this rapidly spreading disease.","Wang, Zhengpin; Xu, Xiaojiang",,610,23

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths at small-area resolution, identify localised areas in space-time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at high spatial resolution in coming weeks. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical space-time SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), 6791 units] and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34 of 2020), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial-temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Reductions in population mobility during the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have significantly contributed to the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates. A geographically staggered re-introduction of intensified social distancing measures is advised and limited cross MSOA movement if the magnitude and geographic extent of the second wave is to be reduced.","Sartorius, B; Lawson, A B; Pullan, R L",Sci Rep,610,29

In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/µl, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.","Huang, Di; Shi, Zhuwei; Qian, Jiajie; Bi, Ke; Fang, Mengjun; Xu, Zhinan",Biotechnol Bioeng,610,26

The difference in the incidence of violence between general population and people with a psychiatric or social disorder (like drug abuse and criminal background) in both periods were also compared using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: During the first COVID-19 outbreak, there were 6 violence cases against medical staff out of 24,740 visits to the ED, vs. 21 cases out of 30,759 visits during the same periods in 2019 (P < 0.05). There were 19 violence cases in the whole hospital with 14,482 admissions in 2020 vs. 51 violence cases of 17,599 admissions in 2019 (P < 0.05). Violence against security guards in the entire hospital dropped from 20 to 11 cases, and in the set of the ED, from 13 to 4 cases in both periods respectively. A 20 % decrease in the number of visits to the ED, might have influenced the average LOS during the study period, 2020 compared to 2019 (4.4 + 0.45 vs. 5.4 + 0.36 h. (P < 0.001). The ratio of violence among general population vs. people with a psychiatric or social background revealed a non-significant change in both periods (P = 0.75 and P = 0.69) respectively. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 outbreak supplied some evidence that a change in environmental conditions, trust, waiting time, personal attitude and communication might have reduced violence against hospital staff. CONCLUSIONS: Except for violence coming from patients with psychiatric or social disorders, most other violence cases might be reduced if the environment conditions and attitudes of both citizens and staff are improved.","Basis, Fuad; Moskovitz, Kobi; Tzafrir, Shay",Isr J Health Policy Res,610,9

However, the clinical features of MIS-C and the differences from Kawasaki disease remain unknown. The study aims to investigate the epidemiology and clinical course of MIS-C. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched through August 30, 2020. Observational studies describing MIS-C were included. Data regarding demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory, echocardiography and radiology findings, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were identified including 917 MIS-C patients. The mean age was 9.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-10.1). The pooled proportions of Hispanic and Black cases were 34.6% (95% CI, 28.3-40.9) and 31.5% (95% CI, 24.8-38.1), respectively. The common manifestations were gastrointestinal symptoms (87.3%; 95% CI, 82.9-91.6) and cardiovascular involvement such as myocardial dysfunction (55.3%; 95% CI, 42.4-68.2), coronary artery aneurysms (21.7%; 95% CI, 12.8-30.1) and shock (65.8%; 95% CI, 51.1-80.4), with marked elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. The majority of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (81.0%; 95% CI, 75.0-86.9), aspirin (67.3%; 95% CI, 48.8-85.7), and corticosteroids (63.6%; 95% CI, 53.4-73.8) with a variety of anti-inflammatory agents. Although myocardial dysfunction improved in 55.1% (95% CI, 33.4-76.8) at discharge, the rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was 6.3% (95% CI, 2.8-9.8) and the mortality was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.0-2.8). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C leads to multiple organ failure, including gastrointestinal manifestations, myocardial dysfunction and coronary abnormalities, and has distinct features from Kawasaki disease.","Yasuhara, Jun; Watanabe, Kae; Takagi, Hisato; Sumitomo, Naokata; Kuno, Toshiki",Pediatr. pulmonol,610,1

Wastewater samples were collected from four sewage treatment plants (STPs), five sewage pumping stations (SPSs) and at different time intervals from a suburban hospital wastewater (HWW). Four different methods of wastewater concentrations viz., composite (COM), supernatant (SUP), sediment (SED), and syringe filtration (SYR) were subjected to quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Unlike HWW, STP inlet, sludge and SPS samples were found with higher loading of SARS-CoV-2 by SED followed by SUP method. Given the higher levels of dissolved and suspended solids in STPs and SPSs over HWW, we suspect that this enveloped virus might exhibit the tendency of higher partitioning in solid phase. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were < 30 in 50% of the HWW samples indicating higher viral load from the COVID-19 infected patients. In the STP outlets, a strict decline of biochemical oxygen demand, >95% removal of caffeine, and absence of viral copies reflect the efficiency of the treatment plants in Chennai city. Among the detected OTs, a combination of maximum dynamic range and high concurrence percentage was observed for caffeine and N1 gene of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we suggest that caffeine can be used as an indicator for the removal of SARS-CoV-2 by STPs. Our predicted estimated number of cases are in line with the available clinical data from the catchments. Densely distributed population of the Koyambedu catchment could be partly responsible for the high proportion of estimated infected individuals during the study period.","Chakraborty, Paromita; Pasupuleti, Mukesh; Jai Shankar, M R; Bharat, Girija K; Krishnasamy, Sundar; Dasgupta, Sakshi Chadha; Sarkar, Shyamal Kumar; Jones, Kevin C",Sci Total Environ,610,20

However, its successful application to medical images is severely handicapped with the limited amount of annotated training data. Transfer learning is commonly adopted for the medical imaging tasks. However, a large covariant shift between the source domain of natural images and target domain of medical images results in poor transfer learning. Moreover, scarcity of annotated data for the medical imaging tasks causes further problems for effective transfer learning. To address these problems, we develop an augmented ensemble transfer learning technique that leads to significant performance gain over the conventional transfer learning. Our technique uses an ensemble of deep learning models, where the architecture of each network is modified with extra layers to account for dimensionality change between the images of source and target data domains. Moreover, the model is hierarchically tuned to the target domain with augmented training data. Along with the network ensemble, we also utilize an ensemble of dictionaries that are based on features extracted from the augmented models. The dictionary ensemble provides an additional performance boost to our method. We first establish the effectiveness of our technique with the challenging ChestXray-14 radiography data set. Our experimental results show more than 50% reduction in the error rate with our method as compared to the baseline transfer learning technique. We then apply our technique to a recent COVID-19 data set for binary and multi-class classification tasks. Our technique achieves 99.49% accuracy for the binary classification, and 99.24% for multi-class classification.","Altaf, Fouzia; Islam, Syed M S; Janjua, Naeem Khalid",Neural Comput Appl,610,1

However, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 of pets from households with no COVID-19 cases or stray animals remains less assessed. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90), we investigated the infection and previous exposure of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Both the feature-based and neural-networks-based approaches have delivered promising results. However, the frequently minor fluctuations of the stock prices restrict learning the sentiment of text from price patterns, and learning market sentiment from text can be biased if the text is irrelevant to the underlying market. In addition, when using discrete word features, the polarity of a certain term can change over time according to different events. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage system that consists of a sentiment extractor to extract the opinion on the market trend and a summarizer that predicts the direction of the index movement of following week given the opinions of the news over the current week. We adopt BERT with multitask learning which additionally predicts the worthiness of the news and propose a metric called Polarity-Over-Time to extract the word polarity among different event periods.

The overall sensitivity in the group of N protein-based assays ranged from 66.7 to 77.8% and in the S protein-based-assays from 71.1 to 75.6%. Five follow-up samples of three individuals were only detected in either an S and/or N protein-based assay, indicating an individual different immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the influence of the used assay in the detection of IgG antibodies. This should be further analysed. The specificity of the examined assays was &#8805; 97%. However, because of the low or unknown prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the examined assays in this study are currently primarily eligible for epidemiological investigations, as they have limited information in individual testing.","Kohmer, Niko; Westhaus, Sandra; Rühl, Cornelia; Ciesek, Sandra; Rabenau, Holger F",J Clin Virol,610,1

Immunoinformatics approach in vaccine design takes advantage of antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes present on the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to elicit immune responses. T cells and B cells epitopes were predicted, and the selected residues were subjected to allergenicity, antigenicity and toxicity screening which were linked by appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope subunit vaccine. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine construct was analyzed and the molecular weight, molecular formula, theoretical isoelectric point value, half-life, solubility score, instability index, aliphatic index and GRAVY were predicted. The vaccine structure was constructed, refined, validated, and disulfide engineered to get the best model. Molecular binding simulation and molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to predict the stability and binding affinity of the vaccine construct with TLRs. Codon acclimatization and in silico cloning were performed to confirm the vaccine expression and potency. Results obtained indicated that this novel vaccine candidate is non-toxic, capable of initiating the immunogenic response and will not induce an allergic reaction. The highest binding energy was observed in TLR 4 (-1398.1) and the least is TLR 2 (-1479. 6). The steady rise in Th (helper) cell population with memory development was noticed and IFN-g was provoked after simulation. At this point, the vaccine candidate awaits animal trial to validate its efficacy and safety for use in the prevention of the novel COVID-19 infections.","Oladipo, Elijah Kolawole; Ajayi, Ayodeji Folorunsho; Ariyo, Olumuyiwa Elijah; Onile, Samson Olugbenga; Jimah, Esther Moradeyo; Ezediuno, Odinakaose Louis; Adebayo, Oluwadunsin Iyanuoluwa; Adebayo, Emmanuel Tayo; Odeyemi, Aduragbemi Noah; Oyeleke, Marvellous Oluwaseun; Oyewole, Moyosoluwa Precious; Oguntomi, Ayomide Samuel; Akindiya, Olawumi Elizabeth; Olamoyegun, Bunmi Olayemi; Aremu, Victoria Oyetayo; Arowosaye, Abiola O; Aboderin, Dorcas Olubunmi; Bello, B Habibat; Senbadejo, Y Tosin; Awoyelu, Elukunbi Hilda; Oladipo, Adio Abayomi; Oladipo, Bukola Bisola; Ajayi, Lydia Oluwatoyin; Majolagbe, Olusola Nathaniel; Oyawoye, Olubukola Monisola; Oloke, Julius Kola",Inform Med Unlocked,610,26

Here we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in the serum, saliva and broncho-alveolar fluid of 159 patients with COVID-19. Early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were dominated by IgA antibodies. Peripheral expansion of IgA plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. The virus-specific antibody responses included IgG, IgM and IgA, but IgA contributed to virus neutralization to a greater extent compared with IgG. Specific IgA serum concentrations decreased notably one month after the onset of symptoms, but neutralizing IgA remained detectable in saliva for a longer time (days 49 to 73 post symptoms). These results represent a critical observation given the emerging information as to the types of antibodies associated with optimal protection against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider targeting a potent but potentially short-lived IgA response.","Sterlin, Delphine; Mathian, Alexis; Miyara, Makoto; Mohr, Audrey; Anna, François; Claër, Laetitia; Quentric, Paul; Fadlallah, Jehane; Devilliers, Hervé; Ghillani, Pascale; Gunn, Cary; Hockett, Rick; Mudumba, Sasi; Guihot, Amélie; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Mayaux, Julien; Beurton, Alexandra; Fourati, Salma; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier; Lacorte, Jean-Marc; Yssel, Hans; Parizot, Christophe; Dorgham, Karim; Charneau, Pierre; Amoura, Zahir; Gorochov, Guy",Sci. transl. med,610,20

Particularly, we concentrate on the so-called PT-broken phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian turn out to be a complex conjugate pair. In this case, we find that the transition probabilities will be unbounded in the limit of infinite time $t \to +\infty$. After making a connection between the PT-broken phase and the neutral-meson system in particle physics, we observe that the infinite-time behavior of the transition probabilities can be attributed to the negative decay width of one eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We also present some brief remarks on the situation at the so-called exceptional point, where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian coalesce.","Ohlsson, Tommy; Zhou, Shun",,610,4

OSA affects daily life and poses a severe threat to human health. The standard clinical method for identifying and predicting OSA events is the use of Polysomnography signals. In this paper, a novel scheme based on an ensemble of recurrence plots (RPs) and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (RPCNNs) is proposed to improve the prediction rate of OSA. First, RPs were used to represent the dynamic behavior of single electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for 60 s before and during OSA events. Then, using RPs, three prompt CNNs named ResNet-50 were fine-tuned, and their classification results were fused via the Majority Voting (MV) method to produce a final result concerning prediction. Next, the subject-independent Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) and subject-dependent 10-fold Cross-Validation (10-fold CV) methods were used to validate the prediction rate from signals derived from the University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database. Finally, the highest achieved average accuracy for the fusion level was 91.74% and 89.45% at the 10-fold CV and LOSO-CV. Additionally, our results outperformed state-of-the-art findings and could be recommended to predict and detect other biomedical signals. As a result, this predictive system can also be used to adjust the air pressure in sleep apnea patients' Automatic Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) devices.","Taghizadegan, Yashar; Jafarnia Dabanloo, Nader; Maghooli, Keivan; Sheikhani, Ali",Med Hypotheses,610,16

The demographics, clinical characteristics, imaging, and EEG features were analyzed and presented. RESULTS: Of 23 patients undergoing continuous video-EEG, 16 were COVID positive and were included. Continuous video-EEG monitoring was ordered for ""altered mental status"" in 11 of 16 patients and for ""clinical seizure"" in 5 of 16 patients. None of the patients had seizures or status epilepticus as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection. Instead, witnessed clinical seizures developed as results of COVID-19-related medical illness(es): anoxic brain injury, stroke/hemorrhage, lithium (Li) toxicity (because of kidney failure), hypertension, and renal disease. Three patients required therapeutic burst suppression because of focal nonconvulsive status epilepticus, status epilepticus/myoclonus secondary to anoxic injury from cardiac arrest, and one for sedation (and with concomitant EEG abnormalities secondary to Li toxicity). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational case series of 16 patients with COVID-19 who were monitored with continuous video-EEG, most patients experienced a nonspecific encephalopathy. Clinical seizures and electrographic status epilepticus were the second most commonly observed neurological problem.","Zafar, Saman; Aydemir, Seyhmus; Karceski, Steve; Doria, Joseph W; Schaefer, Candace; Swarnkar, Rohit; Afra, Pegah",J. clin. neurophysiol,610,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Preoperative IVIg is not needed to prevent myasthenic crisis in stable myasthenia gravis patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, based on controlled data. Rituximab, if initiated early in new-onset myasthenia gravis, can lead to faster and more sustained remission even without immunotherapies in 35% of patients at 2 years. Biomarkers determining the timing for follow-up infusions in Rituximab-responding AChR-positive patients are discussed. Most patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis treated with Rituximab have sustained long-term remission with persistent reduction of IgG4 anti-MuSK antibodies. Eculizumb in the extension REGAIN study showed sustained long-term pharmacological remissions and reduced exacerbations. Three new biologic agents showed promising results in phase-II controlled myasthenia gravis trials: Zilucoplan, a subcutaneous macrocyclic peptide inhibiting complement C5; Efgartigimod, an IgG1-derived Fc fragment binding to neonatal FcRn receptor; and Rozanolixizumab, a high-affinity anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Finally, the safety of ongoing myasthenia gravis immunotherapies during COVID19 pandemic is discussed. SUMMARY: New biologics against B cells, complement and FcRn receptor, are bringing us closer to successful targeted immunotherapies in the chronic management of myasthenia gravis promising an exciting future for antibody-mediated neurological diseases.","Dalakas, Marinos C",Curr Opin Neurol,610,10

Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop serious respiratory illness requiring ventilator management. In the early phase of this pandemic, the risk of disease spread lead to the development of conservative guidelines which advocated delaying tracheostomy at least two to three weeks from intubation and, preferably, with negative COVID-19 testing. The morbidly obese patient population, however, presents a unique scenario in which early tracheostomy may be beneficial. In this article, we discuss our institution's current practices along with clinical outcomes with reference to intensive care literature and propose that early tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients should be considered on a case by case basis.","Caputo, M.

Vaccination programs have contributed to the decline in mortality and morbidity of various infectious diseases. This review aims to investigate the impact of sex/gender on the vaccine acceptance, responses, and outcomes. The studies were identified by using PubMed, until 30th June 2020. The search was performed by using the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gender, sex, vaccine, adverse reaction. Clinical trials, retrospective and prospective studies were included. Studies written in languages other than English were excluded. Studies were included if gender differences in response to vaccination trials were reported. All selected studies were qualitatively analyzed. Innate recognition and response to viruses, as well as, adaptive immune responses during viral infections, differ between females and males. Unfortunately, a majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people, with ages between 18 to 65 years, excluding the elderly, pregnant women, post-menopausal female and children. In conclusion, it is apparent that the design of vaccines and vaccine strategies should be sex-specific, to reduce adverse reactions in females and increase immunogenicity in males. It should be mandatory to examine sex-related variables in pre-clinical and clinical vaccine trials, such as their crucial role for successful prevention of pandemic COVID-19.","Ciarambino, Tiziana; Barbagelata, Elena; Corbi, Graziamaria; Ambrosino, Immacolata; Politi, Cecilia; Lavalle, Franco; Ruggieri, Anna; Moretti, Annamaria",Monaldi arch. chest dis,610,26

Furthermore, when data were analyzed between the 2 patients, the immunocompetent patient demonstrated greater changes in various subsets as compared to the CVID patient. These data demonstrate different immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompetent patient and the CVID patient. A marked decrease in GC B cells and plasmablasts may be responsible for failure to make SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Drug reactions rarely affect both organs concurrently. The clinical features, risk factors, and prognostic markers of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with SJS/TEN are not well studied. Materials and Methods: The clinical features, risk factors, and prognostic markers of DILI in patients with SJS/TEN hospitalized at the dermatology department of our hospital from January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 298 patients with SJS/TEN were enrolled in this study. Of them, 40 had liver injury and the rest served as control. Causative drugs mainly included antipodagrics (xanthine oxidase inhibitors occupying 100% among antipodagrics), anticonvulsants (dibenzazepine occupying 76.92% among anticonvulsants), and traditional Chinese medicines. There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with liver injury and the control group in the history of liver disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (P < 0.05). Nine of the 40 patients with liver injury died. High serum total bilirubin and creatinine levels were significantly associated with poor prognosis of DILI in patients with SJS/TEN (P < 0.05). Conclusion: DILI usually occurs in patients with SJS/TEN. Pre-existing liver disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are independent risk factors for DILI in patients with SJS/TEN. High serum total bilirubin and creatinine levels may be useful prognostic markers for DILI in patients with SJS/TEN.","Zhang, Zhibin; Li, Sisi; Zhang, Zhixiong; Yu, Kaihui; Duan, Xunxin; Long, Lin; Zhang, Shulan; Jiang, Meiying; Liu, Ougen",Indian J Dermatol,610,17

Although patients primarily present with fever, cough and dyspnea, some patients also develop gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic manifestations. The most common GI symptoms reported are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Liver chemistry abnormalities are common and include elevation of aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract via its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II, which is expressed on enterocytes of the ileum and colon. Viral RNA has also been isolated from stool specimens of COVID-19 patients, which raised the concern for fecal-oral transmission in addition to droplet transmission. Although indirect evidence has suggested possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, more effort is needed to establish the role of the fecal-oral transmission route. Further research will help elucidate the association between patients with underlying GI diseases, such as chronic liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease, and severity of COVID-19.

This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus; seven and seven deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.003), primarily as a consequence of a decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths. Overall, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was higher, but not significantly, in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.08, Yates-corrected Chi-square test).

This presentation (a) summarizes recommendations from six key organizations related to preparation for and response to COVID in AL in relation to resident health and quality of life;(b) compares recommendations for AL with those for NHs;and (c) assesses implications for the future of AL. Methods: We collected, categorized, and summarized recommendations related to preparation for and response to COVID in AL, long-term care in general, and NHs, from six key organizations: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services, the American Geriatrics Society, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, and the Alzheimer's Association. Results: Recommendations for AL and NHs were similar in many areas, while differences provided insight into the ways that the pandemic has challenged AL in particular, and may have implications for the evolution of AL. Differences include recommending more flexible visitation and group activities for AL, providing screening by AL staff or an outside provider, and suggesting that AL staff should access resources to facilitate advance care planning. Recommendations for both AL and NHs that provide insight into how AL may be integrating more health care into their offered services include working with consulting clinicians who know both the resident and the AL setting when making transfer decisions, and suggesting that AL communities follow guidance for testing as recommended for NHs. Conclusions: COVID may accelerate the integration and/or closer coordination of social work and medical care into AL, because recommendations suggest AL would benefit from the services and expertise of licensed nurses, social workers, and physicians.

COVID-19 amplified those concerns, and an examination of recommendations to manage COVID-19 may shed light on the future of AL. This review summarizes recommendations from 6 key organizations related to preparation for and response to COVID-19 in AL in relation to resident health and quality of life; compares recommendations for AL with those for nursing homes (NHs); and assesses implications for the future of AL. DESIGN: Nonsystematic review involving search of gray literature. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Recommendations from key governmental bodies and professional societies regarding COVID-19 in AL, long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in general, and NHs. MEASURES: We collected, categorized, and summarized these recommendations as they pertained to quality of life and health care. RESULTS: Many recommendations for AL and NHs were similar, but differences provided insight into ways the pandemic was recognized and challenged AL communities in particular: recommending more flexible visitation and group activities for AL, providing screening by AL staff or an outside provider, and suggesting that AL staff access resources to facilitate advance care planning discussions. Recommendations were that AL integrate health care into offered services, including working with consulting clinicians who know both the residents and the LTC community. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Long-term care providers and policy makers have recognized the need to modify current long-term care options. Because COVID-19 recommendations suggest AL communities would benefit from the services and expertise of social workers, licensed nurses, and physicians, it may accelerate the integration and closer coordination of psychosocial and medical care into AL. Future research should investigate different models of integrated, interdisciplinary health care in AL.","Vipperman, Andrew; Zimmerman, Sheryl; Sloane, Philip D",J. Am. Med. Dir. Assoc,610,29

SETTING: Research laboratory. METHODS: Participants with iSCI and age- and sex-matched able-bodied (AB) individuals walked normally (SCI n = 18, AB n = 17) and in tandem (SCI n = 12, AB n = 17). Haptic input was added through light touch on a railing. Step parameters, and mediolateral and anterior-posterior margins of stability (means and standard deviations) were calculated. Surface electromyography data were collected bilaterally from the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), and gluteus medius (GMED) and integrated over a stride. Repeated measures ANOVAs examined within- and between-group differences (&#945; = 0.05). Cutaneous and proprioceptive sensation of individuals with iSCI were correlated to changes in outcome measures that were affected by haptic input. RESULTS: When walking normally, adding haptic input decreased stride velocity, step width, stride length, MOSML, MOSML_SD, MOSAP, and MOSAP_SD, and increased GMED activity on the limb opposite the railing. During tandem walking, haptic input had no effect; however, individuals with iSCI had a larger step width SD and MOSML_SD compared with the AB group. Sensory abilities of individuals with iSCI were not correlated to any of the outcome measures that significantly changed with added haptic input. CONCLUSIONS: Added haptic input improved balance control during normal but not in tandem walking. Sensory abilities did not impact the use of added haptic input during walking.","Oates, Alison R; Arora, Tarun; Lanovaz, Joel L; Musselman, Kristin E",Spinal cord,610,15

Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19-69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. High awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mandatory for all people, but especially for HWs, irrespective of symptoms, to safeguard their health and that of patients.","Lahner, Edith; Dilaghi, Emanuele; Prestigiacomo, Claudio; Alessio, Giuliano; Marcellini, Laura; Simmaco, Maurizio; Santino, Iolanda; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Anibaldi, Paolo; Marcolongo, Adriano; Annibale, Bruno; Napoli, Christian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,10

We begin by defining SDOH and health disparities in today's context; we then move to discussing SDOH and stroke, particularly secondary stroke prevention, and conclude with possible approaches to addressing SDOH and reducing stroke disparities. These approaches include (1) building on prior work; (2) enhancing our understanding of populations and subpopulations, including intersectionality, of people who experience stroke disparities; (3) prioritizing populations and points along the stroke care continuum when racial/ethnic disparities are most prominent; (4) understanding how SDOH impact stroke disparities in order to test SDOH interventions that contribute to the disparity; (5) partnering with communities; and (6) exploring technological innovations.

To adapt to late spring arrival at northern latitudes, a lower photoperiodic sensitivity and therefore a higher critical photoperiod for reproductive onset is necessary in northern species to arrest reproductive development until spring onset. Temperature-photoperiod relationships, and hence food availability-photoperiod relationships, are highly latitude dependent. Therefore, we predict PNES sensitivity characteristics to be latitude-dependent. Here, we investigated photoperiodic responses at different times during development in northern (tundra/root vole, Microtus oeconomus) and southern vole species (common vole, Microtus arvalis) exposed to constant short (SP) or long photoperiod (LP). Although, the tundra vole grows faster under LP, no photoperiodic effect on somatic growth is observed in the common vole. Contrastingly, gonadal growth is more sensitive to photoperiod in the common vole, suggesting that photoperiodic responses in somatic and gonadal growth can be plastic, and might be regulated through different mechanisms. In both species, thyroid-stimulating-hormone-ß subunit (Tshß) and iodothyronine- deiodinase 2 (Dio2) expression is highly increased under LP, whereas Tshr and Dio3 decreases under LP. High Tshr levels in voles raised under SP may lead to increased sensitivity to increasing photoperiods later in life. The higher photoperiodic induced Tshr response in tundra voles suggests that the northern vole species might be more sensitive to TSH when raised under SP. In conclusion, species differences in developmental programming of the PNES, which is dependent on photoperiod early in development, may form different breeding strategies evolving as part of latitudinal adaptation.","van Rosmalen, Laura; van Dalum, Jayme; Hazlerigg, David G; Hut, Roelof A",J. exp. biol,610,20

The existing literature is limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. METHODS: Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray, and procedures were performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson's correlation for comparison of analytic methods. RESULTS: All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (&#8804;0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post-procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67-75% at 0.5-1.5 m. Mannequin and operator were heavily contaminated. The two analytic methods showed good correlation (r = 0.930, n = 244, P < .001).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the experiences and psychosocial problems of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey. SETTINGS: The data were collected between 9 May and 12 May 2020, in Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 10 nurses, who cared for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The research employed the descriptive phenomenological approach. The interviews were conducted face-to-face via the internet and were analysed with Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS: The experiences and psychosocial problems among nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised under three themes, which were further divided into subcategories. The theme of the effects of the outbreak was divided into working conditions, psychological effects and social effects; the theme of short-term coping strategies was divided into normalisation, refusal to dwell on experiences, avoidance, expression of emotions and distraction; and the theme of necessities was divided into psychosocial support and resource management. CONCLUSION: The nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey were adversely affected, both psychologically and socially, by the pandemic; they used short-term coping strategies, and they needed psychosocial support and resource management.

Patients with AM related SARS-CoV-2 had lower serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P = 0.012), and platelets (P < 0.001), but had a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) value (P = 0.04), and N-terminal-pro hormone BNP in comparison to patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had significant reduction of CRP (P = 0.007). Inotropic drug support was used for shorter durations in patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2, than in others (P = 0.02). Children with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had significant improvement of left ventricle systolic function on the third day in hospital (P = 0.001). Patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 AM had more frequent adverse outcomes (P = 0.04; three died and four dilated cardiomyopathy). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2, patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had a higher CRP value, polymorphic clinical presentation, shorter durations of inotropic drugs use as well as prompt recovery of left ventricle systolic function.","Vukomanovic, Vladislav A; Krasic, Stasa; Prijic, Sergej; Ninic, Sanja; Minic, Predrag; Petrovic, Gordana; Nesic, Dejan",Pediatr Infect Dis J,610,5

The ability of nursing homes to invest in quality improvement initiatives may depend on resource availability. In this study, we sought to examine whether lower profit margins, as a proxy for lack of resources, are associated with persistent infection control citations. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare-certified nursing homes in the US with financial and facility characteristics data (n = 12,194). METHODS: We combined facility-level data on nursing home profit margins from Medicare Cost Reports with deficiency citation data from Nursing Home Compare (2017-2019) and facility characteristics data from LTCFocus.org. We descriptively analyzed infection control citations by profit margins quintiles. We used logistic regressions to examine the relationship between profit margin quintiles and citations for infection prevention and control, adjusting for facility and market characteristics. RESULTS: About three-fourths of all facilities received deficiency citations for infection prevention and control during 1 or more years from 2017 to 2019 with about 10% of facilities cited in all 3 years. Facilities in the highest profit margin quintile had 7.6% of facilities with citations for infection prevention and control in each of the 3 years compared with 8.1%, 10.0%, 10.7%, and 13.7% for facilities in the fourth, third, second, and first quintiles of profit margins, respectively. Multivariable regressions showed that facilities with the lowest profit margins (first quintile) had 54.3% higher odds of being cited in at least 1 year and 87.6% higher odds of being cited in each of the 3 years compared with facilities with the highest profit margins (fifth quintile). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that nursing homes may need more resources to prevent citations for infection prevention and control.","Sharma, Hari; Xu, Lili",J. Am. Med. Dir.

METHODS: This study included 1,908,197 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 190 countries between 23 January and 13 April 2020. The implemented NPIs were categorised into four types: mandatory face mask in public, isolation or quarantine, social distancing and traffic restriction (referred to as mandatory mask, quarantine, distancing and traffic hereafter, respectively). RESULTS: The implementations of mandatory mask, quarantine, distancing and traffic were associated with changes (95% confidence interval, CI) of -15.14% (from -21.79% to -7.93%), -11.40% (from -13.66% to -9.07%), -42.94% (from -44.24% to -41.60%) and -9.26% (from -11.46% to -7.01%) in the Rt of COVID-19 when compared with those without the implementation of the corresponding measures. Distancing and the simultaneous implementation of two or more types of NPIs seemed to be associated with a greater decrease in the Rt of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that NPIs can significantly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Distancing and the simultaneous implementation of two or more NPIs should be the strategic priorities for containing COVID-19.","Bo, Yacong; Guo, Cui; Lin, Changqing; Zeng, Yiqian; Li, Hao Bi; Zhang, Yumiao; Hossain, Md Shakhaoat; Chan, Jimmy W M; Yeung, David W; Kwok, Kin On; Wong, Samuel Y S; Lau, Alexis K H; Lao, Xiang Qian",Int J Infect Dis,610,20

We demonstrate that there is a constellation of stakeholders who have different explanation needs, not just the 'user'. Further, the findings demonstrate how the need for xAI emerges through concerns associated with specific stakeholder groups i.e., the development team, subject matter experts, decision makers, and the audience. Our findings contribute to the expansion of xAI by highlighting that different stakeholders have different explanation needs.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety measures taken to contain its spread also disrupted routines and reduced access to familiar coping mechanisms, social support networks, and health care services. Social media and the ED communities on social media platforms have been an important source of support for individuals with EDs in the past. So far, it is unknown how discussions in online ED communities changed as offline support networks were disrupted and people spent more time at home in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify changes in language content and style in an online ED community during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We extracted posts and their comments from the ED community on the social media website Reddit and concatenated them to comment threads. To analyze these threads, we applied top-down and bottom-up language analysis methods based on topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and 13 indicators from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, respectively. Threads were split into prepandemic (before March 11, 2020) and midpandemic (after March 11, 2020) groups. Standardized mean differences were calculated to estimate change between pre- and midpandemic threads. RESULTS: A total of 17,715 threads (n=8772, 49.5% prepandemic threads; n=8943, 50.5% midpandemic threads) were extracted from the ED community and analyzed. The final topic model contained 21 topics. CIs excluding zero were found for standardized mean differences of 15 topics and 9 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories covering themes such as ED symptoms, mental health, treatment for EDs, cognitive processing, social life, and emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed a reduction in discussions about ED symptoms, an increase in mental health and treatment-related topics was observed at the same time. This points to a change in the focus of the ED community from promoting potentially harmful weight loss methods to bringing attention to mental health and treatments for EDs. These results together with heightened cognitive processing, increased social references, and reduced inhibition of negative emotions detected in discussions indicate a shift in the ED community toward a pro-recovery orientation.","Feldhege, Johannes; Moessner, Markus; Wolf, Markus; Bauer, Stephanie",J Med Internet Res,610,16

Secondary to the pathogenic nature of the virus in the respiratory tract and upper airway, it is essential that speech-language pathologists who specialize in these disorders are knowledgeable of current practices to provide evidence-based care while minimizing viral transmission. Understanding how and when SARS-CoV-2 spreads is critical to the development of effective infection prevention within clinical practices. Method We established an evidence-based clinical practice guide for clinicians working with voice and upper airway through a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed journals, non-peer-reviewed manuscripts on preprint servers, national health guidelines, and published and online consensus statements and emerging data. Emphasis was placed on risk mitigation for viral transmission via safe clinical practices, including evaluative procedures, therapy including telehealth, personal protective equipment, room, staffing, and distancing considerations. Results/Conclusions While knowledge relevant to viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving, there is a paucity of literature specific to the evaluation and treatment of voice and upper airway disorders. Within these confines and given the potentially significant high risk of infection secondary to the nature of COVID-19, we summarize current considerations and recommend best practices that maximize risk mitigation whereby ensuring patient and provider safety.","Doll, Emerald J; Braden, Maia N; Thibeault, Susan L",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,610,16

Data from the AGES-Reykjavik study, a cohort of 5764 elderly Icelanders, were used. Outcome data were ascertained from electronic medical records. Gray's tests, Cox proportional hazards models and proportional subdistribution hazards models were used to analyse associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with lung cancer diagnoses and lung cancer mortality as well as diagnoses and mortality from all cancers.Participants with interstitial lung abnormalities had greater cumulative incidence of lung cancer diagnoses (p<0.001) and lung cancer mortality (p<0.001) than others. Interstitial lung abnormalities were associated with an increased hazard of lung cancer diagnosis (HR=2.77) and lung cancer mortality (HR=2.89) in adjusted Cox models. Associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with all cancers were found in models including lung cancers but not in models excluding lung cancers.People with interstitial lung abnormalities are at increased risk of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality, but not of other cancers. This implies that an association between fibrotic and neoplastic lung diseases of the lung exists from the early stages of lung fibrosis and suggests interstitial lung abnormalities as a risk factor in lung cancer screening efforts.","Axelsson, Gisli T; Putman, Rachel K; Aspelund, Thor; Gudmundsson, Elias F; Hida, Tomayuki; Araki, Tetsuro; Nishino, Mizuki; Hatabu, Hiroto; Gudnason, Vilmundur; Hunninghake, Gary M; Gudmundsson, Gunnar",Eur. respir. j,610,30

This manuscript describes the development and implementation of the MDI and presents findings from a recently conducted online survey concerning MDI participation.Methods: Faculty and trainees at APPCN member programs were recruited to complete the MDI survey, administered using the Qualtrics platform, through email announcements and via website link and on-screen quick response code shared at online didactic sessions. The MDI survey instrument was designed to capture basic demographics and professional role; information regarding level of site participation, benefits of participation, barriers to participation, online conference platform(s) used, and interest in continued participation; as well as anxiety and work engagement ratings.Results: The response rate was estimated to be 21-29%. Transition to videoconferencing for didactics was noted by 80% due to Covid-19, with 17% of respondents experiencing cancellation or reduction in didactic activities. About 79% endorsed that participation in MDI activities was always or nearly always beneficial. Barriers to participation included not having time, difficulty accessing didactic information, and not knowing about the MDI. Interestingly, trainees at nonparticipating sites reported greater anxiety than trainees at participating sites.Conclusion: It is hoped that these findings will inform future efforts to develop and implement online training activities. The benefits reported by respondents suggest that this work is warranted, while reported barriers to participation identify areas for improvement.","Domen, Christopher H; Collins, Robert L; Davis, Jeremy J",Clin Neuropsychol,610,1

Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%-99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P < 0.001; pandemic training p < 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Government and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection.","Bahlol, Mohamed; Dewey, Rebecca Susan",Res. soc. adm. pharm,610,1

While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. OBJECTIVES: To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). MAIN RESULTS: We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.","Krishnaratne, Shari; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; Coenen, Michaela; Geffert, Karin; Jung-Sievers, Caroline; Klinger, Carmen; Kratzer, Suzie; Littlecott, Hannah; Movsisyan, Ani; Rabe, Julia E; Rehfuess, Eva; Sell, Kerstin; Strahwald, Brigitte; Stratil, Jan M; Voss, Stephan; Wabnitz, Katharina; Burns, Jacob",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,610,20

In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may impact general cardiovascular risk for years to come, and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions. From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence. Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute cardiovascular events. Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and mis-information may have negatively impacted adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents. From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to income loss, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse cardiovascular risk-factor control and outcomes. We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health impacts of COVID-19.","Lau, Darren; McAlister, Finlay A",Can J Cardiol,610,1

Early and accurate diagnosis of ARDS depends upon clinical suspicion and chest imaging. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an important novel cause of ARDS with a distinct time course, imaging and laboratory features from the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection to hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may allow diagnosis and management prior to or at earlier stages of ARDS. Treatment of ARDS remains largely supportive, and consists of incremental respiratory support (high flow nasal oxygen, non-invasive respiratory support, and invasive mechanical ventilation), and avoidance of iatrogenic complications, all of which improve clinical outcomes. COVID-19-associated ARDS is largely similar to other causes of ARDS with respect to pathology and respiratory physiology, and as such, COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure should typically be managed as other patients with ARDS. Non-invasive respiratory support may be beneficial in avoiding intubation in COVID-19 respiratory failure including mild ARDS, especially under conditions of resource constraints or to avoid overwhelming critical care resources. Compared to other causes of ARDS, medical therapies may improve outcomes in COVID-19-associated ARDS, such as dexamethasone and remdesivir. Future improved clinical outcomes in ARDS of all causes depends upon individual patient physiological and biological endotyping in order to improve accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis as well as optimal targeting of future therapies in the right patient at the right time in their disease.","Kassirian, Shayan; Taneja, Ravi; Mehta, Sanjay",,610,16

Mental health status is affected by the quarantine even after the end of it and for an extended period. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Depression levels among nursing/midwifery students during the quarantine period are high. Depression levels among students' family members during the quarantine period are high. Those who are not satisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures and those who believe that COVID-19 and quarantine can cause problems on health, have elevated levels of depression. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period should be a priority for the healthcare system. Offering mental health first aid training and support can improve the mental health status of students and their family members. ABSTRACT: Introduction The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. Aim This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. Results In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SD = 5.803) and 6.280 (SD = 5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. Discussion Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. Implications for Practice Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance. Mental health first aid training and support could benefit both students and their parents significantly. Additionally, follow-up services after the end of quarantine are recommended.","Mechili, Enkeleint A; Saliaj, Aurela; Kamberi, Fatjona; Girvalaki, Charis; Peto, Ela; Patelarou, Athina E; Bucaj, Jorgjia; Patelarou, Evridiki",J. psychiatr. ment. health nurs,610,26

We investigated the measures the top 35 UK universities receiving most Medical Research Council funding have taken to ensure global equitable access to health technologies in technology transfer. In October 2020 we sent Freedom Of Information requests and analysed universities websites, to (i.) assess institutional strategies on the patenting and licensing of COVID-19-related health technologies, (ii.) identify all COVID-19-related health technologies licensed or patented, and (iii.) record whether universities engaged with the Open-COVID pledge, COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), or Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) COVID-19 licensing guidelines. Except for the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, UK universities have not updated their institutional strategies during the pandemic. Nine universities licensed 22 COVID-19 health technologies. Imperial College London disclosed 10 patents relevant to COVID-19. No UK universities participate in the Open-COVID Pledge or C-TAP, but discussions are ongoing. The University of Bristol signed up to the AUTM guidelines. Despite several COVID-19 health technologies being developed by UK universities, our findings suggest minimal engagement with measures that may promote equitable access. We suggest that universities review their technology transfer policies and implement global equitable access strategies for COVID-19 health technologies.","Keestra, Sarai Mirjam; Rodgers, Florence; Osborne, Rhiannon; Wimmer, Sabrina",,610,23

AIMS: To describe end-of-life symptoms and care needs of people dying of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive admitted patients who died at a Victorian tertiary referral hospital from 1 January to 30 September directly due to COVID-19. Clinical characteristics, symptoms, and use of supportive therapies including medications and non-pharmacological interventions in the last three days of life were extracted. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 58 patients (median age 87 years IQR 81, 90) predominantly admitted from home (n = 30), who died after a median of 11 days (IQR 6, 28) in the acute medical (n = 31) or aged care (n = 27) wards of the hospital. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 7 (IQR 5,8). Breathlessness (n = 42), agitation (n = 36) and pain (n = 33) were the most frequent clinician-reported symptoms in the final three days of life, with most requiring opioids (n = 52), midazolam (n = 40), with dose escalation commonly being required. While oxygen therapy was commonly used (n = 47), few (n = 13) required an anti-secretory agent. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one of the first and largest Australian report of the end of life and symptom experience of people dying of COVID-19. This information should help clinicians to anticipate palliative care needs of these patients, for example recognising that higher starting doses of opioids and sedatives may help reduce prevalence and severity of breathlessness and agitation near death.

Here, to quantitatively assess the scale of this threat, we conducted a meta-analysis of 356 interaction effect sizes from 90 studies in which bees were exposed to combinations of agrochemicals, nutritional stressors and/or parasites. We found an overall synergistic effect between multiple stressors on bee mortality. Subgroup analysis of bee mortality revealed strong evidence for synergy when bees were exposed to multiple agrochemicals at field-realistic levels, but interactions were not greater than additive expectations when bees were exposed to parasites and/or nutritional stressors. All interactive effects on proxies of fitness, behaviour, parasite load and immune responses were either additive or antagonistic; therefore, the potential mechanisms that drive the observed synergistic interactions for bee mortality remain unclear. Environmental risk assessment schemes that assume additive effects of the risk of agrochemical exposure may underestimate the interactive effect of anthropogenic stressors on bee mortality and will fail to protect the pollinators that provide a key ecosystem service that underpins sustainable agriculture.","Siviter, Harry; Bailes, Emily J; Martin, Callum D; Oliver, Thomas R; Koricheva, Julia; Leadbeater, Ellouise; Brown, Mark J F",Nature (Lond.),610,11

A broad definition of a whistle-blower is adopted, which includes any witness internal or external to an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that includes using news reports and other secondary data sources on a recent modern slavery scandal in garment factories in Leicester, UK and the lens of the bystander effect from the social psychology literature. The core focus is on whistleblowing by members of the local community in which an operation or supply chain is embedded. Findings: The phenomenon of modern slavery being an “open secret” within the local community is highlighted. But rather than the case being characterised by widespread whistleblowing, the problem only came into full focus when poor working conditions and forced labour during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions contributed to the spread of the virus. It is argued that overcoming this “bystander effect” can lead to the greater mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing. Research limitations/implications: Two sets of propositions and a conceptual model are provided and seven future research suggestions are outlined, including extending the present study to whistleblowing by victims and other internal members of an organisation or supply chain. Practical implications: If it can be mobilised, then whistleblowing has the potential to be an important part of detecting modern slavery, either temporarily replacing audits where they are not possible due to social distancing restrictions or directing the use of limited auditing resources to high-risk factories. In this way, combinations of practices can be effectively used to tackle the threat. Social implications: This contributes to addressing an important societal problem and one of the grandest challenges facing modern-day supply chains. This, it has been argued, is an even bigger problem now than ever before given the economic and market conditions created by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first paper to focus on operationalising the practice of whistleblowing as a source of greater supply chain intelligence to aid modern slavery detection. Causes of the bystander effect include the perceived low-emergency threat of modern slavery, the high-ambiguity environment, a low bystander responsibility and low assistance/intervention incentive. Countermeasures include elevating the emergency status of modern slavery, creating a shared sense of responsibility for tackling the problem, having clear reporting channels and taking swift and consistent action when instances of modern slavery are detected. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Stevenson, M.",Supply Chain Management,610,16

Although nvHAP occurs more frequently than VAP and results in similar mortality and costs, prevention guidelines and prevention focus almost exclusively on VAP. Scientific evidence about nvHAP prevention and its implementation is scarce. Therefore, we designed a mixed-methods hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study to investigate both the effectiveness and implementation of a newly developed nvHAP prevention bundle. METHODS: This single-centre project at the 950-bed University Hospital Zurich (UHZ) will engage the wards of nine departments with substantial nvHAP rates. The nvHAP bundle consists of five primary prevention measures: 1) oral care, 2) prevention of dysphagia-related aspiration, 3) mobilization, 4) stopping unnecessary proton pump inhibitors, and, 5) respiratory therapy. Implementation includes the engagement of department-level implementation teams, who sustain the 'core' intervention components of education, training, and environmental restructuring and tailor the implementation strategy to local needs. Both effectiveness and implementation outcomes will be assessed using mixed-methods. As a primary outcome, nvHAP incidence rates will be analysed by Poisson regression models to compare incidence rates before, during, and after the implementation phases (on the hospital and department level). Additionally, the association between process indicators and nvHAP incidence rates will be analysed using longitudinal Poisson regression models. A longitudinal, qualitative study and formative evaluation based on interviews, focus groups, and observations identifies supporting or hindering factors for implementation success in participating departments dynamically over time. This accumulating implementation experience will be constantly fed back to the implementation teams and thus, represents an active implementation element. DISCUSSION: This comprehensive hybrid mixed-methods study is designed to both, measure the effectiveness of a new nvHAP prevention bundle and multifaceted implementation strategy, while also providing insights into how and why it worked or failed. The results of this study may contribute substantially to advancing knowledge and patient safety in the area of a rediscovered healthcare-associated infection - nvHAP.

The spread of pathogens in wildlife is currently highly related to the transmission of pathogens from farmed animals, which has increased with the constant development of farming. Here, we analysed the spatio-temporal variation in the prevalence of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) antibodies in feral American mink (Neovison vison) populations in Poland (1153 individuals from 9 sites) in relation to mink farming intensity. AMDV was detected in feral mink at all study sites and the prevalence ranged from 0.461 in the northern region to 0.826 in the western region. Mink males and adults were infected more often than females and subadults; the infection was also more frequent during the mink breeding season than during non-breeding. The prevalence of AMDV changed nonlinearly in consecutive years and the peak of prevalence was every 3-4 years. The predicted AMDV prevalence was low at sites where the number of farmed mink was also low and increased linearly with the increase in the number of mink kept on farms. The predicted AMDV prevalence at sites with low mink farming intensity strongly varied between years, whereas at sites with high mink farming intensity, the predicted prevalence did not change significantly. AMDV infection affected the mink's body condition and caused an increase in the size of the spleen, liver, and kidneys. This study shows that Aleutian mink disease strongly affects feral mink but the spatio-temporal variation of its prevalence is complex and partly related to the transmission of the virus from farmed mink to feral populations. The study highlights the complexity of AMDV circulation in feral mink populations and implicates a potential spillover of the virus to native species.","Zalewski, Andrzej; Virtanen, Jenni M E; Brzezinski, Marcin; Kolodziej-Sobocinska, Marta; Jankow, Wladyslaw; Sironen, Tarja",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with men and women who had started PrEP but did not return to the clinic for a refill after a 1, 2 or 3-month period. These 'discontinuation' clients were enrolled in a PrEP demonstration project for the general population in nurse-led, public-sector, primary-care clinics in Eswatini. Reasons for discontinuation included changes to self-perceived HIV risk such as the end of pregnancy and absent partners. Others described PrEP as inaccessible when working away from home and many described difficulties relating to a daily pill regimen and managing side effects. Female clients described being prohibited from using PrEP by their partners and co-wives. From these results, we recommend that client-centred counselling stresses the prevention-effective adherence paradigm, which promotes PrEP use in risk periods that are identifiable and PrEP discontinuation when the risk period has finished. A national scale up of PrEP may mitigate problems accessing PrEP. Extended counselling and support could assist with adherence and the management of side effects. Education and support for partners and families of PrEP clients may also contribute to better PrEP continuation.","Bärnighausen, Kate; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Matse, Sindy; Hettema, Anita; Hughey, Allison B; Dlamini, Phiwa; Mavuso, Mxolisi; Fakudze, David; Kahn, Kathleen; Bärnighausen, Till; McMahon, Shannon A",Cult Health Sex,610,21

Replicating such structural features in artificial materials is of great significance yet remains a big challenge. Here, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate hydrogels with elaborate ordered structures of nanosheets (NSs) oriented under a distributed electric field. Multiple electrodes are distributed with various arrangements in the precursor solution containing NSs and gold nanoparticles. A complex electric field induces sophisticated orientations of the NSs that are permanently inscribed by subsequent photo-polymerization. The resultant anisotropic nanocomposite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels exhibit rapid deformation upon heating or photoirradiation, owing to the fast switching of permittivity of the media and electric repulsion between the NSs. The complex alignments of NSs and anisotropic shape change of discrete regions result in programmed deformation of the hydrogels into various configurations. Furthermore, locomotion is realized by a spatiotemporal light stimulation that locally triggers time-variant shape change of the composite hydrogel with complex anisotropic structures. Such a strategy on the basis of the distributed electric-field-generated ordered structures should be applicable to gels, elastomers, and thermosets loaded with other anisotropic particles or liquid crystals, for the design of biomimetic/bioinspired materials with specific functionalities.","Zhu, Qing Li; Dai, Chen Fei; Wagner, Daniel; Daab, Matthias; Hong, Wei; Breu, Josef; Zheng, Qiang; Wu, Zi Liang",Adv Mater,610,6

All of the above conditions are characterized by increased sympathetic discharge, which may exert significant detrimental effects on COVID-19 patients, through actions on the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, metabolism, and/or immune system. Furthermore, COVID-19 may also increase sympathetic discharge, through changes in blood gases (chronic intermittent hypoxia, hyperpnea), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)1/ACE2 imbalance, immune/inflammatory factors, or emotional distress. Nevertheless, the potential role of the sympathetic nervous system has not yet been considered in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

Apart from the oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone have been proven to be efficacious against COVID-19, along with various vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy for Regeneron. All of these are currently at different stages of clinical trials. People with weak immunity are more prone to a severe infection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, early and judicious nutritional supplementation along with pharmacological treatment and clinician collaborations are critical in restituting the current situation. Nutritional supplements help in acquiring strong immunity to prevent the progression of disease any further. Vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium, zinc and many other nutritional and dietary supplements inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines during a viral infection and prevents several unwanted symptoms of infection. Many dietary components like citrus fruits, black elderberry, ginger, and probiotics have the ability to attack viral replication. These supplements can also tame the overriding immune system during coronavirus infection. Keeping in view these facts, nutritional and dietary supplements can be used along with other management modalities. These nutritional and dietary supplements are potential candidates to curb the convulsive unfolding of novel COVID-19, in combination with other standard treatment protocols. In this review, various search engines were used to exploit available literature in order to provide a comprehensive review on nutritional and dietary supplements with respect to the viral infections. It will also provide a brief overview on some of the clinical trials that are in progress to assess the role of nutritional supplements, either alone or in combination with other pharmacological drugs, in fight against COVID-19.","Yaseen, Muhammad Osama; Jamshaid, Humzah; Saif, Arifa; Hussain, Talib",Int J Vitam Nutr Res,610,6

Understanding the underlying pathogenesis is important for disease management. With the implications from studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), this review mainly discussed the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and focused on the host immune response to viruses. Direct damage to tissues and organs and excessive inflammatory responses induced by 2019-nCoV are associated with the pathological process and disease progression. Viral load and high inflammatory response are related to disease severity. Peripheral lymphocytes are closely associated with the acute lung injury, and can be used to predict disease severity. 2019-nCoV-specific antibody and T cell immune response can be detected in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Given the two sides of inflammation and hormone therapy, steroid as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressant needs to be used with caution. Biologics targeting IL-6 and convalescent plasma therapy are promising treatment for COVID-19.

Population migration increases the risk of epidemic transmission. Here the objective of study is to estimate the output risk quantitatively and evaluate the effectiveness of travel restrictions of Wuhan city. METHODS: We proposed a modified SEIR dynamics model to predict the number of COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in Wuhan. And subsequently we estimated the export risk of COVID-19 epidemic from Wuhan to other provinces in China. Finally, we estimated the effectiveness of travel restrictions of Wuhan city quantitatively by the export risk on the assumption that the measure was postponed. FINDINGS: The export risks of COVID-19 varied from Wuhan to other provinces of China. The peak of export risk was January 21-23, 2020. With the travel restrictions of Wuhan delayed by 3, 5 and 7 days, the export risk indexes will increase by 38.50%, 55.89% and 65.63%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the travel restrictions of Wuhan reduced the export risk and delayed the overall epidemic progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The travel restrictions of Wuhan city may provide a reference for the control of the COVID-19 epidemic all over the world.","Li, Yue; Hou, Shike; Zhang, Yongzhong; Liu, Junfeng; Fan, Haojun; Cao, Chunxia",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,610,1

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the United States, uses a replication-incompetent human adenoviral type 26 vector platform* (2) and is administered as a single intramuscular dose, whereas the first two authorized vaccines use an mRNA platform and require 2 doses. On February 28, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged &#8805;18 years (3). During April 13-23, CDC and FDA recommended a pause in use of Janssen vaccine after reports of six cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/µL of blood) among Janssen vaccine recipients (4). Similar thrombotic events, primarily among women aged <60 years, have been described in Europe after receipt of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vector (5-7). The U.S. CVST cases that prompted the pause in Janssen vaccination, as well as subsequently detected CVST cases, are described elsewhere (8). This report summarizes adverse events among Janssen vaccine recipients, including non-CVST cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), a passive surveillance system, and through v-safe, an active monitoring system. As of April 21, 2021, 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine had been administered. Among 13,725 VAERS reports reviewed, 97% were classified as nonserious and 3% as serious, including three reports among women of cases of thrombosis in large arteries or veins accompanied by thrombocytopenia during the second week after vaccination. These three cases and the previously detected CVST cases are consistent with 17 cases of TTS,§ a newly defined condition. Approximately 338,700 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients completed at least one v-safe survey during the week after vaccination; 76% reported a systemic reaction, 61% reported a local reaction, and 34% reported a health impact.¶ Fatigue and pain were commonly reported symptoms in both VAERS and v-safe. The overall safety profile is consistent with preauthorization clinical trials data. Prompt review of U.S. vaccine safety data detected three additional cases of non-CVST TTS, in addition to the previously recognized CVST cases that initiated the pause in use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Ongoing monitoring of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, including vaccination with the Janssen single-dose vaccine, is essential for evaluating the risks and benefits of each vaccine.","Shay, David K; Gee, Julianne; Su, John R; Myers, Tanya R; Marquez, Paige; Liu, Ruiling; Zhang, Bicheng; Licata, Charles; Clark, Thomas A; Shimabukuro, Tom T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,610,33

Infectious complications due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae can lead to fulminant sepsis and death, particularly in young children, in the period shortly after splenectomy, and in immunocompromised patients. Patients with asplenia are also at risk for less common infections due to Capnocytophaga, Babesia, and malaria. Antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccines, and patient and family education are the mainstays of prevention in these at-risk patients. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis typically target high-risk periods, such as 1 to 3 years after splenectomy, children &#8804;5 years of age, or patients with concomitant immunocompromise. However, the risk for sepsis is lifelong, with infections occurring as late as 40 years after splenectomy. Currently available vaccines recommended for patients with asplenia include pneumococcal vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), meningococcal vaccines (meningococcal conjugate vaccines for serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines), H. influenzae type b vaccines, and inactivated influenza vaccines. Ongoing booster doses are also recommended for pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to maintain protection. Despite the availability of prevention tools, adherence is often a challenge. Dedicated teams or clinics focused on patient education and monitoring have demonstrated substantial improvements in vaccine coverage rates for individuals with asplenia and reduced risk of infection. Future efforts to monitor the quality of care in patients with asplenia may be important to bridge the know-do gap in this high-risk population.","Lee, Grace M",Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,610,24

The results suggest that the genetic background of the host could affect the levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and might modulate the progression of Covid-19 in affected patients. Notably, genetic variations in innate immune components such as toll-like receptors and mannose-binding lectin 2 play critical roles in the ability of the immune system to recognize coronavirus and initiate an early immune response to clear the virus and prevent the development of severe symptoms.

We further evaluated the development of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with RMDs. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19+) with those who did not develop the disease (COVID-19-) and patients with mild/moderate disease with those exhibiting severe/critical COVID-19. COVID-19+ patients were asked to collect a blood sample for IgG testing [≥] 3 months after infection and results were compared with age-, sex- and sampling date-matched controls. Overall, 179 cases of COVID-19 were registered in Reuma.pt in the period of interest (median age 55 (IQR 20); 76.5% females) in a total of 6404 registered appointments. We found that patients treated with TNF inhibitors had reduced odds of infection (OR=0.16, 95%CI 0.10-0.26, p<0.001), severe disease (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.84, p=0.010) and seroconversion rates (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02-0.91, p=0.040). Tocilizumab was also associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.05-0.41, p<0.001). Older age, major comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary and kidney disease) and rituximab were associated with an increased risk of infection and worse prognosis, in line with previous reports. Importantly, most patients with inflammatory RMDs (86.2%) were able to develop a robust antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was linked with disease severity.","Cruz-Machado, Ana Rita; Barreira, Sofia C.; Bandeira, Matilde; Veldhoen, Marc; Gomes, Andreia; Serrano, Marta; Duarte, Catarina; Rato, Maria; Fernandes, Bruno Miguel; Garcia, Salomé; Pinheiro, Filipe; Bernardes, Miguel; Madeira, Nathalie; Miguel, Cláudia; Torres, Rita; Silva, Ana Bento; Pestana, Jorge; Almeida, Diogo; Mazeda, Carolina; Santos, Filipe Cunha; Pinto, Patrícia; Sousa, Marlene; Parente, Hugo; Sequeira, Graça; Santos, Maria José; Fonseca, João Eurico; Romão, Vasco C.",,610,26

These clinical observations suggest that municipal and hospital wastewater from affected communities may contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Recent studies have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human feces. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given catchment population, as wastewater contains viruses from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The current study reports the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Slovenia. Two sizes of centrifugal filters were tested: 30â¯kDa and 10 kDA AMICON® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters, where 10 kDA resulted in a higher concentration factor and higher recovery efficiency.

Records from five EDs and one urgent care centre in Ireland, representing approximately 48% of national annual public paediatric ED attendances, are analysed to determine changes in characteristics of attendance during the three month period following the first reported COVID-19 case in Ireland, with reference to specific national public health stages. ED attendance reduced by 27-62% across all categories of diagnosis in the Delay phase and remained significantly below prior year levels as the country began Phase One of Reopening, with an incident rate ratio (IRR) of 0.58. The decrease was predominantly attributable to reduced attendance for injury and viral/viral induced conditions resulting from changed living conditions imposed by the public health response. However, attendance for complex chronic conditions also reduced and had yet to return to pre-COVID levels as reopening began. Attendances referred by general practitioners (GPs) dropped by 13 percentage points in the Delay phase and remained at that level. While changes in living conditions explain much of the decrease in overall attendance and in GP referrals, reduced attendance for complex chronic conditions may indicate avoidance behaviour and continued surveillance is necessary.","McDonnell, Thérèse; Nicholson, Emma; Conlon, Ciara; Barrett, Michael; Cummins, Fergal; Hensey, Conor; McAuliffe, Eilish",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,16

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients at a single center with COVID-19 infection and shock who were treated with angiotensin II. The hemodynamic response to angiotensin II was estimated by recording the mean arterial pressure, norepinephrine equivalent dose (NED) and urine output. RESULTS: Ten patients with COVID-19 related shock were treated with angiotensin II. Over the initial 6 hours, the average the norepinephrine equivalent dose decreased by 30.4% (from 64.6 mcg/min to 44 mcg/min) without a significant change in the mean arterial pressure (0.7% decrease). Six patients experienced at least a 25% reduction in norepinephrine equivalent dose by 6 hours, and two experienced at least a 50% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the hemodynamic response to angiotensin II in COVID-19 related shock was favorable. Two patients had a marked rapid improvement. Given the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, further evaluation of angiotensin II for the treatment of COVID-19 related shock is warranted.","Ofosu-Barko, Kwadwo; Liu, Yi; Tamimi, Faisal Alkhatib; Al Husami, Wael; Ganatra, Sarju; Resnic, Frederic; Shah, Sachin P",Crit Pathw Cardiol,610,22

The use of facial masks and other full personal protective equipment increases air flow resistance, facial skin temperature and physical discomfort. The aim of the present study was to measure surgeons' oxygenation status and discomfort before and after their daily routine activities of oral interventions. METHODS: 10 male voluntary dentists, specializing in oral surgery, and 10 male voluntary doctors in dentistry, participating in master's courses in oral surgery in the Department of Oral Surgery of the University of Chieti, with mean age 29 ± 6 (27-35), were enrolled. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of wearing a PFM on oxygenation status while the oral surgeons were actively working. Disposable sterile one-way surgical paper masks (Surgical Face Mask, Euronda, Italy) and FFP2 (Surgical Face Mask, Euronda, Italy) were used and the mask position covering the nose did not vary during the procedures. The FFP2 was covered by a surgical mask during surgical treatment. A pulse oximeter was used to measure the blood oximetry saturation during the study. RESULTS: In all 20 surgeons wearing FFP2 covered by surgical masks, a reduction in arterial O2 saturation from around 97.5% before surgery to 94% after surgery was recorded with increase of heart rates. A shortness of breath and light-headedness/headaches were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, wearing an FFP2 covered by a surgical mask induces a reduction in circulating O2 concentrations without clinical relevance, while an increase of heart frequency and a sensation of shortness of breath, light-headedness/headaches were recorded.","Scarano, Antonio; Inchingolo, Francesco; Rapone, Biagio; Festa, Felice; Tari, Sergio Rexhep; Lorusso, Felice",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),610,29

Hence, it has emerged as an attractive antiviral drug-target. In this study, computational approaches were employed, mainly the structure-based virtual screening coupled with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to computationally identify specific inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PLpro, that can be further developed as potential pan-PLpro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The sequence, structure, and functional conserveness of most deadly human CoVs PLpro were exploited, and it was revealed that functionally important catalytic triad residues are well conserved among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The subsequent screening of a focused protease inhibitors database composed of â¼7000 compounds resulted in the identification of three candidate compounds, ADM_13083841, LMG_15521745, and SYN_15517940. These three compounds established conserved interactions which were further explored through MD simulations, free energy calculations, and residual energy contribution estimated by MM-PB(GB)SA method. All these compounds showed stable conformation and interacted well with the active residues of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and showed consistent interaction profile with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro as well. Conclusively, the reported SARS-CoV-2 PLpro specific compounds could serve as seeds for developing potent pan-PLpro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against deadly human coronaviruses. Moreover, the presented information related to binding site residual energy contribution could lead to further optimization of these compounds.","Alamri, Mubarak A; Tahir Ul Qamar, Muhammad; Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Alqahtani, Safar M; Froeyen, Matheus; Chen, Ling-Ling",,610,6

Since there are several ways of visually communicating information, we investigate whether different types of visualizations affect how viewers judge the credibility of information as well as the complexity and potential harm of pathogens. A first experiment was conducted to assess whether a round, fluent shape elicits a different response than pathogens featuring disfluent components such as thread-like appendages. Visualizations of disfluent bacteria were rated as more credible than those of fluent bacteria. In Experiment 2, bacteria were either presented as realistic renderings or as cartoon-like line drawings (varied between-subjects). Furthermore, half of the six bacteria had fluent shapes, while the other half featured disfluent shapes, resulting in the within-subjects factor of fluency. Participants were asked to rate the credibility, complexity, and risk of serious illness associated with these bacteria. We found that disfluent bacteria were perceived as having a more complex metabolism and as holding a higher risk for serious illness. Furthermore, realism and disfluent shapes increase the credibility of visualizations, but not the credibility of additional information. These results have important implications for the field of science communication.","Skulmowski, Alexander; Rey, Günter Daniel",,610,1

We aimed to evaluate changes in sexual behavior of men in the Covid-19 outbreak in Turkey. MATERIAL-METHOD: In our cross-sectional and descriptive study, an online questionnaire evaluating sexual habits during the Covid-19 outbreak was conducted on the men living in the Western Black Sea Region, between 8-25 June 2020. In the questionnaire, questions were asked to evaluate the socio-demographic data of the participants, their comprehensive medical history, their sexual preferences, their family and social life during the Covid-19 outbreak, their concerns about Covid-19, and their changes in their sexual behavior after the Covid-19 outbreak. RESULTS: 536 participants with mean age of 38.6 ± 10.3 years were included in the study. 23.9% (128) respondents stated that they had the fear of transmitting Covid-19 to their partner during sexual intercourse. It was observed that 19.4% (104) of the participants developed a fear of Covid-19 transmission from her sexual partner during the relationship. While the number of weekly sexual intercourse of the participants before the pandemic was 2.34 ± 1.35, this number was found to be 1.54 ± 1.45 during the epidemic period (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The fear of infection and transmission of the disease to the partner that occurs during the Covid-19 pandemic manifests itself in the form of a decrease in the frequency and quality of sexual intercourse.","Baran, Ozer; Aykac, Aykut",Int J Clin Pract,610,1

The amount of regularity infers on the unpredictability of fluctuations. The t-test and F-test are performed on estimated LLE and ApEn. In total, 36 statistical tests are performed to check for differences between time periods (pre- versus during COVID-19 pandemic samples) on the one hand, as well as check for differences between markets (cryptocurrencies versus stocks), on the other hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic period it was found that (a) the level of stability in cryptocurrency markets has significantly diminished while the irregularity level significantly augmented, (b) the level of stability in international equity markets has not changed but gained more irregularity, (c) cryptocurrencies became more volatile, (d) the variability in stability and irregularity in equities has not been affected, (e) cryptocurrency and stock markets exhibit a similar degree of stability in price dynamics, whilst finally (f) cryptocurrency exhibit a low level of regularity compared to international equity markets. We find that cryptos showed more instability and more irregularity during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to international stock markets.

The proposed algorithm detects the abnormal skin and creates an energy efficient data aggregation tree covering the affected area while putting the unnecessary sensors to sleep mode. The algorithm responds to the changing conditions of the skin by dynamically adapting the size and shape of the monitoring trees to that of the abnormal skin areas thus providing a comprehensive monitoring. Simulation results demonstrate the application and utility of the proposed algorithm for changing wound shapes and sizes.","Kumar, Suman; Siddiqui, Kazi Amanul Islam; Kumary, Mukesh",,610,30

Traditional evaluation approaches rely heavily on repeated in-person field surveys to measure changes in economic well-being and thus program effects. However, this is known to be costly, time-consuming, and often logistically challenging. Here we provide the first evidence that we can conduct such program evaluations based solely on high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning methods. Our application estimates changes in household welfare in the context of a recent anti-poverty program in rural Kenya. The approach we use is based on a large literature documenting a reliable relationship between housing quality and household wealth. We infer changes in household wealth based on satellite-derived changes in housing quality and obtain consistent results with the traditional field-survey based approach. Our approach can be used to obtain inexpensive and timely insights on program effectiveness in international development programs.","Huang, Luna Yue; Hsiang, Solomon; Gonzalez-Navarro, Marco",,610,5

COVID-19 pathophysiology involves the activation of three main pathways: the inflammatory, the coagulation and the bradykinin cascades. Here, we highlight for the first time the joint potential therapeutic role of bromelain and curcumin, two well-known nutraceuticals, in the prevention of severe COVID-19. Bromelain (a cysteine protease isolated from the pineapple stem) and curcumin (a natural phenol found in turmeric) exert important immunomodulatory actions interfering in the crucial steps of COVID-19 pathophysiology. Their anti-inflammatory properties include inhibition of transcription factors and subsequent downregulation of proinflammatory mediators. They also present fibrinolytic and anticoagulant properties. Additionally, bromelain inhibits cyclooxygenase and modulates prostaglandins and thromboxane, affecting both inflammation and coagulation, and also hydrolyzes bradykinin. Interestingly, curcumin has been shown in in silico studies to prevent entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells as well as viral replication, while a recent experimental study has demonstrated that bromelain may also inhibit viral entry into cells. Notably, bromelain substantially increases the absorption of curcumin after oral administration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report highlighting the significance of bromelain and, most importantly, the potential preventive value of the synergistic effects of bromelain and curcumin against severe COVID-19.","Kritis, Panagiotis; Karampela, Irene; Kokoris, Styliani; Dalamaga, Maria",Metabol Open,610,1

Data from a behavior survey during COVID-19, conducted in Brazil with 45,161 people (18 years old or older), from April 24 to May 24, 2020, were used. The outcome variable was the onset or increase in sleep problems, and the exposure variable was the presence of CNCDs. The adjusted Odds Ratio of the association between CNCDs and sleep was estimated, and a mediation analysis was performed to test the effect of the report of sadness or nervousness on this association, using the Karlson Holm Breen method. The increase in sleep problems was reported by 44.9% of the population, and 33.9% reported at least one CNCD. The chance of sleep problems was higher among people with diabetes (1.34; 1.05-1.71), hypertension (1.26; 1.06-1.50), and with coronary heart diseases (1.36; 1.13-1.65) or respiratory diseases (1.42; 1.04-1.93). Compared to people without CNCDs, individuals with at least one CNCD had a 36% greater chance of impaired sleep (1.36; 1.19-1.55).

Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital in Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym ""AIFELL"" consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe's post-hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score.

However, p38-targeted therapeutics have largely failed in clinical trials in part due to the ubiquitous expression and essential physiological roles of p38 activity in almost all tissues. We have previously shown that G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation activates an understudied atypical p38 pathway, through direct interaction between p38 and an essential adaptor protein TGF-? Activated Kinase 1 Binding Protein 1 (TAB1), inducing p38 autophosphorylation. There is a critical gap in our understanding of how this pathway induces inflammation, and a greater understanding of atypical p38 signaling could provide alternative therapeutic approaches. We hypothesized that the spatiotemporal regulation of atypical p38 signaling is critical for downstream signaling responses associated with pulmonary inflammation. In this work, we have developed a Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform of sub-cellular localized biosensors to map p38 activity. Through exploration of GPCRs known to activate atypical p38 signaling, we demonstrate that GPCRs significantly alter the dynamics of p38 activity in part through sequestration of the kinase in the cytosol. This is contrary to rapid nuclear translocation after induction of classical MKK3/6 mediated p38 signaling. This ligand-dependent bias in the spatiotemporal dynamics of p38 activity represents an under-explored mechanism for regulation of vascular inflammation. Our current studies are focused on defining how cytosolic atypical p38 modulates pulmonary inflammatory signaling. We have established a basis for further expansion of this system to differentiate cytosolic-biased GPCR signaling at the endosome and will adapt this platform of biosensors for further exploration in pulmonary vascular cells. Combined, these studies provide foundational insight into the spatiotemporal bias of TAB1-mediated p38 signaling and its modulation of vascular inflammatory disease.","Burton, Jeremy Okalova Jennifer Grimsey Neil",The FASEB Journal,610,13
459737,459737,459737,India's COVID-19 teacher,16.791964,4.044412,2020,"BACKGROUND: The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. METHODS: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. FINDINGS: We assessed 155â689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114â957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115â394 patients, with 72â310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 95·7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0·939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 94·8% specificity (AUROC 0·940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98·5%) across a range of prevalences (&#8804;5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92·3% accuracy (NPV 97·6%, AUROC 0·881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92·5% accuracy (97·7%, 0·871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95·1%, admissions model 94·1%) and NPV (ED model 99·0%, admissions model 98·5%). INTERPRETATION: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

This pre-specified analysis included Japanese patients in PINNACLE-4. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized study (NCT02343458), patients received GFF MDI (18/9.6 µg), glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI (18 µg), formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI (9.6 µg), or placebo MDI twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) over Weeks 12-24. Secondary lung function endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, and safety were assessed. The Japanese subpopulation (n = 150) analyses were exploratory. RESULTS: GFF MDI improved change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over Weeks 12-24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean [LSM] differences [95% confidence interval]: 69 [8-131], 60 [-1 to 121], and 275 [180-370] mL, respectively).

This review article summarizes the current evidence by also emphasizing its heterogeneity. Importantly, current evidence suggests that these non-invasive strategies can be successfully used even in case of severe respiratory failure and are, thus, indeed capable of avoiding intubation, and consequently, tube-related complications. In contrast, it also remains to be emphasized that prolonged spontaneous breathing supported by non-invasive treatment strategies is also prone to complications. In particular, late NIV failure is associated with substantially deteriorated outcome, which is suggested to be meaningful in view of NIV failure rates still being high in Germany.

First, the situation was complicated by the influence of transnational migrant workers, large numbers of whom returned to Romania when the pandemic started, accounting for distinct geographical variations in the rates of infection. At the same time, large numbers were able to leave the country at the height of the pandemic because they were “needed” for low-paid agricultural/social care work in western European countries. Second, the pandemic placed tension on Romania’s relationship with the EU, whilst highlighting a number of existing issues between Romania and its neighbors. Third, Romania’s strict lockdown measures exacerbated long-standing internal tensions, particularly with regard to the large and marginalized Roma community.

Some companies -- in the case of their default -- can trigger significant cascades of shock in the supply-chain network and are thus systemically risky. Up to now, systemic risk of individual companies was practically not quantifiable, due to the unavailability of firm-level transaction data. So far, economic shocks are typically studied in the framework of input-output analysis on the industry-level that can't relate risk to individual firms. Exact firm-level supply networks based on tax or payment data exist only for very few countries. Here we explore to what extent telecommunication data can be used as an inexpensive, easily available, and real-time alternative to reconstruct national supply networks on the firm-level. We find that the conditional probability of correctly identifying a true customer-supplier link -- given a communication link exists -- is about 90%. This quality level allows us to reliably estimate a systemic risk profile of an entire country that serves as a proxy for the resilience of its economy. In particular, we are able to identify the high systemic risk companies. We find that 65 firms have the potential to trigger large cascades of disruption in production chains that could cause severe damages in the economy.

On multivariate analysis, at COVID-19 onset, the probability of in-hospital mortality was increased with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.63), ADL score < 4 (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.70), asthenia (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.32), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score &#8805; 2 (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.22) and specific COVID-19 anomalies on chest computerized tomography (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.46). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information about older patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized. A quick bedside evaluation at admission of sex, functional status, systolic arterial pressure, consciousness, respiratory rate and asthenia can identify older patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes.","Zerah, Lorène; Baudouin, Édouard; Pépin, Marion; Mary, Morgane; Krypciak, Sébastien; Bianco, Céline; Roux, Swasti; Gross, Ariane; Toméo, Charlotte; Lemarié, Nadège; Dureau, Antoine; Bastiani, Sophie; Ketz, Flora; Boully, Clémence; de Villelongue, Cédric; Romdhani, Mouna; Desoutter, Marie-Astrid; Duron, Emmanuelle; David, Jean-Philippe; Thomas, Caroline; Paillaud, Elena; de Malglaive, Pauline; Bouvard, Eric; Lacrampe, Mathilde; Mercadier, Elise; Monti, Alexandra; Hanon, Olivier; Fossey-Diaz, Virginie; Bourdonnec, Lauriane; Riou, Bruno; Vallet, Hélène; Boddaert, Jacques","J. gerontol.

As with all medical fields, plastic and reconstructive surgery has been profoundly impacted across the entire spectrum of practice from academic medical centers to solo private practice. The decision to preserve vital life-saving equipment and cancel elective procedures to protect patients and medical staff has been extremely challenging on multiple levels. Frequent and inconsistent messaging disseminated by many voices on the national stage often conflicts and serves only to exacerbate an already difficult decision-making process. METHODS: A survey of relevant COVID-19 literature is presented, and bioethical principles are utilized to generate guidelines for plastic surgeons in patient care through this pandemic. RESULTS: A cohesive framework based upon core bioethical values is presented here to assist plastic surgeons in navigating this rapidly evolving global pandemic. CONCLUSION: Plastic surgeons around the world have been affected by COVID-19 and will adapt to continue serving their patients. The lessons learned in this present pandemic will undoubtedly prove useful in future challenges to come.","Chi, David; Chen, Austin D; Dorante, Miguel I; Lee, Bernard T; Sacks, Justin M",J. reconstr. microsurg,610,16

In addition to the vast number of global mortalities due to COVID-19, since its outbreak, almost every aspect of human lives has changed one way or another. In the present review, various defensive and offensive strategies developed to confront COVID-19 are illustrated. The Administration of immune-boosting micronutrients/agents, as well as the inhibition of the activity of incompetent gatekeepers, including some host cell receptors (e.g. ACE2) and proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2), are some efficient defensive strategies. Antibody/phage therapies and specifically vaccines also play a prominent role in the enhancement of host defense against COVID-19. Nanotechnology, however, can considerably weaken the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, utilizing fake cellular locks (compounds mimicking cell receptors) to block the viral keys (spike proteins). Generally, two strategies are developed to interfere with the binding of spike proteins to the host cell receptors, either utilizing fake cellular locks to block the viral keys or utilizing fake viral keys to block the cellular locks. Due to their evolutionary conserved nature, viral enzymes, including 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and helicase are highly potential targets for drug repurposing strategy. Thus, various steps of viral replication/transcription can effectively be blocked by their inhibition, leading to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RNA decoy and CRISPR technologies likely offer the best offensive strategies after viral entry into the host cells, inhibiting the viral replication/assembly in the infected cells and substantially reducing the quantity of viral progeny.","Khodajou-Masouleh, Hamidreza; Shahangian, S Shirin; Rasti, Behnam",Drug Metab Rev,610,16

The clinical outcomes of elderly individuals and those with underlying diseases affected by COVID-19 are serious, and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even mortality. Currently, the clinical treatments for COVID-19 mostly involve symptom alleviation measures and non-specific broad spectrum antiviral drugs, as highly effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are not yet available. Lactoferrin (LF) is a safe iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in the milk of the majority of mammals and exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity, including against coronaviruses. In addition, LF also exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-infective and immune-regulating properties, which are in line with the treatment requirements for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the use of LF may be of value in the prevention and/or management of COVID-19. The aim of the present review was to summarize the previous reports on the antiviral properties of LF and compare these with the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to determine whether LF could be used to assist in the prevention of COVID-19 and to investigate the possible underlying mechanisms governing its mode of action.","Wang, Yidan; Wang, Puxiu; Wang, Haoran; Luo, Yifan; Wan, Long; Jiang, Mingyan; Chu, Yang",Exp Ther Med,610,33

This study gauges the impact of COVID-19 on optometry education and practices in India. Methods: The impact of COVID-19 among key stakeholders of Indian optometry that included educators, students, and practitioners was surveyed. The content validity of the survey tool was achieved through a focused group discussion with experts. Results: Of the 1408 responses, 118 were educators, 845 were students and 445 were practitioners. Post COVID-19 lock-down, a high percentage of students (96%) and educators (94%) were now using online mode of education to learn and teach. The blended learning methods were reported to be used by 81% of educators. Practical skills were the most difficult to teach by educators and to learn by students. Almost a third of the students were concerned about their internships and job opportunities amid the pandemic. Practitioners felt confident in performing routine eye examinations with personal protective equipment (PPE). Telemedicine was found to be adopted by 55% of the private practitioners and 49% of the eye hospitals. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to reform Indian optometry education through blended learning methods. Optometry practices changed and adapted instantly to the new hygiene norms that have raised the standard of care provided to patients. Telemedicine emerged as a mode of providing care by optometrists. Overall, all key stakeholders of optometry in India were found to have adapted well to the sudden changes due to COVID 19 pandemic.","Sehgal, Shivalika; Shinde, Lakshmi; Madheswaran, Gopinath; Mukherjee, Paula; Verkicharla, Pavan; Easwaran, Soumya; Bandamwar, Kalika",Indian J Ophthalmol,610,24

BACKGROUND: CT might have a prognostic predictive value beyond its diagnostic value. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients, 32 with cytokine storm and 36 without cytokine storm, were included in the study. Four different scoring methods were created according to elementary lesions, distribution and involvement rate. CT scores and demographic findings of the cases were compared in the cytokine storm and non-cytokine storm groups. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 57.72 (SD: 13.5) and 40 (58.8 %) of them were male. The cytokine storm was significantly more common among male patients and patients of older age (p=0.04). The AUC values of CT score 1, CT score 2, CT score 3, and CT score 4 were as follows; 0.772 (95% CI; 0.651-0.892), 0.766 (95% CI; 0.647-0.885), 0.758 (95% CI; 0.639-8.78), and 0.760 (95% CI; 0.640-0.881), respectively.

We prospectively assessed outcomes in patients managed in a hepatology clinic (HC) alone vs. those managed in combination with a multidisciplinary weight management program (MWMP). We describe each group's readiness to change at the time of NAFLD diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD were given a modified Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) at enrollment (T1) to assess readiness to change. They were then followed at 3-9 months (T2) and at 10-15 months (T3). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, and transaminases over time and between the two groups. There were no significant treatment group main effects or treatment × time interactions for our primary end points for HC alone (n = 75) or with MWMP (n = 18). There was a significant main effect for time for BMI z-score, with BMI z-scores declining on average by 0.0568 (P = 0.004) from visit to visit. Low SOCRATES subscales scores in HC alone (n = 33) or with MWMP (n = 4) suggested a patient population with low recognition of disease and likelihood of taking steps for change. Patients with obesity and NAFLD had low scores on all three SOCRATES subscales. Despite this, both groups had improvement in BMI z-score without significant difference between the two treatment groups in other primary end points. Further study is needed to identify the most effective patient selection and treatment strategies for pediatric patients with NAFLD, including pharmacotherapy and surgery.","Slowik, Voytek; Wasserkrug, Heather; Fischer, Ryan T; Connelly, Mark; Deacy, Amanda D; Hampl, Sarah; Daniel, James F",Clinical and translational science (Online),610,20

The challenge of caring for COPD patients is made even more complex when it has to be delivered over the phone. The interview must be conducted without examining the patient, without performing additional tests, and without checking their inhalation technique. Therefore, healthcare providers who conduct these interviews must be trained to perform them properly in order to make the right decisions. This document is aimed at healthcare professionals who need to provide some form of telephone care to COPD patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and is based on the authors’ experience in telephone interviews conducted during this period.

The aim of this study was to investigate the echocardiographic features in COVID-19 patients between severe and non-severe groups. For this single-center study, data from patients who were treated for COVID-19 between March 25, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were collected. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) images were obtained for all patients. Patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of their COVID-19 infections. 2DE parameters indicating right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) functions were compared between the two groups. A total of 90 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were included in this study. The mean age of the severe group (n = 44) was 63.3 ± 15.7 years, and 54% were male. The mean age of non-severe group (n = 46) was 49.7 ± 21.4 years, and 47% were male. In the severe group, RV and LV diameters were larger (RV, 36.6 ± 5.9 mm vs. 33.1 ± 4.8 mm, p = 0.003; LV 47.3 ± 5.8 mm vs. 44.9 ± 3.8 mm, p = 0.023), the LE ejection fraction (LVEF) and the RV fractional area change (RV-FAC) were lower (LVEF, 54.0 ± 9.8% vs. 61.9 ± 4.8%, p < 0.001; RV-FAC, 41.4 ± 4.1% vs. 45.5 ± 4.5%, p < 0.001), and pericardial effusions were more frequent (23% vs. 0%) compared to patients in the non-severe group. A multiple linear regression analysis determined that LVEF, right atrial diameter, high-sensitivity troponin I, d-dimer, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, were independent predictors of RV dilatation. The results demonstrate that both right and left ventricular functions decreased due to COVID-19 infection in the severe group. 2DE is a valuable bedside tool and may yield valuable information about the clinical status of patients and their prognoses.","Barman, Hasan Ali; Atici, Adem; Tekin, Esra Aktas; Baycan, Omer Faruk; Alici, Gokhan; Meric, Bengisu Keskin; Sit, Omer; Genc, Omer; Er, Fahri; Gungor, Baris; Sahin, Irfan; Turgut, Namigar",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,610,20

We report a case series of 8 patients with COVID-19 and PRES diagnosed at two academic medical centers between March and July of 2020. The clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age was 57.9 ± 12 years, and 50% were women. Four patients had previous vascular comorbidities. All the patients suffered from severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care unit admission. Five patients were not hypertensive at presentation (all SBP < 127 mmHg). Neurologic symptoms included seizures in 7 patients; impaired consciousness in 5 patients; focal neurological signs in 3 patients; and visual disturbances in 1 patient. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging which indicated asymmetric T2 prolongation or diffusion changes (50%), extensive fronto-parieto-occipital involvement (25%), vascular irregularities (12.5%) and intracranial hemorrhage (25%). Four patients were treated with tocilizumab. Three patients were discharged without neurologic disability, 2 patients had persistent focal neurologic deficits and 2 expired. One patient's prognosis remains guarded. Together, these data support the relationship between PRES and endothelial dysfunction associated with severe COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, PRES can be triggered by uncontrolled hypertension, or occur independently in the setting of systemic illness and certain medications. Like other infectious processes, critically ill patients with COVID-19 may be at greater risk of PRES because of impaired vasoreactivity or the use of novel agents like Tocilizumab.","Lallana, Sofía; Chen, Austin; Requena, Manuel; Rubiera, Marta; Sanchez, Anna; Siegler, James E; Muchada, Marián",J Clin Neurosci,610,26

Of the 19 patients under the PD Hub, 11 had a Case Manager, four were engaged with the PD Hub's day services / safe service and one with a PD Hub readiness group. Six of the 50 patients had a documented refusal to engage with the PD Hub.Only 27 of the patients had either received psychological intervention, were on a waiting list, or had a referral in place. 16% of patients refused a psychotherapy referral. Of the 20 patients who received psychological treatment, eight completed a form of psychotherapy (cognitive analytic therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) and 12 psychological intervention (either structured case management, psychoeducation or emotional coping skills).Only 28 of 50 patients had an extended care plan and 28 had a collaborative risk management plan in place.ConclusionThere was no obvious correlation between previous completion of psychological therapy and degree of polypharmacy. Median admission time was reduced for patients under the PD Hub (six vs 14 days). This was also reduced for patients who accessed psychotherapy or psychotherapeutic interventions (nine vs 10 days).This audit coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent reduced access to the PD Hub and psychotherapy service. There is a need to consider barriers to EUPD patients receiving psychotherapy.EUPD patients may have numerous hospital admissions and frequently present in crisis. Given the iatrogenic harm from prolonged hospital admission, there is a need to consider incorporating a collaborative extended care plan and risk management plan as part of discharge planning, following admission to hospital.","Hyland, Declan Daniels Charlie Ionescu Iulian Goodier Katie Graham Simon",BJPsych Open,610,16

Recent scientific evidences have suggested that the main protease (Mpro) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound Mpro complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the Mpro. In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 µs long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo Mpro structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and Mpro dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular-level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Weng, Ying Li; Naik, Shiv Rakesh; Dingelstad, Nadia; Lugo, Miguel R; Kalyaanamoorthy, Subha; Ganesan, Aravindhan",Sci Rep,610,13

This study describes three types of changes that police agencies in counties worldwide made. First, how have various domains of policing changed and how much did they change? Second, were these changes regulated by the official policy? Third, what are the potential consequences of the changes made during the pandemic? Taking a mixed-methods approach, our quantitative survey data from 27 countries, buttressed by qualitative responses, enable us to examine changes in these three areas. Our results suggest there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the degree of change, the use of policy to make the changes, and the perceived effects of the changes. Some changes (i.e., the use of personal protective equipment) are relatively ubiquitous and common sense based on the pandemic. Other organizational changes show a great deal more variation, especially when considering the valence of the change. Finally, the police executives from these countries express a highly optimistic?and potentially overly rosy?view of the potential longer term consequences of the pandemic or the operational changes made because of it. Overall, the results paint a more complicated picture of the responses to the pandemic made by the police organizations included in our sample.

This study was conducted to evaluate the distance of oral and nasal droplet spread in a model that simulates coughing and sneezing in a public setting, specifically a school setting, to guide faculty and staff members with safety measures and guidelines to reduce droplet spread. Several models were prepared to observe and visualize the spread of fluid simulating respiratory droplets in places such as the classroom and the cafeteria, in which a student would be more susceptible to contract a virus since individuals cannot wear masks while eating. For all trials, a 2.54 centimeter balloon with 0.3 milliliters of diluted fluorescent paint was placed inside a mannequin head and was exploded outwards from the mannequin's mouth at 5 pounds per square inch (psi). Using a black light, the expelled fluorescent macroscopic droplets were visualized. When applying safety precautions and guidelines such as mandating face masks, the results of the experiments conducted in this study with a surgical mask, were extremely positive. However, without other safety precautions such as face masks and barriers, social distancing proved to be ineffective. In conclusion the most effective way to prevent droplet spread during activities where masks simply cannot be worn, such as eating, is to apply barriers between the individuals. Applying barriers and wearing masks successfully prevented macroscopic droplet spread.","Bhavsar, Atreyus A",PLoS One,610,30

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study that included patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil from March 2019 to December 2019. Patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and who were extubated during the study period were included. The primary outcome was extubation failure, considered as the need for reintubation in the first 72 hours after extubation. The secondary outcome was a combined outcome with extubation failure or the need for therapeutic noninvasive ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included. Extubation failure was observed in 29 (28.7%) patients. In univariate analysis, patients with a negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance higher than one liter had a lower rate of extubation failure (12.0%) than patients with a negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance lower than 1L (34.2%; p = 0.033). Mechanical ventilation duration and negative 48-hour postextubation fluid balance lower than one liter were associated with extubation failure when corrected for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 in multivariate analysis. When we evaluated the combined outcome, only negative 48-hour postextubation lower than 1L maintained an association when corrected for for Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 and mechanical ventilation duration. CONCLUSION: The 48-hour postextubation fluid balance is associated with extubation failure. Further studies are necessary to assess whether avoiding positive fluid balance in this period might improve weaning outcomes.","Santos, Priscila Albrecht Dos; Ribas, Alexandre; Quadros, Thiele Cabral Coelho; Blattner, Clarissa Netto; Boniatti, Márcio Manozzo",Rev. bras. ter. intensiva,610,29

Complexation takes place when materials like proteins and polysaccharides are blended to promote the entrapment of active compounds. The interaction forces between the charged groups in the polymeric chains allow the miscibility of the components in the complex system. Understanding the interactions taking place between the polymers as well as between the wall material and the active compound is important when designing delivery systems.

To systematically explore the relationship between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), a novel strategy using single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was developed. This approach was applied to pooled conjugative plasmids from clinically isolated multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary referral hospital over a 9-month period. The conjugative plasmid pool was obtained from transconjugants that acquired antimicrobial resistance after plasmid conjugation with 53 clinical isolates. The plasmid pool was then subjected to SMRT sequencing, and 82 assembled plasmid fragments were obtained. In total, 124 ARGs (responsible for resistance to ß-lactam, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside, among others) and 317 MGEs [including transposons (Tns), insertion sequences (ISs), and integrons] were derived from these fragments. Most of these ARGs were linked to MGEs, allowing for the establishment of a relationship network between MGEs and/or ARGs that can be used to describe the dissemination of resistance by mobile elements. Key elements involved in resistance transposition were identified, including IS26, Tn3, IS903B, ISEcp1, and ISKpn19. As the most predominant IS in the network, a typical IS26-mediated multicopy composite transposition event was illustrated by tracing its flanking 8-bp target site duplications (TSDs). The landscape of the pooled plasmid sequences highlights the diversity and complexity of the relationship between MGEs and ARGs, underpinning the clinical value of dominant HGT profiles.","Jiang, Yan; Wang, Yanfei; Hua, Xiaoting; Qu, Yue; Peleg, Anton Y; Yu, Yunsong",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,610,16

METHODS: This retrospective single-center study consecutively enrolled patients who presented with STEMI and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) during the outbreak of COVID- 19. Due to the delay in the reporting of the PCR test results, our postprocedural triage regarding COVID-19, followed by the isolation strategy, was based on lung CT scan results. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with STEMI referred to our center. PPCI was done for 44 (91%) of these patients. The mean symptom-to-device time was 490.93 ± 454.608 minutes, and the mean FMC-to-device time was and 154.12 ± 36.27 minutes. Nine (18%) patients with STEMI were diagnosed as having typical/indeterminate features indicating COVID-19 involvement. During hospitalization, 1 (2.0%) patient died of cardiogenic shock.

After 30 seconds contact under standard aqueous conditions CPC mouthwashes achieved a [≥]4.0log10 PFU/mLreduction in SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) titres whereas comparable products containing CHX achieved <2.0log10 PFU/mL reduction. Further testing with CPC mouthwashes demonstrated efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, with inactivation below the limit of detection observed against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.35.1) and Gamma (P.1) variants. Virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwash was also observed in the presence of human saliva with the product delivering [≥]4.0log10 PFU/mL reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titres after 30 seconds providing additional evidence for the virucidal efficacy of CPC mouthwashes under simulated physiological conditions. Together these data suggest CPC-based mouthwashes are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 and further supports the use of mouthwash to mitigate the risk of transmission during dentistry procedures.","Anderson, Enyia R; Patterson, Edward I; Richards, Siobhan; Green, Alison K; Mukherjee, Sayandip; Hoptroff, Michael; Hughes, Grant",,610,20

ObjectiveTo assess the course of illness and final outcome in patients who received RDV at various stages of illness, and compare it to the non-RDV group. MethodsThis is a retrospective data analysis of 1262 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from May5, 2020 to August 31, 2020. The primary outcomes were progression to mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log rank test were used for evaluating primary outcomes. Results398 patients comprised the RDV group and 260 patients comprised the non-RDV group. 2/3rd of patients were above 50 years of age in both the groups and 3/4th patients were male. Mortality rate was 5.8% in RDV group (10.4% in non-RDV group). Mortality rate was 3.6%, 4% and 16.7% when RDV was started within 5 days, 5 to 10 days and after 10 days of symptom onset respectively. Fewer patients in RDV group progressed to MV (4.0% v/s 8.2%). Earlier discharge occurred in RDV group. Use of supplemental oxygen was observed in 44.7% patients in RDV group (54.2% in non-RDV group). No significant adverse events were observed with RDV. Survival analysis showed that probability of event (death) was significant for patients with hypertension (HT) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) in RDV group. ConclusionEarly initiation of RDV is associated with shorter hospital stay, lower mortality as well as reduced need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation.","Madan, Surabhi; Patel, Amit; Sharan, Kartikae; Ghosh, Shayon; Venugopal, Vishnu; Shah, Nitesh; Shah, Bhagyesh; Thakkar, Vipul; Chovatiya, Rashmi; Shah, Hardik; Dhabhi, Pradip; Patel, Minesh; Meghnathi, Bhowmik; Sankhla, Vineet; Kapoor, Vipul; Patel, Tejas; Soni, Maulik; Bapat, Nirav; Shah, Kaivan; Chandarana, Ritanshu; Bhatt, Parloop; Rana, Manish",,610,20

We aimed to explore the standards for research conduction, publications and retraction of articles related to COVID-19 pharmacotherapy research during the pandemic. We analysed data from the contemporary literatures on studies reporting pharmacological agents for COVID-19 using MEDLINE, PubMed, WHO database and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and March 20, 2021. The initial search revealed a total of 61,801 articles. Based on the inclusion criteria, a total of 124 studies related to various pharmacological agents were included in the final analysis. Most of the studies were reported from the United States (n = 30, 24%). Of the 124 studies, 50 (40%) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Immunomodulatory drugs-related (n = 17, 34%) and COVID-19 vaccine-related studies (n = 14, 28%) were the main topics in the relevant RCTs. The median days for dissemination of findings in journals were 114 days (IQR 61-189). A comparative analysis revealed that RCTs were disseminated earlier (median 79 days; IQR 52-131) when compared to observational studies (median = 144 days; IQR 69-206) (p = 0.003). Six papers were retracted from high impact journals; in which the average period till publication was 33 days. Retraction of papers occurred within 10-48 days. Expedited reviews, research approval and early publications of COVID-19 related pharmaceutical studies could have an impact on the quality of publications. However, the huge number of publications in short time creates confusion for readers during the early phases of the pandemic. Retraction of papers is alarming but ensures research integrity and correctness of scientific information. These abbreviated processes could affect patient care and public awareness. It is imperative to follow rapid but rigours ethical standards for research approval and peer-review process for publications during health pandemics.","El-Menyar, Ayman; Mekkodathil, Ahammed; Asim, Mohammad; Consunji, Rafael; Rizoli, Sandro; Abdel-Aziz Bahey, Ahmed; Al-Thani, Hassan",Sci Prog,610,16

Indias relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age gradient of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling for estimating the level of Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. Once Indias age structure is taken into account, these figures correspond to one of the most severe cases of Covid-19 mortality in the world. BackgroundIndia has recorded after February a second outbreak of coronavirus that has affected the entire country. The accuracy of official statistics of Covid-19 mortality has been called in question and the real number of Covid-19 deaths is thought to be several times higher than reported. In this paper, we assembled four independent population samples to model and estimate the level of Covid-19 mortality in India. MethodsWe first used a first population sample with age and sex of Covid-19 victims to develop a Gompertz model of Covid-19 mortality in India. We applied and adjusted this mortality model on two other national population samples after factoring in the demographic characteristics of these samples. We finally derive from one of these samples the most reasonable estimate of Covid-19 mortality level in India and confirm this result with the use of a fourth population sample. FindingsOur findings point to a death toll of about 2.2 million persons by late May 2021. This is the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world. Once standardized for its age and sex structure, Indias Covid-19 mortality rate is above that of Brazil or the USA. InterpretationOur analysis shows that existing population samples allow for an alternative estimation of deaths due to Covid-19 in India. The results confirm that only one out 7 Covid-19 deaths appear to be registered in India. The estimates point to a very Covid-19 mortality rate, which is even higher after age and sex standardization. The magnitude of the pandemic in India requires immediate attention and calls for a strong response based on a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the scale-up of vaccination to make them accessible to all, with an improved surveillance system to monitor the progression of the pandemic.","Guilmoto, Christophe Z",,610,1

If this is correct, simply naming unrelated words and then measuring the semantic distance between them could serve as an objective measure of divergent thinking. To test this hypothesis, we asked 8,914 participants to name 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. A computational algorithm then estimated the average semantic distance between the words; related words (e.g., cat and dog) have shorter distances than unrelated ones (e.g., cat and thimble). We predicted that people producing greater semantic distances would also score higher on traditional creativity measures. In Study 1, we found moderate to strong correlations between semantic distance and two widely used creativity measures (the Alternative Uses Task and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task). In Study 2, with participants from 98 countries, semantic distances varied only slightly by basic demographic variables. There was also a positive correlation between semantic distance and performance on a range of problems known to predict creativity. Overall, semantic distance correlated at least as strongly with established creativity measures as those measures did with each other. Naming unrelated words in what we call the Divergent Association Task can thus serve as a brief, reliable, and objective measure of divergent thinking.","Olson, Jay A; Nahas, Johnny; Chmoulevitch, Denis; Cropper, Simon J; Webb, Margaret E",Proc.

However, systematic reviews of the registered clinical trials are still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials for COVID-19 to summarize their characteristics. METHODS: This study is based on the PRISMA recommendations in the Cochrane handbook. The Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched to identify registered clinical trials related to COVID-19. The retrieval inception date was February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) for COVID-19 were identified. The majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials have been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in the pre-experiment stage, 13 trials were phase III, and four trials were phase IV. The intervention methods included traditional Chinese medicine in 26 trials, Western medicine in 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in 19 trials. The subjects were primarily non-critical adult patients (&#8805; 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60-200), and the median length of the trial periods was 179 d (IQR: 94-366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, the methodological quality of both the interventional trials and observational studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive clinical trials on the treatment of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be performed in China. However, based on the uncertain methodological quality, small sample size, and long trial duration, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence regarding the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for clinical trials of COVID-19 in the future.","Zhu, Rui-Fang; Gao, Yu-Lu; Robert, Sue-Ho; Gao, Jin-Ping; Yang, Shi-Gui; Zhu, Chang-Tai",J Transl Med,610,24

This study exploits the impact of pandemic-induced human mobility restrictions, as the response to COVID-19 pandemic, on the urban air quality across China. Different from the ""traditional"" difference-in-differences analysis, a human mobility-based difference-in-differences method is used to quantify the effect of intracity mobility reductions on air quality across 325 cities in China. The model shows that the air quality index (AQI) experiences a 12.2% larger reduction in the cities with lockdown. Moreover, this reduction effect varies with different types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO decreased by 13.1%, 15.3%, 4%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the effect is greater in northern, higher income, more industrialized cities, and more economically active cities. We also estimate the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 26,385 to 38,977 during the sample period. These findings illuminate a new light on the role of a policy intervention in the pollution emission, while also providing a roadmap for future research on the pollution effect of COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Meichang; Liu, Feng; Zheng, Meina",Air Qual Atmos Health,610,1

The peptide L-glutamyl-L-tryptophan (EW/IM862) has been claimed to exhibit inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo. However, the potential role of natural peptides with respect to anti-angiogenic properties is unsettled. The current study explores anti-angiogenic effects of the dipeptides WL, EW, IW, and WE. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a bottom-up strategy, we first evaluated the effects of the peptides on VEGFR-2 signalling and quantified their effects in different angiogenesis assays. WL consistently had the strongest effects on phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and downstream signalling. Therefore, this peptide was chosen in comparison with EW to further assess anti-angiogenic properties. However, sprout formation in 3D fibrin gel bead assay was significantly inhibited by EW only. Furthermore, vessel sprouting in the mouse aortic ring assay was decreased by the presence of WL and EW compared to control. Results from a chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that under VEGF stimulation WL and EW decreased the number of blood vessels versus control. These results were in line with those obtained in a matrigel plug assay. The VEGF-induced increase in the hemoglobin content was nearly abolished when treatment was combined with either WL or EW application. In the murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, WL exhibited a small albeit significant anti-angiogenetic effect.

Data for January 22-July 15, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively (January 22-May 6) and prospectively (May 7-July 15) to detect hotspot counties. No counties met hotspot criteria during January 22-March 7, 2020. During March 8-July 15, 2020, 818 counties met hotspot criteria for &#8805;1 day; these counties included 80% of the U.S. population. The daily number of counties meeting hotspot criteria peaked in early April, decreased and stabilized during mid-April-early June, then increased again during late June-early July. The percentage of counties in the South and West Census regions* meeting hotspot criteria increased from 10% and 13%, respectively, during March-April to 28% and 22%, respectively, during June-July. Identification of community transmission as a contributing factor increased over time, whereas identification of outbreaks in long-term care facilities, food processing facilities, correctional facilities, or other workplaces as contributing factors decreased. Identification of hotspot counties and understanding how they change over time can help prioritize and target implementation of U.S. public health response activities.","Oster, Alexandra M; Kang, Gloria J; Cha, Amy E; Beresovsky, Vladislav; Rose, Charles E; Rainisch, Gabriel; Porter, Laura; Valverde, Eduardo E; Peterson, Elisha B; Driscoll, Anne K; Norris, Tina; Wilson, Nana; Ritchey, Matthew; Walke, Henry T; Rose, Dale A; Oussayef, Nadia L; Parise, Monica E; Moore, Zack S; Fleischauer, Aaron T; Honein, Margaret A; Dirlikov, Emilio; Villanueva, Julie",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,610,16

Matching criteria included age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and baseline ventilation requirement 48 hours from admission, and in a second matching analysis, ventilation status at day 0. Variability in the timing of transfusion relative to admission and titer of antibodies of plasma transfused allowed for analysis in specific matched cohorts. The analysis showed a significant reduction (P = 0.047) in mortality within 28 days, specifically in patients transfused within 72 hours of admission with plasma with an anti-spike protein receptor binding domain titer of &#8805;1:1350.

Even before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak infectious diseases represented one of the major causes of death of older adults. Loss of immune function and reduced protection from infectious agents with age - immunosenescence - is a result of complex mechanisms affecting production and maintenance of immune cells as well as the initiation, maintenance and termination of properly directed immune responses.

Present testing solutions are based on the extraction of RNA from patients using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, and then testing with real-time PCR for the presence of specific RNA filaments identifying the virus. This approach is limited by the availability of reactants, trained technicians and laboratories. One of the ways to speed up the testing procedures is a group testing, where the swabs of multiple patients are grouped together and tested. In this paper we propose to use the group testing technique in conjunction with an advanced replication scheme in which each patient is allocated in two or more groups to reduce the total numbers of tests and to allow testing of even larger numbers of people. Under mild assumptions, a 13 × average reduction of tests can be achieved compared to individual testing without delay in time.","Zilinskas, Julius; Lancinskas, Algirdas; Guarracino, Mario R",Sci Rep,610,16

In addition, we provide evidence in patients with COVID-19 that SARS-CoV-2 is massively detected and replicated within the multiciliated cells. We observed these findings during the early stage of COVID-19, when infected ciliated cells were rapidly replaced by differentiating precursor cells. Moreover, our analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism was restricted to the nasal ciliated versus oral squamous epithelium. These results imply that targeting ciliated cells of the nasal epithelium during the early stage of COVID-19 could be an ideal strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 propagation.","Ahn, Ji Hoon; Kim, JungMo; Hong, Seon Pyo; Choi, Sung Yong; Yang, Myung Jin; Ju, Young Seok; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Ho Min; Rahman, M D Tazikur; Chung, Man Ki; Hong, Sang Duk; Bae, Hosung; Lee, Chang-Seop; Koh, Gou Young",J. clin. invest,610,16

METHODS: U.S. adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the HeartlineTM clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the HeartlineTM mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. RESULTS: Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report. CONCLUSIONS: Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake.

This paper considers a mixture of the Marshall–Olkin extended Weibull distribution for efficient modeling of failure, survival, and COVID-19 data under classical and Bayesian perspectives based on type-II censored data. We derive several properties of the new distribution such as moments, incomplete moments, mean deviation, average lifetime, mean residual lifetime, Rényi entropy, Shannon entropy, and order statistics of the proposed distribution. Maximum likelihood and Bayes procedure are used to derive both point and interval estimates of the parameters involved in the model. Bayes estimators of the unknown parameters of the model are obtained under symmetric (squared error) and asymmetric (linear exponential (LINEX)) loss functions using gamma priors for both the shape and the scale parameters. Furthermore, approximate confidence intervals and Bayes credible intervals (CIs) are also obtained. Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators and Bayes estimators with respect to their estimated risk. The flexibility and importance of the proposed distribution are illustrated by means of four real datasets.

Inspired by state and local governments that declared racism a public health crisis or emergency, the Anti-Racism in Public Health Act of 2020 reflects a shifting paradigm in which racism is considered a social determinant of health. Indeed, health inequities fundamentally rooted in structural racism have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which calls for the integration of antiracist praxis to promote ethical public health research processes. This commentary describes ways in which antiracist praxis-which emphasizes empowerment of traditionally marginalized populations-offers strategies to explicitly address power imbalance, stigmatization, and other consequences of structural racism in public health research.","Fletcher, Faith E; Jiang, Wendy; Best, Alicia L",Hastings Cent Rep,610,29

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of non-structural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (remdesivir, alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","Ogando, Natacha S; Dalebout, Tim J; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Limpens, Ronald W A L; van der Meer, Yvonne; Caly, Leon; Druce, Julian; de Vries, Jutte J C; Kikkert, Marjolein; Bárcena, Montserrat; Sidorov, Igor; Snijder, Eric J",J Gen Virol,610,1

Online environments make it even more difficult to get assistance especially more recently because of COVID-19. Given the multilingual context of SuaCode students - learners across 42 African countries that are mostly Anglophone or Francophone - in this work, we developed a bilingual Artificial Intelligence (AI) Teaching Assistant (TA) - Kwame - that provides answers to students' coding questions from SuaCode courses in English and French. Kwame is a Sentence-BERT (SBERT)-based question-answering (QA) system that we trained and evaluated offline using question-answer pairs created from the course's quizzes, lesson notes and students' questions in past cohorts. Kwame finds the paragraph most semantically similar to the question via cosine similarity. We compared the system with TF-IDF and Universal Sentence Encoder. Our results showed that fine-tuning on the course data and returning the top 3 and 5 answers improved the accuracy results.

Of note, ACE2 is responsible for the host cell entry of the virus. METHODS: We extracted data on 575 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Humanitas Center, between February 21 and April 14, 2020. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of chronic treatment with ACE-I or ARBs and other clinical predictors on in-hospital mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that a chronic intake of ACE-I was associated with a trend in reduction of mortality (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27-1.03; p = 0.06), differently from a chronic intake of ARB (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.5-2.8; p=0.8). Increased age (ORs ranging from 3.4 to 25.2 and to 39.5 for 60-70, 70-80 and >80 years vs <60) and cardiovascular comorbidities (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p = 0.02) were confirmed as important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. Timely treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in ED was found to be protective (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.21-0.62; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study can contribute to understand the reasons behind the high mortality rate of patients in Lombardy, a region which accounts for >50% of total Italian deaths. Based on our findings, we support that daily intake of antihypertensive medications in the setting of COVID-19 should not be discontinued and that a timely LMWH administration in ED has shown to decrease in-hospital mortality.","Desai, Antonio; Voza, Giuseppe; Paiardi, Silvia; Teofilo, Francesca Ilaria; Caltagirone, Giuseppe; Pons, Marta Ripoll; Aloise, Monia; Kogan, Maria; Tommasini, Tobia; Savevski, Victor; Stefanini, Giulio; Angelini, Claudio; Ciccarelli, Michele; Badalamenti, Salvatore; De Nalda, Ana Lleo; Aghemo, Alessio; Cecconi, Maurizio; Martinelli Boneschi, Filippo; Voza, Antonio",Int. j. cardiol,610,25

However, amid a rapidly changing technology landscape, it has become increasingly clear that the concept may need updating, in order to keep up with new trends such as big data, open data, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

There are reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as a consequence of environmental contamination. The SARS-CoV-2 laden infective droplets can actively persist on the surface of different materials for several hours to days. Sunlight can affect the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in these aerosols and thereby have an impact on the decay rate of the virus. Solar radiation might play an important role in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 that persists in different surfaces and the environment. Among the different climatological factors, ultraviolet radiation was found to have an important role in determining the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although ultraviolet radiation C (UVC), UVB, UVA, visible light, and infrared radiation possess germicidal properties, human CoVs including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 are inherently sensitive to UVC. However, the successful decontamination using other wavebands requires higher dosages and longer administration times. Furthermore, studies have also identified association between COVID-19 fatalities and the latitude. The intensity of sunlight is highest near the equator, and therefore populations in these regions with more regular exposure to sunlight are less susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. This article has analyzed the potential impact of sunlight in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. It is evident that there exists an interesting link between sunlight exposure, latitude, and vitamin D status with COVID-19 incidence, fatality and recovery rates that requires further investigation.","Sharun, Khan Tiwari Ruchi Dhama Kuldeep",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,610,24

COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Among Nonprofit vs. For-Profit Assisted Living Facilities in Florida,16.838007,3.9667726,2020,"Falls, which are prevalent among older adults, may not only cause severe physical injuries, but also lead to low fall self-efficacy (FSE). Low FSE is associated with restricted activity, which putatively increases risk of future falls. However, emerging studies have failed to confirm this association. Furthermore, the interplay between age, gender, and fall history with falls has not been adequately addressed in adults aged 70 years or older. The aims of this secondary analysis were to: (1) prospectively explore the association of FSE and fall events considering age, gender, and fall history, and (2) examine the characteristics of fall events and fall-related outcomes. Forty-seven community-dwelling adults over 70 years of age were followed for about 12 months. During the follow-up, 22 participants with low FSE experienced 119 fall events whereas 25 participants with high FSE reported 106 fall events. Among fallers, 72.3% (n = 34) experienced recurrent fall events. About 15.0% (n = 34) of 225 fall events resulted in injuries and 4.0% of injuries required medical care. FSE was a statistically significant predictor of future fall events (incident rate ratio = 0.96, p = .013) regardless of age, gender, and fall history. Participants with low FSE were more likely than those with high FSE to fall more frequently without noticeable prodromal symptoms and apparent reasons. These findings suggest that FSE is an important protective factor against future fall events. However, interpretation of these results requires caution given the small sample size and effect size.","Yang, Rumei; Pepper, Ginette A",Res Nurs Health,610,20

To address coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently no effective drug or vaccine is available. This necessity motivated us to explore potential lead compounds by considering drug repurposing approach targeting main protease (Mpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. This enzyme considered to be an attractive drug target as it contributes significantly in mediating viral replication and transcription. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening based PhaseScore. Docking based virtual screening workflow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide GScore. The pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the selected lead compounds were characterized using ADMET. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the binding affinities of the considered lead compounds. Binding energies revealed that compound ABBV-744 binds to the Mpro with strong affinity (&#916;Gbind -45.43 kcal/mol), and the complex is more stable in comparison with other protein-ligand complexes. Our study classified three best compounds which could be considered as promising inhibitors against main protease SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Fakhar, Zeynab; Khan, Shama; AlOmar, Suliman Y; Alkhuriji, Afrah; Ahmad, Aijaz",Sci Rep,610,1

Measurements were compared and differences were statistically investigated with T student's test (p&lt;0.01). Results: Forehead digital thermometer temperatures were superimposable to those recorded in ear areas and inner canthi with the thermal camera connected to a smartphone. Differences were not statistically significant even in comparison between the sexes. Forehead temperature values detected with a thermal camera are lower than those detected with a digital forehead thermometer. Conclusion: Thermal camera on a smartphone could be reliable in measuring body temperature. Mobile thermographic values of ears and inner canthi areas can be used as an alternative to forehead digital thermometer measurements. Further applications in pediatric dentistry of thermography on smartphones should be examined.","Putrino, A.; Raso, M.; Caputo, M.; Calace, V.; Barbato, E.; Galluccio, G.",Pesquisa Brasileira Em Odontopediatria E Clinica Integrada,610,20

Because particulate pollutants scatter, diffuse, and absorb incoming solar radiation, a net negative radiative forcing, decreased air pollution can yield surface warming. As such, this study (1) documents the evolution of China's January-February 2020 air temperature and concurrent particulate changes; (2) determines the temperature response related to reduced particulates during the COVID-19 quarantine (C19Q); and (3) discusses the conceptual implications for temperature-dependent disease transmission. C19Q particulate evolution is monitored using satellite analyses, and concurrent temperature anomalies are diagnosed using surface stations and Aqua AIRS imagery. Meanwhile, two WRF-Chem simulations are forced by normal emissions and the satellite-based urban aerosol changes, respectively. Urban aerosols decreased from 27.1% of pre-C19Q aerosols to only 17.5% during C19Q. WRF-Chem resolved ~0.2 °C warming across east-central China, that represented a minor, though statistically significant contribution to C19Q temperature anomalies. The largest area of warming is concentrated south of Chengdu and Wuhan where temperatures increased between +0.2-0.3 °C. The results of this study are important for understanding the anthropogenic forcing on regional meteorology. Epidemiologically, the marginal, yet persistent, warming during C19Q may retard temperature-dependent disease transmission, possibly including SARS-CoV-2.","Miller, P W; Reesman, C; Grossman, M K; Nelson, S A; Liu, V; Wang, P",Sci Total Environ,610,3

This study is the first detailed insight into the impact of frailty markers on patient outcomes and provides the infection rate among healthcare workers. METHODS: Data were obtained from medical records. Outcome measures were level of oxygen therapy, discharge and death. Patients were followed up until 21 April 2020. RESULTS: 108 patients were included. 34 (31%) died in hospital or were discharged for palliative care. 43% of patients aged over 65 died. The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (49; 45%) and diabetes (25; 23%). Patients who died were older (mean difference ±SEM, 13.76±3.12 years; p<0.0001) with a higher NEWS2 score (median 6, IQR 2.5-7.5 vs median 2, IQR 2-6) and worse renal function (median differences: urea 2.7 mmol/L, p<0.01; creatinine 4 µmol/L, p<0.05; eGFR 14 mL/min, p<0.05) on admission compared with survivors. Frailty markers were identified as risk factors for death. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was higher in patients over 65 who died than in survivors (median 5, IQR 4-6 vs 3.5, IQR 2-5; p<0.01). Troponin and creatine kinase levels were higher in patients who died than in those who recovered (p<0.0001). Lymphopenia was common (median 0.8, IQR 0.6-1.2; p<0.005). Every patient with heart failure died (8). 26 (24%) were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; median 3 days, IQR 2-7.3) and 9 (8%) were intubated (median 14 days, IQR 7-21). All patients who died after discharge (4; 6%) were care home residents. 276 of 699 hospital staff tested were positive for COVID-19.

Similarly, some environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) have been shown to be associated with transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but global data on their association with COVID-19 are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between climatic factors and COVID-19. METHODS: We used multilevel mixed-effects (two-level random-intercepts) negative binomial regression models to examine the association between 7- and 14-day-lagged temperature, humidity (relative and absolute), wind speed and UV index and COVID-19 cases, adjusting for Gross Domestic Products, Global Health Security Index, cloud cover (%), precipitation (mm), sea-level air-pressure (mb), and daytime length. The effects estimates are reported as adjusted rate ratio (aRR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Data from 206 countries/regions (until April 20, 2020) with &#8805;100 reported cases showed no association between COVID-19 cases and 7-day-lagged temperature, relative humidity, UV index, and wind speed, after adjusting for potential confounders, but a positive association with 14-day-lagged temperature and a negative association with 14-day-lagged wind speed. Compared to an absolute humidity of <5 g/m3, an absolute humidity of 5-10 g/m3 was associated with a 23% (95% CI: 6-42%) higher rate of COVID-19 cases, while absolute humidity >10 g/m3 did not have a significant effect. These findings were robust in the 14-day-lagged analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results of higher COVID-19 cases (through April 20) at absolute humidity of 5-10 g/m3 may be suggestive of a 'sweet point' for viral transmission, however only controlled laboratory experiments can decisively prove it.","Islam, Nazrul; Bukhari, Qasim; Jameel, Yusuf; Shabnam, Sharmin; Erzurumluoglu, A Mesut; Siddique, Muhammad A; Massaro, Joseph M; D039,; Agostino, Ralph B",Environ Res,610,24

This condition may affect multiple organs and systems, including the skin, and cutaneous manifestations are varied. Although several studies on COVID-19 have been conducted in Peru, to date, this type of manifestation has not been described in the Peruvian population, especially in environments with high prevalence of viral diseases that cause similar dermatological lesions, such as the Peruvian jungle. Case presentation: A 16-year-old male patient with no relevant medical history was admitted to a hospital in the Peruvian jungle due to headache, chills, general malaise, and respiratory distress. On physical examination, oxygen saturation was 89-90%, and a skin rash was observed; it was characterized by non-evanescent, confluent, pruritic, and symmetrical morbilliform lesions in the limbs, abdomen, thorax, and face, without mucous membrane involvement. Due to the shortage of molecular tests in the region where he was treated, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on serological (serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 (IgM+ and IgG+)) and radiological criteria (imaging findings compatible with COVID-19 atypical pneumonia). The initial treatment included the administration of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, dexamethasone, cetirizine, as well as the use of oxygen by binasal cannula. After 5 days and given the persistence of symptoms and respiratory and skin signs, treatment with ivermectin was started. 48 hours after the introduction of this treatment, the cutaneous and respiratory manifestations had completely resolved. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 may develop several cutaneous manifestations similar to those produced by other viruses or adverse drug reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately interview the patient and establish the chronological order of symptom onset to diagnose this disease correctly.","Echeverría, Ronald Rainer; Caceres, Onice Jimena; Quiñones-Laveriano, Dante Manuel; Sueyoshi, Jennifer Harumi",Rev.

Associations between mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their city and the magnitude of life expectancy disparity in their city are not moderated by the social or fiscal ideology of mayoral officials or the ideology of their constituents. Highly visible and publicized information about mortality disparities, such as that related to COVID-19 disparities, has potential to elevate elected officials' perceptions of the severity of health disparities and influence their opinions about the issue. CONTEXT: A substantive body of research has explored what factors influence elected officials' opinions about health issues. However, no studies have assessed the potential influence of the health of an elected official's constituents. We assessed whether the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity within a city was associated with the opinions of that city's mayoral official (i.e., mayor or deputy mayor) about health disparities in their city. METHODS: The independent variable was the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in US cities. The magnitude was determined by linking 2010-2015 estimates of life expectancy and median household income for 8,434 census tracts in 224 cities. The dependent variables were mayoral officials' opinions from a 2016 survey about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city (n = 224, response rate 30.3%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for characteristics of mayoral officials (e.g., ideology) and city characteristics. FINDINGS: In cities in the highest income-based life expectancy disparity quartile, 50.0% of mayoral officials ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 52.7% believed health disparities were ""very unfair."" In comparison, among mayoral officials in cities in the lowest disparity quartile 33.9% ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 22.2% believed the disparities were ""very unfair."" A 1-year-larger income-based life expectancy disparity in a city was associated with 25% higher odds that the city's mayoral official would ""strongly agree"" that health disparities existed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; P = .04) and twice the odds that the city's mayoral official would believe that such disparities were ""very unfair"" (OR = 2.24; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their jurisdictions are generally aligned with, and potentially influenced by, information about the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparities among their constituents.","Purtle, Jonathan; Joshi, Rennie; LÊ-Scherban, FÉlice; Henson, Rosie Mae; Diez Roux, Ana V",Milbank q,610,23

To investigate the results of LU in severe and critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed a single-institution study to evaluate the related lung lesions and variations, and prophylactic strategies, in a large referral and treatment center. METHODS: We included 91 adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19, namely 62 males and 29 females, with an average age of 59 ± 11 years, who underwent LU. We collected the following patient information: sex, age, days in hospital, and days in ICU. In the ultrasound examinations, we recorded the presence of discrete B lines, confluent B lines, consolidation, pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax (PTX). RESULTS: Among the 91 severe and critical patients, 59 cases had scattered B lines, 56 cases had confluent B lines, 58 cases had alveolar-interstitial syndrome (AIS), 48 cases had lung consolidation, six cases had pleural thickening, 39 cases had pleural effusion (average depth of the pleural effusion: 1.0 ± 1.5 cm), and 20 patients developed PTX. In the Cox multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in age, hospitalization days, ICU days, and lung consolidation. CONCLUSION: Lung ultrasonography performed at the bedside can detect lung diseases, such as B lines, PTX, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, pleural effusion, and variations of these findings. Our findings support the use of LU and measurements for estimating factors, and monitoring response to therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.","Li, Shuo; Qu, Ya-Li; Tu, Mu-Qin; Guo, Li-Yan; Zhang, Qi-Li; Lv, Chao-Yang; Guo, Rui-Jun",Echocardiography,610,20

Evidence from emerging and developed countries,16.70094,3.5800426,2020,"Objective: The aim of this article was to study the potential antivirus and fever reducing mechanisms of Xiaochaihu Decoction (XCHD) on novel coronavirus pneumonia based on network pharmacology and molecular docking method. Methods: Firstly, the potential targets and pathways of XCHD on fever were analyzed using network pharmacology. Compounds and potential targets in XCHD were screened using TCMSP and PharmMapper databases. The targets in fever reducing were identified from OMMI and Genecards databases. The protein-protein interaction network was established by String database to analyze key targets. The gene oncology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of key targets were also conducted to generate the relative pathways based on DAVID and KOBAS 3.0 databases, respectively. The compound-target-pathway network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. In addition, we used molecular docking method to identify the crucial compounds with higher connectivity on SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 has been identified as the key target of SARS-CoV-2 entering cells. The possible binding sites of compounds on SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 were predicted. Results: Network pharmacology analysis indicated that 165 active compounds and 168 relative targets were selected. A total of 7006 targets related to fever were identified. In addition, 141 potential targets of XCH on fever were identified. Totally, 292 GO terms of XCHD on fever and 30 pathways were identified using GO and KEGG analysis. Furthermore, molecular docking indicated that main active compounds in XCHD exhibited higher affinity with both SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 3’-hydroxy-4’-O-methylglabridin were top three candidates with highest affinity. Conclusion: In summary, our study identified the potential mechanisms of XCHD on fever. Besides, Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 3’-hydroxy-4’-O-methylglabridin could be the key compounds to exert anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Our prediction also provided the research fields to further study the mechanisms of XCH on SARS-CoV-2 infection in future.","Yang, Lu; Cui, Huan-Tian; Liu, Xiang-Guo; Wen, Wei-Bo; Wang, Hong-Wu",Chin.

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients are often in need for intensive chemotherapy to induce remission that will be complicated with prolonged period of cytopenias. They are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. These patients may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anti-cancer therapy. ALL patients are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors in the same patient is common. Cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such pandemic on ALL patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the optimal management of ALL patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, we will address the potential challenges associated with managing ALL patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic with suggestions of some practical approaches, focusing on screening asymptomatic ALL patients, diagnostic and response evaluation and choice of chemotherapy in different scenarios and setting and use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","Alhuraiji, Ahmad; Eldadah, Saleem; Alfraih, Feras; Pandita, Ramesh; Absi, Ahmad; Hanbali, Amr; Aljurf, Mahmoud; El Fakih, Riad",Gulf J Oncolog,610,26

There is large number of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 that are not reported. Hence, serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies is warranted for a better estimation of the actual number of infected patients to limit the disease spread and to get an idea of herd immunity. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood Diseases at Pakistan. The study includes healthcare workers (HCWs), community and industrial workers. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was performed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. RESULTS: A total of 1675 samples have been received from three groups of population. The percentage positivity for industrial employees is high (50.3%) for HCW (13.2%) and community population (34%).Total percentage for positive antibodies result is ~36%. CONCLUSION: Our seroprevalence is 36%, which still far from herd immunity that needs to be at least 60-70% in population. If we consider acquiring 60% seroprevalence in next few months, then herd immunity is not far from reality, provided the antibodies did not decline with time. Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, the findings suggest a study with larger population to implement stronger and targeted interventions.","Zaidi, Samreen; Rizwan, Faiza; Riaz, Quratulain; Siddiqui, Asma; Khawaja, Shabnam; Imam, Mehjabeen; Naz, Arshi; Waheed, Samra; Shamsi, Tahir",J. public health (Oxf),610,10

The sensitivity of these tests heavily depends on the viral load, extrapolated by the threshold cycle (Ct). It is therefore essential to verify their performance before their inclusion in routine. The Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette Bio-Rad, the GSD NovaGen SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Antigen Rapid Test and the Aegle Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette were evaluated on 199 samples: 150 fresh samples from the routine and positive in RT-qPCR, 9 fresh samples negative in RT-qPCR and 40 frozen samples, taken prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 but positive for other respiratory viruses. Positive RT-qPCR samples were categorized according to their Ct: Ct <20 (18.7%), &#8805;20-<25 (27.3%), &#8805;25-<30 (18.7%), &#8805;30-35 (17.3%), >35 (18.0%). Sensitivities (95% CI) for Ct below 25 were 95.7% (92.4-98.9), 97.1% (94.4-99.8) and 97.1% (94.4-99.8) for GSD NovaGen, Bio-Rad and Aegle respectively but drastically dropped when Ct exceeded 27. Among samples with previously diagnosed viruses, 7 false positive results were found with GSD NovaGen only (specificity 85.7%). Equivalent, high sensitivities were observed with the highest viral load samples. The GSD NovaGen assay showed less specificity.

This includes assessment of suicidal risk following self-harm at least monthly. Trainees in Bath and Gloucester are not meeting these requirements. We set up an emergency experience rota, with the aim of increasing trainees’ experience and confidence in assessment and management of emergency psychiatry.MethodAn emergency experience rota was implemented in Bath in September 2017. Trainees were surveyed before and after their 6 month rotations. In cycle 1, trainees spent two weeks with the Crisis team and an additional three days with the Liaison team per rotation. In cycle 2, we made some modifications to the rota so that it was more flexible. This system was then adopted in Gloucester where trainees were encountering similar difficulties. We hope to complete cycle 3 across the two localities by July 2021.ResultFrom the initial two cycles conducted in Bath, post-change surveys showed an increase in trainees’ confidence in assessments in acute settings and completing risk assessments in cases of self-harm and suicidal ideation. All of the trainees who took part would recommend the experience to other trainees (100% (7/7)). In Gloucestershire, only pre-change data have been collected so far. A full analysis of all the results will be presented.ConclusionThe introduction of working time regulations such as the European Working Time Directive (2003) as well as local service reconfigurations leading to nurse-led liaison services and home treatment teams, have reduced the opportunity for trainees to undertake emergency assessments. Across the Severn Deanery, there is a discrepancy in the opportunity core trainees’ have to undertake emergency assessments – depending on their rota, stage of training, and services available. This difference in trainee experience, depending on locality, has been further impacted by COVID-19 and the introduction of cohorted wards.Trainees in Bath and Gloucester are predominantly covering the wards during on-calls and, therefore, we set out to ensure that they are regularly rostered to obtain emergency experience, helping them meet their core training competences. Initial results from two cycles of an emergency / out-of-hours experience rota suggest increased experience and confidence in first-line emergency assessments, enabling them to work towards meeting their core training requirements.","Nutting, Tom Stuart Sally Hill Francesca",BJPsych Open,610,16

Animal models played vital roles in understanding the mechanism of human diseases. However, the use of these models has been a subject of heated debate, particularly due to ethical matters and the inevitable pathophysiological differences between animals and humans. Current in vitro models lack the sufficient functionality and predictivity of human pharmacokinetics and toxicity, therefore, are not capable to fully replace animal models. The recent development of micro-physiological systems has shown great potential as indispensable tools for recapitulating key physiological parameters of humans and providing in vitro methods for predicting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans.

Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for neonatal throat swab samples. The pathological changes of COVID-19 on the placenta is evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS: The most common symptoms of the pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were fever and cough, which is comparable to the nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 infection. Nobody was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment and there were no maternal and neonatal deaths. However, there was one case with induced abortions on first-trimester (due to pregnant woman's concerns about COVID-19), one diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, no intrauterine fetal deaths during the study period.

Demographic data, occupational or private exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and prior medical history consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected according to a preplanned analysis. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0% [398/3609; confidence interval (CI) 10.0%–12.1%]. Seroprevalence was higher in female inmates than in male inmates (12.5% vs. 9.2%, respectively, p = 0.002), with the highest rate observed among adults aged &gt;55 years (13.2%). A generalized estimating equations model showed that the main risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence were the following: an occupational exposure to the virus [Odd ratio (OR) = 2.36; 95% CI 1.59–3.50, p = 0.001], being a long-term care facility resident (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 3.19–6.45, p = 0.001), and reporting previous symptoms of influenza-like illness (OR = 4.86; 95% CI 3.75–6.30, p = 0.001) or loss of sense of smell or taste (OR = 41.00; 95% CI 18.94–88.71, p = 0.001). In conclusion, we found a high prevalence (11.0%) of SARS-CoV-2 infection that is significantly associated with residing in long-term care facilities or occupational exposure to the virus. These findings warrant further investigation into SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among the Italian population.","Vena, Antonio; Berruti, Marco; Adessi, Andrea; Blumetti, Pietro; Brignole, Michele; Colognato, Renato; Gaggioli, Germano; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Bracci-Laudiero, Luisa; Magnasco, Laura; Signori, Alessio; Taramasso, Lucia; Varelli, Marco; Vendola, Nicoletta; Ball, Lorenzo; Robba, Chiara; Battaglini, Denise; Brunetti, Iole; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",J.

However, the information available is not always suitable for all readers because of its difficult readability. We sought to assess the readability of online information regarding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and establish whether they follow the patient educational information reading level recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: We searched five key terms on Google and the first 30 results from each of the searches were considered for analysis. Five validated readability tests were utilized to establish the reading level for each article. RESULTS: Of the 150 gathered articles, 61 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. None (0%) of the articles met the recommended 5th to 6th grade reading level (of an 11-12-year-old). The mean readability scores were Flesch Reading Ease 44.14, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 12.04, Gunning-Fog Index 14.27, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook SMOG Index 10.71, and Coleman-Liau Index 12.69. CONCLUSIONS: Online educational articles on COVID-19 provide information too difficult to read for the general population. The readability of articles regarding COVID-19 and other diseases needs to improve so that the general population may understand health information better and may respond adequately to protect themselves and limit the spread of infection.","Szmuda, T; Özdemir, C; Ali, S; Singh, A; Syed, M T; Sloniewski, P",Public Health,610,26

The purpose of this study is to gauge the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck oncology and reconstructive surgery (HNORS) practice and evaluate their practice patterns especially ones that might be impacted by COVID-19 and compare them to the current literature. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS: We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an intensive care unit postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a small impact on the surgical treatment of patients with head and neck oncology. Most HNORS surgeons are practicing in accordance with recently published literature.","Zaid, Waleed; Schlieve, Thomas",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,610,24

As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. METHODS: In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. RESULTS: The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). CONCLUSIONS: Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community. Our analysis of early COVID-19 research may be valuable in informing research prioritisation and policy planning both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar global health crises.","Liu, Nan; Chee, Marcel Lucas; Niu, Chenglin; Pek, Pin Pin; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Ansah, John Pastor; Matchar, David Bruce; Lam, Sean Shao Wei; Abdullah, Hairil Rizal; Chan, Angelique; Malhotra, Rahul; Graves, Nicholas; Koh, Mariko Siyue; Yoon, Sungwon; Ho, Andrew Fu Wah; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock",BMC Med Res Methodol,610,20

The elderly population suffering from cardiovascular diseases is, therefore, to be considered a particularly vulnerable population. However, age cannot be considered the only discriminating factor because in the young-adult population suffering from severe forms of heart disease, the prognosis, if affected by COVID-19, is particularly ominous and these patients should have priority access to the vaccination program.

Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. Lay Summary: The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair. Therefore, it is important to explore the clinical trial in the world for treating the COVID-19 disease using MSCs and MSC-derived secretome.","Chouw, Angliana; Milanda, Tiana; Sartika, Cynthia Retna; Kirana, Marsya Nilam; Halim, Danny; Faried, Ahmad",Regen Eng Transl Med,610,22

In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$.

Avaliou-se a cinética da fase sólida com uso de silagem mordantada e o comportamento ingestivo de novilhas mantidas em confinamento, submetidas a dois planos alimentares. Utilizaram-se 12 novilhas, sendo seis da raça Nelore e seis da raça Guzerá e duas dietas: na primeira fase (restrita), a dieta foi formulada para manutenção do peso vivo, permitindo-se ganhos de 200 g/dia e na segunda fase (ad libitum), a dieta foi formulada para ganho de um quilograma/dia. O delineamento estatístico utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado. No período restrito os indicadores subestimaram o valor de consumo (P=0,0001), sendo menor valor foi obtido pelo TiO2. Os valores para produção fecal foram de 0,637; 0,578; 0,449 kg de MS, respectivamente para coleta total, NANOLIPE® e TiO2 (P=0,0001). A taxa de recuperação do indicador NANOLIPE® apresentou valor 93,37% e o TiO2 68,30% (P=0,0001) na fase restrita. Para a cinética da fase sólida tanto na fase restrita como na fase ad libitum não houve diferença entre raças quanto à cinética de partículas (P>0,05). O tempo de trânsito (TT) foi 10 horas após a ingestão da fibra marcada para ambas as raças. Os valores de digestibilidade da matéria seca das novilhas na fase restrita foi de 721,14 e 690,34 g/kg de MS, respectivamente para Guzerá e Nelore (P<0,05). O comportamento ingestivo na fase restrita, houve diferença apenas na eficiência de alimentação da matéria seca (EFAL da MS) (33,32 e 18,32 g/min, respectivamente para Guzerá e Nelore) e na eficiência de alimentação da fibra em detergente neutro corrigida para cinzas e proteína (EFAL da FDNcp) (13,89 e 7,64 g/min, respectivamente para Guzerá e Nelore) para as novilhas da raça Guzerá (P<0,05). Na fase ad libitum os valores para consumo foram de 8,38; 7,56; 7,50 kg de MS, respectivamente para TiO2, consumo real e NANOLIPE® (P<0,05). O valor de produção fecal estimada pelo TiO2 foi superior à da coleta total e o NANOLIPE® (P<0,05). Os valores de digestibilidade da MS foi de 674,01 e 673,23 g/kg de MS, respectivamente para Guzerá e Nelore (P>0,05). Os valores de TT foram 7,62 h e 6,69 h, respectivamente para as novilhas Nelore e Guzerá. O grupo Guzerá apresentou superioridade (P<0,05) em relação aos animais Nelore na EFAL da MS (49,48 e 26,44 g/min, respectivamente, para Guzerá e Nelore) e EFAL da FDNcp (18,65 e 9,97 g/min, respectivamente para Guzerá e Nelore). Conclui-se que o NANOLIPE® estimou melhor os valores de produção fecal e de consumo na fase ad libitum. O TiO2 superestimou o valor de consumo e de produção fecal na fase ad libitum. As variáveis estudadas para cinética de partículas foram similares nas raças Guzerá e Nelore.

It is a novel strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the 7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS). The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets, either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions. Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function. Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour. Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral economic damage. This review paper aims to synthesize the impact of the virus on a global, micro to macro scale.","Mallah, Saad I; Ghorab, Omar K; Al-Salmi, Sabrina; Abdellatif, Omar S; Tharmaratnam, Tharmegan; Iskandar, Mina Amin; Sefen, Jessica Atef Nassef; Sidhu, Pardeep; Atallah, Bassam; El-Lababidi, Rania; Al-Qahtani, Manaf",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,610,24

However, Covid-19 can serve as a test case of the expected response of the new healthcare system under Vision 2030. This study used data from the thirteen present administrative regions of KSA to simulate the variations in ICU admission as a quality indicator in the five business units proposed by a new Model of Care. METHODS: We determined the rates of ICU admission for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) from March to mid-July 2020. The final sample included 1743 inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Patient characteristics, including demographics, pre-existing chronic conditions, and COVID-19 complications, were collected. Business units (BUs) were compared with respect to the relative odds of ICU admission by using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: After keeping patient and clinical characteristics constant, clear BU differences were observed in the relative odds of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients. Inpatient admission to ICU in our total sample was almost 50%. Compared to the Central BU, the Northern and Western BUs showed significantly higher odds of ICU admission while the Eastern & Southern BUs had significantly lower odds. CONCLUSION: ICU use for COVID-19 patients differed significantly in KSA healthcare BUs, consistent with variations in care for other non-COVID-19-related conditions. These differences cannot be explained by patient or clinical characteristics, suggesting quality-of-care differences. We believe that privatization and the shift to fewer administrative BUs will help lessen or eliminate altogether the present variations in healthcare service provision.","Alharbi, Abdullah A; Alqassim, Ahmad Y; Gosadi, Ibrahim M; Aqeeli, Abdulwahab A; Muaddi, Mohammed A; Makeen, Anwar M; Alhazmi, Abdulaziz H; Alharbi, Ahmad A",J Infect Public Health,610,24

These questions were investigated using the mandatory reporting data in Frankfurt am Main and the extensive testing of contact persons (CP) in schools and daycare centers after the occurrence of an index case. Method: The reporting data were taken from SurvStat. The index cases from daycare centers and schools were isolated and the CPs were offered PCR testing for SARS-CoV­2 on a voluntary basis, regardless of whether symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV­2 had occurred or not. Deep nasal/pharyngeal swabs were collected by paramedics on behalf of the public health department of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and tested according to established standards at two accredited institutes. Results: From March to 31 December 2020, 22,715 COVID-19 cases were reported in Frankfurt, including 1588 (7.6%) SARS-CoV­2 detections in children 14 years and younger. Thus, approximately half as many SARS-CoV­2 detections were reported in children up to 14 years of age than would have corresponded to their proportion in the population. In autumn 2020, the increase in incidence in children over the weeks followed the increase in incidence in the general population, the age-related incidence of children remained below the incidence in the general population.From week 35 to week 52, index cases were reported from 143 daycare centers and 75 schools. As a result, 7915 CPs were tested. In daycare centers, SARS-CoV­2 was detected in 4.5% of adult CPs and 2.5% of child CPs and in schools SARS-CoV­2 was detected in 0.9% of adult CPs and 2.5% of student CPs tested. On average, less than 1 CP tested positive per index case. The rate of positive findings increased with increasing incidence in the overall population. No major outbreak occurred. Discussion: Regarding the level and timing of age-related incidences among children in Frankfurt am Main, there was no evidence that children were the drivers of the pandemic. Only a small percentage of the examined CPs in schools and daycare centers tested positive for SARS-CoV­2. In the absence of evidence of intense transmission in the facilities, CP attendance can/should continue under hygiene conditions and there is no need to close entire groups, classes, or even facilities.","Heudorf, Ursel; Steul, Katrin; Walczok, Antoni; Gottschalk, Rene",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,610,16

The goal of this work was to identify shortcomings in the conventional screening system (CSS) implemented in the beginning of the outbreak. To overcome these shortcomings, we then introduced a novel, independently developed system called the Yeungnam University type drive-through (YU-Thru), and distributed it nationwide in Korea. This system is similar to the drive-throughs utilized by fast food restaurants. YU-Thru system has shortened the time taken to test a single person to 2-4 minutes, by completely eliminating the time required to clean and ventilate the specimen collection room. This time requirement was a major drawback of the CSS. YU-Thru system also reduced the risk of subjects and medical staff infecting one another by using a separate and closed examination system. On average, 50 to 60 tests were conducted per day when using the CSS, while now up to 350 tests per day are conducted with the YU-Thru system. We believe that the YU-Thru system has made an important contribution to the rapid detection of COVID-19 in Daegu, South Korea. Here, we will describe the YU-Thru system in detail so that other countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks can take advantage of this system.","Seo, Wan Seok; Kim, Seong Ho; Song, Si Youn; Hur, Jian; Lee, Jun; Choi, Sunho; Lee, Yoojung; Bai, Dai Seg",,610,24

Although it is well known that attention can modulate neural responses in many brain areas, the computational principles underlying attentional modulation remain unclear. Contrary to the prevailing view of a high-dimensional, distributed neural representation, here we show a surprisingly simple, biased neural representation for feature-based attention in a large dataset including five human fMRI studies. We found that when human participants (both sexes) selected one feature from a compound stimulus, voxels in many cortical areas responded consistently higher to one attended feature over the other. This univariate bias was consistent across brain areas within individual subjects. Importantly, this univariate bias showed a progressively stronger magnitude along the cortical hierarchy. In frontoparietal areas, the bias was strongest and contributed largely to pattern-based decoding, whereas early visual areas lacked such a bias. These findings suggest a gradual transition from a more analog to a more abstract representation of attentional priority along the cortical hierarchy. Biased neural responses in high-level areas likely reflect a low-dimensional neural code that can facilitate a robust representation and simple readout of cognitive variables.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It is typically assumed that cognitive variables are represented by distributed population activities. Although this view is rooted in decades of work in the sensory system, it has not been rigorously tested at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Here we show a novel, low-dimensional coding scheme that dominated the representation of feature-based attention in frontoparietal areas. The simplicity of such a biased code may confer a robust representation of cognitive variables, such as attentional selection, working memory, and decision-making.","Gong, Mengyuan; Liu, Taosheng",J Neurosci,610,1

Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. One of these mAbs, BG10-19, locks the spike trimer in a closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the recently arising mutants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together, our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and therapeutic design against coronaviruses.","Scheid, Johannes F; Barnes, Christopher O; Eraslan, Basak; Hudak, Andrew; Keeffe, Jennifer R; Cosimi, Lisa A; Brown, Eric M; Muecksch, Frauke; Weisblum, Yiska; Zhang, Shuting; Delorey, Toni; Woolley, Ann E; Ghantous, Fadi; Park, Sung-Moo; Phillips, Devan; Tusi, Betsabeh; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Cohen, Alexander A; Gnanapragasam, Priyanthi N P; Rzasa, Kara; Hatziioanno, Theodora; Durney, Michael A; Gu, Xiebin; Tada, Takuya; Landau, Nathaniel R; West, Anthony P; Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit; Seaman, Michael S; Baden, Lindsey R; Graham, Daniel B; Deguine, Jacques; Bieniasz, Paul D; Regev, Aviv; Hung, Deborah; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Xavier, Ramnik J",Cell,610,16

While contemporary theories argue disgust is a genetic adaptation, there is surprisingly little evidence to support this claim. Here, we simulated 100 000 years of evolution in human hunter-gatherers to test a wide variety of theoretical models. Our results indicate that natural selection for monogenic or polygenic pathogen-avoidance traits is plausible. However, the cultural inter-generational transmission of such traits operated more quickly in realistic scenarios, and continued to work even when artificially constrained. In the absence of reliable empirical data, our computational work supports the hypothesis that cultural evolution outpaced its biological counterpart to select health-improving behaviours that benefited survival. This study serves not only as evidence of cultural evolution of the behavioural immune system, but is also an illustration of emerging theories that paint cognitive mechanisms as socially transmitted rather than biologically hardwired functions.","Dalmaijer, Edwin S.; Armstrong, Thomas",,610,24

PURPOSE: To examine the ethical challenges encountered by nurses caring for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and to provide nurses with suggestions and support regarding promotion of their mental health. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. The participants were 18 nurses who agreed to attend an interview and describe their own experiences of providing care to COVID-19 patients in China. They were purposively sampled, and structured, in-depth interviews were performed. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed from February to March 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University, China. FINDINGS: The findings revealed three main themes and 10 categories. The themes were the following: (1) ethical challenges (people with COVID-19, inequality, professional ethics, and job competency); (2) coping styles (active control and planning, seeking support as well as catharsis, and staying focused); and (3) impacts on career (specialized nursing skills, scientific research ability, and management skills). CONCLUSION: Nurses faced ethical challenges on multiple fronts in caring for COVID-19 patients. The results may help nurses with more safety, ethics, and humanistic care in nursing practice.","Jia, Yuxiu; Chen, Ou; Xiao, Zhiying; Xiao, Juan; Bian, Junping; Jia, Hongying",Nurs Ethics,610,23

SETTING: Aerosol and droplet quantification laboratory. DESIGN: Laboratory study. METHODS: In an experimental set-up, phacoemulsification was performed on enucleated goat eyes and cadaveric human corneoscleral rims mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were performed using titanium straight tips (2.2 mm and 2.8 mm in diameter). The main wound incisions were titrated equal to and larger than the sleeve size. High-speed shadowgraphy technique was used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. The visualization and quantification of size of the aerosols and droplets along with calculation of their spread were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: In longitudinal phacoemulsification using a peristaltic pump device with a straight tip, no aerosol generation was seen in a closed chamber. In larger wounds, there was a slow leak at the main wound. The atomization of balanced salt solution was observed only when the phacoemulsification tip was completely exposed next to the ocular surface. Under this condition, the nominal size of the droplet was approximately 50 µm, and the maximum calculated spread was 1.3 m. CONCLUSIONS: There was no visible aerosol generation during microincision or standard phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification is safe to perform in the COVID-19 era by taking adequate precautions against other modes of transmission.","Shetty, Naren; Kaweri, Luci; Khamar, Pooja; Balakrishnan, Nikhil; Rasheed, Abdur; Kabi, Prasenjit; Basu, Saptarshi; Shetty, Rohit; Nuijts, Rudy M M A; Sinha Roy, Abhijit",J Cataract Refract Surg,610,2

These impacts are likely to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. There are no methods for characterizing the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and differentiating this burden from that of the prepandemic era. Accurate illness detection methods are critical for facilitating pandemic-related treatment and preventing the worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify major themes and symptom clusters in the SMS text messages that patients send to therapists. We assessed patients who were seeking treatment for pandemic-related distress on Talkspace, which is a popular telemental health platform. METHODS: We used a machine learning algorithm to identify patients' pandemic-related concerns, based on their SMS text messages in a large, digital mental health service platform (ie, Talkspace). This platform uses natural language processing methods to analyze unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessment methods for analyzing depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Our results show a significant increase in the incidence of COVID-19-related intake anxiety symptoms (P<.001), but no significant differences in the incidence of intake depression symptoms (P=.79). During our transcript analyses, we identified terms that were related to 24 symptoms outside of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for Talkspace suggest that people who seek treatment during the pandemic experience more severe intake anxiety than they did before the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to monitor the symptoms that we identified in this study and the symptoms of anxiety and depression, to fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","Hull, Thomas D; Levine, Jacob; Bantilan, Niels; Desai, Angel N; Majumder, Maimuna S",JMIR Form Res,610,10

METHODS: A case of reinfection was observed in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak involving 3 patients and 2 health care workers. To distinguish reinfection from persistent infection and detect potential transmission clusters, whole genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs of all individuals including the reinfection case's first episode. IgA, IgM, and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in serum of all individuals, and viral infectiousness was measured in the swabs of the reinfection case. RESULTS: Reinfection was confirmed in a young, immunocompetent health care worker as viral genomes derived from the first and second episode belonged to different SARS-CoV-2 clades. The symptomatic reinfection occurred after an interval of 185 days, despite the development of an effective humoral immune response following symptomatic primary infection. The second episode, however, was milder and characterized by a fast rise in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Although contact tracing and virus culture remained inconclusive, the health care worker formed a transmission cluster with 3 patients and showed evidence of virus replication but not of neutralizing antibodies in her nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: If this case is representative of most Covid-19 patients, long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection might not be likely.","Selhorst, Philippe; Van Ierssel, Sabrina; Michiels, Jo; Mariën, Joachim; Bartholomeeusen, Koen; Dirinck, Eveline; Vandamme, Sarah; Jansens, Hilde; Ariën, Kevin K",Clin. infect. dis,610,30

COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with the number of infected cases increased to 54.4 million with 1.32 million deaths. Different types of statistical models have been developed to predict viral infection and multiple studies have compared the performance of these predictive models, but results were not consistent. This study aimed to develop and provide easy to use model to predict the Covid-19 infection severity in the patients and to help understanding the patient's condition. METHODS: This study analyzed simulated data obtained from the large database for 340 patients with an active Covid-19 infection. The study identified predictors of Covid-19 outcomes that may be measured in two different ways: the total T-cell levels in the blood with T-cell subsets and number of cells in the blood infected with virus. All measures are relatively unobtrusive as they only require a blood sample, however there is a significant laboratory cost implications for measuring the number of cells infected with virus. This study used methodological approach using two different methods showing how multiple regression and logistic regression can be used in the context of Covid-19 longitudinal data to develop the prediction models. RESULTS: This study has identified the predictors of Covid-19 infection outcomes and developed prediction models. In the regression model of Total_T Cell, the predictors BMI, comorbidity and Total_Tcell were all associated with increased levels of infection severity (p < 0.001). For BMI, the mean % of unhealthy cells increased by 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) and comorbidity predictor has on average 8.3% more unhealthy liver cells than without comorbidity (95% CI - 2.9%-1.29%). The results of multivariate logistic regression model predicting the Covid-19 Infection severity were promising. The significant predictors were observed such as Age (OR 0.95, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99), Helper T_cells (OR O.93, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.87-0.99), Basic_Tcell (OR 1.11, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71) and Comorbidity (OR 0.41, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.16-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study recommendation has been provided to clinical researchers on the best way to use the various Covid-19 infections measures along with identifying other possible predictors of Covid-19 infection. It is imperative to monitor closely the T-cell subsets using prediction models that might provide valuable information about the patient's condition during the treatment process.","Ansari, Rashid M; Baker, Peter",J Infect Public Health,610,25

Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional, and municipal. The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to a higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals, G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity. These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus and support continuing surveillance of Spike mutations to aid with development of immunological interventions.","Korber, Bette; Fischer, Will M; Gnanakaran, Sandrasegaram; Yoon, Hyejin; Theiler, James; Abfalterer, Werner; Hengartner, Nick; Giorgi, Elena E; Bhattacharya, Tanmoy; Foley, Brian; Hastie, Kathryn M; Parker, Matthew D; Partridge, David G; Evans, Cariad M; Freeman, Timothy M; de Silva, Thushan I; McDanal, Charlene; Perez, Lautaro G; Tang, Haili; Moon-Walker, Alex; Whelan, Sean P; LaBranche, Celia C; Saphire, Erica O; Montefiori, David C",Cell,610,24

The need is not only to integrate multiple data streams from different sources, scales, and cadences, but to also identify meaningful spatial patterns in these data, especially in vulnerable settings where even small numbers and low rates are important to pinpoint for early intervention. This paper identifies a gap in current analytical approaches and presents a near-real time assessment of emergent disease that can be used to guide a local intervention strategy: Geographic Monitoring for Early Disease Detection (GeoMEDD). Through integration of a spatial database and two types of clustering algorithms, GeoMEDD uses incoming test data to provide multiple spatial and temporal perspectives on an ever changing disease landscape by connecting cases using different spatial and temporal thresholds. GeoMEDD has proven effective in revealing these different types of clusters, as well as the influencers and accelerators that give insight as to why a cluster exists where it does, and why it evolves, leading to the saving of lives through more timely and geographically targeted intervention.","Curtis, Andrew; Ajayakumar, Jayakrishnan; Curtis, Jacqueline; Mihalik, Sarah; Purohit, Maulik; Scott, Zachary; Muisyo, James; Labadorf, James; Vijitakula, Sorapat; Yax, Justin; Goldberg, Daniel W",Sci Rep,610,16

One of the challenges is the scarcity of qualified instructors, and with COVID-19, another challenge is the difficulty with social distancing between learners and educators. The purpose of our study was to determine if ultrasound-naïve operators can learn ultrasound techniques and develop the psychomotor skills to acquire ultrasound images after reviewing SonoSim® online modules. METHODS: This was a prospective study evaluating first-year medical students. Medical students were asked to complete four SonoSim® online modules (aorta/IVC, cardiac, renal, and superficial). They were subsequently asked to perform ultrasound examinations on standardized patients utilizing the learned techniques/skills in the online modules. Emergency Ultrasound-trained physicians evaluated medical students' sonographic skills in image acquisition quality, image acquisition difficulty, and overall performance. Data are presented as means and percentages with standard deviation. All P values are based on 2-tailed tests of significance. RESULTS: Total of 44 medical students participated in the study. All (100%) students completed the hands-on skills evaluation with a median score of 83.7% (IQR 76.7-88.4%). Thirty-three medical students completed all the online modules and quizzes with median score of 87.5% (IQR 83.8-91.3%). There was a positive association between module quiz performance and the hands-on skills performance (R-squared = 0.45; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant association between module performance and hands-on performance for any of the four categories individually. In all four categories, the evaluators' observation of the medical students' difficulty obtaining views correlated with hands-on performance scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings suggest that ultrasound-naïve medical students can develop basic hands-on skills in image acquisition after reviewing online modules.","Situ-LaCasse, Elaine; Acuña, Josie; Huynh, Dang; Amini, Richard; Irving, Steven; Samsel, Kara; Patanwala, Asad E; Biffar, David E; Adhikari, Srikar",BMC Med Educ,610,16

This case described a patient who remained symptomatic several weeks after discharge from hospital with what was diagnosed as a COVID-19 infection. There were significant deficits shown in his functional exercise testing, his pulmonary functions testing and there was evidence of fibrotic changes on his radiology. METHODS: As part of a multidisciplinary clinic, he was started on steroids and a tailored pulmonary rehabilitation course over a course of 6-8 weeks. Thereafter, his exercise testing, pulmonary function tests and radiology were all repeated to see progress. RESULTS: On completing the course of corticosteroids and concurrent personalised pulmonary rehabilitation, there was a dramatic improvement in the patient's symptom severity, radiology and pulmonary function. The most significant improvement noted was in his exercise testing, namely a 6-min walk test and 1 min of sit-to-stands. Before treatment, he had a Medical Reserch Council (MRC) score of 2, and after it returned to his baseline of 0. DISCUSSION: Using corticosteroids and exercise training that allowed quantitative evaluation throughout the stages of recovery was a valuable tool to gauge progress and response to treatment. These therapies present opportunity to prevent the development of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis that could prove to be a major breakthrough in reducing long-term morbidity and improving the quality of life of those affected.","Fanshawe, Jack; Howell, Jack; Omar, Adhnan; Piper, Megan; Simpson, Thomas",Physiother Res Int,610,24

We present 1 critically ill patient who had a rapid therapeutic response to moderate-dose corticosteroids. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old critically ill woman from Wuhan suffered with COVID-19. DIAGNOSIS: The chest computed tomography scan was suggestive of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. The critically ill status was characterized by worsening dyspnea, progressing bilateral lung consolidation, and poor oxygenation (SiO2/FiO2:110âmm Hg). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with a moderate dose of intravenous corticosteroids and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. OUTCOMES: After the initiation of corticosteroids, the patient rapidly improved over the following 6 days. Serial chest computed tomography scans showed good absorption of the consolidations. The patient was discharged on Day 17 of hospitalization without obvious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of moderate-dose corticosteroids over a short period may enhance recovery from COVID-19 in critically ill patients.","Wang, Kaige; Tan, Fen; Zhou, Rui; Liu, Dan; Ni, Zhong; Liu, Jiasheng; Luo, Fengming",Medicine (Baltimore),610,16

The causative agent behind this disease is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the category of RNA viruses. The main protease, responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein is considered as one of the hot targets for treating COVID-19. Earlier reports suggest the use of HIV anti-viral drugs for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the year 2002-2003. Hence, drug repurposing approach may prove to be useful in targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The high-resolution crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used as the target. The Food and Drug Administration approved and SWEETLEAD database of drug molecules were screened. The apo form of the main protease was simulated for a cumulative of 150 ns and 10 µs open-source simulation data was used, to obtain conformations for ensemble docking. The representative structures for docking were selected using RMSD-based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis. This ensemble docking approach for the main protease helped in exploring the conformational variation in the drug-binding site of the main protease leading to the efficient binding of more relevant drug molecules. The drugs obtained as top hits from the ensemble docking possessed anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. This in silico ensemble docking approach would support the identification of potential candidates for repurposing against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A convolutional neural network classifier is first trained on 553 sequences from the National Genomics Data Center repository, separating the genome of different virus strains from the Coronavirus family with 98.73% accuracy. The network's behavior is then analyzed, to discover sequences used by the model to identify SARS-CoV-2, ultimately uncovering sequences exclusive to it. The discovered sequences are validated on samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data repositories, and are proven to be able to separate SARS-CoV-2 from different virus strains with near-perfect accuracy. Next, one of the sequences is selected to generate a primer set, and tested against other state-of-the-art primer sets, obtaining competitive results. Finally, the primer is synthesized and tested on patient samples (n = 6 previously tested positive), delivering a sensitivity similar to routine diagnostic methods, and 100% specificity. The proposed methodology has a substantial added value over existing methods, as it is able to both automatically identify promising primer sets for a virus from a limited amount of data, and deliver effective results in a minimal amount of time. Considering the possibility of future pandemics, these characteristics are invaluable to promptly create specific detection methods for diagnostics.","Lopez-Rincon, Alejandro; Tonda, Alberto; Mendoza-Maldonado, Lucero; Mulders, Daphne G J C; Molenkamp, Richard; Perez-Romero, Carmina A; Claassen, Eric; Garssen, Johan; Kraneveld, Aletta D",Sci Rep,610,24

We demonstrate that even under extreme conditions, SARS-CoV-2 virus is unable to replicate in these mosquitoes and therefore cannot be transmitted to people even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host.","Huang, Yan-Jang S; Vanlandingham, Dana L; Bilyeu, Ashley N; Sharp, Haelea M; Hettenbach, Susan M; Higgs, Stephen",Sci Rep,610,16

At the phylum level, an increase of Proteobacteria was detected in w-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. A decrease of Fusobacteria and Spirochetes has been found, with the latter decreased in i-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. Significant changes in gut microbial communities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different disease severity compared to CTRL have been identified.

Few major outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in China after major non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines have been deployed and implemented. However, sporadic outbreaks that had high possibility to be linked to cold chain products were reported in several cities of China.. What is added by this report? In July 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Dalian, China. The investigations of this outbreak strongly suggested that the infection source was from COVID-19 virus-contaminated packaging of frozen seafood during inbound unloading personnel contact. What are the implications for public health practice? Virus contaminated paper surfaces could maintain infectivity for at least 17–24 days at -25 ℃. Exposure to COVID-19 virus-contaminated surfaces is a potential route for introducing the virus to a susceptible population. Countries with no domestic transmission of COVID-19 should consider introducing prevention strategies for both inbound travellers and imported goods. Several measures to prevent the introduction of the virus via cold-chain goods can be implemented.","Huilai, Ma Jianqun Zhang Ji Wang Ying Qin Cao Chen Yang Song Liang Wang Jun Meng Lingling Mao Fengqin Li Ning Li Jian Cai Yong Zhang Dayan Wang Yunting Xia Hong Wang Shaofeng Jiang Xiang Zhao Peihua Niu Wenjie Tan Tao Ma Yecheng Yao Naiying Mao Zhen Zhu Tianjiao Ji Qian Yang Baoying Huang Li Zhao Jianxing Yu Li Bai Shuangli Zhu Dongyan Wang Yan Zhang Yingwei Sun Mingchun Luan Yanhai Wang Haibo Sun Shihong Yang Zhijian Bo Xiang Ren Zhongjie Li George Fu Gao Wei Yao Wenqing Yao Zijian Feng Wenbo Xu",China CDC Weekly,610,18

People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-Î³ (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.","Sun, Dan; Li, Hui; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Xiao, Han; Ren, Jie; Zhang, Fu-Rong; Liu, Zhi-Sheng",World J Pediatr,610,1

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among patients admitted to the William Harvey Hospital in England between March 10th and May10th, 2020 with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, duration of diabetes, control of diabetes, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. RESULTS: There were 232 COVID-19 presentations. Mean (standard deviation (SD), range) age was 70.5 (±15.7, 30-101) years, 62.5% were male, and 37.5% were having diabetes. There were 43.4% males and 27.6 females, p = 0.016, with diabetes admitted to our hospital due to COVID-19.

Guanylurea often accumulates and is poorly, if at all, biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants. This study describes Pseudomonas mendocina strain GU, isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, using guanylurea as its sole nitrogen source. The genome was sequenced with 36-fold coverage and mined to identify guanylurea degradation genes. The gene encoding the enzyme initiating guanylurea metabolism was expressed, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Guanylurea hydrolase, a newly described enzyme, was shown to transform guanylurea to one equivalent (each) of ammonia and guanidine. Guanidine also supports growth as a sole nitrogen source. Cell yields from growth on limiting concentrations of guanylurea revealed that metabolism releases all four nitrogen atoms. Genes encoding complete metabolic transformation were identified bioinformatically, defining the pathway as follows: guanylurea to guanidine to carboxyguanidine to allophanate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The first enzyme, guanylurea hydrolase, is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase protein family, which includes biuret hydrolase and triuret hydrolase. Although homologs, the three enzymes show distinct substrate specificities. Pairwise sequence comparisons and the use of sequence similarity networks allowed fine structure discrimination between the three homologous enzymes and provided insights into the evolutionary origins of guanylurea hydrolase.IMPORTANCE Metformin is a pharmaceutical most prescribed for type 2 diabetes and is now being examined for potential benefits to COVID-19 patients. People taking the drug pass it largely unchanged, and it subsequently enters wastewater treatment plants. Metformin has been known to be metabolized to guanylurea. The levels of guanylurea often exceed that of metformin, leading to the former being considered a ""dead-end"" metabolite. Metformin and guanylurea are water pollutants of emerging concern, as they persist to reach nontarget aquatic life and humans, the latter if it remains in treated water. The present study has identified a Pseudomonas mendocina strain that completely degrades guanylurea. The genome was sequenced, and the genes involved in guanylurea metabolism were identified in three widely separated genomic regions. This knowledge advances the idea that guanylurea is not a dead-end product and will allow for bioinformatic identification of the relevant genes in wastewater treatment plant microbiomes and other environments subjected to metagenomic sequencing.","Tassoulas, Lambros J; Robinson, Ashley; Martinez-Vaz, Betsy; Aukema, Kelly G; Wackett, Lawrence P",,610,26

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.","Shah, Neha; Raheem, Ali; Sideris, Michail; Velauthar, Luxmi; Saeed, Ferha",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,610,21

However, there is an absence of knowledge on the effect of long-term operation under these conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the operational conditions of an anaerobic reactor treating food waste after long-term operation without temperature control and low-intensity mixing. For this, a demonstration-scale reactor (18.8 m3) was operated for 160 days, while stability parameters were used to control the applied organic loading rate (OLR). Stability parameters indicated that the reactor was operated at stable conditions with an OLR of 0.3â kg VS m-3 d-1, while it was overloaded at an OLR of 0.4â kg VS m-3 d-1. This was observed through high value of intermediate and partial alkalinity ratio (IA/PA ratio), 2.5, and low values of bicarbonate alkalinity and pH, 1,800â mg CaCO3 L-1 and 6.8, respectively. Moreover, there was a change in the concentration of intermediated metabolites, with a higher content of propionate and acetate, 1,080 and 3,775â mg L-1, respectively. Consequently, the methane production rate was decreased from 0.12 to 0.08â m³ CH4 m-3 d-1 and methane yield from 0.43 to 0.15â m³ CH4 kg VS-1. The reactor instability at a relatively low OLR was most probably due to hydrodynamic factors caused by the accumulation of recalcitrant material. Therefore, this material reduced the reactor performance and requires attention for a sustainable long-term operation.","Ferreira, Tiago B; Passos, Fabiana; de Souza, Cláudio L",Environ Technol,610,16

Despite that, clinical information regarding the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 infection remains limited. In this case series, we provide a novel insight into the physiotherapy management in patients infected with COVID-19 in Singapore. The main findings are: (1) Respiratory physiotherapy interventions were not indicated in the majority of the patients with COVID-19 in this case series; (2) During rehabilitation, exertional or position-related desaturation is a common feature observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection locally. This clinical phenomenon of exertional or positional-related desaturation has significantly slowed down the progression of rehabilitation in our patients. As such, it can potentially result in a significant burden on healthcare resources to provide rehabilitation to these patients. Based on these findings, we have highlighted several recommendations for the provision of rehabilitation in patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.","Lee, Audrey Jia Yi; Chung, Chloe Lau Ha; Young, Barnaby Edward; Ling, Li Min; Ho, Benjamin Choon Heng; Puah, Ser Hon; Iqbal, Saboor Rahman; Tan, Geak Poh",Physiotherapy,610,24

Decisions on decommissioning alternatives will benefit from quantifying and understanding the marine communities associated with these structures. As a case study, fish assemblages associated with an inshore network of subsea pipelines located on the North West shelf of Western Australia were compared to those in surrounding natural reef and soft sediment habitats using remotely operated vehicles fitted with a stereo-video system (stereo-ROVs). The number of species, the abundance, biomass, feeding guild composition and the economic value of fishes were compared among habitats. The community composition of fish associated with pipelines was distinct from those associated with natural habitats, and was characterised by a greater abundance and/or biomass of fish from higher trophic levels (e.g. piscivores, generalist carnivores and invertivores), including many species considered to be of value to commercial and recreational fishers. Biomass of fish on pipelines was, on average, 20 times greater than soft sediments, and was similar to natural reefs. However, the biomass of species considered important to fisheries recorded on the pipelines was, on average 3.5 times greater than reef and 44.5 times greater than soft sediment habitats. This study demonstrates that fish assemblages on the pipeline infrastructure exhibit high ecological and socioeconomic values.","Schramm, Karl D; Marnane, Michael J; Elsdon, Travis S; Jones, Christopher M; Saunders, Benjamin J; Newman, Stephen J; Harvey, Euan S",Sci Rep,610,16

Currently, commercial methods for SWE rely on directional filtering based on the prior knowledge of the wave propagation direction, to remove complicated wave patterns formed due to reflection and refraction. The result is a set of decomposed directional waves that are separately analyzed to construct shear modulus fields that are then combined through compounding. Instead, PWE relies on a rigorous representation of the wave propagation using the frequency-domain scalar wave equation to automatically select appropriate propagation directions and simultaneously reconstruct shear modulus fields. Specifically, assuming a homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, linear-elastic medium, we represent the solution of the wave equation using a linear combination of plane waves propagating in arbitrary directions. Given this closed-form solution, we formulate the SWE problem as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem which can be solved very efficiently. Through numerous phantom studies, we show that PWE can handle complicated waveforms without prior filtering and is competitive with state-of-the-art that requires prior filtering based on the knowledge of propagation directions.","Khodayi-Mehr, Reza; Urban, Matthew W; Zavlanos, Michael M; Aquino, Wilkins",Phys. med. biol,610,16

With the new ordinances of the Ministry of Education and Health, all courses can use remote methodologies for the continuity on the current school year. With new challenges and paradigms emerging from this methodological proposal: provide for the user the feeling of immersion, of being in the class room, from the navigation and interaction in this virtual environment, at the same time that the educator, respecting the educational principles and the pedagogical approach that he believes, does not transform this moment into a simple distance educationOBJECTIVE: To describe the state of the art on nursing education and the challenges of using remote technologies in the time of Corona virus pandemicMETHODS: This is a reflective study based on secondary sources of literature relevant to the theme, considering articles from national and international journals and recent productions on education, health training, remote technologies, COVId-19 and public healthRESULTS: It is evident that experiencing the effects of the corona virus pandemic (COVID-19) in the health educational sector, especially in the field of nursing, goes beyond a structural reorganization of courses. It implies change attitude of managers, teachers and students to reformulate educational practices (sometimes with traditional tools), with innovative practices preserving a methodology that provides to the student criticality reflection, dialogue, bonding and interaction; elements that are part of a training aimed at transformation, empowerment and not just the transmission of knowledge. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic caused paradigm shifts perhaps not yet overcome by health science institutions , because when they perceived themselves within a reality that generated changes in the political, economic, cultural and social aspects at a global level, they had to reinvent and insert new ways of teaching in their work process; they had to discuss different educational approaches and, given the needs to readjust health teaching methods, they inserted remote technologies as essential tools to meet the real need for continuity of classes in non-face-to-face model. For many, it is a challenge, as it currently permeates a reflection on the attention of distance learning in the field of nursing and other courses in the health area. However, as it opened up to discussions about new ways of teaching mediated by innovation, it can be said that this will be one of the greatest impact of the pandemic in benefit the education: the contribution of new information and communication technologies in the teaching-learning process for training in health, as well as the reflection on distance education and its concepts, differentiating it from the concepts of remote methodology and the use of technologiesCONCLUSION: In nursing education, the discussion related to the use of remote technologies in the classroom has always been a point of debate. However, with the need to include these tools for the continuity of classes in the non-face-to-face model resulting from the social isolation strategy motivated by the pandemic of COVID-19, it can provide an opportunity to have a new look on the subject and perhaps there is an opportunity to expand the debate on the use of remote methodologies in health education, seeking a reflection on their interaction with the other teaching methods already implemented","Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro",Rev. bras. crescimento desenvolv. hum,610,13

These major changes also involved the activity of the Emergency Radiology Department (ERD). This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging studies, both in terms of the amount, frequency and subspecialty of different imaging modalities requested to the ERD of the Maggiore della Carità Hospital in Novara (Italy). METHODS: To this end, our observational study took into account the imaging studies requested by the emergency department during three-time spans. These were defined as phase 0 (pre-pandemic), phase 1 (pandemic peak with complete lockdown) and phase 2 (post-pandemic peak with partial lifting of restrictive measures), as derived from Italian urgent decrees by the President of the Council of Ministers (DPCM) which established the duration and entity of the lockdown measures throughout the pandemic. The dataset was processed and then compared with Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: During the pandemic peak, our data showed a significant drop in the total number of studies requested and a significant rise in computed tomography (CT) studies. In particular, a statistically significant increase in chest CT studies was found, probably due to the high sensitivity of this imaging method in identifying pulmonary involvement during respiratory tract infection of possible viral etiology (SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, we observed a statistically significant decrease of X-ray (XR) and ultrasound (US) studies during phase 1 compared to phase 0 and phase 2 probably due to a reduction in the numbers of ER visits for minor traumas given the mobility restrictions and people hesitancy in visiting the ER due to fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the activity of the ERD was heavily impacted by the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Further studies will be needed to estimate the impact of the pandemic on public health in terms of excess mortality related to delayed diagnosis and care of non-COVID diseases.","Garlisi, C; Licandro, D; Siani, A; Rodolfi, S; Pansini, S; Garcia Navarro, L I; Carriero, A; Avanzi, G C; Castello, L M",Emerg. radiol,610,4

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors related to weight gain during lockdown in patients with a sleeve gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 48 obese subjects with previous bariatric surgery was enrolled. After a 7-week confinement, a telephone interview was conducted. In this phone call, self-reported body weight gain and different factors were recorded. In order to obtain the basal and pre-surgical data, biochemical and anthropometric parameters were recorded from electronic medical record. RESULTS: The mean age was 45.3±8.0 years (range: 23-61) and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.5±7.5 kg/m2 (range: 28.6-34.2). Gender distribution was 38 females (79.2%) and 10 males (20.8%). The increase in self-reported body weight was 3.8±2.1 kg during the 7 weeks of confinement. And the self-reported body weight gain was lower in subjects with regular exercise (4.6±0.9 vs 1.1±0.3 kg; p=0.02). The number of face-to-face visits to the nutrition office that did not attend was 0.61±0.81 (range: 0-4) per patient. In the multiple regression analysis with self-reported body weight gain as a dependent variable, the physical activity (minutes/week) remained as a protective factor with a beta coefficient of -0.09 (95% CI: -0.001 to 0.016; p=0.03) and number of face-to-face appointments in the nutrition consultation missed as a risk factor with a beta coefficient of 9.65 (95% CI: 1.17-18.12; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in self-reported body weight is associated with a decrease in physical activity and the loss of face-to-face visits to the Nutrition Unit.","de Luis, Daniel; Izaola, Olatz; Primo, David; Gómez, Emilia; Torres, Beatriz; Gómez, Juan José López; Pacheco, David",Obes. surg,610,29

OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a literature review on placental changes in infected pregnant women and/or asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 during pregnancy, aiming at the possible vertical transmission. METHODOLOGY: A systematic collection was carried out on the effects of that COVID-19 can cause directly and/or indirectly to pregnancy and the placenta in the following databases: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs and Web of Science. For search, the following descriptors were used: placenta, pregnant woman, COVID-19, maternal-fetal. RESULTS: The results indicate transplacental transmission in some cases reviewed in many reports from this study. The presence of the virus was seen in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and peripheral blood. Finally, pathological studies suggest that there are morphological changes related to infection in the placentas. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that, based on the researched material, there is little evidence of transplacental vertical viral transmission and its respective morphological changes related to viral infection in the placenta.","Costa, Marcos Aurélio Santos; Albuquerque Britto, Diana Babini Lapa; Silva, Maria Eduarda; Carvalho, Jennyfer Martins; Oliveira, Maria Luísa Figueira; Silva Gomes, José Anderson; Tenorio, Fernanda das Chagas Angelo Mendes; Leite, Sônia Pereira",Biol. reprod,610,24

Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the presence of myocardial injury in unselected patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective observational cohort study, 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness were identified from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry between April and June 2020. Exposure: Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained. Comparisons were made with age-matched and sex-matched control groups of healthy volunteers (n = 50) and risk factor-matched patients (n = 57). Results: Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (greater than 3 pg/mL) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (greater than 13.9 pg/mL) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), or pericardial enhancement (n = 22). There was a small but significant difference between patients who recovered at home vs in the hospital for native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1119 [1092-1150] ms vs 1141 [1121-1175] ms; P = .008) and hsTnT (4.2 [3.0-5.9] pg/dL vs 6.3 [3.4-7.9] pg/dL; P = .002) but not for native T2 mapping. None of these measures were correlated with time from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P = .47; native T2: r = 0.14; P = .15; hsTnT: r = -0.07; P = .50). High-sensitivity troponin T was significantly correlated with native T1 mapping (r = 0.33; P < .001) and native T2 mapping (r = 0.18; P = .01). Endomyocardial biopsy in patients with severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1 and T2 were the measures with the best discriminatory ability to detect COVID-19-related myocardial pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis. These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19.","Puntmann, Valentina O; Carerj, M Ludovica; Wieters, Imke; Fahim, Masia; Arendt, Christophe; Hoffmann, Jedrzej; Shchendrygina, Anastasia; Escher, Felicitas; Vasa-Nicotera, Mariuca; Zeiher, Andreas M; Vehreschild, Maria; Nagel, Eike",JAMA Cardiol,610,10

To minimize the transmission of COVID-19, family visit in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was suspended in China. In order to maintain the benefits of FCC, the Hong Kong University-Shenzhen Hospital NICU modified FCC strategies. We evaluated the effects of new strategies and aimed to share our results and experience with other NICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using prospectively collected hospital databases, we retrospectively compared the demographic and clinical data of neonates, rates of breastfeeding at discharge, nosocomial infection and parental satisfaction one month before (open group) and after (closed group) the implementation of alternative FCC management strategies when family visit was suspended during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized a multidisciplinary task force and adopted strategies of triage and screening, management of suspected infants, and breastfeeding promotion with effective communication. The nosocomial infection rate and parental satisfaction for open and closed groups (144 and 108 term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, respectively) were not different (1% vs. 0%, p = 1.00; 98.6 vs. 98.8, p = .80; respectively). Breastfeeding rate at discharge decreased but the difference was not significant (74% vs. 80%, p = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, in term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, the alternative FCC strategies maintained high parental satisfaction without increased nosocomial infection rate, but strong support for breastfeeding was needed. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the continuation of ""modified"" FCC in a level III NICU is feasible in the context of COVID-19 pandemic with reduced family visitation and participation in the care.","Yi, Yan-Zhi; Su, Ting; Jia, Yi-Zhen; Xue, Yin; Chen, Yu-Zhi; Zhang, Qian-Shen; Chow, Chun-Bong; Lee, Winnie Gun-Ping; Cheung, Po-Yin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,610,20

At the outset of these dual public health emergencies, the BC government announced interim Risk Mitigation Guidance (RMG) that permitted prescribing medication alternatives to substances, including opioids, alcohol, stimulants and benzodiazepines, an intervention sometimes referred to as 'safe supply'. This protocol outlines the approach for a study of the implementation of RMG and its impacts on COVID-19 infection, drug-related and systemic harms, continuity of care for people with substance use disorder (SUD), as well as their behavioural, psychosocial and well-being outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We conducted a parallel mixed-method study that involved both analysis of population-level administrative health data and primary data collection, including a 10-week longitudinal observational study (target n=200), a cross-sectional survey (target n=200) and qualitative interviews (target n=60). We implemented a participatory approach to this evaluation, partnering with people with lived or living expertise of drug use, and researchers and public health decision-makers across the province. Linked population-level administrative databases will analyse data from a cohort of BC residents with an indication of SUD between 1996 and 2020. We will execute high-dimensional propensity score matching and marginal structural modelling to construct a control group and to assess the impact of RMG dispensation receipt on a collaboratively determined set of primary and secondary outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study activities were developed to adhere to the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, recommended COVID-19 research practices, and guided by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action for public health, data governance and research ethics related to Indigenous people. Results will be disseminated incrementally, on an ongoing basis, through the consortium established for this study, then published in peer-reviewed journals.","Nosyk, Bohdan; Slaunwhite, Amanda; Urbanoski, Karen; Hongdilokkul, Natt; Palis, Heather; Lock, Kurt; Min, Jeong E; Zhao, Bin; Card, Kiffer G; Barker, Brittany; Meilleur, Louise; Burmeister, Charlene; Thomson, Erica; Beck-McGreevy, Phoenix; Pauly, Bernie",BMJ Open,610,1

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to guide clinical decision-making and future research. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Scopus databases from 1 December 2019 to 10 January 2021 for observational studies or randomised clinical trials examining ECMO in adults with COVID-19 ARDS. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression, assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Survival outcomes were presented as pooled proportions while continuous outcomes were presented as pooled means, both with corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs]. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy and mechanical ventilation, weaning rate from ECMO and complications during ECMO. RESULTS: We included twenty-two observational studies with 1896 patients in the meta-analysis. Venovenous ECMO was the predominant mode used (98.6%). The pooled in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (22 studies, 1896 patients) supported with ECMO was 37.1% (95% CI 32.3-42.0%, high certainty). Pooled mortality in the venovenous ECMO group was 35.7% (95% CI 30.7-40.7%, high certainty). Meta-regression found that age and ECMO duration were associated with increased mortality. Duration of ECMO support (18 studies, 1844 patients) was 15.1 days (95% CI 13.4-18.7). Weaning from ECMO (17 studies, 1412 patients) was accomplished in 67.6% (95% CI 50.5-82.7%) of patients. There were a total of 1583 ECMO complications reported (18 studies, 1721 patients) and renal complications were the most common. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients received venovenous ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS. In-hospital mortality in patients receiving ECMO support for COVID-19 was 37.1% during the first year of the pandemic, similar to those with non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Increasing age was a risk factor for death. Venovenous ECMO appears to be an effective intervention in selected patients with COVID-19-related ARDS.

Aunque el tema de la evaluación, por sí misma, ya es complejo, esta complejidad aumenta cuando media la tecnología digital. Lejos de pensar que se trata de una acción técnica, la evaluación digital y la digitalización de la evaluación, como lo demuestra el contenido de este monográfico, no se reducen a la inserción de sistemas tecnológicos, sino a la comprensión pedagógica de su rol e impacto en los procesos educativos. Los trabajos que conforman este monográfico buscan contribuir, desde el análisis empírico y la reflexión pedagógica, a la construcción de una irremediable línea de trabajo que se pregunta: ¿cómo transforma, y transformamos, la condición digital, procesos tan sensibles como la evaluación del aprendizaje mediado y la evaluación de los sistemas educativos digitales? Al respecto, en este número se avanza en la respuesta en torno a cuatro núcleos. Por un lado, trabajos que ponen énfasis en la nueva exigencia digital impuesta a la evaluación en tiempos de pandemia, el papel renovado del feedback educativo en la necesaria autorregulación con soporte tecnológico, la necesidad de encarar con garantías la evaluación digital como condición de rendimiento y, como mecanismo observante, la evaluación de la calidad de la educación digital.

On its own, assessment is a complex subject, but add digital technology and this complexity increases tenfold. Far from a mechanical action, the assessment of online learning and the digitalization of this process involve more than just the incorporation of technological systems;as this special issue will show, they are concepts whose role in and impact on teaching must be understood at a pedagogical level. Based on empirical analysis and pedagogical reflection, the papers in this special issue seek to construct an irrefutably important line of work that poses the question, how does the digital environment transform sensitive processes such as ICT-mediated learning assessment and the assessment of online learning systems, and how do we in turn transform it? The issue tackles this question from four different angles: by highlighting the new digital demands placed on assessment in times of pandemic;the renewed role of educational feedback in the ICT-based self-regulated learning required;the need to move towards e-assessment as a guarantee of performance, and the evaluation of the quality of online learning as a watchdog mechanism. As the special issue on learning assessment shows, the topic is full of challenges, but that is the nature of the beast, so to speak, and how one must approach all things digital.","Barberà-Gregori, Elena Suárez-Guerrero Cristóbal",Revista Iberoamericana de Educación a Distancia,610,1

The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and maximize public health benefits derivable from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing applications and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of Pubmed, Medbase, and grey literature was performed to identify available contact tracing applications. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the applications' compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal to estimate whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing applications were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequent feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only one app provided a threshold for population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing applications with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. What mostly lacked were information about personal data breach and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by COVIDSafe and worst by Alipay Health Code. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing applications with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for more data collection. Overall, the review shows that a consistent number of applications appears to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from the public health perspective can still be maximized.","Kolasa, Katarzyna; Mazzi, Francesca; Leszczuk-Czubkowska, Ewa; Zrubka, Zsombor; Péntek, Márta",,610,24

In this study, we developed an assay using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) coupled with multivariate analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 in an ultra-fast manner without any pretreatment (e.g., RNA extraction). Using silver-nanorod SERS array functionalized with cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), we obtained strong SERS signals of ACE2 at 1032, 1051, 1089, 1189, 1447 and 1527 cm-1. The recognition and binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on SERS assay significantly quenched the spectral intensities of most peaks and exhibited a shift from 1189 to 1182 cm-1. On-site tests on 23 water samples with a portable Raman spectrometer proved its accuracy and easy-operation for spot detection of SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate disinfection performance, explore viral survival in environmental media, assess viral decay in wastewater treatment plant and track SARS-CoV-2 in pipe network. Our findings raise a state-of-the-art spectroscopic tool to screen and interrogate viruses with RBD for human cell entry, proving its feasibility and potential as an ultra-fast detection tool for wastewater-based epidemiology.","Zhang, Dayi; Zhang, Xiaoling; Ma, Rui; Deng, Songqiang; Wang, Xinzi; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Xian; Huang, Xia; Liu, Yi; Li, Guanghe; Qu, Jiuhui; Zhu, Yu; Li, Junyi",Water Res,610,16

METHODS: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 26 June 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io application programming interface. The repository of the data sets used to collect and analyse the data are available at https://osf.io/k2r57/. RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared with 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p < 0.005) and T2DM (p < 0.005) trials over the same period, respectively. During the pre-study period, the proportion of principal investigators who were predicted to be women were 49.7% (245/493) and 44.4% (148/333) for breast cancer and T2DM trials, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant when compared with results from the study period (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that less than one-third of COVID-19-related clinical trials are led by women, half the proportion observed in non-COVID-19 trials over the same period, which remained similar to the pre-study period. These gender disparities during the pandemic may not only indicate a lack of female leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.","Cevik, Muge; Haque, Syed Arefinul; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer; Kuppalli, Krutika; Sax, Paul E; Majumder, Maimuna S; Orkin, Chloe",Clin Microbiol Infect,610,24

It is of extreme importance to develop an efficient statistical model of COVID-19 spread, which could help in the global fight against the virus. We propose a clustering-segmented autoregressive sigmoid (CSAS) model to explore the space-time pattern of the log-transformed infectious count. Four key characteristics are included in this CSAS model, including unknown clusters, change points, stretched S-curves, and autoregressive terms, in order to understand how this outbreak is spreading in time and in space, to understand how the spread is affected by epidemic control strategies, and to apply the model to updated data from an extended period of time. We propose a nonparametric graph-based clustering method for discovering dissimilarity of the curve time series in space, which is justified with theoretical support to demonstrate how the model works under mild and easily verified conditions. We propose a very strict purity score that penalizes overestimation of clusters. Simulations show that our nonparametric graph-based clustering method is faster and more accurate than the parametric clustering method regardless of the size of data sets. We provide a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify multiple change points and calculate a confidence interval for a mean response. By applying the CSAS model to the collected data, we can explain the differences between prevention and control policies in China and selected countries.","Shi, Xiaoping; Chen, Meiqian; Dong, Yucheng",,610,33

Exploratory studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection on the plasma metabolome have been performed, often with small numbers of patients, and with or without relevant control data;however, determining the impact of biological and clinical variables remains critical to understanding potential markers of disease severity and progression. The present large study, including relevant controls, sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n = 831), testing positive (n = 543) or negative (n = 288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on 831 plasma samples from acutely ill patients while in the emergency department, at admission, and during hospitalization. We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding ~ 78% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.","D039,; Alessandro, A.; Akpan, I.; Thomas, T.; Reisz, J.; Cendali, F.; Gamboni, F.; Nemkov, T.; Thangaraju, K.; Katneni, U.; Tanaka, K.; Kahn, S.; Wei, A.; Valk, J.; Hudson, K.; Roh, D.; Moriconi, C.; Zimring, J.; Hod, E.; Spitalnik, S.; Buehler, P.; Francis, R.",Research Square,610,22

Methods The clinical data of severe and critical COVID-19 patients treated in General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA from Jan. 2020 to Mar. 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into non-myocardial injury group and myocardial injury group. The baseline data, clinical characteristics, auxiliary examination, treatment and prognosis were compared between the two groups, and the risk factors of myocardial injury and the effect on the prognosis of the severe and critical COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results A total of 56 patients were included, with 22 in the non-myocardial injury group and 34 in the myocardial injury group. Patients were mostly male in both groups, and there was no significant difference in gender composition between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the non-myocardial injury group, the age of onset was significantly higher in the myocardial injury group (78.5[ 70.8, 89.0] years vs 56.5[ 50.3, 68.3] years, P&lt;0.01), and the proportions of patients over 65 years old and combined with coronary heart disease were significantly greater (85.3%[ 29/34] vs 31.8%[ 7/22] and 38.2% [13/34] vs 9.1%[ 2/22], both P&lt;0.05). In terms of symptoms, fever (87.5%, 49/56), cough (64.3%, 36/56) and fatigue (46.4%, 26/56) were the most common ones, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). For the CT findings of the lungs, the proportion of patients having patch-like/plaque-like shadows and ground-glass opacities was significantly greater in the non-myocardial injury group versus the myocardial injury group (72.7%[ 16/22] vs 38.2%[ 13/34], χ2=6.364, P&lt;0.05), and other signs were not significantly different between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the non-myocardial injury group, the levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, procalcitonin and IL-6 were significantly higher in the myocardial injury group (4 939.5[ 1 817.0, 9 450.3] pg/mL vs 612.5[ 301.0, 1 029.5] pg/mL, 4 386.5 [2 309.5, 9 635.3] ng/mL vs 850.5 [343.5, 2 333.8] ng/mL, 0.46 [0.23, 3.79] ng/mL vs 0.18 [0.13, 0.39] ng/mL, and 138.6 [41.9, 464.8] pg/mL vs 65.1[ 34.7, 99.3] pg/mL, respectively), and the differences were significant (all P&lt;0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age≥65 years old (odds ratio[ OR] =18.62, 95% confidence interval[ CI] 1.61-215.96, P&lt;0.05) and D-dimer level≥3 000 ng/mL (OR=15.48, 95% CI 1.45-164.77, P&lt;0.05) were the independent risk factors for myocardial injury in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. There were no significant differences in the use of antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, or glucocorticoids between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the myocardial injury than that in the non-myocardial injury group (58.8% [20/34] vs 9.1% [2/22], P&lt;0.01). Patients who received tracheal intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other invasive life support measures were all in the myocardial injury group. Conclusion Older age, male gender, coronary heart disease and (or) cardiac insufficiency, and elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin and IL-6 are the risk factors of myocardial injury in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury can aggravate the condition and some patients need invasive circulating breathing support, with poor prognosis and high mortality. Therefore, the above indicators need to be observed more closely and dynamically and active treatment should be given according to related factors.","Qing, Lu; Jiu-Long, Wang; Bo, Zhang; Zhi-Gang, Li; De-Na, Kong; Shi-Qiang, Xiong; Shi-Fang, Ding",Acad.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods: Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results: Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusion: Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.","Zaorsky, Nicholas G; Yu, James B; McBride, Sean M; Dess, Robert T; Jackson, William C; Mahal, Brandon A; Chen, Ronald; Choudhury, Ananya; Henry, Ann; Syndikus, Isabel; Mitin, Timur; Tree, Alison; Kishan, Amar U; Spratt, Daniel E",,610,16

Healthcare workers play a crucial role in the case management of COVID-19 in many institutions. Globally, the disease burden is increasing, and the mortality has reached over 2 041 426 compared with 323 000 in May 2020. In West Africa, the pandemic has shown a slow but steady rise in many countries. Existing protocols and their utilization are best assessed after the occurrence of the index case. General aim. The study assessed the health worker's response to COVID-19 protocols at three designated areas of the in-hospital management care triaging, holding area, and treatment centers. Method. A qualitative design was used to assess the response of healthcare workers with regards to early case detection, infection prevention, risk communication to clients and compliance to protocols. The study conducted observational visits and purposively selected healthcare workers comprising of clinicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and laboratory technicians who perform routine duties at the triaging, holding, and treatment centers. A total of 41 observations were made over two weeks. Results. Participants comprised 23 males and 18 females. At all observed units, the case definition was being used to screen attendants presenting, and appropriate categorization of patients was ensured. The use of temperature in screening for COVID-19 at the units was generally adhered to. Only 50% of participants used the prescribed PPEs. The physical distancing between healthcare workers and client and between clients and caregivers were not enforced; however, hand hygiene was practiced. Disinfection of working surfaces and equipment with 0.5% chlorine or 70% alcohol-based rubs were used most of the time. It was observed however that no psychological counselling was given to suspected cases or their relatives. Conclusion. Healthcare workers showed discordant response to different parts of the protocols for COVID-19 especially appropriate distancing. There was an enhanced awareness among healthcare workers and improvement in infection prevention protocols. The study also observed that as the risk of infection increased from triaging to holding area and to treatment centers, the response of healthcare workers to COVID-19 protocols also improved. Risk communication is an essential part of the COVID-19 management strategy. At the treatment centers, healthcare workers adhered to this protocol, whereas it was a major gap at the triaging and holding areas.","Afeng-Nkansah, D; Asumanu, E; Nyinaku, P; Acheampong, F; Lamptey, R",Biomed Res Int,610,10

Transfusions early during disease course was found to be beneficial. Lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could inform early responses to future pandemics and may continue to be relevant in lower resource settings. We sought to identify factors correlating to high antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors and understand the magnitude and pharmacokinetic time course of both transfused antibody titers and the endogenous antibody titers in transfused recipients. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected up to 174 days after convalescence from 93 CCP donors with mild disease, and from 16 COVID-19 patients before and after transfusion. Using ELISA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, S1, and N-protein antibodies, as well as capacity of antibodies to block ACE2 from binding to RBD was measured in an in vitro assay. As an estimate for viral load, viral RNA and N-protein plasma levels were assessed in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking capacity were highest within the first 60 days after symptom resolution and markedly decreased after 120 days. Highest antibody titers were found in CCP donors that experienced fever. Effect of transfused CCP was detectable in COVID-19 patients who received high-titer CCP and had not seroconverted at the time of transfusion. Decrease in viral RNA was seen in two of these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high titer CCP should be collected within 60 days after recovery from donors with past fever. The much lower titers conferred by transfused antibodies compared to endogenous production in the patient underscore the importance of providing CCP prior to endogenous seroconversion.","Wirz, Oliver F.; Röltgen, Katharina; Stevens, Bryan A.; Pandey, Suchitra; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Tolentino, Lorna; Verghese, Michelle; Nguyen, Khoa; Hunter, Molly; Snow, Theo Thomas; Singh, Abhay Raj; Blish, Catherine A.; Cochran, Jennifer R.; Zehnder, James L.; Nadeau, Kari C.; Pinsky, Benjamin A.; Pham, Tho D.; Boyd, Scott D.",Front Immunol,610,2

The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","Wathes, D.

The purpose of this article is to report our experience for rescheduling nonemergent imaging and procedures during the pandemic at our tertiary, academic institution. METHODS We rescheduled the nonemergent imaging and procedures in our hospitals and outpatient centers from March 16 to May 4, 2020. We created a tiered priority system to reschedule patients for whom imaging could be delayed with minimal clinical impact. The radiologists performed detailed chart reviews for decision making. We conducted daily virtual huddles with discussion of rescheduling strategies and issue tracking. RESULTS Using a snapshot during the rescheduling period, there was a 53.4% decrease in imaging volume during the period of March 16 to April 15, 2020, compared with same time period in 2019. The total number of imaging studies decreased from 38,369 in 2019 to 17,891 in 2020 during this period.

Sixty-one pathogenic E. coli strains and Salmonella spp. (n = 24) strains isolated from fecal samples of calves and Salmonella spp. (n = 39) strains previously isolated from fecal samples of growing/finishing pigs were tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the agar dilution method was determined for nalidixic acid, amikacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefoxitin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to amikacin. Tetracycline was the antimicrobial that presented the higher frequency of resistance among E. coli strains, followed by ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and cefoxitin. E. coli (n = 61) strains isolated from calves belonged to different phylogroup namely, phylogroup A (n = 26), phylogroup B1 (n = 31), phylogroup E (n = 3), and phylogroup F (n = 1). Phylogroups B2, C, and D were not identified among the E. coli in the present study. All Salmonella spp. (n = 24) strains isolated from fecal samples of calves were susceptible to amikacin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, norfloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to nalidixic acid and cefoxitin was detected in 16.66 and 8.33 % of the Salmonella spp. strains, respectively. Among the Salmonella spp. (n = 39) strains isolated from fecal samples of pigs, the higher frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline, followed by amoxicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, cefoxitin, and norfloxacin. All strains were susceptible to amikacin. Forty-eight (78.68 %) of the E. coli strains were classified as multidrug-resistant, whereas among Salmonella spp. strains, the percentage of multidrug resistance was 57.14 %, being all multidrug-resistant strains isolated from pigs (92.30 %). The results from the present study indicate a high frequency of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from calves and Salmonella spp. strains isolated from pigs and a high rate of susceptibility to most antimicrobials tested among Salmonella spp. strains isolated from calves.

Our study underlines the role that family physicians have in the education and information of citizens. A small, but considerable, number of respondents (108, 7.84% of those with children) had not vaccinated their children according to the national vaccination scheme. Deterrents were considered to be lack of information and fear of side effects. However, 167 of our respondents (12.12% out of 1377 respondents with children) said that their child experienced adverse events—most of which were mild local reactions. Alternatives to vaccination were proposed by some.

The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. RESULTS: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6 ± 3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation. After 3-months of follow-up, the number of repetitions during STST significantly increased either in telerehabilitation (n = 14) (p < 0.001) or in control groups (n = 13) (p = 0.002) but only one patient had a result higher than the 50th percentile (in Telerehabilitation group) and 37% of them were still under the 2.5th percentile for this result. The improvement was significantly and clinically greater after the telerehabilitation program (p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported by the patients during the program. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a low functional exercise capacity at discharge and the recovery after three months is poor.

Despite their key roles, little attention has been given to the SOCS family as compared to other feedback regulators. To date, SOCS proteins have been found to be exploited by viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola virus, influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV, just to name a few. The hijacking and subsequent upregulation of the SOCS proteins upon viral infection, suppress the associated JAK-STAT signalling activities, thereby reducing the host antiviral response and promoting viral replication. Two SOCS protein family members, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are well-studied and their roles in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway are defined as attenuating interferon (IFN) signalling upon viral infection. The upregulation of SOCS protein by SARS-CoV during the early stages of infection implies strong similarity with SARS-CoV-2, given their closely related genomic organisation. Thus, this review aims to outline the plausibility of SOCS protein inhibitors as a potential therapeutic regimen for COVID-19 patients. We also discuss the antagonists against SOCS protein to offer an overview on the previous 'successes' of SOCS protein inhibition in various viral infections that may portray possible clues for COVID-19 disease management.","Low, Zheng Yao; Wen Yip, Ashley Jia; Chow, Vincent T K; Lal, Sunil K",Rev Med Virol,610,16

The fact that the Ebola virus subtypes, which have caused human disease episodes, have been different from one another makes it clear that a common source human-to-human transmission chain extending across sub-Saharan Africa is not the case and rather, virus subtypes lodged at or near each site of the recent human disease episodes have been responsible. Filovirus virions are enveloped and pleomorphic, appearing filamentous or bacilliform, U-shaped, 6-shaped, or circular. Particles have a uniform diameter of 80 nm, but vary greatly in length. The degree of the stability of filovirus sequences overall and the absence of genetic variability among Ebola virus isolates obtained within an outbreak match the character of other member viruses of the order, Mononegavirales. In rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, African green monkeys, and baboons inoculated with Marburg virus or the Zaire subtype of Ebola virus, the incubation period is 4–6 days, during which time virus replicates to high titer in the reticuloendothelial system, endothelium, liver, and lungs. It is found that with the onset of clinical disease, there is severe necrosis of these target organs, which is most evident in the liver and there is an interstitial hemorrhage, which is most evident in the gastrointestinal tract.","Murphy, Frederick A.; Peters, C.

The pandemic, which has killed over four million people worldwide, is putting unprecedented pressure on governments to maintain essential health and social services, as well as keep their economies running, even as the virus threatens people's daily life on every level. Thus, the purpose of this study is to discuss the short-term economic impacts of the pandemic by assessing its costs using official economic data for both the world and Turkey. Furthermore, this research highlights possible economic, social, and political pathways for a post-pandemic new world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a review article that overviews and tracks the economic development of the Covid-19 Pandemic from the start, synthesizes and compares current data of reliable institutions, and provides an overall assessment. RESULTS: The pandemic has certainly caused long-term damage to economies and living standards for many people. Although there are estimates of what this damage is, the exact degree of the damage is still unknown. However, it seems that the recovery will be gradual, long-lasting, and unpredictable due to the unprecedented uncertainty characteristic of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Early economic growth projections show that there will be no ordinary recovery for the world economy since countries' recovery paths are different. It is likely to remain uneven and dependent on the effectiveness of the vaccination process, fiscal policy support, public health management, and hard-hit sectors' growth size in economies. Due to the uncertainty and lack of confidence, governments should ensure an equal and sustainable economic recovery from the Covid-19 Pandemic by conducting flexible monetary and fiscal policies. However, without structural reforms, economies can not boost either in the short-term and long-term.","Açikgöz, Ömer; Günay, Asli",Turkish journal of medical sciences,610,24

A substantial proportion of all human populations studied to date have MBL deficiency due to MBL2 polymorphisms, which potentially increases susceptibility to infectious disease. MBL binds numerous respiratory pathogens but the capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae abrogates its efficient binding. Clinical studies in humans have shown that MBL deficiency appears to predispose to severe respiratory tract infection. A recent meta-analysis shows that MBL deficiency was associated with death in patients with pneumococcal infection after adjusting for bacteraemia and comorbidities. Human clinical studies have also shown associations between MBL deficiency and various less common respiratory infections. Intracellular infections like tuberculosis may be less common with MBL deficiency because of reduced opsonophagocytosis. Lung secretions contain small amounts of MBL that are potentially sufficient to activate complement, but their measurement is confounded by dilution inherent in collection techniques. Therefore, if this protein does play a role in pulmonary immunity it is presumably through prevention of haematogenous dissemination of respiratory pathogens while adding to mucosal defences. Ficolins are collectins that are structurally and functionally related to MBL and are either present in serum or expressed in tissues including the lung. Limited variation in serum levels of L- and H-ficolin result from the presence of FCN2 and FCN3 polymorphisms. Initial studies on the impact of FCN2 polymorphisms or low L-ficolin levels do not seem to show major associations with respiratory infection. MBL is being developed as a new immunotherapeutic agent for prevention of infection in immunocompromised hosts. The available literature suggests that it may also be of benefit in MBL deficient patients with severe pneumonia. This review concentrates on clinical associations between MBL deficiency and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection.","Eisen, Damon P.",J Innate Immun,610,20

Wheat breeding with a high level of zinc in wheat grain is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to address zinc def iciency in the diet. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the contribution of the factors ‘location’ and ‘genotype’ in the variability of zinc content in wheat grain, and to identify the best varieties as sources of this trait for breeding. The research on screening zinc content in the wheat grain of 49 spring bread wheat varieties from the Kazakhstan- Siberia Spring Wheat Trial (KASIB) nursery was carried out at 4 sites in Russia (Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Tyumen, Novosibirsk) and 2 sites in Kazakhstan (Karabalyk and Shortandy) in 2017–2018. The content of zinc in wheat grain was evaluated at the Ionomic Facility of University of Nottingham in the framework of the EU project European Plant Phenotyping Network-2020. The analysis of variance showed that the main contribution into the general phenotypic variation of the studied trait, 38.7 %, was made by the factor ‘location’ due to different contents of zinc and moisture in the soil of trial sites; the effect of the factor ‘year’ was 13.5 %, and the effect of the factor ‘genotype’ was 8.0 %. The most favorable environmental conditions for accumulation of zinc in wheat grain were observed in the Omsk region. In Omsk, the average zinc content in all studied varieties was 50.4 mg/kg, with 63.7 mg/ kg in the best variety ‘OmGAU 100’. These values are higher than the target values of the international program Harvest Plus. ‘Novosibirskaya 16’ (49.4 mg/kg), ‘Silach’ (48.4 mg/kg), ‘Line 4-10-16’ (47.2 mg/ kg), ‘Element 22’ (46.3 mg/kg) and ‘Lutescens 248/01’ (46.0 mg/kg) were identif ied as being the best varieties.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted, with a sample size of 523 paediatric patients, diagnosed with an URTI during the period of June 2003 to 22 June 2005. The study was conducted at five Primary Health Care Facilities in North Trinidad. RESULTS: The three most frequent URTIs diagnosed were non-specific URTI, common cold, and acute tonsillitis in rank order. Four patterns of prescribing were identified, (1) no drug therapy [1.9%]; (2) antibiotic therapy alone [6.1%]; (3) antibiotic and symptomatic therapy [53.0%]; and (4) symptomatic therapy alone [39.0%]. The, most frequently prescribed antibiotics were penicillins (amoxicillin [46.3%] and amoxicillin/clavulanate [5.3%]) and a macrolide (erythromycin [6.1%]). The three symptomatic agents most frequently prescribed were paracetamol [40.1%]; diphenhydramine [29.1%]; and normal saline nasal drops [14.2%]. In 112 cases with swab analyses done, of these, 98.2% revealed a growth of commensals only, while 1.8% grew pathogenic micro-organisms. Of the cases showing commensal growth only, 84.6% were treated with an antibiotic, 14.5% were treated with symptomatic agents alone and 0.9% received no drug therapy at all. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of paediatric patients diagnosed with an URTI in North Trinidad was prescribed antibiotics although not indicated The inappropriate use of antibiotics can potentiate the worldwide trend of antimicrobial resistance.","Mungrue, Kameel; Brown, Tessa; Hayes, Ivory; Ramroop, Savatri; Thurston, Portio; Pereira, Lexley PINTO",Pharm Pract (Granada),610,9

The epidemic was rapidly controlled. Analyzing the impact of an epidemic only makes sense if it is compared with a zone with a similar health care system. OBJECTIVE: To compare epidemic evolution in New-Caledonia and Paris suburb. METHODS: Health care organization is similar in New-Caledonia and Seine-Saint-Denis, based on an Emergency Medical System call center. We recorded the numbers of patients managed by SAMU (Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente)-Emergency Medical System, transferred to the emergency department and managed in prehospital setting by mobile intensive care unit. We compared these parameters during the reference (February 1-23, 2020) and the COVID-19 (February 24, 2020, to April 19, 2020) periods. Primary end-point: number of days over the 95th percentile of the reference period. RESULTS: Number of patients managed was over the 95th percentile during 27 and 47 days in New-Caledonia and Seine-Saint-Denis, respectively. Number of emergency department transfers was more than the 95th percentile during 4 and 31 days, respectively.

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes in noncritically ill patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS: In this open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and who were not critically ill (which was defined as an absence of critical care–level organ support at enrollment) to receive pragmatically defined regimens of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The primary outcome was organ support–free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of −1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. This outcome was evaluated with the use of a Bayesian statistical model for all patients and according to the baseline d-dimer level. RESULTS: The trial was stopped when prespecified criteria for the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were met. Among 2219 patients in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased organ support–free days as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 98.6% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% credible interval, 1.03 to 1.58). The adjusted absolute between-group difference in survival until hospital discharge without organ support favoring therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.0 percentage points (95% credible interval, 0.5 to 7.2). The final probability of the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation over usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 97.3% in the high d-dimer cohort, 92.9% in the low d-dimer cohort, and 97.3% in the unknown d-dimer cohort. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% of the patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 0.9% of those receiving thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: In noncritically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis.

The early polymerase synthesized a single RNA species of viral genomic size and negative sense. In contrast, the light peak of the late polymerase synthesized genomic-sized RNA of positive sense, while the heavy peak of the activity synthesized positive-sensed genomic and subgenomic mRNAs. These findings suggest that the light peak of the late polymerase represents a replication complex while the heavy peak represents a transcription complex.

This study aims to evaluate the association between first-line antihypertensive drug class and medication adherence in a large Chinese population. METHODS: All patients prescribed ≥ one antihypertensive drug in 2001–2003 and 2005 who have paid at least two consecutive clinic visits in the public healthcare system of Hong Kong were included. We excluded patients who have followed-up in the clinics for ≤ 30 days. Interval-based Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) was used to assess medication adherence. All patients were followed-up for up to 5 years. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with optimal adherence, defined as PDC ≥ 80%. RESULTS: From 147,914 eligible patients, 69.2% were adherent to the antihypertensive prescriptions. When compared with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), patients initially prescribed α-blockers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.234, 95% C.I. 0.215–0.256), β-blockers (AOR = 0.447, 95% C.I. 0.420, 0.477), thiazide diuretics (AOR = 0.431 95% C.I. 0.399, 0.466) and calcium channel blockers (AOR = 0.451, 95% C.I. 0.423, 0.481) were significantly less likely to be drug adherers. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and fixed-dose combination therapies were similarly likely to be medication adherent. Older age, male gender, visits in general out-patient clinics, residence in urbanized regions, and the presence of comorbidity were positively associated with optimal drug adherence.

Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participants’ level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing.

We assessed COVID-19 knowledge and associated factors among dental academics in 26 countries. METHODS: We invited dental academics to participate in a cross-sectional, multi-country, online survey from March to April 2020. The survey collected data on knowledge of COVID-19 regarding the mode of transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, protection, and dental treatment precautions as well as participants’ background variables. Multilevel linear models were used to assess the association between dental academics’ knowledge of COVID-19 and individual level (personal and professional) and country-level (number of COVID-19 cases/ million population) factors accounting for random variation among countries. RESULTS: Two thousand forty-five academics participated in the survey (response rate 14.3%, with 54.7% female and 67% younger than 46 years of age). The mean (SD) knowledge percent score was 73.2 (11.2) %, and the score of knowledge of symptoms was significantly lower than the score of knowledge of diagnostic methods (53.1 and 85.4%, P < 0.0001). Knowledge score was significantly higher among those living with a partner/spouse than among those living alone (regression coefficient (B) = 0.48); higher among those with PhD degrees than among those with Bachelor of Dental Science degrees (B = 0.48); higher among those seeing 21 to 30 patients daily than among those seeing no patients (B = 0.65); and higher among those from countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases/million population (B = 0.0007).

Moreover, African bats also carry other potentially zoonotic agents such as Henipah‐like viruses, coronaviruses and lyssaviruses. Today only little information is available on interactions between humans and bats. The objective of our exploratory study was to describe the extent and modes of contacts between humans and bats in southern Cameroon, considered as an area at risk for future EBV outbreaks. The survey was conducted in 11 villages of four distinct rural areas in southern Cameroon. A total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi‐structured questionnaires, between February and May 2017. The study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common. Bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource; 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three, and 28% of respondents hunt them. About 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats. Indirect contact also appeared to be common; 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats. Bat consumption varied significantly between regions (from 0% to 87%) and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme south‐east of Cameroon. The study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees, most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self‐hunted bushmeat.

More recently, in 2019, a disease caused by a new coronavirus appeared in China, in the province of Wuhan, with a characteristic of greater infectivity, called COVID-19, which has caused a new world pandemic. Considering the need to contain the advance in the number of cases, based on the high rate of transmissibility, several countries have adopted extreme social distancing measures, including the so-called ‘lockdown’. Despite the socioeconomic side effects, the aforementioned measure reduced the progression of the pandemic in countries that adopted it. In Brazil, the state of Ceará was one of the first epicenters of the disease in the country and the state capital city of Fortaleza, on May 8, implemented the lockdown measure to contain the increase in the number of cases. It was then observed, in a tertiary hospital, which is a referral for COVID-19 cases, a decrease in the daily occupancy rate of beds reserved for the pandemic after the lockdown onset, evidencing that this measure leads to a sustainable reduction in bed occupation rates, thus preventing the collapse and overload in health services.","Lino, Danielli Oliveira da Costa; Barreto, Renato; Souza, Francisco Daniel de; Lima, Carlos José Mota Mota de; Junior, Geraldo Bezerra da Silva",Braz J Infect Dis,610,27

Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place. However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes. Methods: Fourteen out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARS-CoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days. Results: Out of 1,299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least one of two testings. None of the teachers but one child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2% (95% CI 0.0–1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7 (0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in a new buccal sample taken 2 h to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. Thirty-five percent of children and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing. Conclusion: In a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.

OBJECTIVE This narrative review evaluates the utility of HFNC in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ED setting. DISCUSSION HFNC provides warm (37 °C), humidified (100% relative humidity) oxygen at high flows with a reliable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). HFNC can improve oxygenation, reduce airway resistance, provide humidified flow that can flush anatomical dead space, and provide a low amount of positive end expiratory pressure. Recent literature has demonstrated efficacy in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), interstitial lung disease, immunocompromised states, the peri-intubation state, and palliative care, with reduced need for intubation, length of stay, and mortality in some of these conditions. Individual patient factors play an important role in infection control risks with respect to the use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19. Appropriate personal protective equipment, adherence to hand hygiene, surgical mask placement over the HFNC device, and environmental controls promoting adequate room ventilation are the foundation for protecting healthcare personnel. Frequent reassessment of the patient placed on HFNC is necessary; those with severe end organ dysfunction, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, significantly increased respiratory rate, poor oxygenation despite HFNC, and tachycardia are at increased risk of HFNC failure and need for further intervention. CONCLUSIONS HFNC demonstrates promise in several conditions requiring respiratory support. Further randomized trials are needed in the ED setting.","Long, Brit; Liang, Stephen Y; Lentz, Skyler",The American journal of emergency medicine,610,20

The only current FDA-approved treatment, which directly targets the virus, is the ProTide prodrug remdesivir. In its activated form, remdesivir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Like other ProTide prodrugs, remdesivir contains a chiral phosphorus center. The initial selection of the (S(P))-diastereomer for remdesivir was reportedly due to the difficulty in producing the pure (R(P))-diastereomer of the required precursor. However, the two currently known enzymes responsible for the initial activation step of remdesivir are each stereoselective and show differential tissue distribution. Given the ability of the COVID-19 virus to infect a wide array of tissue types, inclusion of the (R(P))-diastereomer may be of clinical significance. To help overcome the challenge of obtaining the pure (R(P))-diastereomer of remdesivir, we have developed a novel chemoenzymatic strategy that utilizes a stereoselective variant of the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta to enable the facile isolation of the pure (R(P))-diastereomer of the chiral precursor for the chemical synthesis of the (R(P))-diastereomer of remdesivir.","Bigley, Andrew N.; Narindoshvili, Tamari; Raushel, Frank M.",Biochemistry,610,1

Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are crucial to the practice of dentistry; it is imperative to understand the inherent risks of viral dispersion associated with AGPs and the efficacy of available mitigation strategies. In a dental surgery setting, crown preparation and root canal access procedures were performed with an air turbine or high-speed contra-angle handpiece (HSCAH), with mitigation via rubber dam or high-volume aspiration and a no-mitigation control. A phantom head was used with a 1.5-mL min-1 flow of artificial saliva infected with &#934;6-bacteriophage (a surrogate virus for SARS-CoV-2) at ~108 plaque-forming units mL-1, reflecting the upper limits of reported salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels. Bioaerosol dispersal was measured using agar settle plates lawned with the &#934;6-bacteriophage host, Pseudomonas syringae. Viral air concentrations were assessed using MicroBio MB2 air sampling and particle quantities using Kanomax 3889 GEO&#945; counters. Compared to an air turbine, the HSCAH reduced settled bioaerosols by 99.72%, 100.00%, and 100.00% for no mitigation, aspiration, and rubber dam, respectively. Bacteriophage concentrations in the air were reduced by 99.98%, 100.00%, and 100.00% with the same mitigations. Use of the HSCAH with high-volume aspiration resulted in no detectable bacteriophage, both on nonsplatter settle plates and in air samples taken 6 to 10 min postprocedure. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the aerosolization in a dental clinic of active virus as a marker for risk determination. While this model represents a worst-case scenario for possible SARS-CoV-2 dispersal, these data showed that the use of HSCAHs can vastly reduce the risk of viral aerosolization and therefore remove the need for clinic fallow time. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the use of particle analysis alone cannot provide sufficient insight to understand bioaerosol infection risk.","Vernon, J J; Black, E V I; Dennis, T; Devine, D A; Fletcher, L; Wood, D J; Nattress, B R",J Dent Res,610,16

METHODS: The study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, temporal distribution, population history and clinical symptoms of betacoronavirus infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,060 adults presented with acute respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of betacoronaviruses using multiplex PCR. The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. RESULTS: A total of 48/2060 (2.4 %) specimens were tested positive for HCoV-OC43 (1.3 %) and HCoV-HKU1 (1.1 %). Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were co-circulating throughout the year, with the lowest detection rates reported in the October-January period. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene showed that the majority of HCoV-OC43 isolates were grouped into two previously undefined genotypes, provisionally assigned as novel lineage 1 and novel lineage 2. Sign of natural recombination was observed in these potentially novel lineages. Location mapping showed that the novel lineage 1 is currently circulating in Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and China, while novel lineage 2 can be found in Malaysia and China. Molecular dating showed the origin of HCoV-OC43 around late 1950s, before it diverged into genotypes A (1960s), B (1990s), and other genotypes (2000s). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 27.3 % of the HCoV-HKU1 strains belong to genotype A while 72.7 % belongs to genotype B. The tree root of HCoV-HKU1 was similar to that of HCoV-OC43, with the tMRCA of genotypes A and B estimated around the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Correlation of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 with the severity of respiratory symptoms was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reported the molecular complexity and evolutionary dynamics of human betacoronaviruses among adults with acute respiratory symptoms in a tropical country. Two novel HCoV-OC43 genetic lineages were identified, warranting further investigation on their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.

Dental Monitoring is the world’s first SaaS (Software as a Service) application designed for remote monitoring of dental treatment, developed in Paris, France, with Philippe Salah as the Co-founder and CEO. Cases presentation: This report describes two cases in which DM system was essential to achieve the control of certain movements: it was possible to follow the movement, even if complex, such as the anterior cross of an adult patient and a lack of space in the canine of the growing patient. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. They were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown with aligners. The first case is a growing patient who was monitored during an interceptive orthodontic treatment to manage a retained upper canine. The second case is an adult patient forced to finalize his treatment of upper lateral incisor crossbite. The software analyzed the fit and retention of the aligner, thus ensuring correct biomechanics. Conclusions: DM system appears to be a promising method, useful for improving the interaction between doctor and patient, generally acceptable and useful to patients, even in critical clinical situations, at least in cases with optimal compliance and ability to use the tool properly.","Caruso, Silvia; Caruso, Sara; Pellegrino, Marianna; Skafi, Rayan; Nota, Alessandro; Tecco, Simona",Sensors (Basel),610,9

In this report, we describe the case of a 71-year-old woman who had undergone splenectomy 35 years ago. She came to our emergency department complaining of back pain, myalgia, asthenia, and a fever of 40.2ºC. No other symptoms were noted upon her admission. Blood workup revealed hyperlacticaemia, increased C-reactive protein, and lymphopenia. A urinalysis and chest radiography were ordered, with no abnormal findings, and the SARS-CoV-2 test was negative. The patient developed persistent hypotension and drowsiness that did not improve with intravenous fluids. Therefore, she was started on a norepinephrine infusion. Cultures were collected, and intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2.2 mg and azithromycin 500 mg. Besides all the diagnostic tests, no infectious cause was found. On the second day of hospitalization, she started to deteriorate, and antibiotic therapy was escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g, resulting in a good clinical response. On the third day after admission, thanks to a group discussion, we were able to identify C. canimorsus in the patient’s blood cultures. A review of history revealed that the patient was in close contact with her pet dog. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary discussion, including the microbiology team, in order to reach an uncommon diagnosis. When dealing with splenectomized individuals presenting with the septic shock of unclear origin, a history of close contact with dogs must lead clinicians to consider C. canimorsus as a causative agent.","Oliveira, Pedro; Figueiredo, Maria; Paes de Faria, Vitória; Abreu, Gabriela; Resende, Janine",Cureus,610,3

METHODS: New York-Presbyterian Hospital – Weill Cornell Medical Center is an urban, quaternary, academic medical center, a level 1 trauma center, and a regional burn center located in New York City. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a unique challenge for pediatric emergency medicine. As the crisis heightened for adult patients, pediatric emergency services experienced a significant decline in volume and acuity. RESULTS: We offer guidelines to modify physical space, clinical services, staffing models, and the importance of steady leadership. Pediatric emergency space was converted to adult COVID-19 beds, necessitating the repurposing of nonclinical areas for pediatric patients. Efficient clinical pathways were created in collaboration with medical and surgical subspecialists for expedited emergency care of children. We transitioned staffing models to meet the changing clinical demands of the emergency department by both reallocation of pediatric emergency medicine providers to telemedicine and by expanding their clinical care to adult patients. Concentrated communication and receptiveness by hospital and department leadership were fundamental to address the dynamic state of the pandemic and ensure provider wellness.

Among all these drugs, we focus on the most promising drugs (such as favipiravir, tocilizumab, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, Lianhua Qingwen, interferon beta-1a, remdesivir, etc.) that have or will enter the final stage of human testing—phase III–IV clinical trials.","Guan, Wenyi; Lan, Wendong; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Shan; Ou, Junxian; Wu, Xiaowei; Yan, Yuqian; Wu, Jianguo; Zhang, Qiwei",Virol Sin,610,1

This study evaluates the association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular (coronary heart disease and stroke) mortality in the primary care settings. METHODS: From a territory-wide database in Hong Kong, we included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents in the years between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and assigned as having poor (Proportion of Days Covered [PDC] < 40%), intermediate (40–79%), and high (≥ 80%) adherence to antihypertensive agents. The association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: From a total of 218,047 eligible patients, 3825 patients (1.75%) died of cardiovascular disease within five years after having received their first-ever antihypertensive agents. The proportions of patients having poor, intermediate, and high medication adherence were 32.9%, 12.1%, and 55.0%, respectively. Higher adherence levels at PDC 40%–79% (HR = 0.46, 95% C.I. 0.41–0.52, p < 0.001) and ≥ 80% (HR = 0.91, 95% C.I. 0.85–0.98, p = 0.012) were significantly less likely to be associated with mortality than the poor adherence (PDC0.040) group. CONCLUSIONS: Better antihypertensive adherence was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. This highlights the need to promote adherence through strategies which have been proved to be effective in clinical settings.","Wong, Martin C.S.; Tam, Wilson W.S.; Cheung, Clement S.K.; Wang, Harry H.X.; Tong, Ellen L.H.; Sek, Antonio C.H.; Yan, Bryan P.Y.; Cheung, N.T.; Leeder, Stephen; Yu, C.M.; Griffiths, Sian",Int J Cardiol,610,3

Six days earlier, the Japan Surgical Society had recommended postponing elective surgical procedures. Along with the growing public fear of COVID-19, hospital visits in Japan decreased. Methods Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, considered to be from March to May 2020, on case volume and claimed hospital charges in acute care hospitals during this period. To make year-over-year comparisons, we considered cases from July 2018 to June 2020. Results A total of 2,739,878 inpatient and 53,479,658 outpatient cases from 195 hospitals were included. In the year-over-year comparisons, total claimed hospital charges decreased in April, May, June 2020 by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. Our results also showed that per-case hospital charges increased during this period, possibly to compensate for the reduced case volumes. Regression results indicated that the hospital charges in April and May 2020 decreased by 6.3% for hospitals without COVID-19 patients. For hospitals with COVID-19 patients, there was an additional decrease in proportion with the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients including suspected cases. The mean additional decrease per COVID-19 patients was estimated to 5.5 million JPY. Conclusion It is suggested that the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients were negatively incentivized.","Shin, J.-h.; Takada, D.; Morishita, T.; Lin, H.; Bun, S.; Teraoka, E.; Okuno, T.; Itoshima, H.; Nagano, H.; Kishimoto, K.; Segawa, H.; Asami, Y.; Higuchi, T.; Minato, K.; Kunisawa, S.; Imanaka, Y.",,610,1

In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity (host sharing) and heterogeneity (host specificity). Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species -avian coronavirus and influenza A virus- and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while virome heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, as well as differences in viral abundance and alpha diversity among species. Overall, we demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species aggregations.","Wille, Michelle; Shi, Mang; Klaassen, Marcel; Hurt, Aeron C.; Holmes, Edward C.",ISME J,610,5

These undesired outcomes are because ageing is associated with other conditions like multimorbidity, frailty and disability. This paper describes the impact of frailty on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management and outcomes. We also try to point out the role of inflamm-ageing, immunosenescence and reduced microbiota diversity in developing a severe form of COVID-19 and a different response to COVID-19 vaccination among older frail adults. Additionally, we attempt to highlight the impact of frailty on intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes, and hence, the rationale behind using frailty as an exclusion criterion for critical care admission. Similarly, the importance of using a time-saving, validated, sensitive, and user-friendly tool for frailty screening in an acute setting as COVID-19 triage. We performed a narrative review. Publications from 1990 to March 2021 were identified by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and SCOPUS. Based on this search, we have found that in older frail adults, many mechanisms contribute to the severity of COVID-19, particularly cytokine storm; those mechanisms include lower immunological capacity and status of ongoing chronic inflammation and reduced gut microbiota diversity. Higher degrees of frailty were associated with poor outcomes and higher mortality rates during and after ICU admission. Also, the response to COVID-19 vaccination among frail older adults might differ from the general population regarding effectiveness and side effects. Researches also had shown that there are many tools for identifying frailty in an acute setting that could be used in COVID-19 triage, and before ICU admission, the clinical frailty scale (CFS) was the most recommended tool. CONCLUSION: Older frail adults have a pre-existing immunopathological base that puts them at a higher risk of undesired outcomes and mortality due to COVID-19 and poor response to COVID-19 vaccination. Also, their admission in ICU should depend on their degree of frailty rather than their chronological age, which is better to be screened using the CFS.

Ceci est en partie en lien avec des maladies chroniques non suivis, des problèmes d’addiction ainsi qu’une exposition plus forte aux maladies transmissibles, en particulier respiratoires. Nous avons réalisé une étude pour évaluer les taux d’attaque, d’hospitalisation et de mortalité liés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 dans une population de résidents de centres d’hébergement pour sans-abri et du personnel à leur contact. Matériels et méthodes Une étude sérologique rétrospective a été réalisée sur l’ensemble des résidents et des membres du personnel de trois centres d’hébergement pour sans-abri entre mars et mai 2020 : 2 centres de lits halte soins santé (LHSS) et un dortoir de femmes. Nous avons inclus tous les adultes présents dans les centres d’hébergement ou décédés d’une infection avérée par le SARS-CoV-2. Les IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 étaient détectés par le test ELISA « SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect (Abbott) ». Un cas confirmé de SARS-CoV-2 était défini comme tout participant présentant une PCR ou une sérologie positive. Des sérologies de contrôle ont été prélevées quatre mois après la première sérologie positive. Résultats Nous avons inclus 100 résidents et 83 membres du personnel. Le taux de SARS-CoV-2 confirmé par PCR ou sérologie était de 72/100 (72,0 %) pour les résidents et de 17/83 (20,5 %) pour le personnel. Le taux d’hospitalisation chez les résidents était de 17/72 (25 %) et le taux de décès de 4/72 (5,6 %). Toutes les hospitalisations sauf une et tous les décès sont survenus chez des résidents des LHSS. Trente-quatre sur 68 (50 %) des résidents des LHSS présentaient au moins deux facteurs de risque de forme grave d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2. Les femmes hébergées dans le dortoir étaient plus jeunes, présentaient moins de comorbidité, avaient le taux d’attaque le plus élevé (90,6 %) et une morbidité-mortalité quasi nulle. Cinquante-deux sur 80 (63,4 %) des personnes ayant une première sérologie positive ont eu une sérologie de contrôle à 4 mois de la première sérologie et 8 mois environ de leur infection. Parmi eux, 44 (84,6 %) avaient conservé des sérologies positives. Conclusion Le taux d’attaque du SARS-CoV-2 était extrêmement élevé chez les résidents des centres d’hébergement pour sans-abri par rapport à la population générale. Le risque d’infection grave par le SARS-CoV-2 était fortement associé à la présence de comorbidités à un plus jeune âge.

Given the exceptional nature of similar situations, only a few studies have investigated the negative psychological effects of forced social isolation and how they can be mitigated in a real context. In the present study, we investigated whether the amount of digital communication technology use for virtual meetings (i.e., voice and video calls, online board games and multiplayer video games, or watching movies in party mode) during the lockdown promoted the perception of social support, which in itself mitigated the psychological effects of the lockdown in Italy. Data were collected in March 2020 (N = 465), during the lockdown imposed to reduce the COVID-19 spread. The results indicated that the amount of digital technology use reduced feelings of loneliness, anger/irritability, and boredom and increased belongingness via the perception of social support. The present study supported the positive role of digital technologies in maintaining meaningful social relationships even during an extreme situation such as a lockdown. Implications such as the need to reduce the digital divide and possible consequences of the ongoing pandemic are discussed.","Gabbiadini, Alessandro; Baldissarri, Cristina; Durante, Federica; Valtorta, Roberta Rosa; De Rosa, Maria; Gallucci, Marcello",Front Psychol,610,1

Hence, together with increased genomic surveillance, methods to rapidly develop and assess effective interventions are critically needed. Here we report the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients using a high-throughput platform. Antibodies were identified from unpaired donor B-cell and serum repertoires using yeast surface display, proteomics, and public light chain screening. Cryo-EM and functional characterization of the antibodies identified N3–1, an antibody that binds avidly (K(d,app) = 68 pM) to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and robustly neutralizes the virus in vitro. This antibody likely binds all three RBDs of the trimeric spike protein with a single IgG. Importantly, N3–1 equivalently binds spike proteins from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, neutralizes UK variant B.1.1.7, and binds SARS-CoV spike with nanomolar affinity. Taken together, the strategies described herein will prove broadly applicable in interrogating adaptive immunity and developing rapid response biological countermeasures to emerging pathogens.","Goike, Jule; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Horton, Andrew; Gardner, Elizabeth C.; Bartzoka, Foteini; Wang, Nianshuang; Javanmardi, Kamyab; Herbert, Andrew; Abbassi, Shawn; Renberg, Rebecca; Johanson, Michael J.; Cardona, Jose A.; Segall-Shapiro, Thomas; Zhou, Ling; Nissly, Ruth H.; Gontu, Abhinay; Byrom, Michelle; Maranhao, Andre C.; Battenhouse, Anna M.; Gejji, Varun; Soto-Sierra, Laura; Foster, Emma R.; Woodard, Susan L.; Nikolov, Zivko L.; Lavinder, Jason; Voss, Will N.; Annapareddy, Ankur; Ippolito, Gregory C.; Ellington, Andrew D.; Marcotte, Edward M.; Finkelstein, Ilya J.; Hughes, Randall A.; Musser, James M.; Kuchipudi, Suresh V.; Kapur, Vivek; Georgiou, George; Dye, John M.; Boutz, Daniel R.; McLellan, Jason S.; Gollihar, Jimmy D.",bioRxiv,610,28

In order to evaluate the threat of viral infection faced by those working with animals, a cross-sectional, sero-epidemiological study was conducted in Guangdong between December 2013 and January 2014. Individuals working with swine, at poultry farms, or live poultry markets (LPM), and veterinarians, and controls not exposed to animals were enrolled in this study and 11 (4 human, 3 swine, 3 avian, and 1 canine) influenza A viruses were used in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (7 strains) and the cross-reactivity test (9 strains) in which 5 strains were used in both tests. Univariate analysis was performed to identify which variables were significantly associated with seropositivity. Odds ratios (OR) revealed that swine workers had a significantly higher risk of elevated antibodies against A/swine/Guangdong/L6/2009(H1N1), a classical swine virus, and A/swine/Guangdong/SS1/2012(H1N1), a Eurasian avian-like swine virus than non-exposed controls. Poultry farm workers were at a higher risk of infection with avian influenza H7N9 and H9N2. LPM workers were at a higher risk of infection with 3 subtypes of avian influenza, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. Interestingly, the OR also indicated that LPM workers were at risk of H1N1 swine influenza virus infection, perhaps due to the presence of pigs in the LPM. While partial confounding by cross-reactive antibodies against human viruses or vaccines cannot be ruled out, our data suggests that animal exposed people as are more likely to have antibodies against animal influenza viruses.","Chen, Jidang; Ma, Jun; White, Sarah K.; Cao, Zhenpeng; Zhen, Yun; He, Shuyi; Zhu, Wanjun; Ke, Changwen; Zhang, Yongbiao; Su, Shuo; Zhang, Guihong",Vet Microbiol,610,7

It takes time to develop antivirals and vaccines, and implement vaccination campaigns. Therefore, preventive measures such as rapid isolation of cases and identification and early quarantine of cases’ close contacts—as well as masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, surface disinfection and air control—are crucial to reduce the risk of transmission. In this context, disinfectants and antiseptics with proven efficacy against the outbreak virus should be used. However, biocidal formulations are quite complex and may include auxiliary substances such as surfactants or emollients in addition to active substances. In order to evaluate disinfectants’ efficacy objectively, meaningful efficacy data are needed. Therefore, the European Committee for Standardisation technical committee 216 ‘Chemical disinfectants and antiseptics’ Working Group 1 (medical area) has developed standards for efficacy testing. The European tiered approach grades the virucidal efficacy in three levels, with corresponding marker test viruses.

However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in those municipalities. In this ecological study, we use geographical models of population mobility as patterns for spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Based on surveillance data, we identify two patterns: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area and other that is hierarchical, with long-distance spread through major highways to cities of regional relevance.

We also applied these projections to understand economic costs versus health benefit of lockdown measures. METHODS: We analyzed open access data on COVID-19 cases from March 6 to January 16, 2021 in the KSA. To understand the epidemic projection during the pre- and post-lockdown period, we used two types of modeling: the SIR model, and the time series model. We also estimated the costs and benefits of lockdown- QALY gained compared to the costs of lockdown considering the payment threshold of the Government. RESULTS: Prediction using lockdown period data suggested that the epidemic might slow down significantly after 109 thousand cases and end on October 6, 2020. However, analysis with latest data after easing lockdown measures suggested that epidemic might be close to an end on October 28, 2021 with 358 thousand cases. The peak has also been shifted from May 18, 2020 to Jun 24, 2020. While earlier model predicted a steady growth in mid-June, the revised model with latest data predicted it in mid-August. In addition, we estimated that 4986 lives would have been saved if lockdown continued but the cost per life saved would be more than $378 thousand, which is way above not only the KSA threshold, but also the threshold of any other highly advanced economies such as the UK and the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that relaxation of lockdown measures negatively impacts the epidemic. However, considering the negative impact of prolong lockdown measures on health and economy, countries must decide on the best timing and strategy to exit from such measures to safely return to normal life with minimum loss of lives and economy considering its economic and health systems’ capacity. Instead of focusing only on health, a balanced approach taking economy under consideration is recommended.","Shimul, Shafiun Nahin; Alradie-Mohamed, Angi; Kabir, Russell; Al-Mohaimeed, Abdulrahman; Mahmud, Ilias",PLoS One,610,16

We examined the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial functioning of adolescent and emerging adult survivors and their parents. We hypothesized that COVID‐19 disruptions and survivor social connectedness would be associated with survivor‐reported posttraumatic stress and family outcomes, including family functioning, parenting, and parent mental health. PROCEDURE: Fifty‐five families (44 survivors, 48 parents) were recruited via phone and email to participate in the study. Survivors were ages 13–25 (M = 19.62, SD = 3.47) and at least 5 years post diagnosis. Parents completed the COVID‐19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), and survivors completed the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) COVID‐19 child self‐report form, which assessed pandemic impacts on their psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: Parents reported a mean of 7.52 (SD = 2.83) disruptions to their families’ lives.

Total disruptions due to COVID‐19 and survivor social connectedness predicted survivor‐reported posttraumatic stress, above and beyond survivors’ pre‐pandemic psychosocial risk. Most parents reported positive changes in their parenting (n = 31, 67.4%) and family cohesion (n = 30, 66.7%). However, they also reported worsened mood (n = 28, 62.3%) and increased anxiety (n = 31, 71.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and survivors reported positive and negative impacts of COVID‐19, which had downstream consequences on survivor psychosocial functioning. Follow‐up care should consider potential adverse effects on social connectedness and stress symptoms.","Fisher, Allison P.; Patronick, Jamie; Gerhardt, Cynthia A.; Radonovich, Krestin; Salloum, Ralph; Wade, Shari L.",Pediatr Blood Cancer,610,24

In case of associated LV dysfunction, rapidly evolving heart failure may follow, and urgent surgery becomes life-saving. CASE SUMMARY: Following an acute anterior MI treated by percutaneous coronary intervention, which resulted in apical hypokinesis, depressed LV function, and moderate mitral regurgitation, a 70-year-old male patient kept in contact with our cardiology department through phone calls. Over 6 weeks, the patient's conditions worsened. For fear of contracting COVID-19, he refused to attend to the Emergency Room. Conditions did not improve despite medical therapy adjustments, and he was admitted to hospital following a syncope. Computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia, and he was placed in a ‘grey’ ward while waiting for nose-swab results for COVID-19. A rapid escalation of treatment was necessary as conditions did not improve with low-dose inotropes, and he required invasive ventilation. An Impella 5.0 was implanted as support prior to surgery, was maintained during the procedure and as a means of weaning off extracorporeal circulation. Surgery was successful and Impella 5.0 was removed on postoperative Day 5. DISCUSSION: To date, Impella use in cardiothoracic surgery has been described in case of ventricular septal rupture or as a bridge to permanent LV assist device. In our case, Impella 5.0 was implanted, used as a bridge to surgery, and as postoperative support in a patient with evolving cardiogenic shock due to LV aneurysm and depressed LV ejection fraction following acute MI, in the difficult setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Briani, Martina; Torracca, Lucia; Crescenzi, Giuseppe; Barbone, Alessandro",Eur Heart J Case Rep,610,20

The phase III ACTIVATE trial assessed whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly. In this double-blind, randomized trial, elderly patients (n=198) received BCG or placebo vaccine at hospital discharge, and were followed for 12 months for new infections. At interim analysis, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection (median 16 weeks compared to 11 weeks after placebo). The incidence of new infections was 42.3% (95% CIs 31.9-53.4%) after placebo vaccination and 25.0% (95% CIs 16.4-36.16%) after BCG vaccination; most of the protection was against respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, p: 0.013).

The present study aimed to assess the barriers faced by the surgeons while performing surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted from September 10 to October 14, 2020. The study population consisted of surgeons practicing in Kpk, Pakistan. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 292, out of 543, surgeons participated in the study (response rate: 59.6%). The younger surgeons (25–30 years) considered the lack of policies and practices regarding exposure to COVID-19 patients as a significant barrier to their practice. The surgeons practicing in private hospitals considered themselves at a higher risk while providing surgical care to the COVID-19 patients. The non-cooperation of the patients was the main barrier in delivering surgical care services. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The current study highlighted the barriers to the surgeons while providing surgical care to patients in the current pandemic. The most pronounced barriers to the surgeons were the lack of policies regarding exposure to COVID-19 and practice and non-cooperation of the patient. To address these barriers, it is recommended that health regulatory agencies of Pakistan should implement strict infection control practices to ensure the safety of surgeons and allied healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Majeed, Abdul; Hussain, Iltaf; Imran, Imran; Saleem, Muhammad Usman; Saeed, Hamid; Abrar, Muhammad Asad; Islam, Muhammad; Hashmi, Furqan K; Akbar, Muqarrab; Ramzan, Basit; Chaudhry, Muhammad Omer; Ashraf, Waseem; Rasool, Muhammad F",J Multidiscip Healthc,610,24

Background The COVID-19 pandemic had led to an increase in demand for remote care in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who require monitoring and frequent access to health services. Design – methods A retrospective study of all activity (in person and by phone call or email) done on the unit during the acute phase of the pandemic at a reference hospital in Spain. Numbers of activities done by nurses, reasons for telehealth care and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency, chi-squared and analysis of variance tests. Results A total of 1095 activities for 561 patients who received care were reported. Among them, 1042 (95.2%) were telemedicine activities, amounting to a 47.3% increase over the prior year. COVID-19-related activities numbered 588 (59.5%).

El objetivo de nuestro estudio es describir el impacto que han tenido los dos estados de alarma decretados en España en la asistencia de la población infantil a nivel de AP. Material y métodos: estudio observacional retrospectivo. Se analizaron las consultas de AP correspondientes a pacientes pediátricos (<14 años) de un área sanitaria del norte de España y de un Centro de Salud perteneciente a ese área, durante el primer y segundo estados de alarma, y se compararon con sus períodos homólogos del 2019. Resultados: durante el primer estado de alarma en que estableció confinamiento domiciliario y cierre de los colegios, se objetivó un gran descenso de las consultas pediátricas en los centros de salud (758 vs 1381 en 2019), a expensas principalmente de revisiones de salud y enfermedades infecciosas. Dicho descenso no se observó en el segundo estado de alarma (1375 vs 1233 en 2019). En ambos estados de alarma aumentó de forma significativa el porcentaje de consultas telefónicas. Conclusiones: La implantación de los estados de alarma ha supuesto un descenso de la demanda asistencial sobre todo durante la primera ola que podría deberse al temor de las familias a acudir al centro de salud y la disminución de la transmisibilidad de los virus debido al confinamiento domiciliario, así mismo ha supuesto un aumento de la asistencia telemática secundaria a la necesidad de reorganización de la asistencia sanitaria. Aim: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has meant a global change in the healthcare model, enhancing telematic assistance, specially at the Health Primary Care (PC). There are few studies that relate the attendance of children at the PC to de pandemic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to describe the impact of the two Spanish states of alarm on the care of children at de PC level. Methods: retrospective observational study. The PC visits corresponding to pediatric patients (<14 years) from a health area in northern Spain during the first and second states of alarm were analyzed, and compared with their equivalent periods in 2019. Results: During the first state of alarm, home lockdown and school closure were established, and a large decrease in pediatric visits to the health centres was observed (758 vs 1381 in 2019) at the expense of health check-ups and infectious diseases. This decrease was not observed in the second state of alarm (1375 vs 1233 in 2019). In both states of alarm, the percentage of telephone assistance increased significantly. Conclusions: The implementation of alarm states has meant a decrease on the demand of medical care, especially during the first state of alarm, may be owing to the fear of the families of going to the health center and the decrease in the transmissibility of viruses due to home lockdown. The increase of the telematic assistance has been on account of the need of reorganization of health care, wich has proven to be effective.","Alonso, Ana Elisa Laso; Zubillaga, Daniel Mata; García, Lara Gloria González; Manchó, Silvia Rodríguez; Hospital, Sara Corral; Aparicio, Cristina García",Semergen,610,29

Then, many fetuses/newborns died in utero or shortly after birth. With time, the issue of sepsis was addressed, and a greater number of newborns survived. Gradually, in this soil, the disciplines of pediatrics and pediatric nursing arose, as some recognized that infants were not merely small adults but were, in fact, quite different. Years later, pediatric pathology developed as a field of exploration. Today, pediatric pathology is a specialty, as witnessed by training programs, societies devoted to research and education, an expanding number of textbooks and innovative research. Pediatric pathology is distinct from adult pathology, as seen by the diversity of malformations and metabolic diseases stemming from mutations, the immaturity of the newborn's immune system, and the types of neoplasms germane to infants and children. Much of the progress in these areas was facilitated by the simultaneous emergence of cytogenetics and molecular biology and their powerful tools of investigation. The latter were applied in a synergistic fashion to a major extent in maternity clinics and children's hospitals by, among others, molecular biologists, clinical geneticists, cytogeneticists, pediatricians, and pediatric pathologists. This article describes a select but small number of the many contributions of pediatrics and pediatric pathology to the current body of medical knowledge.","Nezelof, Christian; Seemayer, Thomas A.; Bridge, Julia A.",Hum Pathol,610,1

The Hajj may, therefore, contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens resulting from the cross-contamination of participants harboring pathogens that easily spread among pilgrims. A wide range of viral and bacterial clinical infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can occur during the Hajj, leading to a high number of outpatient consultations and hospitalization in Saudi hospitals.

Currently there are no treatment options for it. Drug repurposing studies explored the potency of antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, against SARS-CoV-2 virus. These drugs can inhibit the viral protease, called chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also known as Main protease (3CL(pro)); hence, we studied the binding efficiencies of 4-aminoquinoline and 8-aminoquinoline analogs of chloroquine. Six compounds furnished better binding energies than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The interactions with the active site residues especially with Cys145 and His41, which are involved in catalytic diad for proteolysis, make these compounds potent main protease inhibitors. A regression model correlating binding energy and the molecular descriptors for chloroquine analogs was generated with R(2) = 0.9039 and Q(2) = 0.8848. This model was used to screen new analogs of primaquine and molecules from the Asinex compound library. The docking and regression analysis showed these analogs to be more potent inhibitors of 3CL(pro) than hydroxychloroquine and primaquine. The molecular dynamic simulations of the hits were carried out to determine the binding stabilities. Finally, we propose four compounds that show drug likeness toward SARS-CoV-2 that can be further validated through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Achutha, A. S.; Pushpa, V.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been shown to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, while the regulatory roles of PRRSV-encoded products in apoptosis are not fully understood. In the present study, we first showed a biphasic apoptosis regulation by a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06. It was indicated that PRRSV infection delays apoptosis at early infection but activates apoptosis at late infection in MARC-145 cells. In PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were activated at late infection, demonstrating the involvements of death receptor pathway, mitochondrial pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in inducing apoptosis. PRRSV was also shown to induce a similar apoptosis process in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with an early initiation. Next, the PRRSV-encoded apoptosis inducers were screened, indicating that the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV are pro-apoptotic. In the presence of Nsp4, it was confirmed that procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were cleaved, and Nsp4 facilitates the cleavage of procaspase-9 by activating B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), a pro-apoptotic protein. In addition, Nsp4 was shown to induce the degradation of an anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). Nsp10 was shown to activate procaspase-8 and -9 but procaspase-12 and to upregulate the expression of BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) and its active form, truncated Bid (tBid). Clearly, the participation of both activated caspase-8 and Bid is required for Nsp10-induced apoptosis, indicating a crosstalk between extrinsic- and mitochondria-dependent pathways. Together, our findings suggest that PRRSV infection regulates apoptosis in a two-phase manner and activates all three apoptotic pathways; the Nsp4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV function as apoptosis inducers with different molecular basis.","Yuan, Shuaizhen; Zhang, Ning; Xu, Lei; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun",PLoS One,610,11

However, for low humidity conditions, these materials typically present a less expressive performance, which is a drawback for many applications. In the present report, mesoporous silica SBA-15 was functionalized with Al, Ti, Zr and Li in order to improve their performance in this condition. The influence of functionalization in porosity, morphology and acidic sites was investigated. Samples with an increased number of acidic sites and with higher microporosity when compared to pure silica were produced. This was responsible for their enhanced performance for water adsorption in low moisture conditions. Sample functionalized with zirconium in SBA-15 synthesis improved the water adsorption capacity of pure silica by three times, reaching up to 127 g kg(−1) at a relative pressure of 0.2 and 570 g kg(−1) close to saturation pressure.

Dès janvier 2021, les professionnels de santé (PDS) de plus de 50 ans ou avec facteurs de risque sont devenus éligibles aux vaccins à ARNm. L’autorisation de mise sur le marché du vaccin AztraZeneca (AZ) a permis d’étendre l’indication vaccinale à tous les PDS début février 2021. Matériels et méthodes La vaccination AZ a débuté dans notre établissement le 09/02/2021 et s’est initialement organisée dans plusieurs services considérés à risque afin d’optimiser l’offre vaccinale. Les cadres de chaque unité ont recensé les soignants volontaires à la vaccination et un binôme IDE/médecin s’est déplacé dans chaque service afin d’effectuer la consultation médicale et la vaccination. Un premier recensement des effets secondaires post-vaccinaux a spontanément été réalisé par les cadres devant les nombreux symptômes rapportés dans les 24h suivant l’injection, puis complété par les IDE du centre de vaccination sur appel des PDS vaccinés. Résultats Du 09 au 12/02/21, 144 soignants ont été vaccinés avec l’AZ dont 107 femmes (74 %). L’âge médian était de 38 ans [22-58]. Parmi eux, on dénombrait 26% de médecins/internes, 48 % IDE/IADE, 13 % d’AS, 9 % de sages-femmes/auxiliaires puéricultrices et 13 % d’autres catégories. Les principaux services concernés étaient l’oncologie (7,6 %), l’hématologie-maladies infectieuses (5,6 %), la médecine polyvalente (7,6 %), les urgences/SMUR (22,9 %), la réanimation (13,2 %), la rhumatologie-pneumologie (6,3 %), la gastro-entérologie (4,2 %), le pôle mère-enfant (18,1 %). Les données de tolérance ont pu être recueillies chez 127 soignants (88 %). Seulement 27 vaccinés (21 %) n’ont présenté aucun symptôme post-vaccinal. Les principaux symptômes décrits étaient : fièvre (41 %), frissons (35 %), asthénie (34 %), courbatures (37 %), céphalées (31 %), douleurs au site d’injection (9 %) et troubles digestifs (6 %). Ces symptômes semblaient plus fréquents chez les femmes (82 % vs 71 %) (OR 1,86 [IC 95 % 0,75-4,61], p =0,18), et étaient significativement plus élevés chez les PDS de moins de 35 ans (90% vs 72%) (OR 3,46 [IC 95% 1,21-9,86], p =0,02). Ces effets secondaires ont généré 7 arrêts de travail. Une soignante a été prise en charge au SAU 4jours après la vaccination pour un tableau de dyspnée progressive dont le lien avec la vaccination n’a pas été définitivement établi. Conclusion Si l’idée de vacciner directement dans les services semblait séduisante afin de pouvoir vacciner rapidement les soignants les plus exposés au SARS-CoV-2, la tolérance modérée de ce vaccin a donné lieu à la suspension de la campagne organisée dans les unités afin d’éviter un nombre trop important d’arrêts de travail sur la même période. Elle s’est secondairement mise en place de manière échelonnée au centre de vaccination Covid-19 de l’établissement.

However, the association between other MT time courses or functional outcomes and COVID-19 outbreaks remains unclear. We compared the time courses of stroke pathways or functional outcomes in 2020 (the COVID-19 era) with those in 2019 (the pre-COVID-19 era) in Tokyo, Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : This retrospective observational study used data from the Tokyo-tama-REgistry of Acute endovascular Thrombectomy (TREAT), a multicenter registry of MT for acute large vessel occlusion in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Patients who had undergone acute MT from January 2019 to December 2020 were included. Patients were classified by the year they had undergone MT (2019 or 2020). RESULTS: : In total, 477 patients were analyzed. O2D time was significantly longer in 2020 (146.0 min) than in 2019 (105.0 min; p=0.034). No significant difference in door-to-puncture time (D2P) time or modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0–2 at 90 days was seen between 2019 and 2020. In the subgroup analysis, O2D time was significantly longer in the first half of 2020 compared with 2019. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the year 2020 was a independent predictor of longer O2D time, but not for mRS score 0–2 at 90 days. CONCLUSIONS: : Although O2D time was significantly longer in the COVID-19 compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, D2P may not be significantly delayed and functional outcomes may not be different, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.","Katsumata, Masahiro; Ota, Takahiro; Kaneko, Junya; Jimbo, Hiroyuki; Aoki, Rie; Fujitani, Shigeta; Ichijo, Masahiko; Inoue, Masato; Shigeta, Keigo; Miyauchi, Yoshifumi; Sakai, Yu; Arakawa, Hideki; Otsuka, Yoshinobu; Ariyada, Kenichi; Kuroshima, Yoshiaki; Fuse, Takahisa; Shiokawa, Yoshiaki; Hirano, Teruyuki",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,610,16

As a consequence, the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, these isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Exposed, Presymptomatic Infective, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","Eguíluz, Víctor M.; Fernández-Gracia, Juan; Rodríguez, Jorge P.; Pericàs, Juan M.; Melián, Carlos",Front Med (Lausanne),610,24

Methods: FEV(1) and FVC were assessed by dry bellows spirometer. Serum IgG titres to 11 common respiratory pathogens were assayed. Smoking history was assessed by questionnaire. Reciprocal positive IgG titres were taken as ≥10 for all pathogens with the exception of Legionella spp. (≥40) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (≥20). Linear regression analysis examined associations between titres and lung function after adjustment for age, height, gender and smoking, separately for adults (age > 17 years) and children. Results: An increased total number of positive IgG titres was significantly associated with reduced FEV(1) (P = 0.01) and FEV(1)/FVC ratio (P = 0.01) suggesting the presence of airflow obstruction. This association was independent of age, gender, height, weight and smoking status. Conclusions: The burden of past respiratory infections may be an important determinant of airway function in this Aboriginal community.","MUSK, A.W.

Only 2 months later, the new virus affected most countries of the world, the consequence being an overload of health systems, especially Intensive Care Units. Considered a category of patients at high risk of developing severe forms of the disease, cancer patients can develop a severe form of the disease, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Radiotherapy, as a treatment included in the multidisciplinary management of cancer for both curative and palliative purposes, is also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-positive or -suspected patients are a special category for which the decision to postpone treatment should be made based on the particularities of tumor biology and the radiobiological effect of a gap in radiation fractions delivery. Emergencies including spinal cord compressions, tumor bleeding, and brain metastases not responsive to corticosteroid treatment, should be considered a priority but the palliative treatment should be limited from one single fraction to maximum five fractions for spinal cord compression and whole brain radiotherapy. Radiotherapy for brain metastases does not bring a benefit in terms of overall survival for patients with life expectancy of days or weeks and dexamethasone treatment is the correct choice in this situation. In all settings, the approach of radiotherapy treatment must be adapted for both scenarios of an outbreak pandemic, when general measures of social distancing and protection by specific equipment of patients and radiotherapy staff are a priority, but also for a long period of coexistence with the virus with possible new “pandemic waves.”","Mireștean, Camil Ciprian; Agop, Maricel; Buzea, Clin Gheorghe; Cazacu, Marius Mihai; Prelipceanu, Marius; Iancu, Roxana Irina; Iancu, Dragos Teodor",Biomedical Engineering Tools for Management for Patients with COVID-19,610,20

Pokémon GO leverages AR to introduce virtual objects at fixed and dynamic locations that translate through the app interface to incentives in the real world that potentially influence users’ route and mode choices. Its gaming nature and social components can possibly enhance long-term user engagement through applying the characteristics of game elements and providing opportunities for competition, collaboration, companionship, and social reinforcement. An online survey is conducted to collect the self-reported behavior of a group of Pokémon GO users to explore its impacts on the following aspects of travel behavior: (1) the frequency of changing the route to interact with virtual objects; (2) the likelihood of carpooling more instead of driving alone for more in-app collaboration; and (3) the likelihood of shifting mode from drive alone to public transit, walking, and cycling if provided with additional incentives. The ordered survey responses including frequency and likelihood are analyzed using random parameters ordered probit models to account for the unobserved heterogeneity across users and identify subpopulations of travelers who are more susceptible to the influence of Pokémon GO. The modeling results identify four types of variables (attitude and perceptions related to Pokémon GO, app engagement, play style, and sociodemographic characteristics) that affect users’ travel behavior. The results illustrate that such apps with integrated AR, gamification, and social components can be used by policymakers to influence various aspects of travel behavior. The study findings and insights can provide valuable feedback to system operators for designing such apps to dynamically manage traffic in real-time and promote long-term sustainable mode shifts.","Guo, Yuntao; Peeta, Srinivas; Agrawal, Shubham; Benedyk, Irina",Transportation (Amst),610,23

A key factor in a robust public health system is its workforce. As part of a nationally funded study of public health renewal in Canada, a policy analysis was conducted to compare public health human resources-relevant documents in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON), as they each implement public health renewal activities. METHODS: A content analysis of policy and planning documents from government and public health-related organizations was conducted by a research team comprised of academics and government decision-makers. Documents published between 2003 and 2011 were accessed (BC = 27; ON = 20); documents were either publicly available or internal to government and excerpted with permission. Documentary texts were deductively coded using a coding template developed by the researchers based on key health human resources concepts derived from two national policy documents. RESULTS: Documents in both provinces highlighted the importance of public health human resources planning and policies; this was particularly evident in early post-SARS documents. Key thematic areas of public health human resources identified were: education, training, and competencies; capacity; supply; intersectoral collaboration; leadership; public health planning context; and priority populations. Policy documents in both provinces discussed the importance of an educated, competent public health workforce with the appropriate skills and competencies for the effective and efficient delivery of public health services. CONCLUSION: This policy analysis identified progressive work on public health human resources policy and planning with early documents providing an inventory of issues to be addressed and later documents providing evidence of beginning policy development and implementation. While many similarities exist between the provinces, the context distinctive to each province has influenced and shaped how they have focused their public health human resources policies.","Regan, Sandra; MacDonald, Marjorie; Allan, Diane E; Martin, Cheryl; Peroff-Johnston, Nancy",Hum Resour Health,610,1

In hospital settings, the possibility of airborne transmission needs to be investigated thoroughly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There was a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 in a hematologic ward in a tertiary hospital, Seoul, Korea. We found 11 patients and guardians with COVID-19 through vigorous contact tracing and closed-circuit television monitoring. We found one patient who probably had acquired COVID-19 through airborne-transmission. We performed airflow investigation with simulation software, whole-genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Of the nine individuals with COVID-19 who had been in the hematologic ward, six stayed in one multi-patient room (Room 36), and other three stayed in different rooms (Room 1, 34, 35). Guardian in room 35 was close contact to cases in room 36, and patient in room 34 used the shared bathroom for teeth brushing 40 minutes after index used. Airflow simulation revealed that air was spread from the bathroom to the adjacent room 1 while patient in room 1 did not used the shared bathroom. Airflow was associated with poor ventilation in shared bathroom due to dysfunctioning air-exhaust, grill on the door of shared bathroom and the unintended negative pressure of adjacent room.

Our national guidelines regarding care of women with positive test for SARS‐CoV‐2 (detection with polymerase chain reaction) recommend individualized antenatal care, mode of delivery based on obstetric considerations, and no routine separation of the mother and newborn after birth. Breastfeeding is encouraged, and although there is no specific recommendation on wearing a face mask to prevent viral transmission to the newborn while nursing, instructions are given to keep high hygiene standards. All studies based on cases tested due to hospital admittance, including our, will capture more women with pregnancy complications than in the general population. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics in 67 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive women and their 68 neonates, and to report short‐term maternal and neonate outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case series with data from medical records including all test‐positive women (n=67) who gave birth from March 19 to April 26, 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden. Means, proportions and percentages were calculated for characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 32 years, 40% were nulliparous, and 61% were overweight or obese. Further, 15% had diabetes and 21% a hypertensive disease. 70% of the women had a vaginal birth. Preterm delivery occurred in 19% of the women.

It also has an association with cancer, particularly prostate cancer. However, its association with lung cancer remains insufficiently explored. Thus, an in-depth investigation into the association between TMPRSS2 and lung cancer is significant, considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and that the lungs are the primary organ SARS-CoV-2 attacks. Methods Using five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) genomics datasets, we explored associations between TMPRSS2 expression and immune signatures, cancer-associated pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical prognosis in LUAD by the bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, we validated the findings from the bioinformatics analysis by performing in vitro experiments with the human LUAD cell line A549 and in vivo experiments with mouse tumor models. We also validated our findings in LUAD patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, China. Results TMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD8+ T and NK cells and immune cytolytic activity in LUAD, which represent antitumor immune signatures. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD4+ regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-L1 expression levels in LUAD, which represent antitumor immunosuppressive signatures. However, TMPRSS2 expression levels showed a significant positive correlation with the ratios of immune-stimulatory/immune-inhibitory signatures (CD8+ T cells/PD-L1) in LUAD. It indicated that TMPRSS2 levels had a stronger negative correlation with immune-inhibitory signatures than with immune-stimulatory signatures. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with elevated activities of many oncogenic pathways in LUAD, including cell cycle, mismatch repair, p53, and extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with increased proliferation, stemness, genomic instability, tumor advancement, and worse survival in LUAD. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated the association of TMPRSS2 deficiency with increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion and antitumor immunity in LUAD. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that TMPRSS2-knockdown tumors were more sensitive to BMS-1, an inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1. Conclusions TMPRSS2 is a tumor suppressor, while its downregulation is a positive biomarker of immunotherapy in LUAD.

Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks.

METHODS: The studied subjects were divided into two groups. Sixty-two post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis were one group, and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy people were as normal controlled group. Empty stomach blood samples from cubital veins were collected from both groups. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction and solid phase oligonucleotide assay. RESULTS: The blood agents of post-SARS patients changed obviously with 15.64 ± 13.85 U/ml while the control group 7.96 ± 4.27 U/ml; 4G/4G genotype for the PAI-1 polymorphism detected in post-SARS group was more than that of the control group, but had no statistical significance. The plasma PAI activity was related to homozygote 4G/4G genotype. This reveals that homozygote 4G/4G genotype may be a susceptible gene mark to Chinese osteonecrosis patients.

We find significant susceptibility reductions in the metropolitan regions as a result of earlier seeding, with a relatively longer phase of exponential growth before the introduction of public health interventions. During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects. Forward projections indicate that non-metropolitan regions will be more affected during recurrent epidemic waves compared with the initially heavier-hit metropolitan regions.

The reasons of this geographical pattern might involve several concurrent factors. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether any correlations exist between the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different Italian regions and the amount of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Earth's surface. To this purpose, in this environmental ecological study a mixed-effect exponential regression was built to explain the incidence of COVID-19 based on the environmental conditions, and demographic and pathophysiologic factors. Observations and estimates of the cumulative solar UV exposure have been included to quantify the amount of radiation available e.g., for pre-vitamin D3 synthesis or SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by the sunlight. The analysis shows a significant correlation (p-value <5 × 10−2) between the response variables (death percentage, incidence of infections and positive tests) and biologically effective solar UV radiation, residents in nursing homes per inhabitant (NHR), air temperature, death percentage due to the most frequent comorbidities. Among all factors, the amount of solar UV radiation is the variable contributing the most to the observed correlation, explaining up to 83.2% of the variance of the COVID-19 affected cases per population. While the statistical outcomes of the study do not directly entail a specific cause-effect relationship, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that solar UV radiation impacted on the development of the infection and on its complications, e.g. through the effect of vitamin D on the immune system or virus inactivation by sunlight. The analytical framework used in this study, based on commonly available data, can be easily replicated in other countries and geographical domains to identify possible correlations between exposure to solar UV radiation and the spread of the pandemic.","Isaia, Giancarlo; Diémoz, Henri; Maluta, Francesco; Fountoulakis, Ilias; Ceccon, Daniela; di Sarra, Alcide; Facta, Stefania; Fedele, Francesca; Lorenzetto, Giuseppe; Siani, Anna Maria; Isaia, Gianluca",Sci Total Environ,610,20

It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing measures, with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19.We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, Canada, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical distancing (also known as social distancing)has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66-0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures - if sufficiently strong and robustly followed - could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.","Anderson, Sean C; Edwards, Andrew M; Yerlanov, Madi; Mulberry, Nicola; Stockdale, Jessica; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca C; Otterstatter, Michael C.; Irvine, Michael A; Janjua, Naveed Z; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline",,610,24

These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID-19 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID-19 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D-dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a secondary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID-19 infection. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this are also discussed.","Cavalli, Eugenio; Bramanti, Alessia; Ciurleo, Rosella; Tchorbanov, Andrey I.; Giordano, Antonio; Fagone, Paolo; Belizna, Cristina; Bramanti, Placido; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Nicoletti, Ferdinando",Int J Mol Med,610,10

Objectives: This study details the process of developing and operating an online telepharmacy service, analyzes its usage, and assesses users' health information-seeking patterns. Methods: The service utilized various platforms for receiving and processing queries, communication, and promotion. Submissions received from March 20 to May 31, 2020 were processed for analysis. Parameters analyzed were time patterns of query submission, response time, service feedback, user and patient demographics, and subjects of inquiry. Results: A total of 271 queries were analyzed. Query frequency decreased over time, consistent with relaxation of quarantine restrictions and increasing availability of information. Peak hours of query influx were outside typical business hours. The majority of users were from the general public (93.8%) and preferred to receive responses through text (61.2%). The majority of users from the general public belonged to the 15- to 25-year-old age group (41.1%) and sought information for oneself. Most submissions mentioned COVID-related topics. From the general public, there was greatest interest in drug indications and vitamins, supplements, and herbal products, and from healthcare professionals, in drug procurement. Users who provided feedback (n = 12) all expressed satisfaction with the service and the information they received. Conclusion: Transition to the ""new normal"" entails adopting alternative platforms to augment traditional sources of health information. An online telepharmacy service may be utilized to provide and clarify medication information as part of primary care.","Plantado, Aldrin Nico R; de Guzman, Harold Joshua dV; Mariano, Jose Emmanuel C; Salvan, Maria Rosewynn Anne R; Benosa, Christine Aileen C; Robles, Yolanda R",Journal of pharmacy practice,610,1

It is an important way of reducing clinical risk. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid move to mainly remote consultations within the musculoskeletal field, safety netting is an important strategy to embed within all consultations. Only those presenting with potentially serious conditions are offered face to face consultations. Screening for Red Flags and any indication of a serious cause of symptoms is always first line in any consultation, however, clinical presentations are not always black and white with patients falling into a clear diagnostic category. With patients minds more focussed on COVID-19 symptoms this can be problematic. With the additional ramifications of public health social restrictions, onward management can be a conundrum. Many people with risk factors of serious pathology are also as a consequence, vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. In situations of uncertain clinical presentations, to avoid unnecessary social contact, safety netting can help to monitor symptoms over time until the clinical context becomes more certain. Embedding safety netting within physiotherapy best practice could be a silver lining in this pandemic black cloud.","Greenhalgh, Sue; Finucane, Laura M.; Mercer, Christopher; Selfe, James",Musculoskelet Sci Pract,610,21

This paper reviews the possibility of repurposing angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists and vitamin D to treat COVID-19. ACE2 protein found on the cell membranes is the target of SARS-CoV-2 for entering into the host cells. Viral spike protein-binding with ACE2 down-regulates it. As ACE2 is known to protect the lung from injuries, SARS-CoV-2-induced ACE2 deficiency may expose patients to lung damage. AT1R antagonists and vitamin D increase the expression of ACE2 independently. Besides, vitamin D suppresses the compensatory increase in renin levels following the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by AT1R antagonists. Therefore, a combination of AT1R antagonists and vitamin D may offer protection against COVID-19 induced lung injury.","Rafiullah, Mohamed",Am J Med Sci,610,10

The Philippines is a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak but has recently curtailed transmission while gradually easing interventions. Methods We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a Minimum Health Standards policy, MHS) to represent the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and projected the impacts of easing interventions. Results Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Several of the fitted epidemiological parameters were consistent with those reported in high-income settings. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 15-32%. The December 2020 case detection rate was estimated at ~14%, population recovered at ~12%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. Conclusions COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, and mobility, and the epidemic can be understood within a similar framework as for high-income settings. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS measures should allow the Philippines to maintain epidemic control, but disease resurgence remains a threat due to low population immunity and detection rates.","Caldwell, J.

Transient protonation of a universally conserved carboxylate on subunit c (D61 in E. coli) gated by the electrostatic interaction with arginine on subunit a (R210 in E. coli) is believed to be a crucial step in proton transfer across the membrane. We used a fusion protein consisting of subunit a and the adjacent helices of subunit c to test by NMR spectroscopy if cD61 and aR210 are involved in an electrostatic interaction with each other, and found no evidence of such interaction. We have also determined that R140 does not form a salt bridge with either D44 or D124 as was suggested previously by mutation analysis.

ICBT interventions have already shown their efficacy in several studies, but studies in the field of specific phobias are still scarce. Moreover, few studies have investigated the feasibility of using different types of images in exposure scenarios in ICBTs and no studies have been carried out on the role of sense of presence and reality judgement. The aim of the present study is to explore the feasibility of an ICBT for FP (NO-FEAR Airlines) using two types of images with different levels of immersion (still and navigable images). A secondary aim is to explore the potential effectiveness of the two experimental conditions using two types of images compared to a waiting list control group. Finally, the role of navigable images compared to the still images in the level of anxiety, sense of presence, and reality judgement will also be explored. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: This study is a three-armed feasibility pilot study with the following conditions: NO-FEAR Airlines with navigable images, NO-FEAR Airlines with still images, and a waiting list group. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited. The intervention will have a maximum duration of 6 weeks. Measurements will be taken at four different moments: baseline, post-intervention, and two follow-ups (3- and 12-month). Participants' opinions, preference, satisfaction and acceptance regarding the images used in the exposure scenarios will be assessed. FP symptomatology outcomes will also be considered for secondary analyses. The anxiety, sense of presence, and reality judgement in the exposure scenarios will also be analysed. DISCUSSION: This study will conduct a pilot study on the feasibility of an ICBT for FP and it is the first one to explore the evaluation of patients of the two type of images (still and navigable) and the role of presence and reality judgement in exposure scenarios delivered through the Internet. Research in this field can have an impact on the way these scenarios are designed and developed, as well as helping to explore whether they have any effect on adherence.

Setting A newly created specialized rehabilitation unit in a tertiary care medical center Participants Consecutive sample of the first 100 patients with Covid-19 infection admitted to rehabilitation. Intervention Inpatient rehabilitation for post-acute care Covid-19 patients Main Outcome Measures Measurements, at admission and discharge, comprised a Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (including baseline value before Covid-19 infection), time to perform 10 sit-to-stands with associated cardio-respiratory changes, and grip strength (dynamometry). Correlations between these outcomes and the time spent in ICU were explored. Results Patient characteristics upon admission to rehabilitation were: men 66%, age 66±22 years, mean delay from symptom onset 20.4±10.0 days, BMI 26.0±5.4 kg/m2, hypertension 49%, diabetes 29%, with 26% having >50% pulmonary damage on CT-scans.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation.

Results & methodology: We present the case of a 68-year-old man with COVID-19 who was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and lenzilumab, but continued to develop hypoxemia, requiring an increase in respiratory support with an associated rise in serum inflammatory markers. He was subsequently treated with tocilizumab with marked clinical improvement and a decrease in acute phase reactants within 48 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case demonstrates the effective use of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 and suggests the superiority of tocilizumab over lenzilumab in the management of this cytokine-mediated syndrome.","Melody, Megan; Nelson, Jared; Hastings, Jacquelyn; Propst, Joshua; Smerina, Michael; Mendez, Julio; Guru, Pramod",Immunotherapy,610,1

Our aim of promoting diversity and widening participation (WP) amongst future medical school applicants is reflected in the fact 80.2% of the students enrolled are from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic groups (BAME). Over an 18 month period, our students are invited to monthly seminars hosted at King’s College London (KCL), where all things “medical school” are explored. Students are paired with current KCL medical student ambassadors and are grouped into ‘Families’. Between sessions, students and ambassadors are facilitated to communicate freely, but safely through the online platform Brightside. Early establishment of our key stakeholders allowed us to anticipate how InsideMed would impact each in turn and, therefore, design our scheme to ensure maximal mutual benefit. Continual feedback and review ensures that we are constantly improving to meet the needs of our students. Feedback also allows us to identify how closely we have served our aims for each cohort; common themes which consistently arise include the creation of community, learning more about specifics of the medical application process, and building self-confidence and student independence. InsideMed has the unique quality of being designed by WP students and constantly updated to ensure the support provided best meets WP needs. This has fed into our tangible and impressive impact, whereby 7 out of 18 respondents from our 2017 cohort of students have been accepted into medical school. Going forward, we hope to expand our scope to include a wider catchment area and will continue online in the COVID era. We aim to create an expansive alumni community to inspire other students from comparable socioeconomic backgrounds that they too can have a career in medicine.","Sanders, Gabrielle; Brett, Connor; Paul, Nadine; Scott, Jessica",Adv Med Educ Pract,610,5

Saliva, a biofluid largely generated from salivary glands in oral cavity, has been reported 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive. Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2. Close contact or short-range transmission of infectious saliva droplets is a primary mode for 2019-nCoV to disseminate as claimed by WHO, while long-distance saliva aerosol transmission is highly environment dependent within indoor space with aerosol-generating procedures such as dental practice. So far, no direct evidence has been found that 2019-nCoV is vital in air flow for long time. Therefore, to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets, to thoroughly disinfect indoor air and to block acquisition of saliva droplets could slow down 2019-nCoV dissemination.

Both viral and synthetic vectors have been successfully employed for genetic delivery with recent examples being DNA, adenoviral, and mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. Viral vectors can be target specific and very efficient but can also mediate severe immune response, cell toxicity, and mutations. Four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol for mechanical properties, and PEG-conjugated lipid for stability represent the current leading nonviral vectors for mRNA. However, the segregation of the neutral ionizable lipid as droplets in the core of the LNP, the ""PEG dilemma"", and the stability at only very low temperatures limit their efficiency. Here, we report the development of a one-component multifunctional ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) delivery system for mRNA that exhibits high activity at a low concentration of ionizable amines organized in a sequence-defined arrangement. Six libraries containing 54 sequence-defined IAJDs were synthesized by an accelerated modular-orthogonal methodology and coassembled with mRNA into dendrimersome nanoparticles (DNPs) by a simple injection method rather than by the complex microfluidic technology often used for LNPs. Forty four (81%) showed activity in vitro and 31 (57%) in vivo. Some, exhibiting organ specificity, are stable at 5 °C and demonstrated higher transfection efficiency than positive control experiments in vitro and in vivo. Aside from practical applications, this proof of concept will help elucidate the mechanisms of packaging and release of mRNA from DNPs as a function of ionizable amine concentration, their sequence, and constitutional isomerism of IAJDs.","Zhang, Dapeng; Atochina-Vasserman, Elena N; Maurya, Devendra S; Huang, Ning; Xiao, Qi; Ona, Nathan; Liu, Matthew; Shahnawaz, Hamna; Ni, Houping; Kim, Kyunghee; Billingsley, Margaret M; Pochan, Darrin J; Mitchell, Michael J; Weissman, Drew; Percec, Virgil",J Am Chem Soc,610,11

Today, society is more aware of animal welfare than previous generations. The use of noninvasive LA as a substitute for invasive MA in basic experimental research of acupuncture should be encouraged. Thus, we conducted an overview of animal experiments in the research field of LA from January 1978 to April 2020. After careful research, 52 studies were included in the work. Among these studies, both single-point and multipoint LA studies have been reported. To make noninvasive LA better in replacing invasive MA in experimental animal research of acupuncture, further experiments should focus on exploring uniform criteria for selecting laser parameters and revealing the extent to which the curative effect of LA depends on the property of acupuncture points rather than the characteristics of photobiomodulation.","Yang, Yan; Litscher, Gerhard; Sun, Zhongren; Sun, Wen",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,610,28

The disease is characterized by increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence; the most commonly associated pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae express virulence determinants that directly and indirectly impair mucociliary clearance and incite other consequences that are permissive to microbial persistence. Regarding the use of antibiotics, there is currently a lack of large-scale clinical trials that are sufficiently powerful to provide good evidence-based information. Nonetheless, antimicrobial chemotherapy has repeatedly been shown to confer benefit in patients with moderately severe features of AECB. Simple clinical criteria can be used to identify patients in whom there is a higher likelihood of treatment failure or mortality during AECB. These include significant cardiopulmonary co-morbidity, frequent exacerbations, advanced decline in lung function, malnutrition or other generalized debility, advanced age (> 70 years) and concurrent treatment with corticosteroids. In such patients, an aggressive antimicrobial approach to AECB may be warranted in order to prevent clinical failure or representation. From a clinical perspective, appropriate drugs include those that are stable to β-lactamases, are bactericidal against causative pathogens, penetrate diseased lung tissue in high concentrations and have a good safety profile.","Read, R.

No previous systematic review has provided a comprehensive overview by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis of this current topic. Method: A systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, case–control studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS), cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies of all the available interventions for psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19. We searched the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, as well as the Chinese databases such as Sinomed, Chinese Biomedicine Literature (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), WanFang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), from 2019 to April 30, 2020.

Result: Sixteen self-controlled case series (SCCS) comprising 1,147 participants compared five different psychological interventions with four different measurement scales were included in this study. For effectiveness, all the psychological therapies were significantly more effective than before intervention. Our results showed that supportive therapy (ST), which is adjusted to the COVID-19-related mental crisis, is the best treatment compared with behavioral therapy (BT), nursing-based psychological therapy (NBPT), traditional Chinese medicine therapy (TCMT), and COVID-19-related standard training (CRST) at reducing the anxiety-related symptoms assessed by SAS. When measured by SDS, BT was better than ST and NBPT treatment for reducing the depression symptoms. And ST was better than BT and ST+BT as assessed by PHQ-9. In the end, the last network meta-analysis indicated that NBPT was more effective than ST by the measurement of SCL-90. Conclusion: Our research suggested the potential effectiveness of psychological interventions for decreasing psychological crisis in people affected by COVID-19 and try to introduce the best effective treatment options for clinical practice according to the clinical manifestations of psychological problems, but further confirmation from high-quality RCTs is needed.","Yang, Yang; Sun, Shaodan; Hu, Shaowen; Tang, Chunzhi; Zhang, Yimin; Lin, Haibo",Front Psychol,610,10

In addition, control of spread of infection has been targeted through development of preventive tools and measures. In this regard, nanomaterials, particularly, those combining two or even several constituting materials possessing dissimilar physicochemical (or even biological) properties, i.e., nanohybrid materials play a significant role. Nanoparticulate nanohybrids have gained a widespread reputation for prevention of viral crises, thanks to their promising antimicrobial properties as well as their potential to act as a carrier for vaccines. On the other hand, they can perform well as a photo-driven killer for viruses when they release reactive oxygen species (ROS) or photothermally damage the virus membrane. The nanofibers can also play a crucial protective role when integrated into face masks and personal protective equipment, particularly as hybridized with antiviral nanoparticles. In this draft, we review the antiviral nanohybrids that could potentially be applied to control, diagnose, and treat the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the short age of this health problem, trivially the relevant technologies are not that many and are handful. Therefore, still progressing, older technologies with antiviral potential are also included and discussed.

To date, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide has crossed over six million with over three hundred and seventy thousand deaths (according to the data from World Health Organization; updated on 2 June 2020). Although COVID-19 can be rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment of COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting in high fatality. Some clinical trials have identified vitamin C (VC) as a potent compound pneumonia management. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is clinically as an anti-inflammatory medicine against pneumonia-induced inflammatory stress. We hypothesized that the combination of VC and GA is a potential option for treating COVID-19. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine pharmacological targets and molecular mechanisms of VC + GA treatment for COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology. RESULTS: We uncovered optimal targets, biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19. Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. We also identified 17 core targets of VC + GA, which suggest as antimicrobial function.

Preventive measures to avoid infections are therefore particularly important for individuals engaging in behavioral risk factors. We seek to determine whether behavioral risk factors (BRFs) play a significant role in the adherence to preventive COVID-19 measures in a population aged 50 and above. The SHARE wave 8 (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and SHARE COVID-19 Survey served as the database, resulting in an analytical sample of 17,588 respondents from 23 European countries plus Israel. Of these 36.04% engaged in at least one BRF and 16.68% engaged in 3 or more BRFs. Multilevel logistic regressions revealed that engagement in one BRF was significantly associated with less adherence to hygiene preventive measures, i.e., hand-sanitizing, hand-washing and covering coughs and sneezes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.94), as was engagement in two BRFs (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.97) and three or more BRFs (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59; 0.88). No such association was found between engagement in BRFs and adherences to social isolation preventive measures, i.e., avoiding meeting more than five people, visiting others or going shopping, or regulated preventive measures, i.e., wearing a mask and keeping physical distance. The found association was also stronger when three or more BRFs were engaged in (1 vs. 3 BRFs: χ(2) = 3.43, p = 0.06; 2 vs. 3 BRFs: χ(2) = 6.05; p = 0.01). The study gives insight into the protective behavior of a population with inherent vulnerability during a global health emergency. It lays the foundation for follow-up research about the evolution of adherence to preventive measures as the pandemic progresses and about long-term behavioral changes. In addition, it can aide efforts in increasing preventive compliance by raising awareness of the added risk behavioral risk factors pose.","Mendoza-Jiménez, María-José; Hannemann, Tessa-Virginia; Atzendorf, Josefine",Front Public Health,610,20

We conducted a survey-based human behavioral study in Laikipia County, Kenya, which is characterized by a dynamic human-wildlife-livestock interface. Questionnaires that assessed human-animal interactions, sanitation, and illnesses experienced within the past year were distributed to 327 participants among five communities in Laikipia. This study aimed to 1) describe variation in reported high-risk behaviors by community type and 2) assess the relationship between specific behaviors and self-reported illnesses. Behavioral trends were assessed in R via Fisher’s exact tests. A generalized linear mixed model with Lasso penalization (GLMMLasso) was used to assess correlations between behaviors and participants’ self-reported illness within the past year, with reported behaviors as independent variables and reported priority symptoms as the outcome. Reported behaviors varied significantly among the study communities. Participants from one community (Pastoralist-1) were significantly more likely to report eating a sick animal in the past year (p< 0.001), collecting an animal found dead to sell in the past year (p<0.0001), and not having a designated location for human waste (p<0.0001) when compared to participants from other communities. The GLMMLasso revealed that reports of an ill person in the household in the past year was significantly associated with self-reported illness. Sixty-eight percent of participants reported that bushmeat is available within the communities. Our study demonstrates community-level variation in behaviors that may influence zoonotic pathogen exposure.

A post-operative radiograph forms part of the routine hip fracture pathway, although patients are often mobilised prior to this investigation. This study seeks to provide evidence for a pragmatic clinical change to optimise patient safety and allocate limited resources within the National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: We undertook a retrospective database review of 1563 HA procedures to assess whether the routine ordering of check radiographs played an important role in a patient’s post-operative care. RESULTS: 18 (1.2%) mechanical complications led to a return to theatre within 6 weeks of the index procedure. All were dislocations. Ten had a normal post-operative radiograph and five had documented suspicion of dislocation prior to radiography. The post-operative check radiograph was the sole identifier of dislocation in only three patients (0.2%). All three of these patients were pre-morbidly bed bound and non-communicative due to cognitive impairment (AMTS 0/10).

This study aims to present how government or policymakers could minimize the negative impacts of major incidents (pandemic) and speed up the process of recovery. It was also intended to identify effective strategies for crisis management. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed research method was applied. Qualitative research studies of interviews were used to collect primary data from the stakeholders while archival research method of textual and documental information was used for secondary data on the pandemic facts. Findings: The impacts of the governmental and enterprise actions with a focus on effective mega-crisis management strategies were structured based on the three themes, namely, appropriate measures, timely decisions and the role of the government. These strategies can minimize the destruction to the economy (or organization) while stabilize the emotional and psychological aspects of the people during the crisis and lead the society back on track once the crisis starts to diminish. Originality/value: The experience of Macao in successfully responding to the crisis of pandemic provides constructive references to policymakers on the set up of timely strategic plans and business management on remedy actions, particularly to regions where the pandemic is still out of control.","Im, UtLon Lam ChingChiCindia Ma ErDan",International Journal of Tourism Cities,610,33

Molecular studies on these molecules have shown that lncRNAs act as important regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, in both physiological and pathological conditions, yet cell functions of many of identified lncRNAs remain unknown. Here we summarize the achievements on lncRNAs studies including identification of lncRNA interactomes, structural studies and creating reporters for lncRNA activity. We also collect recent data on the involvement of lncRNAs in diseases, the clinical applications of these molecules and discuss major problems remaining the area of lncRNAs pointing future challenges. ABSTRACT: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been considered as unimportant additions to the transcriptome. Yet, in light of numerous studies, it has become clear that ncRNAs play important roles in development, health and disease. Long-ignored, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), ncRNAs made of more than 200 nucleotides have gained attention due to their involvement as drivers or suppressors of a myriad of tumours. The detailed understanding of some of their functions, structures and interactomes has been the result of interdisciplinary efforts, as in many cases, new methods need to be created or adapted to characterise these molecules. Unlike most reviews on lncRNAs, we summarize the achievements on lncRNA studies by taking into consideration the approaches for identification of lncRNA functions, interactomes, and structural arrangements. We also provide information about the recent data on the involvement of lncRNAs in diseases and present applications of these molecules, especially in medicine.","Borkiewicz, Lidia; Kalafut, Joanna; Dudziak, Karolina; Przybyszewska-Podstawka, Alicja; Telejko, Ilona",Cancers (Basel),610,1

METHODS: Implementing the DEcision-Aid for Lupus (IDEAL) study will put into practice a shared decision-making (SDM) strategy, using an individualized, culturally appropriate computerized decision-aid (DA) for lupus patients in 15 geographically diverse clinics in the USA. The overarching frameworks that guide this implementation study are the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Powell’s typology of implementation strategies. All 15 clinics will receive standardized capacity-building activities for lupus DA implementation in the clinic, including education, training, technical assistance, re-training, and incorporation of a clinic champion in the core team of each site. In addition, clinics will also choose among clinic-targeted activities to integrate the DA into existing work processes and/or patient-targeted activities to raise awareness and educate patients about the DA. These activities will be chosen to stimulate participant recruitment and retention activities that support the implementation of the DA at their clinic. In study aim 1, using surveys and semi-structured interviews with clinic personnel in 15 lupus clinics, we will assess stakeholder needs and identify clinic and contextual characteristics that inform the implementation strategy component selection and influence implementation effectiveness. Study aim 2 is to implement and assess the effectiveness of the IDEAL (standardized and tailored) strategy in 15 lupus clinics by examining the changes in our primary outcome of penetration, i.e., the proportion of all eligible patients in the clinic that receive the lupus DA, and secondary outcomes include DA appropriateness, acceptability, success, permanence, and feasibility. Study aim 3 is to identify ways to sustain and disseminate our lupus DA via semi-structured debriefing interviews with key clinic personnel and patients. DISCUSSION: The study will enroll at least 500 patient participants with lupus across all 15 sites and assess the effectiveness in implementing the DA in various clinic settings across the USA.

The morbidity and mortality of the disease among hypertensive patients in Africa have yet to be well described. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study all confirmed COVID-19 adult patients (≥18 years of age) in Lagos between February 27 to July 62,020 were included. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records of patients admitted at the COVID-19 isolation centers in Lagos. Outcomes included dying, being discharged after recovery or being evacuated/transferred. Descriptive statistics considered proportions, means and medians. The Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used in determining associations between variables. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were performed to quantify the risk of worse outcomes among hypertensives with COVID-19 and adjust for confounders. P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 2075 adults with COVID-19 were included in this study. The prevalence of hypertension, the most common comorbidity, was 17.8% followed by diabetes (7.2%) and asthma (2.0%). Overall mortality was 4.2% while mortality among the hypertensives was 13.7%. Severe symptoms and mortality were significantly higher among the hypertensives and survival rates were significantly lowered by the presence of additional comorbidity to 50% from 91% for those with hypertension alone and from 98% for all other patients (P < 0.001). After adjustment for confounders (age and sex), severe COVID-19and death were higher for hypertensives {severe/critical illness: HR = 2.41, P = 0.001, 95%CI = 1.4–4.0, death: HR = 2.30, P = 0.001, 95%CI = 1.2–4.6, for those with hypertension only} {severe/critical illness: HR = 3.76, P = 0.001, 95%CI = 2.1–6.4, death: crude HR = 6.63, P = 0.001, 95%CI = 3.4–1.6, for those with additional comorbidities}. Hypertension posed an increased risk of severe morbidity (approx. 4-fold) and death (approx. 7-fold) from COVID-19 in the presence of multiple comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The potential morbidity and mortality risks of hypertension especially with other comorbidities in COVID-19 could help direct efforts towards prevention and prognostication. This provides the rationale for improving preventive caution for people with hypertension and other comorbidities and prioritizing them for future antiviral interventions.

Thus, the present study assessed burnout among HCWs during the MERS outbreak to identify the influential factors involved in this process. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of the psychological tests and questionnaires completed by 171 hospital employees from two general hospitals that treated MERS patients. The tests included the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Positive Resources Test, the questionnaires assessed exposure to the MERS outbreak event and perceptions about MERS. RESULTS: Of the 171 HCWs, 112 (65.5%) experienced disengagement and 136 (79.5%) suffered from exhaustion. Disengagement was associated with lower levels of purpose and hope, a higher perception of job risk, and exposure to the media. Exhaustion was associated with lower levels of purpose and hope, a higher perception of little control of the infection, a higher perception of job risk, prior experience related to infections, and being female. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the risk and protective factors associated with burnout among HCWs during an outbreak of MERS. These findings should be considered when determining interventional strategies aimed at ameliorating burnout among HCWs.","Seo, Yae Eun; Kim, Hyun Chung; Yoo, So Young; Lee, Kang Uk; Lee, Hae Woo; Lee, So Hee",Psychiatry Investig,610,16

We aim to identify risk factors for, and outcomes of, BSI among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a severity matched case-control study (1:1 ratio) nested in a large multicenter prospective cohort of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Cases with BSI were identified from the cohort database. Controls were matched for age, sex, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. A Cox proportional hazard ratio model was performed. RESULTS: Of 2005 patients, 100 (4.98%) presented 142 episodes of BSI, mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 23 episodes. The median time from admission to the first episode of BSI was 15 days (IQR 9 - 20), and the most frequent source was catheter-related infection. The characteristics of patients with and without BSI were similar, including the use of tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and combinations. In the multivariate analysis, the use of these immunomodulatory drugs was not associated with an increased risk of BSI. A Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model showed that after adjusting for the time factor, BSI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality risk (HR 2.59 [1.65 – 4.07]; <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired BSI in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia was uncommon and the use of immunomodulatory drugs was not associated with its development. When adjusting for the time factor, BSI was associated with a higher mortality risk.","Abelenda-Alonso, Gabriela; Rombauts, Alexander; Gudiol, Carlota; Oriol, Isabel; Simonetti, Antonella; Coloma, Ana; Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro; Izquierdo, Elisenda; Díaz-Brito, Vicens; Sanmartí, Montserrat; Padullés, Ariadna; Grau, Inmaculada; Ras, M.

Here I model spatial locations as a type and the population mixing by intra- and inter-type mixing patterns. Using the theory of multi-type branching process, I calculate the expected number of new infections as a function of time. In 1-dimension the analysis is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of a tridiagonal Teoplitz matrix. In d-dimensions I take advantage of the graph cartesian product to construct the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the eigenvalue problem in 1-dimension. Using numerical simulations I uncover a transition from linear to multi-type mixing exponential growth with increasing the population size. Given that most countries are characterized by a network of cities with more than 100,000 habitants, I conclude that the multi-type mixing approximation should be the prevailing scenario.","Vazquez, A.",,610,16

Objectives: To determine the effects of lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) in the presence of elevated PPL on hemodynamics, left and right ventricular pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. We hypothesized that elevated PPL protects the cardiovascular system against high airway pressures and prevents lung overdistension. Methods: First, an interventional crossover trial in adult subjects with ARDS and BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (n=21) was performed to explore the hemodynamic consequences of LRM. Second, cardiovascular function was studied during low/high PEEPs in a model of swine with ARDS and high PPL (n=9) versus healthy swine with normal PPL (n=6). Measurements and Main Results: Subjects with ARDS and obesity (BMI=57±12 kg/m2), following LRM, required an increase in PEEP of 8[7, 10] cmH2O above traditional ARDSnet settings to improve lung function, oxygenation and ventilation/perfusion matching, without impairment of hemodynamics or right heart function. ARDS swine with high PPL demonstrated unchanged transmural left ventricle pressure and systemic blood pressure after LRM protocol. Pulmonary artery hypertension decreased 8[13, 4] mmHg, as did vascular resistance 1.5[2.2, 0.9] WU, and transmural right ventricle pressure 10[15, 6] mmHg during exhalation. LRM and PEEP decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and normalized ventilation/perfusion ratio. Conclusions: High airway pressure is required to recruit lung atelectasis in patients with ARDS and class III obesity but causes minimal overdistension. Additionally, patients with ARDS and class III obesity tolerate hemodynamically LRM with high airway pressure.","De Santis Santiago, Roberta; Teggia Droghi, Maddalena; Fumagalli, Jacopo; Marrazzo, Francesco; Florio, Gaetano; Grassi, Luigi G; Gomes, Susimeire; Morais, Caio C A; Ramos, Ozires P S; Bottiroli, Maurizio; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Imber, David A; Bagchi, Aranya; Shelton, Kenneth; Sonny, Abraham; Bittner, Edward A; Amato, Marcelo B P; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Am. j. respir. crit. care med,610,1

In India, the outbreak, starts on 2 nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 12 th November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period.

We conducted a Google Trends search using keywords related to pet adoption. Relative search volume (RSV) was scored between 0 and 100 for the lowest and the highest, respectively. Top countries contributing to the dataset included Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia. From 2015 through 2020, the worldwide RSV for the categories of pet, dog and cat adoption peaked between April and May 2020, the early epidemic phase of the pandemic. These were significantly higher than the 5-year worldwide average RSV for all three categories (P = 0.001). Comparing to the same period in 2019, the RSV ratio (2020/2019) for both dog and cat adoption increased by up to 250%. Nonetheless, the RSV for dog adoption has been decreasing since July 2020 and returned to the 5-year average by December 2020. In contrast, the interest in cat adoption remained sustainably high, possibly reflecting the feline acclimation to indoor living. In conclusion, the global interest in pet adoptions surged in the early phase of the pandemic but not sustainable. With the launch of COVID-19 vaccines, there is a concern for separation anxiety and possible abandonment of these newly adopted pets when the owners would leave their homes for work in the future.","Ho, Jeffery; Hussain, Sabir; Sparagano, Olivier",Front Vet Sci,610,1

Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and PE suspicion who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were also analysed. METHODS: A retrospective study from March 18, 2020, until April 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. CTPA features were evaluated and severity scores, presence, and localisation of PE were reported. d-dimer and IL-6 determinations, ICU admission, and previous antithrombotic treatment were registered. RESULTS: Forty-seven PE suspicions with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with PE with a predominant segmental distribution. Statistically significant differences were found in the highest d-dimer determination in patients with PE and ICU admission regarding elevated IL-6 values. CONCLUSION: PE in COVID-19 patients in our series might predominantly affect segmental arteries and the right lung. Results suggest that the higher the d-dimer concentration, the greater the likelihood of PE. Both assumptions should be assessed in future studies with a larger sample size. KEY POINTS: • On CT pulmonary angiography, pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients seems to be predominantly distributed in segmental arteries of the right lung, an assumption that needs to be approached in future research. • Only the highest intraindividual determination of d-dimer from admission to CT scan seems to differentiate patients with pulmonary embolism from patients with a negative CTPA. However, interindividual variability calls for future studies to establish cut-off values in COVID-19 patients. • Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether the presence of PE could increase the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in COVID-19 patients.","Espallargas, Irene; Rodríguez Sevilla, Juan José; Rodríguez Chiaradía, Diego Agustín; Salar, Antonio; Casamayor, Guillem; Villar-Garcia, Judit; Rodó-Pin, Anna; Marsico, Salvatore; Carbullanca, Santiago; Ramal, Diego; del Carpio, Luis Alexander; Gayete, Ángel; Maiques, José María; Zuccarino, Flavio",Eur Radiol,610,30

To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically ‘controlled’ fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by ‘orderly’ phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity. Our work represents a major resource for understanding the lung-localised immunity and inflammation landscape during COVID-19.","Wauters, Els; Van Mol, Pierre; Garg, Abhishek D.; Jansen, Sander; Van Herck, Yannick; Vanderbeke, Lore; Bassez, Ayse; Boeckx, Bram; Malengier-Devlies, Bert; Timmerman, Anna; Van Brussel, Thomas; Van Buyten, Tina; Schepers, Rogier; Heylen, Elisabeth; Dauwe, Dieter; Dooms, Christophe; Gunst, Jan; Hermans, Greet; Meersseman, Philippe; Testelmans, Dries; Yserbyt, Jonas; Matthys, Patrick; Tejpar, Sabine; Neyts, Johan; Wauters, Joost; Qian, Junbin; Lambrechts, Diether",bioRxiv,610,15

The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: “On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?” Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic.

Thromboprophylaxis is mainly performed with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) and, in some specific patients, with Unfractionated Heparin (UFH). These intensive units are an environment where individual patient variability is extreme and where traditional antithrombotic protocols are frequently ineffective. This was known for a long time, but the hospitalization of many patients with COVID-19 inflammatory storms suddenly highlighted this knowledge. It is therefore reasonable to propose variable antithrombotic prevention protocols based initially on a series of individual criteria (weight, BMI, and thrombotic risks). Secondly, they should be adjusted by the monitoring of anticoagulant activity, preferably by measuring the anti-Xa activity. However, we still face unresolved questions, such as once- or twice-daily LMWH injections, monitoring at the peak and/or trough, and poorly defined therapeutic targets. Equally surprisingly, we observed a lack of standardization of the anti-Xa activity kits.","Cauchie, Philippe; Piagnerelli, Michael",Biomedicines,610,2

Nevertheless, in late November an abrupt increase in hospitalizations and deaths hit Manaus, causing higher number of deaths compared to the first epidemic wave. It has been hypothesized that virus lineages circulating in the second wave, namely the P.1 variant of concern first detected in early December in Manaus, could be better at evading immunity generated in response to previous infection with other lineages. In order to estimate the reinfection rate during the resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, we tested serial samples from 238 unvaccinated repeat blood donors using a SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG chemiluminescence microparticle assay. Blood donors were divided into six groups that reflected the inferred sequence of infection and reinfection with non-P.1 and P.1 variants. We assumed that reinfections induce a recrudescence (or boosting) of plasma anti-N IgG antibody levels, yielding a V-shaped time series of antibody reactivity levels. We infer that 16.9% (95% CI [9.48%, 28.5%]) of all presumed P.1 infections that were observed in 2021 were reinfections. If we also include cases of probable or possible reinfections (defined by considering the time period when the antibody levels are expected to grow after recovery and the range of half-lives for antibody waning after seroconversion), these percentages increase respectively to 25.8% (95% CI [16.7%, 37.4%]), and 31.0% (95% CI [21.4%, 42.5%]).

Methods In this report we present two cases of older adults with no past psychiatric history who developed panic disorder after recovering from COVID-19. Results Patient A is a 51-year-old Haitian American woman who was admitted to inpatient psychiatry with symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, disorganized behavior, and suicidal ideation, as well as intermittent hypertensive episodes. After discharge, the hypertensive episodes persisted and were associated with feelings of impending doom, palpitations, and shortness of breath. While undergoing blood pressure management from her cardiologist, she was admitted to outpatient psychiatry, diagnosed with panic disorder, and tried on multiple medications (Mirtazapine, Trazodone, Hydroxyzine, Escitalopram, Sertraline). None of these medications relieved her symptoms, which gradually evolved from panic/anxiety/depression to derealization/depersonalization. Eventually, all her symptoms abated without medication. Patient B is a 61-year-old African American woman who was admitted to outpatient psychiatry with episodes of chest tightness, palpitations, and trembling, as well as insomnia and depressed mood; she too was diagnosed with panic disorder. She had previously been treated by her primary care doctor and in the emergency room with various benzodiazepines (Diazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam), but she was eventually stabilized on a regimen of Sertraline, Trazodone, and Gabapentin. Conclusions Here we examine the rationale and effectiveness of various medication trials for COVID-19-induced panic disorder, as well as how psychosocial risk factors may predict the course of illness. We also discuss some hypothesized mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 could produce neuropsychiatric sequelae (e.g. direct viral injury, cytokine storm, molecular mimicry). These mechanisms could affect both peripheral and central nervous systems, resulting in the combination of autonomic instability and mood disturbance classically associated with panic disorder.

Captive cervid farming is an emerging industry in Florida, an HD-enzootic region. Morbidity and mortality due to HD are major concerns among deer farmers, but the impact of HD on Florida’s cervid farming industry is unknown. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) among WTD submitted to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Cervidae Health Research Initiative (CHeRI) for post-mortem diagnostics. Our secondary objectives were to identify the predominant circulating EHDV serotypes during each sampling year and to determine the age class with the greatest proportion of EHDV- and BTV-positive post-mortem specimens. From 2016 to 2020, spleen samples from 539 farmed WTD with unexplained mortality were tested for the presence of EHDV and BTV by RT-qPCR. Overall, the prevalence of EHDV, BTV, or EHDV/BTV coinfection was 26%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, and 44% of deer (237/539) were diagnosed with HD by RT-qPCR. The predominant circulating EHDV serotype varied by year. Overall, EHDV-2 was the most commonly identified serotype (55% of PCR-positive cases), and EHDV-1 was the least frequently identified serotype (16% of PCR-positive cases). The greatest proportion of EHDV/BTV positives among mortality cases was observed in young WTD aged 3–6 months (50%–82% positive). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of EHDV/BTV by age when comparing specimens from WTD over 1 year old (p = 0.029, n = 527). Among these samples, the number of reported mortalities and the prevalence of EHDV/BTV were highest in yearling animals (56%). These data provide the first estimate of EHDV and BTV prevalence and virus serotypes among farmed WTD in Florida, identify the WTD age groups with the greatest proportions of EHDV- and BTV-positive specimens, and suggest that HD caused by these two viruses may be a major source of mortality challenging the captive cervid farming industry in Florida.","Cottingham, Sydney L.; White, Zoe S.; Wisely, Samantha M.; Campos-Krauer, Juan M.",Viruses,610,28

The majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection present with mild or asymptomatic course of the disease. Some cases were hospitalized, and few needed intensive care unit admission, or mechanical ventilation. There have also been scarce case reports where neonates required mechanical ventilation post COVID-19 pregnancies. Without approved therapies other than dexamethasone, advanced mesenchymal cell therapy is one immunomodulatory therapeutic approach that is currently explored and might hold great promise. We suggest that the circulating fetal stem cells might have an immune-protective effect to mothers and contribute to the often mild and even asymptomatic post-COVID-19 pregnancies. Thus, COVID-19 pregnancies come forth as a paradigm to be further and more comprehensively approached, to understand both the mechanism and action of circulating stem cells in immunoprotection and hypoxia in microcirculation.","Samara, Athina; Herlenius, Eric",Front Physiol,610,23

Among Hispanic populations, lack of access to testing sites has resulted in delayed time to diagnosis, risking increased spread within high-risk communities. The accessibility and expertise of community pharmacists support expanded pharmacist roles in public health and pandemic response, including point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing. Objective To determine the local impact of community pharmacist-provided COVID-19 testing among a majority-Hispanic, lower income population during the early COVID-19 pandemic, as assessed via a patient satisfaction survey. Methods A 10-question Likert-type questionnaire was administered in English and Spanish to patients who received a pharmacist-provided POC COVID-19 test at a large-chain community pharmacy in Arizona between 5/1/20 and 6/14/20. Questions surrounded patient perceptions of the testing process and subsequent pharmacist counselling on their test results. Results At total of 622 patients completed the survey (94.1% participation rate among successful contacts, representing 28.3% of all eligible patients). The mean age was 42 years, 51% were female, and 64% of patients identified as Hispanic. Over 97% of surveyed patients either agreed or strongly agreed that receiving a pharmacist-provided COVID-19 test at a community pharmacy was a comfortable experience, expanded their access to care, and allowed them to receive their test results in a timely manner. Additionally, over half of surveyed patients “did not know” where they would have alternatively sought testing if the community testing site was not available. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated highly favorable patient perceptions of pharmacist-provided POC testing for COVID-19, with over 99% of surveyed patients satisfied with their testing experience. Conclusion Among patients in a lower-income majority-Hispanic community, pharmacist-provided POC testing services for COVID-19 were well-received and expanded patient access to testing during the early pandemic.","Patel, Janelle; Christofferson, Nikki; Goodlet, Kellie J.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),610,5

METHODS: We collected 1777 responses from pregnant women through an online survey. Using the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), we calculated the percentage of pregnant women above the cutoff (≥ 13), and the factor scores of anhedonia, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors and socioeconomic characteristics correlated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The point prevalence of pregnant women with an EPDS score of ≥ 13 was 17%. The mean scores were 0.73, 3.68, and 1.82 for anhedonia, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The probability of becoming above the cutoff score positively correlated with the cancellation of planned informal support, higher perceived risk for infection of COVID-19, difficulties in household finances, and lack of social support. Moreover, being younger, less wealthy, unemployed, and without a partner showed a significantly higher possibility of having a score above the cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high percentage of pregnant women with depressive symptoms.

This burdens the COVID-19 treatment gap, thereby requiring accelerated discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This study explored the potential of anti-HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) phytochemicals as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (nsps) by targeting in silico key sites in the structures of SARS-CoV-2 nsps. One hundred four anti-HIV phytochemicals were subjected to molecular docking with nsp3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Top compounds in complex with the nsps were investigated further through molecular dynamics. The drug-likeness and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties of the top compounds were also predicted using SwissADME. Their toxicity was likewise determined using OSIRIS Property Explorer. RESULTS: Among the top-scoring compounds, the polyphenolic functionalized natural products comprised of biflavones 1, 4, 11, 13, 14, 15; ellagitannin 9; and bisisoquinoline alkaloid 19 were multi-targeting and exhibited strongest binding affinities to at least two nsps (binding energy = − 7.7 to − 10.8 kcal/mol). The top ligands were stable in complex with their target nsps as determined by molecular dynamics. Several top-binding compounds were computationally druggable, showed good gastrointestinal absorptive property, and were also predicted to be non-toxic. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty anti-HIV RT phytochemicals showed multi-targeting inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Our results highlight the importance of polyhydroxylated aromatic substructures for effective attachment in the binding/catalytic sites of nsps involved in post-translational mechanism pathways. As such with the nsps playing vital roles in viral pathogenesis, our findings provide inspiration for the design and discovery of novel anti-COVID-19 drug prototypes.

In this study, we present a unique complication of this disease. PRESENTATION OF CASES: (A) A 65-year-old woman with a known case of COVID-19; on the second day of admission, the patient presented sudden tachycardia and hypogastric pain; on abdomen physical examination, a huge lower abdominal tender mass was noticed. (B) A 50-year-old woman with COVID-19, 4 days after admission, started complaining of tachycardia, pain, and mass in the lower abdomen. On abdomen physical examination, a huge lower abdominal tender mass was noticed. Both of the patients underwent an abdomen CT scan which confirmed a huge rectus sheath hematoma (RSH). Both of the patients underwent angioembolization of the inferior epigastric artery. The patient recovered completely and no evidence of further expansion was seen after 2 weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Hemorrhagic issues in COVID-19 patients remain poorly understood. Physicians should discuss risks of RSH in patients where continuous anticoagulation therapy will be reinstated. With increased clinician awareness of the need for RSH screening in COVID-19 patients with acute abdominal pain, the interprofessional team of healthcare providers can maximize patient safety and reduce hospitalization time, especially in high-risk patients at risk for unnecessary surgery.

Genetic deletion of TPCs not only affects endocytosis, recycling, and degradation of various surface receptors but also uptake and impact of bacterial protein toxins and entry and intracellular processing of some types of viruses. This review points to important examples of these trafficking defects on one part but mainly focuses on the resulting impact of the TPC inactivation on receptor expression and receptor signaling. Thus, a detailed RNA sequencing analysis using TPC1-deficient fibroblasts uncovered a multitude of changes in the expression levels of surface receptors and their pathway-related signaling proteins.

Major components of rabies elimination programs leading to these successes have been constant and regular surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, vital measures to control COVID-19 have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. We aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics to create a conceptual framework for how different disruptions may affect rabies virus transmission. We parameterized the model for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, a city with active rabies virus transmission. We examined our results over a range of plausible values for R(0) (1.36–2.0). Also, we prospectively evaluated surveillance data during the pandemic to detect temporal changes. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies within months. These results were consistent over all plausible values of R(0). Surveillance data from late 2020 and early 2021 confirms that in Arequipa, Peru, rabies cases are on an increasing trajectory. The rising rabies trends in Arequipa, if indicative to the region as whole, suggest that the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies may be in jeopardy.","Raynor, Brinkley; Díaz, Elvis W.; Shinnick, Julianna; Zegarra, Edith; Monroy, Ynes; Mena, Claudia; De la Puente-León, Micaela; Levy, Michael Z.; Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,610,20

Method: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y León. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. Results: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province. Conclusions: Although the observed increase in mortality cannot be totally attributed to the disease, it is the best estimate we have of the real impact on deaths directly or indirectly related to it. The number of declared deaths only reaches two thirds of the increase in mortality observed.","Sangrador, Carlos Ochoa; Ramón Garmendia Leiza, José; Boillos, María José Pérez; Ara, Fernando Pastrana; Lobato, María del Pilar Lorenzo; de Llano, Jesús María Andrés",Gaceta sanitaria,610,16

Levels of exposure to contaminated water were estimated though social surveys. Follow-up was also conducted to estimate the incidence of disease associated with bathing in the estuary. Pathogen levels exceeded the guideline values recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at most locations throughout the year. The social survey provided information about exposure of the population in age groups. Only 31% of the recreational users belonged to the healthy adult group upon which the WHO quantitative microbial risk assessment model is based. A correlation was established between microbial water quality and incidence of respiratory diseases for children as well as for adults. Exposure to recreational water increased the incidence of respiratory illnesses for the whole population almost by a factor 2. Behaviours which resulted in increased exposures were associated with increased incidence of illnesses were observed, particularly among children aged 11–15yr, who exhibited the highest odd ratio (OR 4.23 [2.44–6.01], CI 95%, p = 0.05 ). There is a need for combining epidemiology studies with risk assessment processes and complementing them with social surveys for understanding the risk of recreational activities to public health.","Lepesteur, Muriel; McComb, Arthur J.; Moore, Susan A.",Water Research,610,1

Recently, we have identified a series of such structures with GalNAc rather than the more common galactose capping the antennae of hybrid and complex glycans. As part of a series of publications describing the negative ion fragmentation of different types of N-glycan, this paper describes their CID spectra and estimated nitrogen cross sections recorded by travelling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS). Most of the glycans were derived from the recombinant glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), recombinantly derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cells. Twenty-six GalNAc-capped hybrid and complex N-glycans were identified by a combination of TWIMS, negative ion CID, and exoglycosidase digestions. They were present as the neutral glycans and their sulfated and α2→3-linked sialylated analogues. Overall, negative ion fragmentation of glycans generates fingerprints that reveal their structural identity.","Harvey, David J.; Behrens, Anna-Janina; Crispin, Max; Struwe, Weston B.",Anal Bioanal Chem,610,4

Our objective was to determine the risk factors for 28-days mortality in patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 compared to those who did not, who were admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. RESULTS: We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes, and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the administration of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the hospital might be associated with improved outcomes.","Salazar, Martín R.; González, Soledad E.; Regairaz, Lorena; Ferrando, Noelia S.; González Martínez, Verónica V.; Carrera Ramos, Patricia M.; Muñoz, Laura; Pesci, Santiago A.; Vidal, Juan M.; Kreplak, Nicolás; Estenssoro, Elisa",PLoS One,610,16

Early studies of GR signaling led to broad acceptance of models in which glucocorticoid receptor (GR) monomers tether repressively to inflammatory transcription factors, thus abrogating inflammatory gene expression. However, newer data challenge this core concept and present an exciting opportunity to reframe our understanding of GR signaling. Here, we present an alternate, two-part model for transcriptional repression by glucocorticoids. First, widespread GR-mediated induction of transcription results in rapid, primary repression of inflammatory gene transcription and associated enhancers through competition-based mechanisms. Second, a subset of GR-induced genes, including targets that are regulated in coordination with inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB, exerts secondary repressive effects on inflammatory gene expression. Within this framework, emerging data indicate that the gene set regulated through the cooperative convergence of GR and NF-κB signaling is central to the broad clinical effectiveness of glucocorticoids in terminating inflammation and promoting tissue repair.","Gerber, Anthony N.; Newton, Robert; Sasse, Sarah K.",J Biol Chem,610,1

Political limitations such as school closure may affect the treatment behavior of pediatric asthma. To investigate the trends of treatment behavior in the field of pediatrics during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study using Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database. We identified children with asthma aged 15 years or younger who were patients from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020. The main outcome was a comparison between asthma patients treatment behavior before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We statistically tested the admission volume changes based on the discharge date after adjusting for seasonality through a Fourier term using an interrupted time-series analysis (ITS). ResultsWe identified 10,481 inpatients cases in 67 hospitals and 258,911 out-patients cases in 180 hospitals who were diagnosed with asthma. We performed ITS analysis for inpatients. The reduction in the number of patients during this period was estimated to be 232 (P=0.001). In addition, ITS analysis was performed for patients aged <3 years. The reduced number of patients during this period was estimated to be 155 (P<0.001). ConclusionsWe found that the number of pediatric asthma patients dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to continue research into the trends of pediatric asthma patients after the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Key MessagesThere are increasingly available data on the relationship between adults asthma and COVID-19. However, in the fields of pediatrics, limited data are available. Patients with moderate to severe asthma who needed hospitalization dramatically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, doctors prescribed nebulizers more than metered-dose inhalers by the clinical guideline recommendation. Our findings reinforce the value of political inventions, such as school closure reduced the number of asthma attacks in infants and school-age children.","Bun, Seiko; Kishimoto, Kenji; Shin, Jung-ho; Takada, Daisuke; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",,610,21

Herein, we report the case of a patient with Parkinson disease who developed severe and prolonged oropharyngeal dysphagia after a coronavirus disease 2019 infection. A 73-yr-old male patient with Parkinson disease was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 and admitted to a tertiary care hospital. Before hospitalization, he was assessed at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 and showed no symptoms of dysphagia. After admission, the patient gradually recovered; however, he was fed through a nasogastric tube. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed a severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with a severely delayed oral phase. Therefore, he underwent percutaneous gastrostomy tube insertion. After discharge, although he received swallowing therapy for 4 mos, he still had severe dysphagia, which made him dependent on enteral feeding. We speculate that the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on dopaminergic and nondopaminergic mechanisms could lead to the development of dysphagia in this patient. The present case suggests that clinicians must have a high index of suspicion without dismissing the possibility of dysphagia and subsequent aspiration pneumonia in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with Parkinson disease.","Lee, Min-Yong; Oh, Byung-Mo; Seo, Han Gil",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,610,30

Criticisms include claims that too much research addresses well-trodden questions and that the field has failed to gain public and policy traction. Qualitative studies have found researchers partly attribute these challenges to fragmentation resulting from disciplinary and methodological differences. Yet, empirical investigation (‘research on research’) is limited. This study addresses this gap, employing mixed-methods to examine, at scale, how and why this field is defined by insular research clusters. First, bibliometric analysis identifies and visualises the 250 most-connected authors. Next, an algorithm was used to identify clustering via citation links between authors. We used researcher profiling to ascertain authors’ geographical and institutional locations and disciplinary training, examining how this mapped onto clusters. Finally, causes of siloing were investigated via semi-structured interviews with 45 researchers. The resulting ‘atlas’ of health inequalities and health disparities research identifies eight clusters of authors with varying degrees of connectedness. No single factor neatly describes observed fragmentation, health equity scholars exhibit a diverse disciplinary backgrounds, and geographical, institutional, and historical factors appear to intersect to explain siloed citation patterns. While the configuration of research activity within clusters potentially helps render questions scientifically manageable, it affirms perceptions of the field as fragmented. We draw on Thomas Kuhn and Sheila Jasanoff to position results within theoretical pictures of scientific progress. Newcomers to the field can use our findings to orient themselves within the many streams of health equity scholarship, and existing health equity scholars can use the atlas to move beyond existing geo-disciplinary networks. However, although stronger cross-cluster engagement would be likely to improve insights, the complex nexus of factors underlying the field’s structure will likely make this challenging in practice.","Collyer, Taya A.; Smith, Katherine E.",Soc Sci Med,610,27

Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin‐angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif‐Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif‐Askari, Fatemeh; Alabed, Mashael; Tayoun, Ahmad Abou; Loney, Tom; Uddin, Mohammed; Senok, Abiola; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamoudi, Rifat; Kashour, Tarek; Alsheikh‐Ali, Alawi; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Clin Transl Sci,610,24

These studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have a consistent chemokine signature comprising cytokines and monocyte-associated chemokines (CCL2 and CCL8). Therefore, it appears that monocyte cytokine production, particularly in those with a diminished innate immunity, is a driving feature of COVID-19 infection.","Thoutam, Akshaya; Breitzig, Mason; Lockey, Richard; Kolliputi, Narasaiah",J Cell Commun Signal,610,12

While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present study’s aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing. METHODS: In this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients’ evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients’ and therapists’ ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides’ experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding session flow, post-session positivity, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were observed. The only exception was that telepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that may decline over time, especially in the videoconferencing group. Patients and therapists identified similar facilitating and complicating aspects, but differed in their emphasis of specific elements. CONCLUSIONS: Both settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.

Treatment of MRONJ is considered primarily conservative with oral mouth rinses and antibiotics but may demand surgery, depending on the complaints and general condition of the patient, the extent of the necrosis, and the overall prognosis with respect to the underlying disease. A 77 year old female patient with invasive ductal breast cancer and bone metastases was treated with intravenous bisphosphonate (BP) zoledronic acid. During therapy, she developed MRONJ in the mandible with severe pain. Clinical examination revealed confluent exposed bone of the lower left jaw and a fistula at the right molar region. The panoramic radiograph revealed a mandibular osseous involvement with diffuse radiopaque areas between radiolucent areas. For preoperative planning, (18)F-fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) of the jaw was performed, showing substantially increased (18)F-fluoride uptake in regions 38 to 47 of the mandible with a focal gap in region 36 (area of clinically exposed bone). CT revealed medullary sclerosis and cortical thickening with confluent periosteal reaction and focal cortical erosion in the regions 37 to 42, whereas the regions 43 to 47 were only subtly sclerotic without cortical thickening. After systemic antibiotic therapy with sultamicillin following significant symptom and pain relief, (18)F-fluoride PET/CT imaging was performed again after 5 months. No changes in either CT and PET were observed in regions 38 to 42, whereas the bony sclerosis was slightly increased in regions 43 to 47 with a slight reduction of (18)F-fluoride uptake. (18)F-fluoride PET/CT showed no significant changes assessing the extent of MRONJ prior and after systemic antibiotic therapy, providing no evidence that conservative treatment reduced the extent of the MRONJ-affected jawbone. The additional information of (18)F-fluoride PET enables to identify the true extent of MRONJ which may be underestimated by CT imaging alone. Patients with MRONJ undergoing conservative treatment could benefit because additional imaging may be avoided as the pre-therapeutic (18)F-fluoride PET/CT delivers all information needed for further treatment. Our findings support the recommendation of a surgical approach as long-term antibiotics cannot downsize the extent of MRONJ.","Reinert, Christian Philipp; Pfannenberg, Christina; Gatidis, Sergios; la Fougère, Christian; Nikolaou, Konstantin; Hoefert, Sebastian",Front Oncol,610,20

Excessive complement and IFN-γ-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-γ producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-γ+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5–7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","McGregor, Reuben; Chauss, Daniel; Freiwald, Tilo; Yan, Bingyu; Wang, Luopin; Nova-Lamperti, Estefania; Zhang, Zonghao; Teague, Heather; West, Erin E; Bibby, Jack; Kelly, Audrey; Malik, Amna; Freeman, Alexandra F; Schwartz, Daniella; Portilla, Didier; John, Susan; Lavender, Paul; Lionakis, Michail S; Mehta, Nehal N; Kemper, Claudia; Cooper, Nichola; Lombardi, Giovanna; Laurence, Arian; Kazemian, Majid; Afzali, Behdad",bioRxiv,610,28

However, little is known about risk factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan. EXPOSURES: Demographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment), the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma related to COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score ≥13. RESULTS: Among 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17–2.16; P=0.003), ages 15–29 (aOR compared with ages 45–59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64–3.38; P<0.001), low income (aOR compared with intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16–2.49; P=0.007), providing caregiving to family members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51–8.56; P<0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81–8.59; P<0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55–2.48; P<0.001) were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Among women aged 15–29 years, who experienced the highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with a higher rate of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Economic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent worldwide regulatory guidance for pharmaceutical industry trials has allowed discussion of alternatives to the ITT approach to analysis; different treatment effects can be considered which may be more clinically meaningful and more relevant to patients and prescribers. The key concept is of a trial “estimand”, a precise description of the estimated treatment effect. The strategy chosen to account for patients who discontinue treatment or take alternative medications which are not part of the randomised treatment regimen are important determinants of this treatment effect. One strategy to account for these events is treatment policy, which corresponds to an ITT approach. Alternative equally valid strategies address what the treatment effect is if the patient actually takes the treatment or does not use specific alternative medication. There is no single right answer to which strategy is most appropriate, the solution depends on the key clinical question of interest. The estimands framework discussed in the new guidance has been particularly useful in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and has clarified what choices are available to account for the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials. Specifically, an ITT approach addresses a treatment effect that may not be generalisable beyond the current pandemic.","Keene, Oliver N.; Wright, David; Phillips, Alan; Wright, Melanie",Contemp Clin Trials,610,14

STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective longitudinal study, 18 children were sampled biweekly for respiratory pathogens, irrespective of respiratory symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for 13 respiratory pathogens. Episodes were defined “asymptomatic” if no symptoms of any respiratory tract illness were present between 1 week before and 1 week after sampling. RESULTS: A total of 230 samples were collected. In 56% of the symptomatic episodes, a pathogen was detected, compared with 40% of the asymptomatic episodes (P = .03). Rhinovirus and coronaviruses were most prevalent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes. In the youngest children, 9% of the pathogen-positive episodes were asymptomatic, compared with 36% in the oldest children (P = .01).

Abstract Introduction: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a radical reorganization of healthcare resources. Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. Patients and methods: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. Results: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","Álvarez Gallego, M; Gortázar de las Casas, S; Pascual Migueláñez, I; Rubio-Pérez, I; Barragán Serrano, C; Álvarez Peña, E; Díaz Domínguez, J",Cir Esp,610,21

We therefore extend current evidence on the relationships between NH quality and resident COVID-19 infection rates and deaths, taking into account NH structural characteristics and community characteristics. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting and Participants 15,390 Medicaid/Medicare-certified nursing homes. Methods We obtained and merged the following data sets: (1) COVID-19 weekly data reported by each nursing home to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), (2) CMS Five Star Quality Rating System, (3) county-level COVID-19 case counts, (4) county-level population data, and (5) county-level socio-demographic data. Results Among 1-star NHs, there were an average of 13.19 cases and 2.42 deaths per 1,000 residents per week between May 25 and December 20, 2020. Among 5-star NHs, there were an average of 9.99 cases and 1.83 deaths per 1,000 residents per week. The rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 31% higher among 1-star NHs compared to 5-star NHs (Model 1: IRR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.23-1.39), and the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 30% higher (IRR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.41). These associations were only partially explained by differences in community spread of COVID-19, case mix, and the for-profit status and size of NHs. Conclusions and Implications We found that COVID-19 case and death rates were substantially higher among NHs with lower star ratings, suggesting that NHs with quality much below average are more susceptible to the spread of COVID-19. This relationship – particularly with regard to case rates – can be partially attributed to external factors: lower-rated NHs are often located in areas with greater COVID-19 community spread, and serve more socioeconomically vulnerable residents than higher-rated NHs.","Khairat, Saif; Zalla, Lauren C.; Adler-Milstein, Julia; Kistler, Christine",J Am Med Dir Assoc,610,16

In addition to community-acquired infections, nosocomial infections are also a major social concern. The likelihood of environmental contamination and transmission of the virus based on disease severity is unknown. Methods We collected nasopharyngeal, environmental and air samples from patients with COVID-19 admitted to the National Centre for Global Health and Medicine between January 29th and February 29th, 2020. The patients were classified by severity of disease. The collected samples were tested using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). Results SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in a subset of 11 air samples. Of the 141 environmental samples collected from three patient bays and two single rooms, four samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. Detections were made on the surface of a stethoscope used in the care of a patient with severe disease, on the intubation tube of a patient classified as critical (and on ventilator management), and on the surface of a gown worn by the nurse providing care. Conclusions Regardless of the patients’ disease severity, SARS-CoV-2 was detected on very few environmental surfaces. However, detection of SARS-CoV-2 on stethoscopes used in the care of multiple patients and on the surface of gowns worn by clinical staff indicates that medical devices may be linked to the spread of infection.","Nakamura, Keiji; Morioka, Shinichiro; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Iida, Shun; Suzuki, Tadaki; Kinoshita, Noriko; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Sugiki, Yuko; Okuhama, Ayako; Kanda, Kohei; Wakimoto, Yuji; Ujiie, Mugen; Yamamoto, Kei; Ishikane, Masahiro; Moriyama, Yuki; Ota, Masayuki; Nakamoto, Takato; Ide, Satoshi; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Akiyama, Yutaro; Miyazato, Yusuke; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Saito, Sho; Ohmagari, Norio",Infection prevention in practice,610,28

We analyzed tumor and paired normal tissue samples from CRC patients (n = 22) whom underwent tumor resection surgery. We assessed 39 inflammation-involved biomolecules (multiplex magnetic bead-based immunoassay), CEA and CA19-9 (ELISA assay) and the tissue expression levels of occludin and also pErk, STAT1 and STAT3 transcriptional factors (western blot). Tumor staging has been established by histopathological evaluation of HE stained tumor tissue sections. We report 32 biomarkers displaying statistically significant differences in tumor vs. control. Additionally, positive statistical biomarker correlations were found between MMP2–IL8 and BAFF–IL8 (Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.751), while APRIL–MMP2, APRIL–BAFF and APRIL–IL8 were negatively correlated (correlation coefficients < − 0.650). While APRIL, BAFF, IL8 and MMP2 did not modulate with tumor stage, they were inversely related to the immune infiltrate level and CD163 tissue expression. We conclude that the significantly decreased APRIL and increased BAFF, IL8 and MMP2 expression were tumor-specific and deserve consideration in the development of new treatments. Also, the positive correlation between Chitinase 3-like 1 and IL8 (0.57) or MMP2 (0.50) suggest a role in tumor growth and metastasis pathways.","Calu, Valentin; Ionescu, Adriana; Stanca, Loredana; Geicu, Ovidiu Ionut; Iordache, Florin; Pisoschi, Aurelia Magdalena; Serban, Andreea Iren; Bilteanu, Liviu",Sci Rep,610,1

Consequently, guidelines on their use vary depending on specific patient populations. METHODS: The study population was drawn from the COPE Study (COVID-19 in Older People), a multicentre observational cohort study, across the UK and Italy. Data were collected between 27 February and 28 April 2020 by trained data-collectors and included all unselected consecutive admissions with COVID-19. Load (name/number of medications) and dosage of immunosuppressant were collected along with other covariate data. Primary outcome was time-to-mortality from the date of admission (or) date of diagnosis, if diagnosis was five or more days after admission. Secondary outcomes were Day-14 mortality and time-to-discharge. Data were analysed with mixed-effects, Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models using non-users of immunosuppressants as the reference group. RESULTS: In total 1184 patients were eligible for inclusion. The median (IQR) age was 74 (62–83), 676 (57%) were male, and 299 (25.3%) died in hospital (total person follow-up 15,540 days). Most patients exhibited at least one comorbidity, and 113 (~10%) were on immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased mortality: aHR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.69 (time to mortality) and aOR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01–2.88 (14-day mortality). There also appeared to be a dose–response relationship. CONCLUSION: Despite possible indication bias, until further evidence emerges we recommend adhering to public health measures, a low threshold to seek medical advice and close monitoring of symptoms in those who take immunosuppressants routinely regardless of their indication. However, it should be noted that the inability to control for the underlying condition requiring immunosuppressants is a major limitation, and hence caution should be exercised in interpretation of the results. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Regular Use of Immune Suppressing Drugs is Associated with Increased Risk of Death in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19 Background: We do not have much information on how the COVID-19 virus affects patients who use immunosuppressants, drugs which inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system. There are various conflicting views on whether immune-suppressing drugs are beneficial or detrimental in patients with the disease. Methods: This study collected data from 10 hospitals in the UK and one in Italy between February and April 2020 in order to identify any association between the regular use of immunosuppressant medicines and survival in patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Results: 1184 patients were included in the study, and 10% of them were using immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased risk of death, and the risk appeared to increase if the dose of the medicine was higher. Conclusion: We therefore recommend that patients who take immunosuppressant medicines routinely should carefully adhere to social distancing measures, and seek medical attention early during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Myint, Phyo K.; Carter, Ben; Barlow-Pay, Fenella; Short, Roxanna; Einarsson, Alice G.; Bruce, Eilidh; McCarthy, Kathryn; Verduri, Alessia; Collins, Jemima; Hesford, James; Rickard, Frances; Mitchell, Emma; Holloway, Mark; McGovern, Aine; Vilches-Moraga, Arturo; Braude, Philip; Pearce, Lyndsay; Stechman, Michael; Price, Angeline; Quinn, Terence J.; Clini, Enrico; Moug, Susan; Hewitt, Jonathan",Ther Adv Drug Saf,610,20

In Chile, three species of non-domestic native canids are present, and due to the growing concern about their interaction with humans and domestic animals, it is of utmost relevance to determine the role of these animals in the epidemiology of brucellosis and leptospirosis. This study aimed to detect the exposure to B. abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira by serologic, bacteriologic, and molecular techniques in native foxes from rehabilitation and exhibition centers in Central Chile. Forty-six blood samples were obtained from culpeo and grey foxes, detecting exposure to B. canis and L. Javanica in 10.9% and 7.7%, respectively. Exposure was not registered by culture and qPCR in any of the sampled animals. Our results show for the first time in Chile exposure to B. canis in native foxes, highlighting the need to establish integrated surveillance programs to better evaluate the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic pathogens that may affect One Health. ABSTRACT: Brucella abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira are zoonotic pathogens that infect humans, as well as domestic and wild animals. In wild canids, they may affect their fertility and reproduction, threatening their conservation. Wild canids play a crucial role in the environment as meso- and top-predators and environmental sentinels for zoonotic pathogens. In Chile, three species of wild canids are present, and due to changes in land use and environmental dynamics, it is of utmost relevance to determine the role of these species in the epidemiology of brucellosis and leptospirosis. This study aimed to detect the exposure to B. abortus, B. canis, and pathogenic Leptospira by serologic, bacteriologic, and molecular techniques in native foxes from rehabilitation and exhibition centers in Central Chile. Forty-six blood samples were obtained from Lycalopex culpaeus and L. griseus, detecting 10.9% of seropositivity to B. canis and 7.7% to L. Javanica. No seropositivity was seen for B. abortus. Exposure was not registered by culture and qPCR in any of the sampled animals. Our findings are the first register of exposure to any Brucella species in wild canids in Chile and highlight the need to establish surveillance programs of these emerging pathogens.","Galarce, Nicolás; de la Fuente, Sebastián; Escobar, Beatriz; Dettleff, Phillip; Abalos, Pedro; Hormazábal, Juan Carlos; Flores, Roberto; Sallaberry-Pincheira, Nicole; Martínez, Víctor",Animals (Basel),610,24

The specific purpose was to assess the perceived impact and impact on mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, and stress). METHODS: The survey battery presented a total of 37 items. Demographic, sport or group-specific, and academic-related questions were included alongside the assessment of psychological well-being coming from the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. RESULTS: There were 249 participants completing some or all of the survey battery. It is notable that 172 participants (69.1%) indicated “a lot has changed”. Common one-word responses to the experience surrounding this change-event were feeling disappointment, upset, frustrated, sadness, annoyance, and depression. Life events that conjured similar magnitude of emotion included significant injury, surgery, and losing a loved one. There were no differences by sport for the depression subscale, but 110 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean depression subscale score compared with males. Differences between sports for the anxiety subscale were negated when evaluating Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, but 69 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean anxiety subscale score compared with males. There was no difference by sport for the stress subscale, but 77 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean stress subscale score compared with males. DISCUSSION: Authors urge the campus and athletics community to be diligent in monitoring the holistic wellness of college athletes and members of other campus groups. Mainly, we contend it is important to consider that COVID-19 is a significant and widespread change-event, and other change-events are known to have significant impact.

Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease (PGT-M) is a powerful tool to tackle the transmission of monogenic inherited disorders from generation to generation. In our case, a mutation in F8 had passed through female carriers in a hemophilia A family and resulted in two male patients with hemophilia A. To identify the etiological genetic variants of F8, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used for chromosome copy number variation detection, Sanger sequencing to verify mutation sites, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for site amplification, and sequencing to validate the genetic linkage. Finally, a novel missense mutation, p. (Phe690Leu)/c.2070C > A, occurring in exon 13 of F8, was screened out as a pathogenic mutation. Following this, an F8 normal euploid blastocyst was transferred. At the 18th week, the pregnant mother underwent amniocentesis, NGS, Sanger sequencing, and SNP typing that further confirmed that the fetus had a healthy genotype. After delivery, a neonatal blood sample was sent for FVIII concentration detection, and the result established that the FVIII protein was rescued to a nearly average level. We first identified a new type of pathogenic mutation in F8, which has not been previously reported, selected a genetically healthy progeny for an affected family, and provided valuable knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia A.","Bai, Haiyan; Xue, Xia; Tian, Li; Liu, Xi Tong; Li, Qian",Front Genet,610,10

Host cell invasion is initiated through direct binding of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disrupting the spike protein–ACE2 interaction is a potential therapeutic target for treating COVID-19. We have developed a proximity-based AlphaLISA assay to measure the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2. Utilizing this assay platform, a drug-repurposing screen against 3384 small-molecule drugs and preclinical compounds was carried out, yielding 25 high-quality primary hits, of which only corilagin was validated in cherry-picking. This established AlphaLISA RBD–ACE2 platform can facilitate evaluation of biologics or small molecules that can perturb this essential viral–host interaction to further the development of interventions to address the global health pandemic.","Hanson, Quinlin M.; Wilson, Kelli M.; Shen, Min; Itkin, Zina; Eastman, Richard T.; Shinn, Paul; Hall, Matthew D.",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,610,10

Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Iraqi government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities and limiting population's mobility. In this study, concentrations of four criteria pollutants, NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 before the lockdown from January 16 to February 29, 2020, and during four periods of partial and total lockdown from March 1 to July 24, 2020, in Baghdad were analysed. Overall, 6, 8 and 15% decreases in NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, respectively in Baghdad during the 1st partial and total lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to the period before the lockdown. While, there were 13% increase in O3 for same period. During the 2nd partial lockdown from June 14 to July 24, NO2 and PM2.5 decreases 20 and 2.5%, respectively. While, there were 525 and 56% increase in O3 and PM10, respectively for same period. The air quality index (AQI) improved by 13% in Baghdad during the 1st partial lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to its pre-lockdown.

Therefore, this study developed a novel technique to optimize electrical current flow to provide in-depth research and analysis of current flowing in the transmission network circuit prone to danger during short-circuit faults. The research methodology involved the generation of unbalanced short-circuit calculations at every single node of the three-phase network using the symmetrical component method. Numerical simulation of different types of unbalanced short-circuit fault into the entire 330kV transmission network using unbalanced fault algorithms written in a flexible MATLAB program environment is also performed on every bus. The influence of these short-circuit faults is examined on the generated spectrum of line current magnitude. This study then generates a series of unbalanced current circuit and line losses analysis that unveils the different scenarios regarding existing network performance. The method adopted is promising. It established the most critical lines (about 20) with high unbalanced current magnitudes and high line losses during the disturbance. Based on the result analysis, four (quad) bundles of conductors is designed as a proposed modification to the upgrade of all critical double circuit lines and the conversion of single critical lines on the 330kV transmission network to improve the power transfer capability and also meet the future transmission network development plan. Furthermore, recommendations that are considered desirable in this study are proffered to ensure acceptable power quality and security in the network.","Abdulkareem, Ademola; Adesanya, A.; Agbetuyi, A.F.; Alayande, A.S.",Heliyon,610,16

Methods: We performed a systematic research on Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov, ProQuest PTSD Pubs ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and other gray databases by January 2021. Randomized controlled trials involving therapeutic interventions for HCP with PTSD were included. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity. Summary standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using inverse variance meta-analysis with fixed effects. Risks of bias were assessed using Cochrane methods. Results: Among 773 citations, this review includes six studies, randomizing 810 participants. A meta-analysis of the effect of interventions compared to placebo showed a significant reduction of PTSD symptom severity: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Brief (CBT-B) (M = 27.80, 95% CI: 17.12, 38.48), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Long (CBT-L) (M = 26.50, 95% CI: 15.75, 37.25), and Mindfulness-Based Stretching and Deep Breathing Exercise (MBX) (M = 17.2, 95% CI: 6.57, 27.83). CBT-L and CBT-B also showed a significant effect on depression severity. Conclusions: The most effective and feasible treatment option for HCP with PTSD is still unclear, but CBT and MBX have displayed the most significant effects based on current limited evidence.

However, it is unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects lung microflora, which contributes to COVID-19 complications. Here, we analyzed the metatranscriptomic data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 19 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy controls from 6 independent projects and detailed the active microbiota landscape in both healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 could deeply change the lung microbiota, evidenced by the -diversity, {beta}-diversity and species composition analysis based on bacterial microbiota and virome. Pathogens (such as Klebsiella oxytoca causing pneumonia as well), immunomodulatory probiotics (such as Lactic Acid Bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a butyrate producer) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were enriched in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a severe microbiota dysbiosis. The significant correlation between Rothia mucilaginosa, TMV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed drastic inflammatory battles between the host, SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in the lungs. Notably, TMV only existed in the COVID-19 group, while Human respirovirus 3 only existed in the healthy group.

During emergency responses, they experience challenging situations. However, previous quantitative studies suggest that the psychological burden of psychosocial emergency care personnel does not exceed that of the general population. This study aimed to obtain an in-depth analysis of the volunteers’ psychological reactions and resources regarding emergency responses. 36 psychosocial emergency care volunteers (12 pre-training, 12 post-training, 12 experienced) were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The volunteers were selected from previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on secondary traumatization in psychosocial emergency care volunteers. A qualitative content analysis of the transcribed interviews was performed following the principles of summary and inductive category development. We identified 845 codes which we summarized in three overarching categories: (I) reactions to emergency responses, (II) psychosocial emergency care work related resources and (III) experiences and changes in life perspective related to working in psychosocial emergency care. The volunteers described both emotional and physical reactions to emergency responses. While they perceived social support as a key coping resource and reported a greater appreciation of their own lives and their families due to their work, many volunteers also felt increased concern that something could happen to them. The volunteers’ reactions and symptoms are reasonable responses to stress and not indicative of serious impairment. Nevertheless, emergency responses are both emotionally and physically challenging.

Heavily affecting orthopaedics, the pandemic led to delay and cancellation of almost all surgical cases, and procedures including perioperative intra-articular corticosteroid injections (ICIs) saw similar decreases. However, the benefits of ICI treatments during the pandemic may outweigh these potential risks, and their continued use may be warranted. METHODS: A literature search was conducted, and all relevant articles including original articles and reviews were identified and considered in full for inclusion, and analysed with expert opinion. Epidemiological statistics and medical guidelines were consulted from relevant authorities. RESULTS: ICIs allow a targeted approach on the affected joint and are effective in reducing pain while improving functional outcome and patient quality-of-life. ICIs delay the requirement for surgery, accommodating for the increased healthcare burden during the pandemic, while reducing postoperative hospital stay, bringing significant financial benefits. However, ICIs can exert systemic effects and suppress the immune system. ICIs may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection and reduce the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations, leading to important public health implications. CONCLUSION: Perioperative ICI treatments may bring significant, multifaceted benefits during the pandemic. However, ICIs increase the risk of infection, and perioperative COVID-19 is associated with mortality. The use of ICIs during the COVID-19 pandemic should therefore be considered carefully on an individual patient basis, weighing the associated risks and benefits.

In this review, we discussed the perspectives of mass spectrometry-based proteomics as an analytical technique to identify and quantify proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and to enable basic research and clinical studies on COVID-19. While RT-PCR and RNA sequencing are indisputably powerful techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of the emerging mutations, proteomics may provide confirmatory diagnostic information and complimentary biological knowledge on protein abundance, post-translational modifications, protein–protein interactions, and the functional impact of the emerging mutations. Pending advances in sensitivity and throughput of mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography, shotgun and targeted proteomic assays may find their niche for the differential quantification of viral proteins in clinical and environmental samples. Targeted proteomic assays in combination with immunoaffinity enrichments also provide orthogonal tools to evaluate cross-reactivity of serology tests and facilitate development of tests with the nearly perfect diagnostic specificity, this enabling reliable testing of broader populations for the acquired immunity. The coronavirus pandemic of 2019–2021 is another reminder that the future global pandemics may be inevitable, but their impact could be mitigated with the novel tools and assays, such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics, to enable continuous monitoring of emerging viruses, and to facilitate rapid response to novel infectious diseases.","Rais, Yasmine; Fu, Zhiqiang; Drabovich, Andrei P.",Clin Proteomics,610,26

Therefore, the idea of a consensus score strategy was put forward. Integrating several scoring functions, consensus score re-assesses the docked conformations using a primary scoring function. However, it is not really robust and efficient from the perspective of optimization. Furthermore, to date, the majority of available methods are still based on single objective optimization design. RESULTS: In this paper, two multi-objective optimization methods, called MOSFOM, were developed for virtual screening, which simultaneously consider both the energy score and the contact score. Results suggest that MOSFOM can effectively enhance enrichment and performance compared with a single score. For three different kinds of binding sites, MOSFOM displays an excellent ability to differentiate active compounds through energy and shape complementarity. EFMOGA performed particularly well in the top 2% of database for all three cases, whereas MOEA_Nrg and MOEA_Cnt performed better than the corresponding individual scoring functions if the appropriate type of binding site was selected. CONCLUSION: The multi-objective optimization method was successfully applied in virtual screening with two different scoring functions that can yield reasonable binding poses and can furthermore, be ranked with the potentially compromised conformations of each compound, abandoning those conformations that can not satisfy overall objective functions.","Li, Honglin; Zhang, Hailei; Zheng, Mingyue; Luo, Jie; Kang, Ling; Liu, Xiaofeng; Wang, Xicheng; Jiang, Hualiang",BMC Bioinformatics,610,16

Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes. Molecular weights of heavy (IgA, IgG, IgM) and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis, and as expected, they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins. In order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response, eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) and serum anti-DNP responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for one year. The full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response, and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species.","Flies, Andrew S.; Grant, Chris K.; Mansfield, Linda S.; Tsao, Jean; Smith, Eric J.; Weldele, Mary L.; Holekamp, Kay E.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,610,17

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng, Bi-heng; Xia, Zhong-yuan; Meng, Qing-tao",Can J Anaesth,610,6

El pronóstico es generalmente favorable. Gran parte de las personas afectadas no manifestarán nunca síntomas y muchas tienen remisión espontánea. El curso es crónico en el 10-30% de los casos, con un deterioro permanente de la función pulmonar. La enfermedad es el resultado de la acción de un agente externo que desencadena la respuesta inmunitaria característica en individuos genéticamente susceptibles. Se han implicado factores ambientales, ocupacionales y genéticos, pero las investigaciones están todavía en los inicios. Estudios de casos y controles, así como los avances en biología molecular, ayudarán a definir los factores de susceptibilidad genética y a entender los distintos fenotipos de la sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease in which lung involvement is common. Its incidence and prevalence have been extensively studied, but with contradictory results because of the lack of standard diagnostic criteria, variations in the methods for detecting cases, and the low sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. Prognosis is generally favorable. Many of those affected remain asymptomatic and remission often occurs spontaneously, although between 10% and 30% of the patients have chronic disease and permanent deterioration in lung function. Sarcoidosis is caused by an external agent that triggers a characteristic immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Environmental, occupational, and genetic factors have all been implicated, but research is still in the early stages.

Using the advantages of blockchain, such as immutability, decentralization, openness, and anonymity, we can build trusted food traceability systems based on these important characteristics. With reliable information, traceability from production to sales can effectively improve food safety. In this research, multiple models, namely, the information success model (ISS) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) are formed into a conceptual integrated framework to study the intentions’ influenced factors of BFTS technology for Chinese consumers to help ensure food safety and the quality of Chinese organic food products. A face-to-face questionnaire survey with 300 valid responses was analyzed by Partial Least Square from the Chinese consumers focusing on the organic food products. This study found that the attitude and perceived behavioral control qualities significantly and positively affect the usage intention in adopting BFTS, while the subjective norms are positively but not significantly correlation with the usage intention in using BFTS. The above results will inform suggestions for productors and academics along with implications to promote BFTS’ usage intention.","Lin, Xin; Chang, Shu-Chen; Chou, Tung-Hsiang; Chen, Shih-Chih; Ruangkanjanases, Athapol",Int J Environ Res Public Health,610,2

METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv for publications before July 13, 2020. Cohort studies and case-control studies that contain information on the association of antihypertensive agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), β-blockers, and diuretics with the risk and severity of COVID-19 were selected. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. The literature search yielded 53 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, which comprised 39 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies. These studies included a total of 2,100,587 participants. We observed no association between prior usage of antihypertensive medications including ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, β-blockers, or diuretics and the risk and severity of COVID-19. Additionally, when only hypertensive patients were included, the severity and mortality were lower with prior usage of ACEIs/ARBs (overall OR of 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99, p < 0.05 and overall OR of 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, usage of antihypertensive drugs is not associated with the risk and severity of COVID-19.

We present results of consecutive population-based seroprevalence surveys performed in Denmark in 2020. In spring, late summer and autumn/winter of 2020, invitation letters including a questionnaire covering symptoms were sent to representative samples of the population above 12 years and to parents of children below 18 years in the sample. Blood samples were analysed for total Ig and seroprevalence estimates per population segment were calculated and compared to other surveillance parameters. Based on 34 081 participants (participation rate 33%), seroprevalence estimates increased from 1.2% (95%CI: 0.3–1.9%) in May to 4.1% (95%CI: 3.1–4.9%) in December 2020. Seroprevalence estimates were roughly three times higher in those aged 12–29 years compared to 65 + and higher in metropolitan municipalities. By December 2020, 1.5% of the population had tested positive by RT-PCR. Infected individuals in older age groups were hospitalised several fold more often than in younger. Amongst seropositives, loss of taste/smell were the more specific symptoms, 32–56% did not report any symptoms. In more than half of seroconverted families, we did not see evidence of transmission between generations. Seroprevalence increased during 2020; adolescents were primarily infected in the autumn/winter. Denmark has a high per capita test rate; roughly one undiagnosed infection of SARS-CoV-2 were estimated to occur for each diagnosed case. Approximately half were asymptomatically infected. The epidemic appears to have progressed relatively modestly during 2020 in Denmark.","Espenhain, Laura; Tribler, Siri; Sværke Jørgensen, Charlotte; Holm Hansen, Christian; Wolff Sönksen, Ute; Ethelberg, Steen",Eur J Epidemiol,610,1

However, adherence to nutritional guidelines may be difficult in the context of capacity constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate barriers to doctors' adherence to nutritional guidelines and the impacts of guideline adherence on the outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multinational electronic survey involving 51 doctors was conducted between November 2020 and January 2021 from 17 COVID-19-designated hospitals in countries with high (Indonesia) and low (Vietnam) numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: In general, doctors reported concerns related to nutritional practices in patients with Covid-19 which included feeling stress when performing medical nutritional therapy (65%), lacking self-efficacy or confidence in performing nutritional care (49%), lacking clear nutritional guidelines (45%), and experiencing budget limitations (33%). A regression analysis adjusted for age, country, and the number of hospitalized COVID-19 cases revealed that guideline knowledge (β: −1.01 (−1.78, −0.23); p = 0.012) and awareness of guidelines (β: −1.37 (−2.66, −0.09); p = 0.037) were negatively correlated with the length of stay of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but non-significant after adjusting for specialization of the doctor. When stratified according to country, a significant relationship between guideline adherence and length of stay of critically ill patients was only found in Vietnam [guideline adherence: β: −0.55 (−1.08, −0.03); p = 0.038; guideline knowledge: β: −1.01 (−1.9, −0.13); p = 0.027] after adjusting for age, specialty, and number of hospitalized COVID-19 cases. In Indonesia, the significant relationship between guideline adherence and mortality of COVID-19 patients remained strong (β: −14 (−27, −1); p = 0.033) after adjusting for age, specialty, and number of hospitalized COVID-19 cases CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate nutritional knowledge is a key barrier to guideline adherence, and this was international and may be related to doctors' specialties and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a healthcare professional would be more preferable for patients and health professionals. Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices (spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral load, sensitivity increased substantially (97.0% and 76.7% for spitting and swabbing, respectively), irrespective of symptomatic status.

Simple logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between the two tests. A subset of samples was screened using qRT‐PCR, ELISA and a commercial LAT dipstick (132 faecal samples were tested for coronavirus and 122 samples for rotavirus). Results Of the 586 samples tested, 131 (22.39%) and 468 (79.86%) were positive for coronavirus and group A rotavirus, respectively, using qRT‐PCR. The number of samples positive on ELISA for coronavirus and rotavirus was 73 (12.46%) and 225 (38.40%), respectively. Using LAT, 30 (22.73%) and 43 (35.35%) samples were positive for coronavirus and rotavirus, respectively. Simple linear regression revealed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) but weak (r(2)=−0.07 and −0.40) correlation between the rotavirus/coronavirus qRT‐PCR and ELISA, respectively. There was also poor agreement between the LAT and qRT‐PCR assays. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of the commercial ELISA and LAT assays evaluated in this study were low compared with qRT‐PCR.
