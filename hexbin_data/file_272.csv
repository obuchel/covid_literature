METHODS: Data of all the NIH cases admitted to neonatal intensive care unit at our center, New Delhi from January, 2010 to October, 2017 were extracted from hospital records, which included clinical profile and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 17,299 total births, 27 neonates were identified to have NIH. Antenatal interventions were undertaken in five (18.5%) cases. The most common etiology of NIH was cardiac (n=5; 18.5%). Two babies with chylothorax were successfully managed with octreotide infusions. Overall survival rate of NIH was 70.3% (n=19). All neonates with a suspected genetic syndrome died. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary team including obstetricians, pediatric surgeons, geneticists and neonatologists can improve outcome in neonates with NIH.","Madathil, Shamnad; Anand, Pratima; Deorari, Ashok K.; Agarwal, Ramesh; Thukral, Anu; Sankar, M.

12989,A comparison of COVID-19 mortality rates between European and Asian States,2020-07-22,"Manganese dioxide (MnO(2)) nanosheets have shown exciting potential in nanomedicine because of their ultrathin thickness, large surface area, high near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and good biocompatibility. However, the effect of MnO(2) nanosheets on bacteria is still unclear. In this study, MnO(2) nanosheets were shown for the first time to possess highly efficient antibacterial activity by using Salmonella as a model pathogen. The growth curve and surface plate assay uncovered that 125 μg/mL MnO(2) nanosheets could kill 99.2% of Salmonella, which was further verified by fluorescence-based live/dead staining measurement. Mechanism analysis indicated that MnO(2) nanosheet treatment could dramatically induce reactive oxygen species production, increase ATPase activity and cause the leakage of electrolytes and protein contents, leading to bacterial death. These results uncover the previously undefined role of MnO(2) nanosheets and provide novel strategies for developing antimicrobial agents.","Du, Ting; Chen, Siya; Zhang, Jinyu; Li, Tingting; Li, Ping; Liu, Jifeng; Du, Xinjun; Wang, Shuo",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7466589/,272
14348,Gluten Free Diet for the Management of Non Celiac Diseases: The Two Sides of the Coin,2020-10-14,"Past studies using the positive deviance (PD) approach in the field of infection prevention and control (IPC) have primarily focused on impacts on healthcare-associated infection rates. This research aimed to determine if health professionals who exhibit PD behaviours have distinctive socio-cognitive profiles compared to non-PD professionals, and to examine the impact of a PD intervention on healthcare professionals’ (HPs) behavioural changes in maintaining IPC guidelines. In a cross-sectional study among 135 HPs, respondents first filled out a socio-cognitive characteristics questionnaire, and after 5 months were requested to complete a self-reported behavioural change questionnaire. The main findings indicate that socio-cognitive variables such as external locus of control, perceived threat and social learning were significant predictors of a person exhibiting PD behaviours. Almost 70% of HPs reported behavioural change and creating social networks as a result of the PD intervention in maintaining IPC guidelines, 16.9% of them are a ‘PD boosters’ (a new group of HPs who have adopted the positive practices of PDs that were originally identified, and also added additional practices of their own). Social networks can contribute to internalizing and raising personal accountability even among non-PD professionals, by creating a mind map that makes each person believe they are an important node in the network, regardless of their status and role. Health intervention programmes should purposely make visible and prominent social network connections in the hospital system.","Cohen, R.; Gesser-Edelsburg, A.; Singhal, A.; Benenson, S.; Moses, A.E.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7689599/,272
15337,Compositional Associations of Sleep and Activities within the 24-h Cycle with Cardiometabolic Health Markers in Adults,2020-08-07,"OBJECTIVE: eHealth interventions are being developed to meet the needs of diverse populations. Despite these advancements, little is known about how these interventions are used to improve the health of persons experiencing homelessness. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and experience of eHealth interventions for the homeless population. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted along with forward and backward citation searching to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Eight articles met eligibility criteria. All articles were pilot or feasibility studies that used modalities, including short message service, mobile apps, computers, email, and websites, to deliver the interventions. The accessibility, flexibility, and convenience of the interventions were valued by participants. However, phone retention, limited adaptability, a high level of human involvement, and preference for in-person communication may pose future implementation challenges. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions are promising digital tools that have the potential to improve access to care and service delivery. eHealth interventions are feasible and usable for persons experiencing homelessness. These interventions may have health benefits by augmenting existing services and if implementation challenges are addressed. Further evaluation of the effectiveness of eHealth interventions is needed before widespread implementation. Those with lived experience should also be engaged in developing and evaluating these interventions.","Polillo, Alexia; Gran-Ruaz, Sophia; Sylvestre, John; Kerman, Nick",Digit Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7863153/,272
18093,Chronic Total Occlusion Percutaneous Coronary Intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from the PROGRESS-CTO Registry,2021-06-05,"With the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population, anaesthetists must confidently manage both the pathophysiological and technical challenges presented in bariatric and non-bariatric surgery. The intraoperative period represents an important opportunity to optimise and mitigate risk. However, there is little formal guidance on what intraoperative monitoring techniques should be used in this population. This narrative review collates the existing evidence for intraoperative monitoring devices in the obese patients. Although a number of non-invasive blood pressure monitors have been tested, an invasive arterial line remains the most reliable monitor if accurate, continuous monitoring is required. Goal-directed fluid therapy is recommended by clinical practice guidelines, but the methods tested to assess this had guarded applicability to the obese population. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO(2)) monitoring may offer additional benefit to standard capnography in this population. Individually titrated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment manoeuvres improved intraoperative mechanics but yielded no benefit in the immediate postoperative period. Depth of anaesthesia monitoring appears to be beneficial in the perioperative period regarding recovery times and complications. Objective confirmation of reversal of neuromuscular blockade continues to be a central tenet of anaesthesia practice, particularly relevant to this group who have been characterised as an “at risk” extubation group. Where deep neuromuscular blockade is used, continuous neuromuscular blockade is suggested. Both obesity and the intraoperative context represent somewhat unstable search terms, as the clinical implications of the obesity phenotype are not uniform, and the type and urgency of surgery have significant impact on the intraoperative setting. This renders the generation of summary conclusions around what intraoperative monitoring techniques are suitable in this population highly challenging.","Haren, Andrea P.; Nair, Shrijit; Pace, Maria C.; Sansone, Pasquale",Adv Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179704/,272
18905,Associations of premorbid adjustment with type and timing of childhood trauma in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders,2021-06-22,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of using consistent complication-avoidance protocols in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery including techniques for avoiding anosmia, epistaxis, carotid artery injury, hypopituitarism, cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis. METHODS: All patients undergoing endoscopic adenoma resection from 2010 to 2020 were included. Primary outcomes included 90-day complication rates, gland function outcomes, reoperations, readmissions and length of stay. Secondary outcomes were extent of resection, short-term endocrine remission, vision recovery. RESULTS: Of 514 patients, (mean age 51 ± 16 years; 78% macroadenomas, 19% prior surgery) major complications occurred in 18(3.5%) patients, most commonly CSF leak (9, 1.7%) and meningitis (4, 0.8%). In 14 of 18 patients, complications were deemed preventable. Four (0.8%) had complications with permanent sequelae (3 before 2016): one unexplained mortality, one stroke, one oculomotor nerve palsy, one oculoparesis. There were no internal carotid artery injuries, permanent visual worsening or permanent anosmia. New hypopituitarism occurred in 23/485(4.7%). Partial or complete hypopituitarism resolution occurred in 102/193(52.8%) patients. Median LOS was 2 days; 98.3% of patients were discharged home. Comparing 18 patients with major complications versus 496 without, median LOS was 7 versus 2 days, respectively p < 0.001. Readmissions occurred in 6%(31/535), mostly for hyponatremia (18/31). Gross total resection was achieved in 214/312(69%) endocrine-inactive adenomas; biochemical remission was achieved in 148/209(71%) endocrine-active adenomas. Visual field or acuity defects improved in 126/138(91.3%) patients. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that conformance to established protocols for endoscopic pituitary surgery may minimize complications, re-admissions and LOS while enhancing the likelihood of preserving gland function, although there remains opportunity for further improvements.","Thakur, Jai Deep; Corlin, Alex; Mallari, Regin Jay; Yawitz, Samantha; Eisenberg, Amalia; Sivakumar, Walavan; Griffiths, Chester; Carrau, Ricardo L.; Rettinger, Sarah; Cohan, Pejman; Krauss, Howard; Araque, Katherine A.; Barkhoudarian, Garni; Kelly, Daniel F.",Pituitary,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252985/,272

31021,COVID‐19 causes more delay in managed care launch for Illinois youth,2020-03-20,"Studies on the prophylactic effect of feeding probiotics, pathogen‐specific colostrum antibodies or egg yolk antibodies in newborn calves The prophylactic efficacy of feeding probiotics, specific egg yolk antibodies and specific colostrum antibodies on neonatal diarrhoea was investigated in a field trial with calves, grouped (n = 39/40 per group) according to the following treatments: Group I: feeding no additive; Group II: feeding probiotics (5 g powder/day with Bacillus cereus var. toyoi); Group III: feeding egg powder (10 g/day with specific egg yolk antibodies against rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli F5); Group IV: feeding colostrum antibodies (10 ml/day containing 1 g bovine immunoglobulins with specific antibodies against rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli antigens); Group V: feeding egg powder together with probiotics (according to group II and III). The additives were given twice daily with the meal from day 2 to day 14 post‐natum. The presence of infectious agents was proved in fecal samples of all calves. Intestinal infections with rotavirus (30.8% of the calves) predominated compared to those with coronavirus (7.1%), E. coli F5 (1.5%) and cryptosporidia (24.2%). In contrast to earlier studies, the manifestation of diarrhoea did not differ significantly between the five groups. Only the growth rate of the calves between day 2 and day 14 of life as a measure of their welfare showed treatmentFspecific differences. The control group (I) showed the lowest body weight gain of about 5.8 kg (SD 5.0), whereas in the treated groups it averaged 6.3 kg (SD 4.1, p = 0,60; group II), 6.8 kg (SD 4.3, p = 0.36; group III), 6.9 kg (SD 4.7, p = 0.61; group IV) and 7.7 kg (SD 4.9, p = 0.08; group V). Considering only the rotavirus‐positive calves the body weight gain of the control group (I) was 3.5 kg (SD 4.8) and of the treated groups was 3.8 kg (SD 3.3, p = 0.65; II), 5.0 kg (SD 3.5, p = 0.54; III), 6.6 kg (SD 4.5, p = 0.05; IV) and 6.1 kg (SD 5.0, p = 0.13; V). Obviously, the feeding of antibodies from colostrum or from egg powder does increase the mean body weight gain. The feeding of probiotics alone has nearly no effect. However, in the combination with specific egg antibodies probiotics seem to have a synergistic effect. In serum from the 198 newborn calves the IgG concentration averaged 4.9 mg/ml serum (SD 3.3). From 93 dams of these calves a sample of the first colostrum could be obtained showing a mean IgG concentration of 22.0 mg/ml (SD 11.0). IgG levels in the colostrum and in the serum have been positively correlated (r = 0.37, p < 0.05). Calves with a high intensity of diarrhoea had a significantly (p = 0.01) lower mean IgG serum level (3.7 mg/ml; n = 36; SD 2.5) than calves without diarrhoea (5.6 mg/ml; n = 75; SD 4.0).","Von Erhard, M.

The law of responsibility is long standing in international law as the framework for providing redress for breaches of law. It gives rise to an obligation to provide redress and ensures some form of culpability for a breach of international law. In this paper we argue that the WHO does not merely have the power to declare a PHEIC via the International Health Regulations (2005), but also has a legal obligation to do so when the criteria are met. An obligation which we argue, they breached in failing to declare the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa a PHEIC in a timely manner. This breach should then engage the law of responsibility for the consequences of the delay. The paper argues, however, that there exist substantial issues with the application of the principles of responsibility to international organizations.","Eccleston-Turner, Mark; McArdle, Scarlett",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7226899/,272
36152,How to deal with the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 for people who pay attention to anxiety and depression,2020-06-23,"Adaptive math software supports students’ learning by targeting specific math knowledge components. However, widespread use of adaptive math software in classrooms has not led to the expected changes in student achievement, particularly for racially minoritized students and students situated in poverty. While research has shown the power of human mentors to support student learning and reduce opportunity gaps, mentoring support could be optimized by using educational technology to identify the specific non-math factors that are disrupting students’ learning and direct mentors to appropriate resources related to those factors. In this paper, we present an analysis of one non-math factor—reading comprehension—that has been shown to influence math learning. We predict math performance using this non-math factor and show that it contributes novel explanatory value in modeling students’ learning behaviors. Through this analysis, we argue that educational technology could better address the learning needs of the whole student by modeling non-math factors. We suggest future research should take this learning analytics approach to identify the many different kinds of motivational and non-math content challenges that arise when students are learning from adaptive math software. We envision analyses such as those presented in this paper enabling greater individualization within adaptive math software that takes into account not only math knowledge and progress but also non-math factors.","Richey, J.

It starts from two inter-connected propositions: the effectiveness of many public sector programs is hampered by inadequate information on how differently different ethnic groups behave, and anxiety over how to discuss matters to do with race inhibits proper evaluation of methodologies which would address this problem. This article highlights four mindsets which could benefit from challenge: the officially sanctioned categories by which ethnic data are tabulated are too crude to capture the subtler differences which are required for effective communications; while self-identification should continue to drive one-to-one communications, it should not preclude the use of more appropriate methods of recording ethnic heritage when analyzing data for population groups; public servants often fail to recognize the limitations of directional measures such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation as against “natural” classifications such as Mosaic and Acorn; and in their quest for predictive accuracy statisticians often overlook the benefit of the variables they use being “actionable,” defining population groups that are easy to reach whether geographically or using one-to-one communications.","Webber, Richard",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7412081/,272

Preliminary Results of an Online Survey,2020-12-16,"Currently, the use of voice-assistants has been on the rise, but a user-centric usability evaluation of these devices is a must for ensuring their success. System Usability Scale (SUS) is one such popular usability instrument in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) scenario. However, there are certain fundamental differences between GUI and voice-based systems, which makes it uncertain regarding the suitability of SUS in a voice scenario. The present work has a twofold objective: to check the suitability of SUS for usability evaluation of voice-assistants and developing a subjective scale in line with SUS that considers the unique aspects of voice-based communication. We call this scale as the Voice Usability Scale (VUS). For fulfilling the objectives, a subjective test is conducted with 62 participants. An Exploratory Factor Analysis suggests that SUS has a number of drawbacks for measuring the voice usability. Moreover, in case of VUS, the most optimal factor structure identifies three main components: usability, affective, and recognizability and visibility. The current findings should provide an initial starting point to form a useful theoretical and practical basis for subjective usability assessment of voice-based systems.","Zwakman, Dilawar Shah; Pal, Debajyoti; Arpnikanondt, Chonlameth",SN Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798382/,272

Despite these children and their families experiencing difficult environmental circumstances, numerous adverse life events, and challenging family dynamics, empirical examinations of the opioid epidemic, as it relates to grandfamilies, remain limited. The purpose of this review is to advance the understanding of how grandfamilies have been impacted by the opioid epidemic by using a systemic perspective to highlight themes and major conclusions within the existing conceptual and empirical literature. The review reveals five systemically informed themes including the assumption of caregiving responsibilities, grandparent stress and well-being, caring for vulnerable grandchildren, navigating relationships with parents, and contextual stressors of societal stigma and barriers to service.

However, the Government of Saudi Arabia only allowed 1000 pilgrims during the 2020 Hajj especially when the world is suffering from COVID-19. In the present paper, a detailed analysis of air quality parameters available from ground measurements have been carried over major cities of Saudi Arabia, Mecca, Madinah, and Jeddah from June to September 2019 and 2020. At Mecca and Jeddah, PM(10), NO(2) and CO concentrations are found to be higher in comparison to stations located close to Madinah. In addition, meteorological parameters, temperature, relative humidity, and wind directions are also analysed to understand changes associated with the meteorological parameters. Our detailed analysis shows a reduction in concentrations of pollutants during the 2020 Hajj, when the lockdown was observed in Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19. During June–August 2020 lockdown period, no major changes in PM(10) concentration was observed since there were frequent dust events were observed. In contrast, our results show 44% reduction in NO(2) (8.77 ppbv in 2019 to 4.97 ppbv in 2020) and 16% reduction in CO (0.85 ppm in 2019 to 0.72 ppm in 2020) concentrations during COVID-19 restrictions. The concentrations of NO(2) and CO do not cause any issue for the air quality as NO(2) and CO Indices lie within the green band (Air quality index 0–50). In Mecca, Madinah and Jeddah, the air quality is generally affected during Hajj, but during 2020, the concentration of particulate matter was influenced by local weather conditions.","Farahat, Ashraf; Chauhan, Akshansha; Al Otaibi, Mohammed; Singh, Ramesh P.",Earth Syst Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7852470/,272

Online dispute resolution (ODR) has already experienced success across a wide range of other conflicts, with preliminary evidence in the growing field of online family dispute resolution (OFDR) showing favourable outcomes for separating parents. The research presented in this book supports arguments that OFDR increases access to quality FDR services which in turn facilitates child-centered decision-making. This chapter will summarise the lessons learned to-date to inform recommendations for future OFDR program design and improvement. Both ODR and OFDR are relatively young developments in Australia, so the potential of these advanced technologies and their capabilities is yet unknown. Continued rigorous research into existing and future OFDR programs will further improve the field and the outcomes for families, an endeavour that will take the collaboration of many different stakeholders and a commitment to ongoing learning and future-focused change.","Wilson-Evered, Elisabeth; Zeleznikow, John",Online Family Dispute Resolution,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978531/,272
50849,A80 IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN IBD PATIENT CARE,2021-03-04,"Expatriate is one of the potential sources of knowledge for firms to increase their capability in creating innovation. Currently, Indonesia has a relatively small number of expatriates but the figure tends to increase overtime. This country has experienced a changing nature of expatriation that brings consequences to several conditions for the achievement of successful knowledge transfer (KT) from expatriates to local employee in Indonesian local firms. This paper proposes a new concept namely Knowledge Transfer Readiness (KTR) which is beneficial in helping the firms to deal with the changing nature. Combining grounded research and multiple case studies to apply this concept to the Indonesian local firms, it is argued that not all of the elements in KTR’s dimensions must be fulfilled in excellent conditions. Weak elements from the source’s side can be surmounted by fulfilling excellent condition of recipient’s side, and vice versa. Nevertheless, there are elements that must be fulfilled in excellent condition of both sides, or becomes absolute requirements solely for the expatriates. The fulfillment of KTR’s elements influences the relationship qualities between expatriates and local employees to achieve Knowledge Transfer Quality (KTQ). The KTQ includes the amount and the accuracy of knowledge and depth of understanding, so it can be a new option of qualitative indicator to measure the success of KT.","Prihadyanti, Dian; Sari, Karlina; Hidayat, Dudi; Laili, Nur; Triyono, Budi; Laksani, Chichi Shintia",J Knowl Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993070/,272

The dog data (age, sex, breed, and eating habits) were examined by two statistical analyses using the C. jejuni and C. coli status (positive or negative) as dependent variables. Dogs fed home-cooked food showed a higher risk of being positive for C. jejuni than dogs fed dry or canned meat for dogs (50.0%; p < 0.01). Moreover, purebred dogs had a significantly higher risk than crossbred dogs for C. coli positivity (16.4%; p < 0.01). This is the first study on the prevalence of C. jejuni and C. coli in dogs frequenting dog training centers for animal-assisted therapies (AATs). Our findings emphasize the potential zoonotic risk for patients and users involved in AATs settings and highlight the need to carry out ad hoc health checks and to pay attention to the choice of the dog, as well as eating habits, in order to minimize the risk of infection.","Santaniello, Antonio; Varriale, Lorena; Dipineto, Ludovico; Borrelli, Luca; Pace, Antonino; Fioretti, Alessandro; Menna, Lucia Francesca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8038157/,272

51938,P54 Framework for Delivery of Elective Orthopaedic Surgery in the United Kingdom Following the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Psychotherapy interventions increasingly utilize digital technologies to improve access to therapy and its acceptability. Opportunities that digital technology potentially creates for art therapy reach beyond increased access to include new possibilities of adaptation and extension of therapy tool box. Given growing interest in practice and research in this area, it is important to investigate how art therapists engage with digital technology or how (and whether) practice might be safely adapted to include new potential modes of delivery and new arts media. METHODS: An integrative review of peer-reviewed literature on the use of digital technology in art therapy was conducted. The methodology used is particularly well suited for early stage exploratory inquiries, allowing for close examination of papers from a variety of methodological paradigms. Only studies that presented empirical outcomes were included in the formal analysis. FINDINGS: Over 400 records were screened and 12 studies were included in the synthesis, pertaining to both the use of digital technology for remote delivery and as a medium for art making. Included studies, adopting predominantly qualitative and mixed methods, are grouped according to their focus on: art therapists’ views and experiences, online/distance art therapy, and the use of digital arts media. Recurring themes are discussed, including potential benefits and risks of incorporating digital technology in sessions with clients, concerns relating to ethics, resistance toward digital arts media, technological limitations and implications for therapeutic relationship and therapy process. Propositions for best practice and technological innovations that could make some of the challenges redundant are also reviewed. Future directions in research are indicated and cautious openness is recommended in both research and practice. CONCLUSION: The review documents growing research illustrating increased use of digital technology by art therapists for both online delivery and digital art making. Potentially immense opportunities that technology brings for art therapy should be considered alongside limitations and challenges of clinical, pragmatic and ethical nature. The review aims to invite conversations and further research to explore ways in which technology could increase relevance and reach of art therapy without compromising clients’ safety and key principles of the profession.","Zubala, Ania; Kennell, Nicola; Hackett, Simon",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060455/,272
52405,The Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Clinical Management of Thyroid Disorders in Japan,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: The majority of burn injured patients travel long distances to receive burn care from regional burn centers, creating a burden on families and impairing outcomes. Recent federal policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have relaxed some of the barriers to virtual visits in the non-health care setting. We sought to review the experience of a comprehensive burn program in managing burn patients with a virtual platform. METHODS: A clinical quality database was maintained to evaluate virtual videoconference and in-person clinic visits for a comprehensive adult and pediatric burn program during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to August 2020). Virtual visits utilized a telemedicine platform that employs real-time audio and video communication. Demographic, burn severity, and visit quality data were recorded. Zip code data was also collected and then used to calculate the following estimated savings for the patient and their family: total miles, travel hours, driving costs, and wages. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were included in this study with 96 (66.2%) male and 49 (33.7%) female. 91 (62.8%) were pediatric patients with a mean age of 6.2 ± 0.5 years and 54 (37.2%) were adult patients with a mean age of 40.4 ± 2.5 years. There were 320 total burn outpatient follow-up visits with 199 pediatric visits (40 virtual and 159 in-person) and 121 adult visits (24 virtual and 97 in-person). The majority of patients (73.1%) were treated as in-person visits while 6.9% had purely virtual visits, and 20.0% of patients had both virtual and in-person visits. The following savings were associated with virtual visits: 8562.6 total miles (average 133.8 ± 42.4), $6789.29 total driving cost (average $106.08 ± 33.61), 161.5 total travel hours (average 2.5 ± 0.7), and $4758.42 total wages lost to travel (average $74.35 ± 21.43). Technical issues were only reported in 14% of total visits (2.5% of pediatric virtual visits and 33.3% of adult virtual visits). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient virtual visits for burn care are a new frontier, driven by improvements in technology and reduced barriers to reimbursement. This study demonstrates that virtual visits are associated with major financial and temporal benefits for patients and their families. Technical issues remain an important barrier, particularly in the adult population. A clear understanding of this and other barriers may improve implementation of this new healthcare delivery paradigm.

52698,Fr002 EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON ACUTE GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING,2021-05-10,"Student enrollment continues to increase in online programs, but there is concern surrounding the reportedly high rates of attrition in online classes compared to face-to-face classes. Undergraduate students are poorly prepared and lack the human agency necessary for success in the online learning environment. To address the lack of persistence of undergraduate online students, universities must create and implement interventions that prepare students for the online learning environment and help them develop as autonomous learners. This study examined whether differences in self-regulation, self-direction, and online learning self-efficacy exist between students participating in an experimental high-impact First-Semester Seminar (FSS) class and a traditional FSS class while controlling for pre-existing factors. A quantitative, quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest research design was used for this study with nonequivalent control groups, and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and follow up analyses of covariances (ANCOVA) were used to analyze the data. MANCOVA results revealed a statistically significant difference between groups. Follow-up ANCOVAs revealed differences between the posttest scores of the traditional FSS class and the high-impact FSS class on the measurements for self-directed learning and self-regulated learning.","Stephen, Jacqueline S.; Rockinson-Szapkiw, Amanda J.",Smart Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102848/,272

53208,981 Management of Epistaxis During The COVID-19 Pandemic Our Experience,2021-05-04,"Yijin-tang is an oriental traditional herb used to treat inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of Yijin-tang water extract (YTE) using an ovalbumin- (OVA-) induced asthma model, focusing on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the herb. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with OVA on days 0 and 14 and then challenged with OVA on days 21, 22, and 23. The animals were orally administered YTE (200 and 400 mg/kg) from days 18 to 23, and this was found to significantly decrease airway hyperresponsiveness and release of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E in mice with asthma. In addition, YTE was associated with a marked reduction in airway inflammation and mucus production in lung tissue of mice with asthma. Furthermore, YTE suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and phosphorylation of ERK in the lungs, which in turn led to a reduction in inducible nitric oxide synthases and an elevation in reduced glutathione and heme oxygenase-1. In conclusion, YTE effectively suppressed allergic responses in mice with asthma and the effect was closely related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the herb. Our results indicate that YTE may be a potential agent for the treatment of allergic asthma.","Lee, Se-Jin; Lee, A.

53235,536 Use of A Cost-Efficient Colonoscopy Simulation Model to Improve Endoscopy Skills During the COVID Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The Rheumatology nurse advice line (NAL) at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD, Bath) provides a vital service for direct patient access to specialist advice via a designated voicemail system. Increasing numbers and difficulty connecting call returns have increased staff workload, reduced efficiency and impacted on staff satisfaction. An audit was therefore undertaken to evaluate service use and efficiency, paired with formal assessment of staff satisfaction in order to identify areas for improvement. Methods The total number of monthly calls through the NAL during 2020 were counted. A subset of consecutive calls were audited in detail, documenting temporal parameters in relation to the call being logged, returned and concluded. The number of clinicians and attempts required to contact the patient was noted. An anonymised staff satisfaction questionnaire was completed by NAL nurses and administrators. Data was analysed using Excel. Results An average 653 calls per month (range 340-894) came through the NAL between January and September 2020. 97 consecutive patient contacts were audited from August 2020. Multiple attempts were required to successfully return the call in 19.6% of cases (n = 19/97). Of those, 68.4% (n = 13/19) of calls needed ≥ 2 nurses to contact the patient. In general, the first attempt to return the call was prompt (average 7.6 hours, range 0.1-27.7). However, the time to conclude the call from the patient’s first call log ranged from 0.1 - 142.6 hours (average 12.7 hours) with increased time associated with difficulties contacting the patient or when further advice was required from a Rheumatology doctor (18.5%, n = 18/97). Staff surveys revealed 67% of staff felt that the NAL is a good service to offer patients. However, 67% of staff did not feel the NAL in its current format was easy to manage. Specific comments included that the lack of rota'd responsibility, unpredictable workload and time inefficiencies were barriers to managing the service. Conclusion From this data, we conclude that patient calls are returned promptly, but utilising a system of voicemail and unscheduled call returns is inefficient and contributes to staff dissatisfaction. This data has driven change for service improvement. To improve efficiency, calls will be answered live by an administrator during working hours and patients given a call-back time. A doctor will be named as a single point of contact for the nurses to seek additional advice and a nurse rota will designate responsibility for NAL calls to reduce work-load uncertainty. Follow up service evaluation will include staff and patient satisfaction questionnaires, and repeat audit, with consideration of ways to support frequent service users. Disclosure J. Day: None. J.

53278,516 Patient Opinion on The Disruption Caused to Daily Life by Attending A Virtual Clinic Over A Face-to-Face Clinic Appointment in General Surgery During The COVID-19 Pandemic. A Retrospective Patient Feedback Study,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The novel infectious disease COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical severity amongst the general population. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) are more likely to experience serious COVID-19 related events, although risk factors for such outcomes have yet to be established. In particular, the risk profiles of specific ARD therapies are unknown. Methods A Scottish wide registry was rapidly developed in March 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected cases were collated across all Scottish health boards, leveraging the Scottish Systemic Vasculitis Network and Scottish Society for Rheumatology. Eligible patients included any adult ARD patients with a confirmed (clinically or PCR) diagnosis of COVID-19. Simple descriptive statistics were employed to evaluate associations between ARD therapies and a serious COVID-19 disease outcome, as defined by a requirement of invasive or non-invasive ventilation, and/or death. Results A total of 69 patients (59% female; mean age 65.6, SD15.5) were recruited to the registry ,92% of which required hospitalisation. Cases were most commonly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 32, 46.4%) followed by spondyloarthritis (n = 19, 27.5%) and systemic vasculitis (n = 9, 13.0%). Anti-TNF therapy (n = 8, 11.6%) and methotrexate (n = 31, 44.9%) were the commonest biologic and conventional disease modifying drug (bDMARD and csDMARD) used respectively. N = 20 (29%) received background corticosteroid therapy (15.9% prednisolone >5mg, 13% prednisolone ≤5mg). A severe outcome was observed in n = 25(31.9%); n = 11 required assisted ventilation and n = 19 died. With the exception of Leflunomide, conventional and biologic DMARDs did not appear to confer a higher risk for severe outcome (table 1). Of note, anti-TNF therapy was associated with a non-serious outcome (p = 0.04) and prednisolone>5mg with a serious outcome (p = 0.08). Conclusion Preliminary data from this Scotland-wide ARD COVID-19 registry evidences variation in the impact of standard ARD therapies on the severity of COVID-19 outcome. In general, background csDMARD and bDMARD use does not appear to be a risk factor for severe outcomes. However, anti-TNF therapy may confer a favourable outcome, while leflunomide and corticosteroids may have the opposite effect. Rheumatologists should be aware of these possible risk factors and continue to contribute to registries to help establish whether these putative signals are clinically relevant. Disclosure M.

Main funding source(s): Fundación del Corazón INTRODUCTION: COVID19 has spread uncontrollably all over the world through this 2020 year. As a new entity, we did not know the potential cardiovascular manifestations of this infectious disease. This national registry was created to describe the cardiac affection and its severity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter registry was conducted, including 28 centers in Spain. Patients with COVID19 diagnosis presenting an acute cardiovascular event between March 1st and May 30th were included. Eighty-two patients were included. Of them, 49 (76,6%) presented with acute coronary syndrome; the rest were diagnosed of acute myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy. The majority of cases were STEMI (n = 31), while the remaining 35,4% presented as NSTEMI. 29 patients (61,7%) underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (Figure 1). Anterior (n = 18) and inferior (n = 16) were the most frequent locations. Coronary angiogram showed total occlusion in 20 patients (55,6%); while 7 patients presented with non-obstructive coronary arteries. PCI was done in 31 patients. Eight patients (17,8%) developed Killip III-IV myocardial infarction. A total of 10 patients required endotracheal intubation and vasoactive agent were needed in 11 patients; none required IABP or ECMO. In-hospital mortality rate was 26,2%.

53319,124 Post-operative mortality and risk of COVID-19 in patients receiving urgent elective surgical care at a COVID clean facility during the COVID 19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study,2021-05-04,"Introduction: COVID-19 infection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with new-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. There are currently limited reports observing the effect of COVID-19 infection on outcomes in patients hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Methods: This retrospective study used electronic medical records, between March 1, 2020 to September 14, 2020, and included patients aged ≥ 18 years with DKA. Clinical characteristics, hospital course, and complications (ICD-10 codes) were compared between patients admitted with DKA and confirmed COVID-19 infection (COVID+) to those with DKA without COVID-19 infection (COVID-). The American Diabetes Association criteria was used to define DKA. Results: Among 757 patients with DKA, 80 COVID+ patients with and 677 COVID- patients were included (mean age 49.1 years, female 52.7%, African-American 70.4%). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The COVID+ group had a lower admission glucose (mean glucose 413.1 ± 218.7 mg/dL vs 441.1 ± 222.6 mg/dL, p-value 0.05), and higher serum bicarbonate levels (18.2 mmol/L vs 16.6 mmol/L, p-value <0.05) compared to the COVID- group. Compared to the COVID- group, COVID+ required a longer time to achieve blood glucose < 250 mg/dl from admission (8.8 hours vs 7.1 hours, p-value <0.01), and had higher rates of acute respiratory failure (48.8% vs 9.5%, p-value <0.001), mechanical ventilation (32.5% vs 10.9%, p-value <0.001), sepsis (37.5% vs 15.7%, p-value <0.001), acute thrombotic events (11.3% vs 2.7%, p-value <0.05), and pneumonia (70% vs 10.3%, p-value <0.001). COVID+ had higher mortality (16.3% vs 3.1%, p-value < 0.001), ICU length of stay (median 5.5 days or 2–58 days vs median 2 days or 2–123 days, p-value <0.001), and total LOS (median 7.5 or 1–47 days vs median 5 days or 1–98 days, p-value <0.001). Both groups required similar total insulin doses throughout the entire hospitalization (mean 143 +/- (SD) vs 142 +/- SD units, p-value 0.088). Conclusion: Our data shows that COVID-19 infection is associated with increased mortality, worse clinical outcomes, and longer LOS among patients hospitalized with DKA, while presenting with less severe hyperglycemia and acidemia compared to those without COVID-19 infection.","Hwang, Patricia; Vellanki, Priyathama; Galindo, Rodolfo Javier; Brechtelsbauer, Erika; Van Prooyen, Amanda; Ashraf, Shanza",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135578/,272
53331,25 Operative Delay in Neck of Femur Fracture Management During the COVID 19 Pandemic Lockdown; Reasons and Impact,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the commonest extra-articular complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is associated with a median survival of 3-8 years. Although biologic therapies are effective for synovitis, they can exacerbate the ILD. RA patients with significant ILD but minimal synovitis have limited therapeutic options. Case reports and retrospective analyses suggest that Abatacept may have efficacy in RA-ILD. However, use of potent immunosuppression in patients with chronic lung disease may increase the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety of Abatacept in patients with progressive RA-ILD. Methods This was a prospective, open-label, study of 19 RA patients (2010 ACR/EULAR criteria) with ILD. Patients were included if either serial thoracic computed tomography (CT) or pulmonary function tests (PFT) indicated progressive ILD over the preceding 14 months. Intravenous Abatacept was administered at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. PFTs, thoracic CT scan and questionnaires were performed at baseline and week 20. The number of LRTI was recorded. Primary outcome: change in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Secondary outcomes: Transfer Factor (TLCOc), King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD) Questionnaire, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and radiological scores (percentage involvement of lung fields scored separately for ground-glass opacification, fibrosis, honeycombing and consolidation). Results Preliminary data from the study are reported. Ten patients completed the study: 6 male, 6 ex-smokers, mean age 68±8.21 years, mean RA duration 6±5.4 years. The APRIL study was terminated due to safety concerns in the context of COVID-19 pandemic; nine patients were withdrawn for this reason. LRTI occurred in 4 patients (one patient had 2 LRTI). There were no serious adverse reactions. The mean FVC remained stable during the course of the study. There was a trend towards improvement in the LCQ and improvement in the K-BILD score. ILD-related changes on thoracic CT were stable in 9 of the patients. Conclusion Our data indicates that abatacept has an acceptable safety profile in progressive pulmonary fibrosis associated with RA-ILD. This small dataset also suggests that ILD has not progressed during the period of treatment. Disclosure T. Gudu: None. C. Stober: None. M. Fifield: None. J. Babar: None. A. Ostor: None. H.

In this paper, we study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial market connectedness and systemic risk. Specifically, we test dynamically whether the network density of pandemic networks constructed by the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is a leading indicator of the financial network density and portfolio risk. Using rolling-window Granger-causality tests, we find strong evidence that the pandemic network density leads the financial network density and portfolio risk from February to April 2020. The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may exert significant impact on the systemic risk in financial markets.","So, Mike K. P.; Chan, Lupe S. H.; Chu, Amanda M.

58281,"A commentary on “ASA-ECOG as a combined tool for peri-operative risk stratification in COVID-19 survivors – A step towards optimizing healthcare resource utilization” (Int J Surg 2021, July:106062)",2021-09-30,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) could lead to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which has now been identified as a major cause of death after trauma if it is not adequately diagnosed and properly treated within the first 24 hours. CT examination is widely preferred for urgent ICH diagnosis, which enables the fast identification and detection of ICH regions. However, the use of it requires the clinical interpretation by experts to identify the subtypes of ICH. Besides, it is unable to provide the details needed to conduct quantitative assessment, such as the volume and thickness of hemorrhagic lesions, which may have prognostic importance to the decision-making on emergency treatment. In this paper, an optimal deep learning framework is proposed to assist the quantitative assessment for ICH diagnosis and the accurate detection of different subtypes of ICH through head CT scan. Firstly, the format of raw input data is converted from 3D DICOM to NIfTI. Secondly, a pre-trained multi-class semantic segmentation model is applied to each slice of CT images, so as to obtain a precise 3D mask of the whole ICH region. Thirdly, a fine-tuned classification neural network is employed to extract the key features from the raw input data and identify the subtypes of ICH. Finally, a quantitative assessment algorithm is adopted to automatically measure both thickness and volume via the 3D shape mask combined with the output probabilities of the classification network. The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework where the average accuracy of 96.21 percent is achieved for three types of hemorrhage. The capability of our optimal classification model to distinguish between different types of lesion plays a significant role in reducing the false-positive rate in the existing work. Furthermore, the results suggest that our automatic quantitative assessment algorithm is effective in providing clinically relevant quantification in terms of volume and thickness. It is more important than the qualitative assessment conducted through visual inspection to the decision-making on emergency surgical treatment.","Phaphuangwittayakul, Aniwat; Guo, Yi; Ying, Fangli; Dawod, Ahmad Yahya; Angkurawaranon, Salita; Angkurawaranon, Chaisiri",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475375/,272

Many hospital trusts do not currently offer formal mechanisms to ensure the quality of supervision is at a high standard. Our Trust wanted to empower trainees to offer objective feedback on the quality of the supervisors. METHODS We introduced a feedback form sent to all Foundation doctors at our Trust. The questionnaire was designed to identify whether ESs were meeting their responsibilities as defined by the Health Education England South West's Severn Deanery. We collected data throughout the academic year 2017-2018 (Year 1) as a pilot, before rolling out the definitive questionnaire with minor modifications from 2018 to 2019 (Year 2). RESULTS All respondents met with their supervisor within the first month of the placement and 90.7% of the trainees found it easy to meet with their supervisor. The Trust received generally very good feedback for all of its supervisors. Low numbers (4/120 trainees) reported supervisors not engaging with the exception reporting process. CONCLUSION Our Trust provides ESs of a high standard. The authors believe collecting feedback for ESs will achieve three things: 1) Drive up standards through increasing accountability of ESs receiving objective feedback. This will be of critical importance in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and the changes to our work it has necessitated. 2) Empower trainees to make informed decisions about where they wish to train and under which supervisors. 3) Facilitate revalidation and appraisal for supervisors by collecting data from trainees on the quality of their supervision.","Heining, Christopher James; Wheeler, Marie; Fletcher, Peter",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32820086/,272
60296,The escalation of the opioid epidemic due to COVID-19 and resulting lessons about treatment alternatives.,2020-07-01,"Advances in the understanding of RNA biological processing and control are leading to new concepts in human therapeutics with practical implications for many human diseases, including antiviral therapy of respiratory viruses. So-called 'non-coding RNA' exerts specific and profound functional control on regulation of protein production and indeed controls the expression of all genes through processes collectively known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a naturally occurring intracellular process that regulates gene expression through the silencing of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Methods are being developed that allow the catalytic degradation of targeted mRNAs using specifically designed complementary small interfering RNAs (siRNA). siRNAs are now being chemically modified and packaged into advanced delivery systems so as to acquire drug-like properties and the ability to deliver their effects systemically. Recent in vivo studies have provided proofs of the concept that RNAi may be useful therapeutically. Much of the design of these siRNAs can be accomplished bioinformatically, thus potentially expediting drug discovery and opening new avenues of therapy for many uncommon, orphan, or emerging diseases. Theoretically, any disease that can be ameliorated through knockdown of any endogenous or exogenous protein is a potential therapeutic target for RNAi-based therapeutics. Lung diseases in general are attractive targets for RNAi therapeutics, since the location of affected cells increases their accessibility to topical administration of siRNA, and respiratory viral infections are particularly attractive targets for RNAi-based drug discovery and development. RNAi therapeutics have been shown to exert potent antiviral effects against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, influenza, coronaviruses, measles and human metapneumoviruses in vitro and in vivo. Recently, a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of an RNAi-based therapeutic against RSV demonstrated that this technology has therapeutic activity, representing the first proof-of-concept test of efficacy for RNAi's therapeutic effect in humans. This review discusses the science behind RNAi and the potential practical issues in applying this technology to various respiratory viral diseases.","DeVincenzo, John P",Antiviral therapy,https://doi.org/10.3851/imp2064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22311654/,272

Chromosomal diagnostic tests showed no abnormalities. CASE REPORT The infant experienced severe central apneas successfully treated with oxygen therapy and caffeine medication; functional motor level was established at L5 with sparse anal sphincter function. DISCUSSION After surgical intervention (myelomeningocele repair and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement), these abnormalities significantly improved on radiological imaging; the preoperative hypoplastic, almost undetectable, cerebellum developed to a fair sized cerebellum. Apneas disappeared over time and the patient showed further developmental improvement. Herein, we illustrate and discuss the changes of the cerebellar volume before and after neurosurgical intervention.","Kronenburg, Annick; Han, Kuo Sen; Gooskens, Rob; Esposito, Giuseppe; Cochrane, Douglas; Woerdeman, Peter",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-013-2156-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686389/,272

We sought to determine the impact of gestational age upon this form of targeted amniotic cell profiling. METHODS Sprague-Dawley fetuses with retinoic acid-induced NTDs (n = 110) underwent amniotic fluid procurement at four time points in gestation. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of cells concomitantly expressing Nestin and Sox-2 (neural stem cells, aNSCs) and cells concomitantly expressing CD29 and CD44 (mesenchymal stem cells, aMSCs). Statistical analysis was by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p < 0.05). RESULTS There was a statistically significant impact of gestational age on the proportions of both aMSCs (p = 0.01) and aNSCs (p < 0.01) in fetuses with isolated spina bifida. No such impact was noted in normal fetuses (p > 0.10 for both cells), in isolated exencephaly (p > 0.10 for both cells), or in combination defects (p > 0.10 for both cells). Gestational age had no effect on aNSC/aMSC ratios. CONCLUSIONS Targeted quantitative amniotic cell profiling varies with gestational age in experimental isolated spina bifida. This finding should be considered prior to the eventual translation of this diagnostic adjunct into the prenatal evaluation of these anomalies. © 2014 S.

The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the patient outcomes that are associated with alternative models of genetic testing and genetic counseling for hereditary cancer, including germline-only and tumor testing models. Seven databases were searched, selecting studies that were: (1) full-text articles published ≥2007 or conference abstracts published ≥2015, and (2) assessing patient outcomes of an alternative model of genetic counseling or testing. A total of 79 publications were included for review and synthesis. Data-charting was completed using a data-charting form that was developed by the study team for this review. Seven alternative models were identified, including four models that involved a genetic counselor: telephone, telegenic, group, and embedded genetic counseling models; and three models that did not: mainstreaming, direct, and tumor-first genetic testing models. Overall, these models may be an acceptable alternative to traditional models on knowledge, patient satisfaction, psychosocial measures, and the uptake of genetic testing; however, particular populations may be better served by traditional in-person genetic counseling. As precision medicine initiatives continue to advance, institutions should consider the implementation of new models of genetic service delivery, utilizing a model that will best serve the needs of their unique patient populations.","McCuaig, Jeanna M; Armel, Susan Randall; Care, Melanie; Volenik, Alexandra; Kim, Raymond H; Metcalfe, Kelly A",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers10110435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428547/,272

There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, although cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of a non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.","Lv, Huibin; Wu, Nicholas C; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Yuan, Meng; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Leung, Wai Shing; So, Ray T Y; Chan, Jacky Man Chun; Yip, Garrick K; Chik, Thomas Shiu Hong; Wang, Yiquan; Choi, Chris Yau Chung; Lin, Yihan; Ng, Wilson W; Zhao, Jincun; Poon, Leo L M; Peiris, J S Malik; Wilson, Ian A; Mok, Chris K P",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684246/,272

The optimum condition to remove off-flavor of the bean and maximize functionality and efficiency was light roasting and cryogenic grinding (<53 μm). In this condition, extraction yield was 16.75%, total phenolic content (TPC) was 69.82 ± 0.35 mg gallic acid equivalents/g, and total flavonoid content (TFC) was 168.81 ± 1.64 mg quercetin equivalents/100 g. The antioxidant properties were 77.58 ± 0.27% for DPPH radical scavenging activity and 58.02 ± 0.76 mg Trolox equivalents/g for ABTS radical scavenging activity. The values of TFC and ABTS radical scavenging activity were significantly higher (p<0.05) than in other conditions, and TPC and DPPH radical scavenging activity were second highest in lightly roasted beans following raw beans. HS-SPME/GC-MS analysis confirmed that the amino acids and carbohydrates that are the main components of sword bean were condensed into other volatile flavor compounds such as derivatives of furan, pyrazine, and pyrrole during roasting. Roasted and cryogenic-ground sword beans showed higher functionality in terms of TFC, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging activities compared to those of coffee. Overall results showed that light roasting and cryogenic grinding are the most suitable processing conditions for enhancing the bioactivity of sword beans.","Jung, Ju-Yeong; Rhee, Jin-Kyu",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2003.03069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830188/,272

Compelling experimental evidence indicates that face conveys plenty of information that are fundamental for humans to interact. These are encoded at neural level in specific cortical and subcortical brain regions through activity- and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity processes. The current pandemic, due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, is causing relevant social and psychological detrimental effects. The institutional recommendations on physical distancing, namely social distancing and wearing of facemasks are effective in reducing the rate of viral spread. However, by impacting social interaction, facemasks might impair the neural responses to recognition of facial cues that are overall critical to our behaviors. In this survey, we briefly review the current knowledge on the neurobiological substrate of facial recognition and discuss how the lack of salient stimuli might impact the ability to retain and consolidate learning and memory phenomena underlying face recognition.

This first-in-human trial aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed after prior EGFR-TKI therapy. METHODS This phase I, open-label, multicenter clinical trial (NCT0298110) included dose-escalation (55, 110, 220 and 260 mg) and dose-expansion cohorts (55, 110 and 220 mg) with once-daily oral administration of almonertinib. In each expansion cohort, tumor biopsies were obtained for determination of EGFR T790M status. The safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of almonertinib were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 120 patients (26 patients in the dose-escalation cohort and 94 patients in the dose-expansion cohort) were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose was not defined in the dose-escalation phase; the 260 mgregimen was not further evaluated in the dose-expansion phase due to safety concerns and saturation of exposure. The most common treatment-related grade ≥3 adverse events were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (10%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (3%). Among 94 patients with the EGFR T790M mutation in the dose-expansion cohort, the investigator-assessed objective response rate and disease control rate were 52% (95%CI: 42-63) and 92% (95%CI: 84∼96), respectively. Median progression∼free survival was 11.0 months (95%CI: 9.5∼not reached) months.

Transabdominal breast augmentation permits insertion of breast implants through the abdominoplasty incision. This combined procedure is preferentially performed in an outpatient setting under monitored anesthesia care and nerve blocks. METHODS This study was a 14-year retrospective review of a single surgeon's technique and outcomes using transabdominal breast augmentation through a low transverse abdominoplasty incision in select patients requesting simultaneous abdominoplasty and bilateral breast augmentation. Patients had minimal ptosis, smoking cessation a minimum of 4 weeks before surgery and indefinitely thereafter, and a lack of superior abdominal or significant breast surgery. RESULTS The study's 114 patients had a mean follow-up of 19.2 months. The procedure was performed under monitored anesthesia care with intercostal nerve blocks for most patients [n = 107 (93.9 percent)] and general anesthesia [n = 7 (6.1 percent)] for a few. Seventy-nine patients [n = 74 (64.9 percent)] underwent additional procedures, with most (n = 48) undergoing suction-assisted lipectomy. Many patients underwent multiple procedures. Most complications occurred predictably along the central distal abdominoplasty flap and were minor (small wound breakdown, seroma, and mild skin infection). Major complications [n = 8 (7.0 percent)] included two patients with implant malposition requiring revision and one patient with a Baker grade III capsule; notably, this patient was a half-pack-per-day smoker with a body mass index of 27 kg/m. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal breast augmentation is a safe, reliable procedure in the appropriately selected, healthy patient and may be used in minimally to moderately ptotic patients who request concurrent breast augmentation and abdominoplasty.

OBJECTIVES We compare two different methods of wound closure in elective plastic surgical cases: barbed 3/0 V-Loc™180 suture and smooth 3/0 Maxon™ sutures, both polyglyconate monofilament synthetic absorbable sutures. We assessed the aesthetic long-term results with a minimum two year follow up. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized controlled study with internal control. A single surgeon performed all cases. Patients who underwent elective operations that involved long wound closure were enrolled in the study. Each patient acted as their own internal control with half their wound being sutured with 3/0 V-Loc™180 barbed suture and the other half with smooth 3/0 Maxon™ deep dermal sutures and then a subcuticular skin closure. In both groups, the superficial fascial system was closed with 1 Vicryl interrupted sutures on both sides. Long-term cosmesis was evaluated using the modified Hollander cosmesis score by review of standardized postoperative photographs by 9 blinded plastic surgeons and specialist registrars. RESULTS The study reports on 33 female patients. The time taken for wound closure was significantly reduced using the barbed suture (p < 0.001). There was no difference in the complication ratio in either group. Two-year aesthetic outcome was significantly superior when using the barbed suture (p = 0.0075). CONCLUSION Barbed sutures closure of long wounds is faster and produces a better long-term aesthetic outcome than smooth sutures.","Koide, S; Smoll, N R; Liew, J; Smith, K; Rizzitelli, A; Findlay, M W; Hunter-Smith, D J","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2015.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25840525/,272

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two female (49 ± 15 years) and nine male (53 ± 13 years) subjects were studied to determine the time course of the physostigmine effect on hippocampus blood flow with ASL perfusion imaging during 20 minutes of baseline, 30 minutes of physostigmine infusion at 1.0 mg/hr, and 70 minutes of recovery. RESULTS Hippocampus perfusion decreased steadily over the course of the infusion, with the reduction in flow becoming significant after 20 minutes of infusion, reaching lowest levels near the end of infusion, and remaining significantly low and stable in the 70-minute recovery period. Percentage changes of hippocampus perfusion were -13.3%, -13.4%, and -13.4% for left, right, and bilateral hippocampus, respectively, at the end of infusion. CONCLUSION At a dose rate of 1.0 mg/hr it is feasible to use an infusion time as short as 20 minutes, performing perfusion imaging up to an hour after physostigmine infusion is discontinued, to minimize chances for adverse side effects.","Li, Xiufeng; Spence, Jeffrey S; Buhner, David M; Haley, Robert W; Briggs, Richard W",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.22821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964728/,272

Here, we determined irradiation doses to safely inactivate liquid proteinaceous specimens harboring different emerging/reemerging viral pathogens known to cause neglected tropical and other diseases of regional or global public health importance. By using a representative arenavirus, bunyavirus, coronavirus, filovirus, flavivirus, orthomyxovirus, and paramyxovirus, we found that these enveloped viruses differed in their susceptibility to irradiation treatment with adsorbed doses for inactivation of a target dose of 1 × 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL ranging from 1 to 5 MRads. This finding seemed generally inversely correlated with genome size. Our data may help to guide other facilities in testing and verifying safe inactivation procedures.","Feldmann, Friederike; Shupert, W Lesley; Haddock, Elaine; Twardoski, Barri; Feldmann, Heinz",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30860018/,272
70899,The challenge of Burnout in Public Medical Teachers in Pakistan: A mixed methods study.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Cerebral vasospasm (cVSP) is a frequent complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), with a significant impact on outcome. Beta blockers (BBs) may blunt the sympathetic effect and catecholamine surge associated with ruptured cerebral aneurysms and prevent cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preadmission BB therapy and cVSP, cardiac dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality following aSAH. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with aSAH who were treated at a tertiary high-volume neurovascular referral center. The exposure was defined as any preadmission BB therapy. The primary outcome was cVSP assessed by serial transcranial Doppler with any mean flow velocity ≥ 120 cm/sec and/or need for endovascular intervention for medically refractory cVSP. Secondary outcomes were cardiac dysfunction (defined as cardiac troponin-I elevation > 0.05 μg/L, low left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%, or LV wall motion abnormalities [LVWMA]) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 210 patients treated between February 2009 and September 2010 (55% were women), with a mean age of 53.4 ± 13 years and median Hunt and Hess Grade III (interquartile range III-IV). Only 13% (27/210) of patients were exposed to preadmission BB therapy. Compared with these patients, a higher percentage of patients not exposed to preadmission BBs had transcranial Doppler-mean flow velocity ≥ 120 cm/sec (59% vs 22%; p = 0.003). In multivariate analyses, lower Hunt and Hess grade (OR 3.9; p < 0.001) and preadmission BBs (OR 4.5; p = 0.002) were negatively associated with cVSP. In multivariate analysis, LVWMA (OR 2.7; p = 0.002) and low LVEF (OR 1.1; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Low LVEF (OR 3.9; p = 0.05) independently predicted medically refractory cVSP. The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with LVWMA (47.4% vs 14.8%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study data suggest that preadmission therapy with BBs is associated with lower incidence of cVSP after aSAH. LV dysfunction was associated with higher medically refractory cVSP and in-hospital mortality. BB therapy may be considered after aSAH as a cardioprotective and cVSP preventive therapy.","Chalouhi, Nohra; Daou, Badih; Okabe, Toshimasa; Starke, Robert M; Dalyai, Richard; Bovenzi, Cory D; Anderson, Eliza Claire; Barros, Guilherme; Reese, Adam; Jabbour, Pascal; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Rosenwasser, Robert; Kraft, Walter K; Rincon, Fred",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.7.jns15956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26799296/,272

This study described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ARIs in children hospitalized in Vietnam. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children with ARIs at Ho Chi Minh City Children's Hospital 2 between April 2010 and May 2011 in order to detect respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. Viruses were found in 64% of 1082 patients, with 12% being co-infections. The leading detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV; 30%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 23·8%), and human bocavirus (HBoV; 7·2%). HRV was detected all year round, while RSV epidemics occurred mainly in the rainy season. Influenza A (FluA) was found in both seasons. The other viruses were predominant in the dry season. HRV was identified in children of all age groups. RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, PIV3 and HBoV, and FluA were detected predominantly in children aged 24 months, respectively. Significant associations were found between PIV1 with croup (P < 0·005) and RSV with bronchiolitis (P < 0·005). HBoV and HRV were associated with hypoxia (P < 0·05) and RSV with retraction (P < 0·05). HRV, RSV, and HBoV were detected most frequently and they may increase the severity of ARIs in children.","Tran, D N; Trinh, Q D; Pham, N T K; Vu, M P; Ha, M T; Nguyen, T Q N; Okitsu, S; Hayakawa, S; Mizuguchi, M; Ushijima, H",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s095026881500134x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26145204/,272

As the outbreak is ongoing, more and more researchers focused interest on the COVID-19. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the publications about COVID-19 to summarize the research hotspots and make a review, to provide reference for researchers in the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a search in PubMed using the keywords ""COVID-19"" from inception to March 1, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus. RESULTS 183 publications published from 2020 January 14 to 2020 February 29 were included in the study. The first corresponding authors of the publications were from 20 different countries. Among them, 78 (42.6%) from the hospital, 64 (35%) from the university and 39 (21.3%) from the research institution. All the publications were published in 80 different journals. Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n=25). 60 (32.8%) were original research, 29 (15.8%) were review, 20 (10.9%) were short communications. 68 (37.2%) epidemiology, 49 (26.8%) virology and 26 (14.2%) clinical features. CONCLUSIONS According to our review, China has provided a large number of research data for various research fields, during the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the findings play an important role in preventing and controlling the epidemic around the world. With research on the COVID-19 still booming, new vaccine and effective medicine for COVID-19 will be expected to come out in the near future with the joint efforts of researchers worldwide.","Lou, J; Tian, S-J; Niu, S-M; Kang, X-Q; Lian, H-X; Zhang, L-X; Zhang, J-J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271460/,272

75878,Managing patients with prostate cancer during COVID-19 pandemic: the experience of a high-volume robotic surgery center.,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Closure of all haemodynamically significant atrial septal defects (ASDs) is recommended irrespective of symptoms. Percutaneous device closure offers a favourable alternative to surgery with lower morbidity, shorter duration of hospital stays, and avoidance of a surgical scar. Though device closure is generally a safe procedure with high success rates, certain complications can arise including device embolization which poses a significant challenge for the treating team. We report one such case in which the ASD closure device got spontaneously released and embolized from the delivery cable into the left atrium prior to its deployment. We describe our approach for its retrieval and subsequently its successful deployment across the septal defect using a gooseneck snare. CASE PRESENTATION A 5-year-old asymptomatic child was found to have a murmur on a routine check-up. Evaluation revealed a haemodynamically significant, 18-mm ostium secundum ASD with normal pulmonary pressures and suitable margins for device closure. A 20-mm ASD closure device was traversed via an 8-Fr delivery system. While manipulating the left atrial (LA) disc from the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) approach, the device got spontaneously released. The right atrial (RA) disc was caught across the ASD, into the left atrium. This was confirmed by intraoperative transthoracic echocardiography and fluoroscopy. The haemodynamics and rhythm were stable. A 20-mm gooseneck snare was immediately passed through the delivery sheath and an attempt was made to catch the screw. With difficulty, the RA screw was caught with the snare and multiple attempts to retrieve the device into the sheath were unsuccessful. However, while negotiating, we were able to secure a favourable position of the device across the atrial septal defect, and after fluoroscopic and echocardiographic confirmation, the device was released. The child remained stable thereafter and was discharged 2 days later. CONCLUSIONS Gooseneck snare is a valuable tool in the management of embolized ASD closure device. Occasionally, like in the index case, one may be successful in retrieving the embolized device and repositioning it across the ASD using a gooseneck snare, thus obviating the need for emergency surgery.","Batta, Akash; Naganur, Sanjeev; Rajan, Ajay; Ary, Kunwer Abhishek; Gawalkar, Atit; Barwad, Parag",The Egyptian heart journal : (EHJ) : official bulletin of the Egyptian Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-021-00175-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091794/,272
76035,The role of continuous spinal anesthesia in COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND Pediatric cardiac patients are at risk for perioperative respiratory insufficiency. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of perioperative lung ultrasound examination in pediatric cardiac surgery. METHODS In this randomized, controlled trial, children (5 yr old or younger) undergoing cardiac surgery were allocated into a control (n = 61) or intervention (n = 61) group. The control group received only lung ultrasound examinations at the end of surgery and 6 to 12 h after surgery. The intervention group received lung ultrasound examinations and an ultrasound-guided recruitment maneuver depending on ultrasound findings after inducing anesthesia, at the end of surgery, and 6 to 12 h after surgery. Primary outcomes were incidences of intra- and postoperative desaturation, and postoperative pulmonary complications. Multiple comparisons were corrected (P ≤ 0.017) in the primary outcome analysis. RESULTS Of the 120 children included in the analysis, postoperative desaturation (64% vs. 27%; P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 0.210; 95% CI, 0.097 to 0.456) occurred more in the control group. The incidences of intraoperative desaturation (36% vs. 19%; P = 0.033; OR, 0.406; 95% CI, 0.176 to 0.939) and postoperative pulmonary complications (12% vs. 3%; P = 0.093; OR, 0.271; 95% CI, 0.054 to 1.361) were similar between the groups. Lung ultrasound scores were better in the intervention group than in the control group. Duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in the control group than in the intervention group (38 ± 43 vs. 26 ± 25 h; 95% CI of mean difference, 0 to 25; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS Perioperative lung ultrasound examination followed by ultrasound-guided recruitment maneuver helped decrease postoperative desaturation events and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation in pediatric cardiac patients.

Since then, over 1100 papers citing the manuscript have been published. Our goal is to compare the field's progress to the originally proposed research agenda, and outline recommendations for the next 10 years. To accomplish this, we are conducting the proposed scoping review. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our approach is informed by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews. We will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We first aim to assess the degree to which each implementation outcome has been investigated in the literature, including healthcare settings, clinical populations and innovations represented. We next aim to describe the relationship between implementation strategies and outcomes. Our last aim is to identify studies that empirically assess relationships among implementation and/or service and client outcomes. We will use a forward citation tracing approach to identify all literature that cited the 2011 paper in the Web of Science (WOS) and will supplement this with citation alerts sent to the second author for a 6-month period coinciding with the WOS citation search. Our review will focus on empirical studies that are designed to assess at least one of the identified implementation outcomes in the 2011 taxonomy and are published in peer-reviewed journals. We will generate descriptive statistics from extracted data and organise results by these research aims. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No human research participants will be involved in this review. We plan to share findings through a variety of means including peer-reviewed journal publications, national conference presentations, invited workshops and webinars, email listservs affiliated with our institutions and professional associations, and academic social media.","Lengnick-Hall, Rebecca; Proctor, Enola K; Bunger, Alicia C; Gerke, Donald R",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145020/,272

The current state of affairs of the chemical industry as seen in its historical context offers a perspective for the future. The chemical industry developed in the 19th century from efforts to replace naturally occurring materials rubber and ivory. Revisiting nature for inspiration with today's far more advanced chemistry knowledge offers an abundance of opportunities for fundamental research as well as applied technology development with commercial perspectives. Beyond the covalent bond as practiced by synthetic petrochemistry for making a wealth of small-, oligo-, and macro-molecules there exists a vast area, barely explored, of bio-materials with seemingly endless structure-forming capability and functionality. These non-covalent, intermolecular forces working at several length and time scales define functional materials that may offer opportunities to tackle the challenges of sustainability. Such coming from a combination of synthetic polymer chemistry and chemistry inspired by nature form a future path to innovation and sustainable growth. They bring a basis for materials differentiation and renewed competitiveness in the chemical industry.","Koopmans, R J",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b602948e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680231/,272

Using whole-genome sequencing on 23 paired Barrett's esophagus and EAC samples, together with one in-depth Barrett's esophagus case study sampled over time and space, we have provided the following new insights: (i) Barrett's esophagus is polyclonal and highly mutated even in the absence of dysplasia; (ii) when cancer develops, copy number increases and heterogeneity persists such that the spectrum of mutations often shows surprisingly little overlap between EAC and adjacent Barrett's esophagus; and (iii) despite differences in specific coding mutations, the mutational context suggests a common causative insult underlying these two conditions.

The main purpose of this study was to confirm that the behavioural determinants we had identified from theory were related as predicted to intentions and to establish the validity of our measures of behavioural intentions. Participants (N = 84) completed a self-report web-delivered questionnaire measuring intentions to engage in hand washing and the hypothesised behavioural determinants of intentions, based on the theory of planned behaviour and protection motivation theory. In a factorial 2 × 2 design, half of the participants were first randomised to receive messages about potential negative consequences of pandemic flu (the ""high-threat"" condition) and half were assigned to receive ""coping"" messages describing the rationale and effectiveness of hand washing for reducing the risk of infection. A substantial proportion of variance in intentions was explained by measures of attitudes (instrumental and affective), social norms (descriptive and injunctive), perceived behavioural control (especially, access to hand gel) and perceived risk (in particular, the likelihood of catching pandemic flu). Our measures of intentions were sensitive to between-group differences, and although our design did not permit causal inference (particularly in view of selective dropout among those required to read most web pages), the pattern of differences was in the expected direction, that is, hand-washing intentions tended to be stronger in those receiving the high-threat message and coping messages. This study provided encouraging confirmation that our intervention development was proceeding correctly. Measures of intentions proved sensitive to group differences, and the behavioural determinants included in the study explained a substantial proportion of the variance in intentions. The study also provided useful indications that our high-threat message might increase hand-washing intentions, that providing hand gel might be beneficial and that it would be necessary to actively manage the risk of selective dropout in the intervention group.","Miller, Sascha; Yardley, Lucy; Little, Paul","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2011.564188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21644184/,272

BACKGROUND Repair of large hiatus hernia is associated with radiological recurrence rates of up to 30%, and to improve outcomes mesh repair has been recommended. Previous trials have shown less short-term recurrence with mesh, but adverse outcomes limit mesh use. METHODS Multicentre prospective double blind randomized controlled trial of 3 methods of repair: sutures versus absorbable mesh versus nonabsorbable mesh. Primary outcome-hernia recurrence assessed by barium meal radiology and endoscopy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes-clinical symptom scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS A total of 126 patients enrolled: 43 sutures, 41 absorbable mesh, and 42 nonabsorbable mesh. Among them, 96.0% were followed up to 12 months, with objective follow-up data in 92.9%. A recurrent hernia (any size) was identified in 23.1% after suture repair, 30.8% after absorbable mesh, and 12.8% after nonabsorbable mesh (P = 0.161). Clinical outcomes were similar, except less heartburn at 3 and 6 months and less bloating at 12 months with nonabsorbable mesh; more heartburn at 3 months, odynophagia at 1 month, nausea at 3 and 12 months, wheezing at 6 months; and inability to belch at 12 months after absorbable mesh. The magnitudes of the clinical differences were small. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences were seen for recurrent hiatus hernia, and the clinical differences were unlikely to be clinically significant. Overall outcomes after sutured repair were similar to mesh repair.","Watson, David I; Thompson, Sarah K; Devitt, Peter G; Smith, Lorelle; Woods, Simon D; Aly, Ahmad; Gan, Susan; Game, Philip A; Jamieson, Glyn G",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25119120/,272

Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, yet some atypical symptoms like loss of smell and taste have also been described. 20% require hospital admission due to severe disease, a third of whom need intensive support. Treatment is primarily supportive, however, prognosis is dismal in those who need invasive ventilation. Trials are ongoing to discover effective vaccines and drugs to combat the disease. Preventive strategies aim at reducing the transmission of disease by contact tracing, washing of hands, use of face masks and government-led lockdown of unnecessary activities to reduce the risk of transmission.","Adil, Md Tanveer; Rahman, Rumana; Whitelaw, Douglas; Jain, Vigyan; Al-Taan, Omer; Rashid, Farhan; Munasinghe, Aruna; Jambulingam, Periyathambi",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788312/,272

Objective To determine the levels of anxiety, depression and self-care symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Method Online survey distributed over three weeks using a non-probability sampling. The PHQ-9 Patient Health Questionnaire, the GAD-7 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Visual analog scale for self-care behaviors were used. Between-group (anxiety and depression) descriptive and comparison analyses were carried out. Results Out of 1508 included participants, 20.8% had symptoms of severe anxiety, while 27.5% showed symptoms of severe depression. Being a woman, being single, having no children, having medical comorbidities and a history of mental health care were risk factors for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression; 66 to 80 % of the population complied with self-care recommendations. A need for receiving mental health care was identified in our study population. Conclusion A larger number of individuals with moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms were observed than in other pandemics. COVID-19 pandemic psychological effects are considered an emerging public health problem, and implementation of programs for their care is therefore recommended.","Galindo-Vázquez, Oscar; Ramírez-Orozco, Mónica; Costas-Muñiz, Rosario; Mendoza-Contreras, Luis A; Calderillo-Ruíz, Germán; Meneses-García, Abelardo",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/gmm.20000266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831341/,272
83524,"Obesity in the Workplace: Impact, Outcomes, and Recommendations.",2018,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to characterize the physicomechanical, thermal, and degradation properties of several types of biologic scaffold materials to differentiate between the various materials. BACKGROUND As more biologic scaffold materials arrive on the market, it is critical that surgeons understand the properties of each material and are provided with resources to determine the suitability of these products for specific applications such as hernia repair. METHODS Twelve biologic scaffold materials were evaluated, including crosslinked and non-crosslinked; those of bovine, human, and porcine origin; and derivatives of pericardium, dermis, and small intestine submucosa. Physicomechanical, thermal, and degradation properties were evaluated through biomechanical testing, modulated differential scanning calorimetry, and collagenase digestion assays, respectively. Biomechanical testing included suture retention, tear strength, uniaxial tensile, and ball burst techniques. RESULTS All scaffolds exhibited suture retention strengths greater than 20 N, but only half of the scaffolds exhibited tear resistance greater than 20 N, indicating that some scaffolds may not provide adequate resistance to tearing. A wide range of burst strengths were observed ranging from 66.2 ± 10.8 N/cm for Permacol to 1,028.0 ± 199.1 N/cm for X-Thick AlloDerm, and all scaffolds except SurgiMend, Strattice, and CollaMend exhibited strains in the physiological range of 10% to 30% (at a stress of 16 N/cm). Thermal analysis revealed differences between crosslinked and non-crosslinked materials with crosslinked bovine pericardium and porcine dermis materials exhibiting a higher melting temperature than their non-crosslinked counterparts. Similarly, the collagenase digestion assay revealed that crosslinked bovine pericardium materials resisted enzymatic degradation significantly longer than non-crosslinked bovine pericardium. CONCLUSIONS Although differences were observed because of cross-linking, some crosslinked and non-crosslinked materials exhibited very similar properties. Variables other than cross-linking, such as decellularization/sterilization treatments or species/tissue type also contribute to the properties of the scaffolds.","Deeken, Corey R; Eliason, Braden J; Pichert, Matthew D; Grant, Sheila A; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3182445341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22314328/,272
85039,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Telemedicine Implementation on Practice Patterns and Electronic Health Record Utilization in an Academic Rheumatology Practice.,2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND Children who experience traumatic physical injuries are at risk of developing acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early identification and treatment of these high-risk children can lead to improved mental health outcomes in this population. OBJECTIVE This study assesses the feasibility of a study protocol that compares 3 screening tools for identifying patients at a high risk of later development of acute stress disorder or PTSD among pediatric trauma patients. METHODS This pilot study compared 3 questionnaires used as screening tools for predictors of later development of PTSD in a convenience sample of pediatric trauma patients aged 7-17 years. Patients were randomized to one of 3 screening tools. Families were contacted at 30, 60, and 90-120 days postinjury to complete the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the screening tools were compared for the diagnosis of PTSD defined using the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. RESULTS Of the 263 patients identified for possible enrollment, 52 patients met full inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Only 29 (55.7%) patients completed at least one follow-up questionnaire. The prevalence of acute stress disorder and PTSD in our population was 41% (95% CI [24, 61]) and 31% (95% CI [15, 51]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, we sought to determine the utility of the 3 commonly used screening instruments for measuring traumatic stress symptoms in pediatric trauma patients to predict the diagnosis of acute stress disorder or PTSD. Limitations include the use of the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms screening tool as the gold standard for calculating test characteristics and lack of 24/7 enrollment capabilities. As such, a significant portion of patients were discharged prior to our teams' engagement for enrollment.","Mazo, Ashley; Waddell, Megan; Raddatz, Julia; Blankenship, Kelly; Rachal, James C; Reynolds, Stacy; Christmas, A Britton",Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jtn.0000000000000591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210943/,272

The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate different reprocessing methods and to determine the mechanical integrity and functionality of tracheostomy tubes following reprocessing. METHODS Sixteen cuffed or un-cuffed tracheostomy tubes obtained from hospital in-patients were reprocessed using one of the following reprocessing methods: a) manual brushing and rinsing with tap water, b) manual brushing followed by disinfection with a glutaraldehyde solution, c) manual brushing followed machine-based cleaning in a dishwasher, and d) manual brushing followed by ultrasound cleaning in a commercially available ultrasound device. Microbial burden of the tubes before and after reprocessing was assessed by measurement of microbial colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of rinsing fluid. After cleaning, tracheostomy tubes were investigated for loss of functionality. FINDINGS Manual brushing and rinsing with tap water reduced microbial colonization in average by 10(2) CFU/mL, but with poor reproducibility and reliability. Complete microbial reduction was achieved only with additional chemical or machine-based thermal disinfection. Ultrasound sonification yielded no further microbial reduction after manual brushing. CONCLUSION Manual brushing alone will not result in complete eradication of microorganism colonising cuffed or un-cuffed tracheostomy tubes. However, manual cleaning followed by chemical or thermal disinfection may be regarded as safe and reproducible reprocessing method. If a machine-based reprocessing method is used for cuffed tubes, the cuffs' ventilation hose must be secured in a safe position prior to thermal disinfection.","Leonhard, Matthias; Assadian, Ojan; Zumtobel, Michaela; Schneider-Stickler, Berit",GMS hygiene and infection control,https://doi.org/10.3205/dgkh000262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958456/,272
86056,"Australian and New Zealand consensus statement on the management of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myeloma during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-05-15,"RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5 C) is a prevalent RNA modification in multiple RNA species, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and broadly distributed from archaea, prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The multiple detecting techniques of m5 C have been developed, such as m5 C-RIP-seq, miCLIP-seq, AZA-IP-seq, RNA-BisSeq, TAWO-seq, and Nanopore sequencing. These high-throughput techniques, combined with corresponding analysis pipeline, provide a precise m5 C landscape contributing to the deciphering of its biological functions. The m5 C modification is distributed along with mRNA and enriched around 5'UTR and 3'UTR, and conserved in tRNAs and rRNAs. It is dynamically regulated by its related enzymes, including methyltransferases (NSUN, DNMT, and TRDMT family members), demethylases (TET families and ALKBH1), and binding proteins (ALYREF and YBX1). So far, accumulative studies have revealed that m5 C participates in a variety of RNA metabolism, including mRNA export, RNA stability, and translation. Depletion of m5 C modification in the organism could cause dysfunction of mitochondria, drawback of stress response, frustration of gametogenesis and embryogenesis, abnormality of neuro and brain development, and has been implicated in cell migration and tumorigenesis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of dynamic regulatory elements of RNA m5 C, including methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and binding proteins (readers). We also summarized the related detecting technologies and biological functions of the RNA 5-methylcytosine, and provided future perspectives in m5 C research.

87687,Quality of osteoarthritis management and the need for reform in the US.,2011,"CONTEXT The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has built a presence in Tremont, a historically redlined neighborhood located in Bronx, NYC. As part of an agency-wide commitment to explicitly name racism as a threat to healthy communities, DOHMH has sought opportunities to educate and engage in discussion about historical and current structural racism. PROGRAM Between January and September 2018, DOHMH exhibited Undesign the Redline, a pictorial timeline and historical analysis of redlining, in its Tremont office. The exhibit exposed neglected history, making concrete the concept of structural racism. IMPLEMENTATION DOHMH staff led 101 tours for 950 visitors, including employees, community partners, and residents. Tours were given in English and Spanish in three 2-month cycles over 8 months. Tour guides also facilitated interactive workshops with youth groups, community-based organizations, and teams from city agencies to engage participants in the design and ownership of new systems intended to ""undesign"" the consequences of redlining. EVALUATION Immediate feedback was requested from all participants at the conclusion of each tour and was collected on a bulletin board. Longer-term impact was assessed through an electronic survey sent to all participants who provided valid contact information to better understand ways that the exhibit impacted personal and professional actions. Participants reported talking with family, friends, and coworkers, seeking more information, and applying an equity lens to professional projects after experiencing the exhibit. DISCUSSION Hosting the exhibit in a local health department building offered a concrete opportunity to learn about and discuss structural racism. Exhibit tours had immediate- and long-term impacts on participants and contributed to sustainable changes internal to DOHMH work. This work presents a concrete practice to make injustice visible and engage in open conversation about structural racism to build community trust.","Shiman, Lauren J; Freeman, Kim; Bedell, Jane; Bassett, Mary T",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956297/,272

METHODS We searched Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library between database inception and 26 June 2019 for longitudinal studies comparing incident HIV infection among women using an unspecified IUD or Cu-IUD compared with non-hormonal or no contraceptive users, or hormonal contraceptive users. We extracted information from included studies, assessed study quality, and summarised study findings. RESULTS From 2494 publications identified, seven met our inclusion criteria. One randomised controlled trial (RCT), judged ""informative with few limitations"", found no statistically significant differences in HIV risk between users of the Cu-IUD and either intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM) or levonorgestrel implant. One observational study, deemed ""informative but with important limitations"", found no statistically significant difference in HIV incidence among IUD users compared with women who had tubal ligation or who were not using any contraception. Another ""informative but with important limitations"" observational study found no difference in HIV incidence between Cu-IUD users and DMPA or norethisterone enanthate injectable, or implant users. An RCT considered ""unlikely to inform the primary question"" also found no difference in HIV risk between Cu-IUD and progestogen-only injectable users. Findings from the other three ""unlikely to inform the primary question"" cohort studies were consistent with the more robust studies suggesting no increased risk of HIV acquisition among Cu-IUD users. CONCLUSION The collective evidence, including that from a large high-quality RCT, does not indicate an increased risk of HIV acquisition among users of Cu-IUDs.","Hannaford, Philip C; Ti, Angeline; Chipato, Tsungai; Curtis, Kathryn M",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2019-200512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919240/,272

Observations show that the kidney damage caused by the new virus mutation is mainly tubular, with impairment of glomerular filtration and high levels of urea and creatinine. A study with seriously ill patients with COVID-19 showed that acute kidney injury was present in 29%. In the face of this evidence, based on recent studies, we can see the great renal contribution as an impact factor in the evolution of COVID-19, not just as a complicator of severity, but maybe part of the initial cascade of the process, requiring a deeper analysis using conventional biomarkers of kidney injury and more aggressive clinical intervention in patients at risk, in an attempt to reduce mortality.","Duarte, Pastora Maria de Araújo; Bastos Filho, Francisco André Gomes; Duarte, João Vitor Araujo; Duarte, Beatrice Araújo; Duarte, Isabella Araujo; Lemes, Romélia Pinheiro Gonçalves; Duarte, Fernando Barroso",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.10.1335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174922/,272

Cooperation between these professionals ensures the integrated management of patients with infectious diseases and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital pharmacists to abruptly suspend all their structured activities and concentrate on the health crisis. Realtime information sharing between different medicine specialties is an effective strategy to generate and maintain treatment protocols adapted to each center, with continuous evidence-based modifications as new publications appear. Hospital pharmacies had to reorganize their activities to respond to the pandemic. On the one side were patients with COVID-19, and on the other were routine hospital pharmacy tasks, with the added difficulty of adapting to individual protection measures. New communication and collaboration strategies were adopted. Protocols were established for the management of COVID-19 patients, with continuous changes; special medications had to be prepared and distributed; circuits were designed for the home- or institution-based care of patients; internal circuits were created to minimize the movements of hospital staff and professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. The most effective antiviral drug and anti inflammatory therapy remains elusive. In this scenario, hospital pharmacists emerge as a key player, as they have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs and potential interactions. In a setting where experimental drugs preferably tested in clinical trials are being used, the role of hospital pharmacists in interdisciplinary teams has become essential for the optimization of clinical outcomes.","Gil-Navarro, María Victoria; Luque-Márquez, Rafael",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533669/,272

CBP are known to play important roles in various diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer, and neuronal problems. However, the calculation of the binding affinity of calcium ion to CBP still possesses a significant challenge to the computational investigators. One of the main reasons for this difficulty is the polarization of CBP due to the binding of calcium. In the current work, we have used the implicit polarization method of Leontyev et al. (PCCP, 13.7 (2011): 2613-2626) to calculate the binding free energy of calcium ion binding to calmodulin, an important CBP. We have used the widely used MM-PBSA method to find a good protocol of calculation with implicit polarization. We have also optimized the best value of the calcium radius to match the experimental results. Our results show incorporation of polarization improves the agreement between the calculated and experimental results, although still, some discrepancy remains. On the whole, this work shows implicit polarization when combined with the MM-PBSA method can give results better than calculation without any polarization, and further improvement is necessary to get a quantitative match with experiments.

After the 2003 SARS epidemic, the pressure in Shenzhen to contain infectious disease has been considerable.

However, by establishing the migrants as dangerous, biological noncitizens, by denying connections between the migrants' experiences and their own experiences of migration, by failing to engage with the migrants as subjects, and by defending structures that institutionalized these exclusions, they undermined both the health of the migrants and the stability of the city they were trying to protect.","Mason, Katherine A",Medical anthropology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01459740.2011.610845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22515154/,272

The best method to secure airway devices is currently unknown. STUDY OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the force required to dislodge 4 types of airways with and without airway securing devices. METHODS We performed a prospective study using 4 commonly used airway devices (endotracheal tube [ETT], laryngeal mask airway [LMA], King laryngeal tube [King], and iGel) performed on 5 different mannequin models. All devices were removed twice per mannequin in random order, once unsecured and once secured as per manufacturers' recommendations; Thomas Tube Holder (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) for ETT, LMA, and King; custom tube holder for iGel. A digital force measuring device was attached to the exposed end of the airway device and gradually pulled vertically and perpendicular to the mannequin until the tube had been dislodged, defined as at least 4 cm of movement. Dislodgement force was reported as the maximum force recorded during dislodgement. We compared the relative difference in the secured and unsecured force for each device and between devices using a random-effects regression model accounting for variability in the manikins. RESULTS The median dislodgment forces (interquartile range [IQR]) in pounds for each secured device were: ETT 13.3 (11.6, 14.1), LMA 16.6 (13.9, 18.3), King 21.7 (16.9, 25.1), and iGel 8 (6.8, 8.3). The median dislodgement forces for each unsecured device were: ETT 4.5 (4.3, 5), LMA 8.4 (6.8, 10.7), King 10.6 (8.2, 11.5), and iGel 3.9 (3.2, 4.2). The relative difference in dislodgement forces (95% confidence intervals) were higher for each device when secured: ETT 8.6 (6.2 to 11), LMA 8.8 (4.6 to 13), King 12.1 (7.2 to 16.6), iGel 4 (1.1 to 6.9). When compared to secured ETT, the King required greater dislodgement force (relative difference 8.6 [4.5-12.7]). The secured iGel required less force than the secured ETT (relative difference -4.8 [-8.9 to -0.8]). CONCLUSION Compared with a secured device, an unsecured airway device requires only half the force to cause airway dislodgement. The secured King had the highest dislodgement force relative to the other studied devices.","Davenport, Curtis; Martin-Gill, Christian; Wang, Henry E; Mayrose, James; Carlson, Jestin N",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2018.1459979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29714527/,272

Compared to the earlier zidovudine and Surfaxin trials, Covid-19 vaccine trials are likely to confer lower risk to placebo groups and to offer a greater number and variety of alternative study designs. However, turning to the developing world to conduct studies that would be unacceptable in developed countries, simply on the ground that Covid-19 vaccines are generally unavailable in developing countries, is not ethically justifiable. This is so whether the justification is rooted in total absence of vaccine in a given country or in developing country vaccine prioritisation practices, because at root both derive from economic, not scientific conditions. However, the advent of variants that may create genuine uncertainty as to comparator vaccine effectiveness could justify a placebo control, depending on vaccine characteristics, variant prevalence, the degree of variant resistance, and the acceptability of immune-bridging studies. These factors must be considered together in the necessary case-by-case assessment of the ethical justification for any proposed trial.","Lurie, Peter",Indian journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.20529/ijme.2021.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908352/,272

The data was obtained from three toxicology laboratories in the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions of the U.S. Fentanyl whole blood concentrations ranged from 0.1 ng/mL to 157 ng/mL in living drivers with a 466% to 524% increase in fentanyl positive DUID cases from 2014 to 2019 depending on the U.S. region. The vast majority of fentanyl cases involved poly-drug use. Twenty case histories are presented where fentanyl was the only drug identified. The mean (SD) fentanyl concentration for these cases was 5.2 ± 3.8 ng/mL with a median of 3.7 ng/mL and the concentrations ranged from 2.0 to 16 ng/mL. Naloxone administration was documented in exactly half of these cases similar to another study involving carfentanil impaired driving. The case histories also demonstrate that some recreational opioid users may display limited signs of impairment either due to tolerance or naloxone administration. The top three observations in common among the cases were the driver was found unresponsive behind the wheel, the vehicle left the travel lane or roadway, and the driver was involved in a crash. The increase in fentanyl use not only poses a risk for overdose and death, but is also a significant concern for traffic safety. This study supports the movement of fentanyl from a Tier II drug to Tier I due to its significant potential for impairment and increase in prevalence in impaired driving cases.","Rohrig, Timothy P; Nash, Emily; Osawa, Kei A; Shan, Xiaoqin; Scarneo, Colleen; Youso, Kimberly B; Miller, Russell; Tiscione, Nicholas B",Journal of analytical toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/bkaa105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797151/,272
93175,COVID-19 and the Indo-Pacific: implications for resource-limited emergency departments.,2020-08-30,"OBJECTIVES To demonstrate and confirm the presence of three anatomic zones of the vagina (a superficial sphincteric zone; a central wedge shaped transition zone; and a deep, expanded forniceal zone) using pelvic magnetic resonance imaging with contrast distention of the vagina. METHODS A total of 107 consecutive female pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scans using vaginal contrast distention were retrospectively reviewed. The images were observed for the three-zone configuration. Anteroposterior and transverse diameter measurements were taken in the proximal, mid, and distal sphincteric, transition, and forniceal zones. Means and standard deviations were calculated at each site. Adjacent sites were compared using paired t tests. RESULTS The three-zone configuration was observed in all of the cases but one. Statistically significant increases and decreases of mean anteroposterior diameters occurred at all levels expected by visual observation. CONCLUSIONS The three-zone configuration of the distended vagina was confirmed by this study. The configuration of the vagina is more complex than has been reported previously. This configuration may facilitate parturition and may be useful in the design of intravaginal devices.","Appelbaum, Alan H; Zuber, Jeffrey K; Levi-D'Ancona, Roberto; Cohen, Harris L",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000000889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392007/,272

94371,COVID-19 epidemic: cocoon the elderly and the vulnerable.,2020-06-01,"Background Catheter-directed thrombolysis may prevent post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with ilio-femoral deep venous thrombosis. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected follow-up data to evaluate the results of catheter-directed thrombolysis at our institution. Method Patients admitted for venous thrombolysis were included in the study and their files screened for information regarding results and technical aspects of treatment and patient status on follow-up. A catheter was inserted under imaging guidance into the thrombosed vein. Through the catheter tissue plasminogen activator was administered. Daily catheter-based venographies were performed to monitor progression in thrombus resolution. After thrombolysis flow-limiting stenosis was stented. Patients started wearing compression stockings and were started on oral anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up visits with ultrasound, magnetic resonance venography and clinical assessment were scheduled at six weeks and three, six, 12 and 24 months. Results A total of 48 patients underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis, including 36 female patients. Median age was 28 years. Complete lysis of the thrombus was achieved in 43 cases and partial lysis in two cases and 26 stents were placed. No deaths or life-threatening bleeding events occurred. Thirty-two of the patients who achieved full lysis and were followed up remained patent at follow-up. At 12 months seven patients had symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome. Conclusion Catheter-directed thrombolysis represents a safe and effective alternative to systemic anticoagulative treatment of deep venous thrombosis with rapid resolution of the thrombus and few complications. Long-term patency shows good validity and this study suggests that catheter-directed thrombolysis is effective in preventing post-thrombotic syndrome.","Madsen, Christina P; Gesla, Jerzy; Vijdea, Radu L; Serifi, Maria A; Christensen, Johnny K; Houlind, Kim",JRSM cardiovascular disease,https://doi.org/10.1177/2048004018766801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623200/,272
95716,COVID-19 in children and young people.,2020-09-21,"AIMS OF THE STUDY To obtain predictions for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany using the modified Bateman SIZ model and input variables based on the status quo in July 2020. To predict the effect of a change in tα on the course of the pandemic. To evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the model in response to a change in the input parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Start parameters for the modified Bateman SIZ model were obtained from observational data published by the Robert-Koch-Institute in Berlin for the period June 1 to July 13, 2020. The robustness and sensitivity of the model were determined by changing the input parameter for the doubling-time (tα) by ± 5% and ± 10%. RESULTS The predictions show that small changes, ± 5%, in the doubling-time, tα for the rate of increase in the number of new infections, can have a major effect, both positive and negative, on the course of the pandemic. The model predicted that the number of persons infected with the virus would reach 1 million within 8 years. A 5% longer ttα would reduce the number of infected persons by ~ 75%. In contrast, a 5% shorter doubling-time would increase the number of infections over 8 years to ~ 9 million when the number of infectious persons would exceed 100,000 at the end of 2022. The pandemic is predicted to have disappeared by the end of 2024. DISCUSSION Predictions for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany based on the status quo up to July 13, 2020 have been obtained using the modified Bateman SIZ model. There are several important assumptions necessary to apply the model and thus the results must be interpreted with caution. The model, previously used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Heidelberg (pop. 166,000) gives comparable predictive data for the whole of Germany (pop. 83 million) and thus appears to be both sensitive and robust. CONCLUSION Since a shorter doubling-time for the number of infectious persons by only 5% would result in a major clinical emergency, interventional measures such as vaccination are urgently needed. Taking into consideration that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not yet available and the efficacy of the Corona-Warn-App has yet to be shown, a relaxation in the lockdown conditions in Germany in 2020 appears premature.","Braun, Peter; Haffner, Steffen; Aguirre Davila, Lukas; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800093/,272
96448,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on eye emergencies.,2020-11-19,"OBJECTIVES To compare the therapeutic outcomes and safety of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for subcardiac and non-subcardiac hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate the risk factors for technical failure of the procedure. METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Between September 2002 and May 2016, 73 patients with subcardiac HCC and the same number of patients with non-subcardiac HCC matched by tumor size were included. Subcardiac HCC was defined as an index tumor that was located ≤ 1 cm from the pericardium in axial or coronal images. Cumulative local tumor progression (LTP) was compared between the two groups using the log-rank test. Prognostic factors for technical failure were assessed using multivariable logistic analysis. RESULTS Technical success rates between both groups were not significantly different (91.8% in the subcardiac HCC group vs. 95.9% in the non-subcardiac HCC group; p = 0.494). The cumulative LTP rates were 15.4% and 19.1% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, in the subcardiac HCC group, and 10.7% and 15.5% in the non-subcardiac HCC group, without significant difference (p = 0.862). The distance between the index tumor and pericardium (odds ratio [OR], 0.14; p = 0.023) and tumor in segment IV (reference, left lateral sector; OR, 36.53; p = 0.029) were significant factors for technical failure in patients with subcardiac HCC. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation was an effective treatment for subcardiac HCC. However, tumor location should be considered in the planning of treatment to avoid technical failure. KEY POINTS • RF ablation for subcardiac HCC is technically feasible without major complications. • RF ablation was an effective treatment for subcardiac HCC in terms of LTP. • Risk factors for technical failure were distance of the index tumor from the heart (cutoff value of 0.5 cm) and the location of the tumor (segment IV).","Cha, Dong Ik; Kang, Tae Wook; Song, Kyoung Doo; Lee, Min Woo; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lim, Hyo Keun; Sinn, Dong Hyun; Kim, Kyunga",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-018-5868-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506222/,272

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS Retrospective review of 855 children undergoing initial cleft lip or palate surgery, or revision surgery after fistula/dehiscence of initial cleft repair. We measured acute and chronic malnutrition using World Health Organization Z-scores of weight-for-age and height-for-age, respectively, and noted any postsurgical fistula or dehiscence. RESULTS Among patients with cleft lip, 22.3% were at least moderately chronically malnourished at the time of initial repair, and 17.5% were at least moderately acutely malnourished. Among patients undergoing initial repair of cleft palate, 20.9% were at least moderately chronically malnourished, and 8.1% were at least moderately acutely malnourished. Increasing nutritional status, as measured by height-for-age, predicts decreased odds of fistula (OR 0.78, P = .01) after cleft palate surgery. CONCLUSIONS Chronic malnutrition significantly increases the risk of fistula formation in patient with cleft palate. Preoperative strategies to manage this risk and influence surgical timing can avoid morbid and costly postoperative complications.

96723,[COVID-19 and People with Dementia: A Silent Pandemic?],2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE The goal of this project was to explore the initial psychometric properties (construct and ecological validity) of self-administered online (SAO) neuropsychological assessment (using the www.testmybrain.org platform), compared to traditional testing, in a clinical sample, as well as to evaluate participant acceptance. SAO assessment has the potential to expand the reach of in-person neuropsychological assessment approaches. METHOD Counterbalanced, within-subjects design comparing SAO performance to in-person performance in adults with diabetes with and without Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Forty-nine participants completed both assessment modalities (type 1 diabetes N = 14, type 2 diabetes N = 35; CKD N = 18). RESULTS Associations between SAO and analogous in-person tests were adequate to good (r = 0.49-0.66). Association strength between divergent cognitive tests did not differ between SAO versus in-person tests. SAO testing was more strongly associated with age than in-person testing (age R2=0.54 versus 0.23), while prediction of education, HbA1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not differ significantly between test modalities (education R2=0.37 versus 0.30; HbA1c R2=0.20 versus 0.12; eGFR R2 = 0.41 versus 0.33). Associations with measures of everyday functioning were also similar (Functional Activities Questionnaire R2=0.08 versus 0.07; Neuro-QoL R2=0.14 versus 0.16; Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire R2=0.19 versus 0.19). CONCLUSIONS The selected SAO neuropsychological tests had acceptable construct validity (including divergent, convergent, and criterion-related validity), and similar ecological validity to that of traditional testing. These SAO assessments were acceptable to participants and appear appropriate for use in research applications, although further research is needed to better understand the strengths and weaknesses in other clinical populations.","Chaytor, Naomi S; Barbosa-Leiker, Celestina; Germine, Laura T; Fonseca, Luciana Mascarenhas; McPherson, Sterling M; Tuttle, Katherine R",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1811893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883156/,272

97197,Taking care of continence patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND Despite the growing literature on the efficiency and productivity of the Chinese healthcare system, less attention has been given to examining the undesirable outputs linked to healthcare services, including environmental pollution. Taking the atmospheric environmental pollution resulting from the incineration of medical waste as an undesirable output of the healthcare system, this study analyzed the growth and decomposition of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of healthcare services across 31 Chinese provinces during the period 2005-2016. METHODS The Meta-frontier undesirable super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) model and the Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) Index were employed to analyze the growth and decomposition of TFP using the Max DEA software. RESULTS The results revealed that the years 2009 and 2015 marked significant changes in TFP of healthcare services in Chinese provinces. During the study period, the rate of technological change (TC) slowly declined, whereas the rate of efficiency change (EC) steadily increased. With the national average being the benchmark, the results indicated that: the TFP of 17 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the EC of 16 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the TC of 9 provinces and cities exceeded the average, and the value in the Technology Gap Ratio (TGR) changes of 13 provinces and cities were above the national average. CONCLUSIONS (1) The TFP of the healthcare services across China continued to decline slowly during the study period. (2) The effect of technical catch-up in the eastern, central, and western regions of China was significant across the three regions, whereas the effect of technical innovation was negative. (3) The TFP varied considerably among the Chinese provinces. These findings suggest that, under existing environmental constraints, relevant government departments should improve technical innovation in the supply of healthcare services and medical waste treatment, increase technical efficiency in the factor of healthcare production, strengthen regional health planning, and balance the development of regional healthcare.","Yu, Jinna; Liu, Zhen; Zhang, Tingting; Hatab, Assem Abu; Lan, Jing",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05496-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698810/,272

We performed gene expression analysis using microarray to find damage-induced genes after spinal cord injury, and found that Sox11b mRNA is up-regulated at 11 days after injury. However, the functional relevance of Sox11b for regeneration is not known. Here, we report that the up-regulation of Sox11b mRNA after spinal cord injury is mainly localized in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in newly differentiating neuronal precursors or immature neurons. Using an in vivo morpholino-based gene knockout approach, we demonstrate that Sox11b is essential for locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. In the injured spinal cord, expression of the neural stem cell associated gene Nestin, and the proneural gene Ascl1a (Mash1a), which are involved in the self-renewal and cell fate specification of endogenous neural stem cells, respectively, is regulated by Sox11b. Our data indicate that Sox11b promotes neuronal determination of endogenous stem cells and regenerative neurogenesis following spinal cord injury in the adult zebrafish. Enhancing Sox11b expression to promote proliferation and neurogenic determination of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury in mammals.","Guo, Y; Ma, L; Cristofanilli, M; Hart, R P; Hao, A; Schachner, M",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.10.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951776/,272

It is now well recognized that human activities can promote the emergence of infectious diseases through the large-scale modification of natural environments and inadvertent vectoring (e.g., international trade and travel). These perturbations can alter the ecological and evolutionary relationships among humans, wildlife, and the pathogens that move between them, resulting in disease emergence. In recent years, the rise in zoonotic EIDs has not only increased our awareness of the need for cross-sectoral collaborations, but has also highlighted the disconnect between current ecological theory and biological reality. As the One Health movement continues to gain steam, further integration of ecological approaches into the One Health framework will be required. We discuss the importance of ecological methods and theory to the study of zoonotic diseases by (i) discussing key ecological concepts and approaches, (ii) reviewing methods of studying wildlife diseases and their potential applications for zoonoses, and (iii) identifying future directions in the One Health movement.","Loh, Elizabeth H; Murray, Kris A; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Hosseini, Parviez R; Rostal, Melinda K; Karesh, William B; Daszak, Peter",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.oh-0009-2012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26184965/,272

Bronchoscopy confirmed the absence of anastomotic leaks and stenoses, and there were no complications associated with the halo-vest.

100325,COVID-19 Guidelines for Assisted Living Facilities: Lessons Learned.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND In anaesthetized patients scheduled for surgery, tracheal intubation is performed with the expectation of subsequent smooth extubation. In critically ill patients, separation from the ventilator is often gradual and the time chosen for extubation may be either delayed or premature. Thus, weaning is challenging, represents a large part of the ventilation period and concerns all mechanically ventilated patients surviving their stay. DEFINITIONS AND MANAGEMENT Weaning may be stratified in three groups according to its difficulty and duration. In simple weaning the main issue is to detect the soonest time to start separation from the ventilator; this is frequently impeded by poor sedation management and excessive ventilator assistance. A two-step diagnostic approach is the most efficacious: screening for ascertained readiness to wean is confirmed by a diagnostic test simulating the post-extubation period, best performed by unassisted breathing (no PEEP). In case of test failure (difficult weaning), a structured and thorough diagnostic work-up regarding potentially reversible pathologies is required with a focus on cardiovascular dysfunction or fluid overload at the time of separation from the ventilator, respiratory or global muscle weakness and underlying infection. Prolonged weaning is exceptionally time- and resource-consuming, needs to properly appraise psychological problems, sleep and nutrition, and is probably best performed in specialized units. CONCLUSIONS Adequately managing simple and difficult weaning requires one to think about ICU policies in terms of sedation, fluid balance and having a systematic screening strategy; it also needs an individualized approach to understand and treat the failing patients. Prolonged weaning requires a holistic approach.","Perren, Andreas; Brochard, Laurent",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-3014-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863974/,272

Massive efforts have been invested to discover or rationally design G4 ligands, evaluate their G4-interacting properties in vitro through a series of now widely accepted and routinely implemented assays, and use them as innovative chemical biology tools to interrogate cellular networks that might involve G4s. In sharp contrast, only uncoordinated efforts aimed at developing small molecules that destabilize G4s have been invested to date, even though it is now recognized that such molecular tools would have tremendous application in neurobiology as many genetic and age-related diseases are caused by an overrepresentation of G4s. Herein, we report on our efforts to develop in vitro assays to reliably identify molecules able to destabilize G4s. This workflow comprises the newly designed G4-unfold assay, adapted from the G4-helicase assay implemented with Pif1, as well as a series of biophysical and biochemical techniques classically used to study G4/ligand interactions (CD, UV-vis, PAGE, and FRET-melting), and a qPCR stop assay, adapted from a Taq-based protocol recently used to identify G4s in the genomic DNA of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This unique, multipronged approach leads to the characterization of a phenylpyrrolocytosine (PhpC)-based G-clamp analog as a prototype of G4-disrupting small molecule whose properties are validated through many different and complementary in vitro evaluations.","Mitteaux, Jérémie; Lejault, Pauline; Wojciechowski, Filip; Joubert, Alexandra; Boudon, Julien; Desbois, Nicolas; Gros, Claude P; Hudson, Robert H E; Boulé, Jean-Baptiste; Granzhan, Anton; Monchaud, David",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c04426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346684/,272

This cross-sectional study sought to analyze the mental health outcomes of SGM young people (18-30 years) during the early stages of the pandemic in the United States (April 13-June 18, 2020) and to explore how factors related to SGM identity impact mental health, such as lifetime discrimination, family support, and pre-existing mental health conditions. An online survey collected socio-demographic information and assessed for both mental health (depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), PTSD (PCL-C)) and COVID-19-related outcomes (COVID-19-related worries and COVID-19-related grief). Out of 981 participants, 320 (32.6%) identified as SGM. SGM had significantly higher levels of depression and PTSD symptoms as well as COVID-19-related worries and grief than non-SGM, even after controlling for family support, lifetime discrimination, and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. These findings suggest that not only has the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted SGM mental health, but that minority stress factors cannot fully explain this impact. Thus, clinicians and societal stakeholders (schools, employers, policymakers) must think beyond traditional minority stress factors (family support, discrimination) and pre-pandemic disparities to support this vulnerable population as the pandemic progresses.","Kamal, Kanika; Li, Jason J; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Liu, Cindy H",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721788/,272

The current study hypothesized that the S-100β serum level could predict the severity of acute amphetamine toxicity and the in-hospital outcome. The current study is a prospective cohort study conducted on 77 patients diagnosed with acute amphetamine exposure and referred to Aseer Poison Control Center, Saudi Arabia. The patients admitted to ICU showed significantly higher serum levels of S-100β in comparison to those not admitted (p < 0.05). Moreover, the S-100β level was significantly elevated among patients with prolonged QTc intervals. Receiver-operating characteristic curve of S-100β serum level as an in-hospital outcome predictor showed that at a cutoff value > 0.430 ug/L, the sensitivity of S-100β serum level as severity predictor was 100%, and the specificity was 74.1%. In conclusion, the current study revealed that the S-100β serum level could be used as an outcome predictor in hospital admission cases due to toxic amphetamine exposure and offers an idea about the cardiac and neuronal involvement. This can help select patients who will benefit most from ICU admission and early management and assess the severity of cases in settings where GC-MS is not available.","Sharif, Asmaa F; Elsheikh, Eman; Al-Asmari, Abdullah Z; Gameel, Dina El",Cardiovascular toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12012-020-09630-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423174/,272

Herein we searched SU efficiency according to the genotype-phenotype correlation, dosage used and side effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Systematic review conducted according the PRISMA control criteria identifying relevant studies evaluating the in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of ATP-dependent potassium channels according to the characteristics of genetic mutation. RESULTS 103 selected articles with complete data in 502 cases in whom 413 (82.3%) had mutations in KCNJ11 (#64) and 89 in ABCC8 (# 56). Successful transfer from insulin to SU was achieved in 91% and 86.5% patients, respectively at a mean age of 36.5 months (0-63 years). Among patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations 64 & 46 were associated with constant success,5 & 5 to constant failure, and 10 and 4 to variable degrees of reported success rate, respectively. The glibenclamide dosage required for each genotype ranged from 0.017 to 2.8 mg / kg / day. Comparing both the in vivo and in vitro susceptibility results, some mutations appear more sensitive than others to sulfonylurea treatment. Side effects were reported in 17 /103 of the included articles: mild gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycaemia were the most common. One premature patient had an ulcerative necrotizing enterocolitis which association with SU is difficult to ascertain. CONCLUSIONS Sulfonylurea are an effective treatment for monogenic diabetes due to KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes mutations. The success of the treatment is conditioned by differences in pharmacogenetics, younger age, pharmacokinetics, compliance and maximal dose used. This article is protected by copyright.

OBJECTIVE To report efficacy and safety results for EVT of intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery trunk (M1) occlusion. METHODS Five revascularization methods for persistent occlusions after IV rt-PA treatment were evaluated for prespecified primary and secondary endpoints, after accounting for differences in key baselines variables using propensity scores. Revascularization was scored using the arterial occlusive lesion (AOL) and the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) scores. RESULTS EVT of 200 subjects with intracranial ICA or M1 occlusion resulted in 81.5% AOL 2-3 recanalization, in addition to 76% mTICI 2-3 and 42.5% mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion. Adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) (8.0%), vessel perforations (1.5%), and new emboli (14.9%). EVT techniques used were standard microcatheter n=51; EKOS n=14; Merci n=77; Penumbra n=39; Solitaire n=4; multiple n=15. Good clinical outcome was associated with both TICI 2-3 and TICI 2b-3 reperfusion. Neither modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 (28.5%), nor 90-day mortality (28.5%), nor asymptomatic ICH (36.0%) differed among revascularization methods after propensity score adjustment for subjects with intracranial ICA or M1 occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Good clinical outcome was associated with good reperfusion for ICA and M1 occlusion. No significant differences in efficacy or safety among revascularization methods were demonstrated after adjustment. Lack of high-quality reperfusion, adverse events, and prolonged time to treatment contributed to lower-than-expected mRS 0-2 outcomes and study futility compared with IV rt-PA.

104823,Love in the age of COVID-19.,2020-11-09,"PURPOSE To demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the magnetization transfer (MT) preparations required for inhomogeneous MT (ihMT) within an MPRAGE-style acquisition. Such a sequence allows for reduced power deposition and easy inclusion of other modules. METHODS An ihMT MPRAGE-style sequence (ihMTRAGE) was initially simulated to investigate acquisition of the 3D ihMT data sequentially, or in an interleaved manner. The ihMTRAGE sequence was implemented on a 3T clinical scanner to acquire ihMT data from the brain and spine. RESULTS Both simulations and in vivo data provided an ihMT signal that was significantly greater using a sequential ihMTRAGE acquisition, compared with an interleaved implementation. Comparison with a steady-state ihMT acquisition (defined as having one MT RF pulse between successive acquisition modules) demonstrated how ihMTRAGE allows for a reduction in average power deposition, or greater ihMT signal at equal average power deposition. Inclusion of a prospective motion-correction module did not significantly affect the ihMT signal obtained from regions of interest in the brain. The ihMTRAGE acquisition allowed combination with a spatial saturation module to reduce phase wrap artifacts in a cervical spinal cord acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Use of preparations necessary for ihMT experiments within an MPRAGE-style sequence provides a useful alternative for acquiring 3D ihMT data. Compared with our steady-state implementation, ihMTRAGE provided reduced power deposition, while allowing use of the maximum intensity from off-resonance RF pulses. The 3D ihMTRAGE acquisition allowed combination of other modules with the preparation necessary for ihMT experiments, specifically motion compensation and spatial saturation modules.","Varma, Gopal; Munsch, Fanny; Burns, Brian; Duhamel, Guillaume; Girard, Olivier M; Guidon, Arnaud; Lebel, R Marc; Alsop, David C",Magnetic resonance in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602958/,272

We compared the seal pressure achieved by the new Ambu AuraGain™ versus LMA Supreme™ following pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position. Sixty female patients were randomly allocated to ventilation with either the AuraGain or the Supreme. A target-controlled system was used to administer total intravenous anesthesia. Intracuff pressure was maintained below 60 cm H2O. The following parameters were registered: Time, number of attempts and manoeuvres required for insertion; seal pressure and peak inspiratory pressure at four time points; ease of gastric tube insertion, flexible scope view, complications and postoperative morbidity. Both devices were quick and easily inserted, although the Supreme required less rotation manoeuvres (16 in AuraGain vs. 6 in LMA Supreme; p = 0.01). The AuraGain achieved higher seal pressures (34 ± 5 in AuraGain vs. 29 ± 5 in LMA Supreme; p = 0.0002). Following pneumoperitoneum in head-down position, peak airway pressure increased 9 ± 3 cm H2O in both groups, exceeding seal pressure in 3 patients in the Supreme group (p = 0.06). The vocal cords were seen through all AuraGain and 90% of the Supreme devices; epiglottis was often visible inside the tube (68%). No differences were found in the incidence of traces of blood on the mask or postoperative symptoms. Both devices allowed effective ventilation in patients undergoing gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery with a low rate of complications. The Ambu AuraGain provided higher seal pressures and a clear view of glottic inlet in all patients offering the possibility to guide direct tracheal intubation if required.","Lopez, Ana M; Agusti, Merce; Gambus, Pedro; Pons, Montserrat; Anglada, Teresa; Valero, Ricard",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9963-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889843/,272

106770,The threat of a UK-US trade deal to managing non-communicable diseases.,2021-07-16,"BACKGROUND Conventional perioperative analgesic modalities (e.g. opioids, epidural analgesia) have their own drawbacks, which limit their clinical application. This study investigated the opioid-sparing effectsof the oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) blockade with ropivacaine for the patients undergoing open liver resection with a Mercedes incision. METHODS 126 patients who were scheduled for open liver resection were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral ultrasound-guided OSTAPblocks with either 0.375% ropivacaine (groupT) or 0.9% isotonic saline (group C). Both groups also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and intravenous 40 mg parecoxib every 12 h for a total of 3 days. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded. RESULTS 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively). Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the incidence of nausea was reduced in group T. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with saline.

106836,Proposed Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies Related to Climate Change: Guidance for OEM Professionals.,2021-09-01,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease thought to result from impaired lung repair following injury and is strongly associated with aging. While vascular alterations have been associated with IPF previously, the contribution of lung vasculature during injury resolution and fibrosis is not well understood. To compare the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in resolving and non-resolving models of lung fibrosis, we applied bleomycin intratracheally to young and aged mice. We found that injury in aged mice elicited capillary rarefaction, while injury in young mice resulted in increased capillary density. ECs from the lungs of injured aged mice relative to young mice demonstrated elevated pro-fibrotic and reduced vascular homeostasis gene expression. Among the latter, Nos3 (encoding the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS) was transiently upregulated in lung ECs from young but not aged mice following injury. Young mice deficient in eNOS recapitulated the non-resolving lung fibrosis observed in aged animals following injury, suggesting that eNOS directly participates in lung fibrosis resolution. Activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase in human lung fibroblasts reduced TGFβ-induced pro-fibrotic gene and protein expression. Additionally, loss of eNOS in human lung ECs reduced the suppression of TGFβ-induced lung fibroblast activation in 2D and 3D co-cultures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that persistent lung fibrosis in aged mice is accompanied by capillary rarefaction, loss of EC identity, and impaired eNOS expression. Targeting vascular function may thus be critical to promote lung repair and fibrosis resolution in aging and IPF.","Caporarello, Nunzia; Meridew, Jeffrey A; Aravamudhan, Aja; Jones, Dakota L; Austin, Susan A; Pham, Tho X; Haak, Andrew J; Moo Choi, Kyoung; Tan, Qi; Haresi, Adil; Huang, Steven K; Katusic, Zvonimir S; Tschumperlin, Daniel J; Ligresti, Giovanni",Aging cell,https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691484/,272

Interestingly, the patient carried a human leukocyte antigen genotype (HLA DR1-DR3-DQ2) considered to provide only a slightly elevated risk of developing autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, as noted, no serum autoantibodies were observed against islet cells, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase, insulin and zinc-transporter 8. Although our report cannot fully establish causality between COVID-19 and the development of diabetes in this patient, considering that SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, are expressed on pancreatic β-cells and, given the circumstances of this case, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection, or COVID-19, might negatively affect pancreatic function, perhaps through direct cytolytic effects of the virus on β-cells.","Hollstein, Tim; Schulte, Dominik M; Schulz, Juliane; Glück, Andreas; Ziegler, Anette G; Bonifacio, Ezio; Wendorff, Mareike; Franke, Andre; Schreiber, Stefan; Bornstein, Stefan R; Laudes, Matthias",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-020-00281-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879473/,272

Many aspects of this disease, as well as the risks for patients treated with multiple drug regimens to control severe COVID-19, are unclear. During emergency surgery for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission to the surgical staff has yet to be determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this report, we describe a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with severe respiratory syndrome treated with multiple doses of IL-6 inhibitors who presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer and underwent emergency surgery. During and after surgery, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the ulcer site and in the peritoneal fluid. RESULTS The history of the patient allows for two possible interpretations of the pathogenesis of the duodenal ulcer, which could have been a stress ulcer, or a gastrointestinal ulcer associated to the use of IL-6 inhibitors. We also noticed that the ulcer site and peritoneal fluid repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the pertinent literature on gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 and on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the peritoneal fluid of surgical patients and discussed possible prevention strategies for bleeding and the actual risk of infection for the surgical staff. CONCLUSIONS The first implication of this case is that the relation between repeated administration of IL-6 inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation must be investigated, and that the threshold for administering prophylactic proton pump inhibitors therapy should be carefully considered for patients with severe COVID-19. The second implication is that further testing should be performed on the peritoneal fluid of COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures to clarify the discordant results for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal cavity and the possible risk of transmission to the surgical staff.","Agnes, A; La Greca, A; Tirelli, F; Papa, V",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336771/,272

The graft densities were estimated to be 0.04-0.28 chains nm. Under this graft dense region it is assumed that surface polymer chains form a polymer brush structure in good solvents. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction suggested that the tacticity of the PS chains on the nanoparticle surface is mainly atactic. PS-grafted-TiO nanoparticles were stably dispersed in good solvents for PS chains due to the steric repulsion between the grafted chains derived from the osmotic pressure effect and their affinity for the solvents. When the PS-grafted-TiO particles were finely dispersed, the ultraviolet absorption due to TiO was strong and the difference in absorbance between the visible and ultraviolet regions was ten or more times greater than that for non-grafted TiO. By adding PS-grafted-TiO particles with PS matrix powder in CHCl, hybrid films were prepared by solvent casting. The PS-grafted-TiO-PS hybrid films showed high transmittance in the visible light region accompanied by ultraviolet absorption characteristic of TiO due to the fine dispersion of nanoparticles in the PS matrix. Furthermore, friction tests revealed that the wear resistance of PS thin films with PS-grafted-TiO was improved compared with PS film.","Matsuno, Ryosuke; Otsuka, Hideyuki; Takahara, Atsushi",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b601197g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680256/,272

We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, with their partial 3D(pol) gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six novel picornavirus species (ChPV1 from clade I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one existing species (Avian encephalomyelitis virus from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features different from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Moreover, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a novel genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (ChPV1 related to Passerivirus A, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to Avisivirus A and Duck hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to Melegrivirus A, ChGV1 to Gallivirus A). Furthermore, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus, with its P2 and P3 regions possibly originating from Melegrivirus A. Chickens are an important reservoir for diverse picornaviruses that may cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yip, Cyril C Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Bai, Ru; Huang, Yi; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.066597-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906980/,272

However, the feasibility and safety of SILC for acute cholecystitis, especially in cases with percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD), are still limited because of the technical difficulty of SILC. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of SILC compared to CLC for cholecystitis requiring PTGBD. METHODS From 1 July 2017 to 8 June 2019, eight patients underwent SILC with PTGBD, and nine underwent CLC with PTGBD. The patients' data, including the operative time, total blood loss, conversion rate to laparotomy, and perioperative complications, were compared. RESULTS In seven of eight patients, SILC was successfully performed. Only one patient required conversion to open surgery because necrosis prevented the cystic duct from being clipped. However, bile leakage occurred in this patient and was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. In the CLC group, one patient required laparotomy but had no postoperative complications due to strong adhesion. One patient underwent reoperation for bile duct injury after the first operation. One other complication (ie, wound infection) was seen in the CLC group. There was no significant difference in the mean operative time and estimated blood loss between the SILC and CLC groups. CONCLUSION With our gallbladder retraction method, SILC may be a relatively safe and feasible alternative to CLC for cholecystitis, even in cases requiring PTGBD.","Funamizu, Naotake; Harada, Eriko; Ishiyama, Satoshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31820545/,272

Engineering cellular pathways related to cell death, metabolism and glycosylation in CHO cell is desired but challenging. Here we present a novel approach that exploits CRISPR-Cas13d for gene silencing and CHO cell engineering. CRISPR-Cas13d is a burgeoning system that exploits Cas13d nuclease and guide RNA (gRNA) for RNA cleavage and gene knockdown. We first showed that CRISPR-Cas13d effectively knocked down exogenous genes in CHO cell lines (K1, DG44 and DUXB11) commonly used for recombinant protein production. We next demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas13d robustly suppressed the expression of exogenous genes and various endogenous genes involved in gene amplification, apoptosis, metabolism and glycosylation (e.g. GS, BAK, BAX, PDK1 and FUT8) in CHO cells with efficiencies ranging from 60-80%, simply by transient transfection. By integrating the entire CRISPR-Cas13d system with the Sleeping Beauty system and optimal gRNA design, we further improved the knockdown efficiency and rapidly generated stable cells with 80-90% knockdown. With this approach, we knocked down FUT8 expression for >90% and significantly attenuated the IgG fucosylation. These data altogether implicated the potentials of CRISPR-Cas13d for gene regulation, glycoengineering and cell engineering of CHO cells.","Shen, Chih-Che; Lin, Mei-Wei; Nguyen, Bao Khanh Thi; Chang, Chin-Wei; Shih, Jie-Ru; Nguyen, Mai Thanh Thi; Chang, Yi-Hao; Hu, Yu-Chen",ACS synthetic biology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911927/,272

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two bovine intestine samples, 4 × 4 cm size and ~3 mm thickness, were adapted with interrupted and continuous techniques using three types of suture materials: Vicryl (polyglactin 910), PDS II (polydioxanone), and V-Loc 180 (knotless, barbed polyglyconate). Four stitches or loops 9 mm apart with three knots, and 10 mm end length were performed by one gynecologist. Forces were applied from 6 newtons (N) to 14 N continuously. Outcome measures included breakage of tissue, tearing of thread, and shortening of the end length of thread. They were evaluated immediately and then at first, third, and fifth minute. RESULTS Tissue breakage using No. 3/0 suture materials appears in the applied force from 10 N. polydioxanone causes more tissue tearing than polyglactin 910. The least to withstand tension is knotless polyglyconate. Interrupted stitches hold the sutured sites better than continuous stitches in all groups of threads. Shortening of the knotless polyglyconate end length by half took place with 6 N force. CONCLUSION Simulating reparation of colpotomy, the ex vivo study supports that polyglactin 910 appears better in holding soft tissue than polydioxanone and knotless polyglyconate.","Chayachinda, Chenchit; Hackethal, Andreas; Tinneberg, Hans-Rudolf",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-012-2214-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22231722/,272

Among them, serine proteases play extraordinary, diverse functions in different physiological and pathological processes. The human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), also referred to as TMPRSS11D and serine 11D, belongs to the emerging family of cell surface proteolytic enzymes, the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs). Through the cleavage of its four major identified substrates, HAT triggers specific responses, notably in epithelial cells, within the pericellular and extracellular environment, including notably inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cell recruitment, or anticoagulant processes. This review summarizes the potential role of this recently described protease in mediating cell surface proteolytic events, to highlight the structural features, proteolytic activity, and regulation, including the expression profile of HAT, and discuss its possible roles in respiratory physiology and disease.","Menou, Awen; Duitman, JanWillem; Flajolet, Pauline; Sallenave, Jean-Michel; Mailleux, Arnaud André; Crestani, Bruno",American journal of physiology.

118067,Should Pediatric Patients Be Prioritized When Rationing Life-Saving Treatments During the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020-07-09,"Cancer is one of the most debilitating diseases worldwide. Cancer incidence and/or death depends on several intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., dietary habits, socio-behavioral activities, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, gender, races/ethnicities and age). Various studies have found that an inverse relationship subsists between environmental temperature and cancer risk. Furthermore, this negative relationship was found to be more consistent in the USA female population. This research mainly focuses on influence of aging on cold environment mediated cancer risk for overall and various anatomical site-specific cancers. Age-specific county-wise data of cancer incidence rate (CIR) in the USA female population was selected in this study. Statistical analysis found a negative correlation between the average annual temperature (AAT) and CIR in all anatomical sites (AAS; overall) as well as different anatomical site-specific cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, leukaemia, pancreas, bladder, uterus, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), except for cervical cancer) in different age groups (e.g., less than 50 years, 50 plus years, less than 65 years and 65 plus years). In addition, an inverse relationship between the AAT and CIR was found in case of paediatric cancer. However, all the results obtained from the linear model based statistical analysis proposed that the older age-group of females particularly above 65 years seems to be more prone to cold temperature linked cancer risk. For example, age-specific cold linked cancer incidence appears to be more inclined in case of breast cancer in the age-group of 65 plus years. This study, for first time, proposes that aging may have a positive influence on the relationship between cancer incidence and environment temperature.","Bandyopadhayaya, Shreetama; Bundel, Rashmi; Tyagi, Shikhar; Pandey, Arvind; Mandal, Chandi C",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888573/,272

Sealants applied around the colon anastomosis may help prevent AL by giving the anastomosis time to heal by mechanically supporting the anastomosis and preventing bacteria leaking into the peritoneal cavity. The aim of this study is to compare commercially available sealants on their efficacy of preventing leakage in a validated mouse model for AL. METHODS Six sealants (Evicel, Omnex, VascuSeal, PleuraSeal, BioGlue, and Colle Chirurgicale Cardial) were applied around an anastomosis constructed with five interrupted sutures in mice, and compared with a control group without sealant. Outcome measures were AL, anastomotic bursting pressure, and death. RESULTS In the control group there was a 40% death rate with a 50% rate of AL. None of the sealants were able to diminish the rate of AL. Furthermore, use of the majority of sealants resulted in failure to thrive, increased rates of ileus, and higher mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS If sealing of a colorectal anastomosis could achieve a reduction of incidence of clinical AL, this would be a promising tool for prevention of leakage in colorectal surgery. In this study, we found no evidence that sealants reduce leakage rates in a mouse model for AL. However, the negative results of this study make us emphasize the need of systemic research, investigating histologic tissue reaction of the bowel to different sealants, the capacity of sealants to form a watertight barrier, their time of degradation, and finally their results in large animal models for AL.","Slieker, Juliette C; Vakalopoulos, Konstantinos A; Komen, Niels A; Jeekel, Johannes; Lange, Johan F",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2013.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23764314/,272

However, public acceptance of such strategies should be monitored to ensure successful implementation. In an experiment with N=1379 German participants, we investigated whether the public's vaccination allocation preferences matched the prioritisation strategy approved by the German government. Results revealed different allocations. While the government had top-prioritised vulnerable people (being of high age or accommodated in nursing homes for the elderly), participants preferred exclusive allocation of the first available vaccines to medical staff and personnel caring for the elderly. Interestingly, allocation preferences did not change when participants were told how many individuals were included in each group. As differences between allocation policies and public preferences can affect trust in the government and threaten the social contract between generations, we discuss possible strategies to align vaccination prioritisations.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Korn, Lars; Eitze, Sarah; Betsch, Cornelia",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972372/,272

Social media can not only deliver reliable information to the public but can in turn reflect changes in the public's psychological status. Insight into the public's hotspots of concern and mental status through media background tools contributes to the formulation of public health policies and the clarification of epidemic development mode. METHODS WeChat is the largest social media in China. Taking the recovery period of COVID-19 in China, for example, we collected WeChat Index data and analyzed the public's concern about the course of COVID-19 and the restoration of emotional tendency through keywords search. RESULTS With the gradual control of the COVID-19 in China, the public psychological status changes from negative to neutral, accompanied by a weakening of negative emotions and an increase in positive emotions. Every obvious inflection point of improvement in social operation is reflected in the increase of public attention and the relaxation of lifestyle.

123485,"Hands down, COVID-19 will change medical practice.",2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Most dementia care occurs in the community with support from informal caregivers who are often distressed. Dementia caregiver distress is known to be hazardous to the caregiver's health, but the impact on the dementia care recipient is not well known. METHODS We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases from inception until June 2017 for studies investigating the association of informal caregiver distress with health outcomes of community-dwelling dementia care recipients. The search results were screened and then data abstracted, and the risk of bias was appraised independently by pairs of reviewers. RESULTS We included 81 original investigations (n = 43 761 caregivers and dementia care recipients). Sixty-six studies (81.5%) were observational or cross-sectional in design, and 47 studies (58%) had a low risk of bias. There was considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity precluding quantitative synthesis. Dementia care recipients (n = 21 881) had a mean age of 78.2 years (SD ± 3.8 y), half (50.0%) were women, and two-thirds (66.1%) had Alzheimer's disease. The dementia caregivers (n = 21 880) had a mean age of 62.5 years (SD ± 23.3), three-quarters (74.1%) were women, and one-half (50.5%) were spouses of the dementia care recipient. Twenty-two unique dementia care recipient outcomes were studied including cognition, mood, quality of life, function, healthcare utilization, and costs. Overall, informal caregiver distress is commonly associated with the institutionalization of the dementia care recipient, worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and experiencing elder abuse. CONCLUSION Informal caregiving is a cornerstone of dementia care, and distress related to this role is associated with worsening of several dementia care recipient health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE To present our results of treatment of these lesions with special emphasis on the fate of 'jailed' cortical branches and perforating arteries. METHODS Seventeen patients were treated with flow diverters (FDs) for 18 aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery bifurcation (n=13) and the anterior communicating artery complex (n=5). Nineteen cortical branches were covered. A single FD was used in all patients. RESULTS At latest follow-up (mean 7.9 months; range 3-36; median 4.0) 2/19 (10.5%) of the covered branches were occluded, 9/19 (47.4%) showed a decreased caliber and the remaining branches were unchanged. All branch modifications were clinically asymptomatic. Mortality and permanent morbidity were 0%. Symptomatic ischemic events in perforator territories occurred in three patients (17.6%), which were reversible in all of them within 24 h. Follow-up MRI disclosed asymptomatic lacunar defects corresponding to covered perforating artery territories in five patients (29.4%). Altogether, perforator lesions-symptomatic and asymptomatic-occurred in 7/17 patients (41.2%). 33.3% of the aneurysms were occluded at latest follow-up; decreased diameters were seen in the other 66.7%. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion of bifurcation aneurysms is feasible with low rates of permanent morbidity and mortality. Caliber reduction and asymptomatic occlusion of covered cortical branches seems to be common, yet ischemic complications are rather linked to perforator occlusions. Our results on aneurysm occlusion rates are preliminary and longer follow-up periods are warranted.","Gawlitza, Matthias; Januel, Anne-Christine; Tall, Philippe; Bonneville, Fabrice; Cognard, Christophe",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878068/,272

Three measurements were successively performed: before vascular section, after inferior mesenteric artery ligation, and after inferior mesenteric artery and vein section. RESULTS Before vascular section, the mean distance between colonic end and lower edge of the symphysis pubis was - 1.9 ± 3.5 cm. After combined artery and vein section, the mean distance was + 10.7 ± 4.6 cm for high tie and + 1.5 ± 3 cm for low tie. A limitation of this study is the use of embalmed anatomical specimens, rather than live patients, and the small number of specimens. This study also does not evaluate colon limb vascularization or the impact of proximal lymph node dissection on survival rates. CONCLUSIONS High tie of the inferior mesenteric artery at its aortic origin allows a gain of extra length of about 9 cm over low tie.","Girard, E; Trilling, B; Rabattu, P-Y; Sage, P-Y; Taton, N; Robert, Y; Chaffanjon, P; Faucheron, J-L",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-01931-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963345/,272

METHODS In this single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 280 patients who were diagnosed as having HCC by conventional dynamic CT, and eligible for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), to undergo CTHA/CTAP before treatment, or to the control group. Newly detected HCC nodules by CTHA/CTAP were intended to be ablated completely. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival and the key secondary end point was overall survival. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Those with nonablated nodules were treated as for recurrence. RESULTS A total of 75 nodules were newly diagnosed as HCC by CTHA/CTAP in 45 patients. Three patients (one in the CTHA/CTAP group and two in the control group) who refused treatment were excluded from all analyses. The cumulative recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 60.1, 29.0, and 18.9% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 52.2, 29.7, and 23.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.66 by log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.94 for CTHA/CTAP vs. control; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-1.22). The cumulative overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 79.7 and 56.4% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 86.8 and 60.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.50; hazard ratio, 1.15, 95% CI, 0.77-1.71). CONCLUSIONS CTHA/CTAP may detect recurrent lesions earlier. However, CTHA/CTAP before RFA did not improve cumulative recurrence-free survival or overall survival.","Ohki, Takamasa; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Akahane, Masaaki; Mikami, Shintaro; Sato, Masaya; Uchino, Koji; Arano, Toru; Enooku, Kenichiro; Kondo, Yuji; Yamashiki, Noriyo; Goto, Tadashi; Shiina, Shuichiro; Yoshida, Haruhiko; Matsuyama, Yutaka; Omata, Masao; Ohtomo, Kuni; Koike, Kazuhiko",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2013.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23629602/,272

Using data science and information systems is necessary to support public health practices. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are key to inform and help guide public health policies related to place (i.e. location or where one lives) and how it affects health. Despite the increasing use of GIS for public health globally, its applications to health in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states remains largely unknown. This systematic scoping review aimed to uncover how GIS has been used in the GCC states to understand ""place"" and ""health"". A comprehensive search of the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Science Citation Index Expanded, ScienceDirect, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library during June 2020. All journal articles involving the use of GIS for human health applications in the GCC states published in English in peerreviewed scientific journals were considered. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, qualitative content analysis was performed for 24 of 630 studies. GIS uses in the GCC states were categorized as health access and planning (n=9), health risk analysis (n=8), disease surveillance (n=6) and community health profiling (n=1). The majority of the uncovered evidence in this study focused on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results of this study indicate a deficiency of published evidence regarding the use of GIS in support of public health in other GCC states. This stands to compromise planning and strategic decision making in health risk analysis, disease surveillance, community health profiling, health services provision and health interventions.","Alhuwail, Dari; AlSharrah, Saad; Coffee, Neil T; Al-Refaei, Faisal H; Daniel, Mark",Geospatial health,https://doi.org/10.4081/gh.2020.887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461280/,272

METHODS We examined the associations between study characteristics and standardized effect size (SES) in a database of 200 publicly available randomized clinical trials of pharmacologic treatments for neuropathic pain. RESULTS There was considerable heterogeneity in the SESs among the examined trials. Univariate meta-regression analyses indicated that larger SESs were significantly associated with trials that had 1) greater minimum baseline pain inclusion criteria, 2) greater mean subject age, 3) a larger percentage of Caucasian subjects, and 4) a smaller total number of subjects. In a multiple meta-regression analysis, the associations between SES and minimum baseline pain inclusion criterion and age remained significant. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses have examined potentially modifiable correlates of study SES and shown that a minimum pain inclusion criterion of 40 or above on a 0 to 100 scale is associated with a larger SES. These data provide a foundation for investigating strategies to improve assay sensitivity and thereby decrease the likelihood of falsely negative outcomes in clinical trials of efficacious treatments for neuropathic pain.","Dworkin, Robert H; Turk, Dennis C; Peirce-Sandner, Sarah; He, Hua; McDermott, Michael P; Farrar, John T; Katz, Nathaniel P; Lin, Allison H; Rappaport, Bob A; Rowbotham, Michael C",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e318297ee69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23700332/,272
128914,"COVID-19 , School Closings and Weight Gain.",2020-04-10,"BACKGROUND CKD induces loss of muscle proteins partly by suppressing muscle protein synthesis. Muscles of mice with CKD have increased expression of nucleolar protein 66 (NO66), as do muscle biopsy specimens from patients with CKD or those undergoing hemodialysis. Inflammation stimulates NO66 expression and changes in NF-κB mediate the response. METHODS Subtotal nephrectomy created a mouse model of CKD with BUN >80 mg/dl. Crossing NO66flox/flox with MCK-Cre mice bred muscle-specific NO66 (MCK-NO66) knockout mice. Experiments assessed the effect of removing NO66. RESULTS Muscle-specific NO66 knockout in mice blocks CKD-induced loss of muscle mass and improves protein synthesis. NO66 suppression of ribosomal biogenesis via demethylase activity is the mechanism behind these responses. In muscle cells, expression of NO66, but not of demethylase-dead mutant NO66, decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and suppressed pre-rRNA expression. Knocking out NO66 increased the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 on ribosomal DNA. In primary muscle cells and in muscles of mice without NO66, ribosomal RNA, pre-rRNA, and protein synthesis all increased. CONCLUSIONS CKD suppresses muscle protein synthesis via epigenetic mechanisms that NO66 mediates. Blocking NO66 could suggest strategies that counter CKD-induced abnormal muscle protein catabolism.","Zhang, Liping; Chen, Qin; Chen, Zihong; Wang, Ying; Gamboa, Jorge L; Ikizler, Talat Alp; Garibotto, Giacomo; Mitch, William E",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019121277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764136/,272

130980,[COVID pandemic and clinical nutrition response in Spain: results of a national survey].,2020-12-15,"BACKGROUND Noncompressible hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death caused by hemorrhage on the battlefield. Currently, there are no hemostatic agents with the ability to control noncompressible hemorrhage. A wound stasis dressing based upon rapidly expanding cellulose minisponges (MS) was developed and tested in a lethal noncompressible model in swine, by fully transecting subclavian artery and vein. MS were compared with conventional hemostasis dressings, Combat Gauze (CG), in a randomized comparison. METHODS Sixteen 40-kg swine underwent transection of the subclavian artery and vein through a 4.5-cm aperture. After 30-second free bleeding, randomly selected MS or CG (n = 8 per group) were administered by an independent medical officer. The wound cavity was filled with either MS + no external pressure or one CG + one KERLIX gauze with 3 minutes of external pressure. One reapplication was allowed for CG. Mean arterial pressure was maintained at 60 mm Hg with 500-mL Hextend and lactated Ringer's solution intravenously administered up to a maximum of 10-L until study termination at 1 hour. RESULTS Mean pretreatment blood loss was similar for MS (719 mL) and CG (702 mL). Primary end points, namely, hemostasis at 4 minutes (MS, 75%; CG, 25%; p = 0.13), hemostasis at 60 minutes (MS, 100%; CG, 25%; p = 0.007), and survival at 60 minutes (MS, 100%; CG, 37.5%; p = 0.026), were improved with MS as were secondary end points, namely, total blood loss (MS, 118 mL; CG 1,242 mL; p = 0.021) and length of application time (MS, 25 seconds; CG, 420 seconds; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION The use of MS is a novel approach for the rapid, simple treatment of severe noncompressible hemorrhage, which provided statistically significant improvement in hemostasis and survival 60 minutes after injury and a large reduction in blood loss, resuscitation fluid requirement, and medic treatment time compared with conventional hemorrhage control dressings in a swine model.","Mueller, Genevieve R; Pineda, Teresa J; Xie, Hua X; Teach, Jeffrey S; Barofsky, Andrew D; Schmid, James R; Gregory, Kenton W",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e3182617c3c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22847084/,272

We also evaluated the underlying causes of recurrent stroke according to d-dimer levels. METHODS A total of 1431 patients with undetermined source were enrolled in this study and divided into quartiles according to their baseline plasma d-dimer levels. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of recurrent stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in the year following the stroke event. RESULTS The risk of recurrent stroke increased significantly with the increasing d-dimer quartile (log-rank P=0.001). Patients in the higher d-dimer quartiles had a higher probability of recurrent embolic stroke because of covert atrial fibrillation, hidden malignancy, or undetermined sources. Most recurrent strokes in Q3 and Q4 were embolic but not in Q1 or Q2. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients in Q3 and Q4 had a significantly increased risk of recurrent stroke compared with those in Q1 (hazard ratio, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.07-9.07], P=0.036; hazard ratio, 7.29 [95% CI, 2.59-20.52], P<0.001, respectively; Ptrend<0.001). Binary analyses showed a significant association between a high d-dimer level above normal range and the risk of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.31-4.70], P=0.005). In subgroup analyses, a high d-dimer level was associated with a significantly higher risk of recurrent stroke in men than in women (P=0.039). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that d-dimer levels can be a useful risk assessment biomarker for predicting recurrent stroke, especially embolic ischemic stroke, in patients with undetermined source.","Choi, Kang-Ho; Kim, Ja-Hae; Kim, Jae-Myung; Kang, Kyung-Wook; Lee, Changho; Kim, Joon-Tae; Choi, Seong-Min; Park, Man-Seok; Cho, Ki-Hyun",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.033217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971744/,272

METHODS A ambispective cohort study was performed in the PICU including patients admitted in whom antibiotic therapy was started and a checklist was applied prospectively. They were compared with a historical cohort, prior the checklist. The main outcome was the antibiotic scaling 48 hours after starting and the secondary endpoints were consultation with infectious diseases (ID) specialist and vancomycin prescription. To compare the variables between the two cohorts, the χ2 test, Fischer test and U Mann-Whitney test were used. The results of the main variables were expressed in RR and RAR. The study was approved by the institution's Ethics Committee. RESULTS 70 patients were admitted in the checklist cohort and they were compared with 124 patients of the historical cohort.

Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms/complications and the effects of minimally invasive trans-oral surgery in these patients. METHODS Consecutive adult patients who underwent trans-oral septum stapling for Zenker diverticulum were included in a retrospective, observational cohort study. Pre- and postoperative symptoms, including chronic cough and aspiration pneumonia, were evaluated using a dedicated foregut questionnaire and were recorded on a prospectively maintained database. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. A barium swallow study and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed 6 months after the operation, and the foregut questionnaire was administered yearly. RESULTS A total of 139 patients were finally included in the study. The median age was 72 years. In 62 (44.6%, CI 36.2-53.3) patients, there was a history of chronic cough and/or aspiration pneumonia. Chronic cough was associated with pneumonia (p < 0.001), while pneumonia was associated with severe regurgitation (p < 0.042) and weight loss (p = 0.001). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 2.2% and there was no mortality. The median postoperative hospital stay was 2 days (range 0-22). The median follow-up was 38 months (range 2-105). At 3 years, a statistically significant reduction in the rate of chronic cough (36.8 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.001), recurrent episodes of pneumonia (6.6 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.031), dysphagia (78.9 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001), and regurgitation (67.1 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001) was recorded. The probability of remaining symptom-free at 90 months of follow-up was 0.818 (CI: 0.745-0.899).

Little is known about reinfarction after drug-eluting stents and bivalirudin anticoagulation. We, therefore, sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and implications of reinfarction after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the contemporary era. METHODS AND RESULTS Outcomes were assessed in 3202 patients undergoing stent implantation for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in the Harmonizing Outcomes with RevascularIZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. Independent predictors of reinfarction and mortality were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling. The cumulative incidence of reinfarction was 1.8% at 30 days, 4.0% at 1 year, and 6.9% at 3 years. Definite stent thrombosis was responsible for 76.3% of reinfarctions occurring within 30 days and 52.0% of all reinfarctions within 3 years. Independent predictors of reinfarction were current smoking, Killip class ≥2, baseline thrombocytosis, multivessel disease, symptom onset-to-balloon time, and total stent length. Randomization to bivalirudin versus heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and use of drug-eluting versus bare metal stents were not significant predictors of reinfarction. Reinfarction was a powerful independent predictor of subsequent cardiac mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=7.65 [4.47-13.09]; P<0.0001) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=2.88 [1.74-4.78]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and stents, reinfarction after primary percutaneous coronary intervention is not infrequent, in the contemporary era is most often attributable to stent thrombosis, and is strongly associated with subsequent cardiac and all-cause mortality. Further enhancements in drugs and devices to prevent reinfarction are needed to improve outcomes in high-risk patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

Upon activation by viral double-stranded RNA, OAS synthesizes (2-5) oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, leading to the nonspecific degradation of cellular and viral RNA. Some association studies in humans suggest that variation at one of the OAS genes, OAS1, could be influencing host susceptibility to viral infection. We assessed the diversity of OAS1 in hominoid primates with a focus on chimpanzees. We found that the OAS1 gene is extremely polymorphic in Central African chimpanzee and exhibits levels of silent and replacement diversity much higher than neutral regions of the chimpanzee genome. This level of variation strongly suggests that balancing selection is acting on OAS1, and indeed, this conclusion was validated by several tests of neutrality. We further demonstrated that balancing selection has been acting at this locus since the split between chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas (~8.6 Ma) and caused the persistence of two deeply divergent allelic lineages in Central African chimpanzees. These two groups of OAS1 alleles differ by a large number of amino acids (a.a.), including several a.a. putatively involved in RNA binding. It is therefore very likely that variation at the OAS1 locus affects the innate immune response of individuals to specific viral infection. Our data strongly suggest that interactions between viral RNA and OAS1 are responsible for the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms at this locus for at least 13.2 My.","Ferguson, William; Dvora, Shira; Fikes, Ronald W; Stone, Anne C; Boissinot, Stéphane",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22104212/,272

The current study is based on the analysis of the 116 patients who underwent a rectocele repair via the infracoccygeal route through the sacrospinous ligament. Anatomical cure was defined when rectocele was at stage <II in the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. Postoperative functional results were evaluated using the self-administered Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ). RESULTS Of the 116 patients who received a posterior mesh with two arms via the infracoccygeal route through the sacrospinous ligament, midterm anatomical results were available for 78 women representing 67 % (78/116) of the operated patients. The mean follow-up was 36 (± 8.1) months. No rectal injury occurred during surgery. The objective success rate was 94.8 % and subjective (by patient satisfaction) was 93.23 %. Colorectal-Anal Impact (CRAI) and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory (CRADI) scores were both significantly decreased at midterm follow-up in comparison with baseline (42.7 at baseline vs 11.4 at 24- or 36-month follow-up, p = 0.001 for CRAI, and 81.1 vs 34.4, p < 0.001 for CRADI) highlighting the benefits of rectocele repair on colorectal-anal function. CONCLUSIONS Polypropylene mesh with two arms via the infracoccygeal route through the sacrospinous ligament has good anatomical results at midterm follow-up with significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life and is associated with few complications. Obstructive symptoms reported in cases of rectocele can be improved by transvaginal mesh repair.","Mourtialon, Pascal; Letouzey, Vincent; Eglin, Georges; de Tayrac, Renaud",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-012-1813-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22588139/,272

140777,Helping protect your practice against COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Glycemic control is suboptimal in many individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although use of flash continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has demonstrated A1C reductions in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a multiple daily injection or insulin pump therapy regimen, the glycemic benefit of this technology in patients with type 2 diabetes using nonintensive treatment regimens has not been well studied. METHODS This retrospective, observational study used the IBM Explorys database to assess changes in A1C after flash CGM prescription in a large population with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes treated with nonintensive therapy. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, age <65 years, treatment with basal insulin or noninsulin therapy, naive to any CGM, baseline A1C ≥8%, and a prescription for the FreeStyle Libre flash CGM system during the period between October 2017 and February 2020. Patients served as their own control subject. RESULTS A total of 1,034 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 51.6 ± 9.2 years, 50.9% male, baseline A1C 10.1 ± 1.7%) were assessed. More patients received noninsulin treatments (n = 728) than basal insulin therapy (n = 306). We observed a significant reduction in A1C within the full cohort: from 10.1 ± 1.7 to 8.6 ± 1.8%; Δ -1.5 ± 2.2% (P <0.001). The largest reductions were seen in patients with a baseline A1C ≥12.0% (n = 181, A1C reduction -3.7%, P <0.001). Significant reductions were seen in both treatment groups (basal insulin -1.1%, noninsulin -1.6%, both P <0.001). CONCLUSION Prescription of the flash CGM system was associated with significant reductions in A1C in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin or noninsulin therapy. These findings provide evidence for expanding access to flash CGM within the broader population of people with type 2 diabetes.","Wright, Eugene E; Kerr, Matthew S D; Reyes, Ignacio J; Nabutovsky, Yelena; Miller, Eden",Diabetes spectrum : a publication of the American Diabetes Association,https://doi.org/10.2337/ds20-0069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149259/,272

141195,Developing a Patient Safety Culture in Primary Dental Care.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND An estimated 55% of older adults in Africa have systemic hypertension, a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and dementia in the region. The risk factors associated with hypertension in this population group in Africa have not been systematically evaluated. We, therefore, undertook a systematic review to identify these risk factors. METHODS We searched for population-based studies of adults aged ≥50 years living in Africa and reporting an estimate of hypertension and associated risk factors. We included articles published in any language between January 1980 and May 2018 using a comprehensive search strategy. We extracted data including the sample characteristics, prevalence of hypertension and risk factors with their effect sizes. RESULTS From an initial 10,719 records, we retained 63 eligible full text articles for review out of which we analyzed 23 studies made up of 19 primary and four multiple publications which had data on risk factors from bivariate or multivariable analysis. The primary studies, published from 2010 to 2018, involved a total of 30,500 participants in 12 different countries with mean ages ranging from 62.7 ± 9 years to 76.9 ± 8.4 years. Through narrative synthesis, we found consistent determinants of hypertension (overweight/obesity and history of stroke), less consistent but frequent determinants (including older age group, female sex and urban residence), inconsistent determinants (including education, wealth index, alcohol intake and physical activity) and nonsignificant covariates (marital status and having health insurance). Overall, the highest adjusted odds ratios were those associated with obesity and history of stroke. CONCLUSION The key determinants of systemic hypertension in older adults in Africa are older age group, overweight/obesity, history of stroke and female sex. Health programmes should promote weight reduction throughout the life course, including during the middle and older age of African adults.","Bosu, William Kofi; Aheto, Justice Moses Kwaku; Zucchelli, Eugenio; Reilly, Siobhan Theresa",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-019-1147-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331284/,272

Braz Oral Res. 2020;34:e068.,2020-06-29,"BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery can be performed via one incision hidden in the umbilicus. Herein, we report a patient with a sigmoid colon cancer undergoing single-port laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. METHODS Laparoscopic single-port sigmoid colectomy through a 3-cm umbilical incision was performed on a patient with a diagnosis of sigmoid cancer. Patient was 54-year-old female with a body mass index of 25.8 kg/m(2). Preoperatively, a CAT scan in the metastasis evaluation did not show any lesion. RESULTS The total operative time was 198 min. Estimated blood loss was 300 ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 days. Patient had no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Examination of pathological specimen showed a specimen containing a circumferential lesion measuring 5 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm with adequate surgical margins (10 and 5.5 cm), and no regional lymph node metastases in 14 lymph nodes collected. Patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Colonoscopy performed 1 year after surgery showed no neoplasm or polyp identified. Abdomen and pelvis CT also found no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery may allow common benign procedures via an incision in the umbilicus. It can also be performed with good surgical and oncologic results in selected patients with a colorectal cancer.","Remzi, F H; Kirat, H T; Geisler, D P",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-009-0545-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19953288/,272
141895,Lessons Learned for Orthopaedic Care Within the NYC COVID Epicenter Utilizing the USNS Comfort.,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with disease severity. More accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is of high clinical importance. OBJECTIVE Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB), we aimed to build machine learning models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and uncover major risk factors involved. METHODS We first restricted the analysis to infected individuals (n=7846), then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infection as controls (ncontrols=465,728). Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. A total of 97 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (eg, hematological/liver/renal function/metabolic parameters), anthropometric measures, and other risk factors (eg, smoking/drinking) were included as predictors. We also constructed a simplified (lite) prediction model using 27 covariates that can be more easily obtained (demographic and comorbidity data). XGboost (gradient-boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values (ShapVal), permutation importance (PermImp), and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationships between risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS A total of 2386 severe and 477 fatal cases were identified. For analyses within infected individuals (n=7846), our prediction model achieved area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.723 (95% CI 0.711-0.736) and 0.814 (95% CI 0.791-0.838) for severe and fatal infections, respectively. The top 5 contributing factors (sorted by ShapVal) for severity were age, number of drugs taken (cnt_tx), cystatin C (reflecting renal function), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and Townsend deprivation index (TDI). For mortality, the top features were age, testosterone, cnt_tx, waist circumference (WC), and red cell distribution width. For analyses involving the whole UKBB population, AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.696 (95% CI 0.684-0.708) and 0.825 (95% CI 0.802-0.848), respectively. The same top 5 risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely, age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR, and TDI. Apart from the above, age, cystatin C, TDI, and cnt_tx were among the top 10 across all 4 analyses. Other diseases top ranked by ShapVal or PermImp were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dementia, among others. For the ""lite"" models, predictive performances were broadly similar, with estimated AUCs of 0.716, 0.818, 0.696, and 0.830, respectively. The top ranked variables were similar to above, including age, cnt_tx, WC, sex (male), and T2DM. CONCLUSIONS We identified numerous baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by XGboost. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multiple comorbidities, and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The prediction models may be useful at a population level to identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, facilitating targeted prevention strategies. A risk-prediction tool is also available online. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.","Wong, Kenneth Chi-Yin; Xiang, Yong; Yin, Liangying; So, Hon-Cheong",JMIR public health and surveillance,https://doi.org/10.2196/29544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591027/,272
142150,Precaution strategy toward the COVID-19 pandemic in the operating room of a tertiary hospital in Taiwan.,2020-11-09,"RATIONALE Co-use of cannabis and nicotine is common among adolescents/young adults and is associated with poorer psychological and physical outcomes, compared with single substance use. Little is known about the impact of co-use on the developing brain. OBJECTIVES Preliminary investigation of the effects of nicotine on white matter (WM) cerebral blood flow (CBF) in adolescents/young adults and its potential moderation by cannabis use. METHODS Adolescent/young adult (16-22 years old) nicotine and tobacco product users (NTP; N = 37) and non-nicotine users (non-NTP; N = 26) underwent a neuroimaging session comprised of anatomical, optimized pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Groups were compared on whole-brain WM CBF estimates and their relation to past-year cannabis use. Follow-up analyses assessed correlations between identified CBF clusters and corresponding fractional anisotropy (FA) values. RESULTS Group by cannabis effects were observed in five clusters (voxel-wise alpha < 0.001, cluster-wise alpha < 0.05; ≥ 11 contiguous voxels): non-NTP exhibited positive correlations between CBF and cannabis use in all clusters, whereas no significant relationships were observed for NTP. Greater CBF extracted from one cluster (including portions of right superior longitudinal fasciculus) was associated with reduced FA for non-NTP group only. CONCLUSIONS This is the first investigation of WM health as indexed by CBF, and its association with FA, in adolescents/young adults with nicotine and/or cannabis use. Results suggest that cannabis use by itself may be related to increased CBF in WM fiber tracts demonstrating poorer structural intergrity, yet the occurrence of even infrequent NTP use (greater than once per month) appears to diminish this relationship.","Courtney, Kelly E; Baca, Rachel; Doran, Neal; Jacobson, Aaron; Liu, Thomas T; Jacobus, Joanna",Psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-020-05640-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803367/,272

PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-four patients with gastric cancer who received LADG with lymph node dissection from January 2004 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. They were divided into three groups (A-C) according to different operative date: 41 were in Group A (early), 41 in Group B (middle), and 42 in Group C (laer). There were no significant statistical differences among the three groups with respect to age, gender, early/advanced gastric cancer, Union for International Cancer Control stage, and lymph node dissection. Then the following items were compared in these groups: operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and long-term survival. RESULTS The operative time in Group A (235.0±50.3 minutes) was significantly longer than in Groups B (201.7±39.6 minutes) and C (199.0±44.7 minutes), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The harvest of lymph nodes from Group A (11.0±5.5) was significantly less than from Groups B (16.3±9.2) and C (17.2±8.7), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The postoperative hospital stay and complications, overall survival, and disease-free survival showed no difference among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve of gastrointestinal surgeons with experience of laparoscopic operation is about 40 cases. The oncological principles and long-term outcomes were not sacrificed during the learning stage.","Hu, Wei-guo; Ma, Jun-Jun; Zang, Lu; Xue, Pei; Xu, Hua; Wang, Ming-Liang; Lu, Ai-Guo; Li, Jian-Wen; Feng, Bo; Zheng, Min-Hua",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Far from being uniform in structure and function, these enzymes display a myriad of distinct mechanistic features. The small number (<100) of DUBs might at first suggest a low degree of selectivity; however, DUBs are subject to multiple layers of regulation that modulate both their activity and their specificity.

Although around 60% of the world's population are seropositive for HSV antigens, fortunately, it is estimated that only 1% of seropositive individuals develop eye disease. The most common ocular manifestation of HSV is keratitis, while uveitis and retinal necrosis occur in a small number of cases. HSV keratitis is a debilitating disease, for several reasons: pain , photophobia, and vision loss in acute disease, latency of the virus which leads to infection reactivation from various triggers, scarring, and neovascularisation, leading to permanent vision loss with poor visual rehabilitation prospects. The Herpetic Eye Disease Study (HEDS) was a landmark series of randomised controlled trials in the 1990s that set the benchmark for evidence-based treatment guidelines for anterior eye herpetic disease. Since this time, there has been a change in the distribution of seroprevalence of herpes in the community, a simplified diagnostic classification, advances in treatment options, an emergence of new and a better understanding of risk factors, and discoveries in science that show promise for vaccine and novel future treatments. However, many of the principles of the HEDS study remain rightly entrenched in clinical practice.

We reviewed publications from five databases (ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Global Health Library) as well as grey literature from expert groups including WHO, IWA, and others; findings from 61 eligible review publications were synthesized. Identified sources of TMs in included studies were natural occurrence (geogenic), catchment pollution, and corrosion of water distribution system materials.

Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.","Henrick, Bethany M; Rodriguez, Lucie; Lakshmikanth, Tadepally; Pou, Christian; Henckel, Ewa; Arzoomand, Aron; Olin, Axel; Wang, Jun; Mikes, Jaromir; Tan, Ziyang; Chen, Yang; Ehrlich, Amy M; Bernhardsson, Anna Karin; Mugabo, Constantin Habimana; Ambrosiani, Ylva; Gustafsson, Anna; Chew, Stephanie; Brown, Heather K; Prambs, Johann; Bohlin, Kajsa; Mitchell, Ryan D; Underwood, Mark A; Smilowitz, Jennifer T; German, J Bruce; Frese, Steven A; Brodin, Petter",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143954/,272

The causative agent was later confirmed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread throughout the world, giving rise in 2020 to the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which, according to the world map of the World Health Organization, has, until May 18, 2021, infected 163,312,429 people and caused 3,386,825 deaths throughout the world. Most critical patients progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, in underlying form, to septic shock, irreversible metabolic acidosis, blood coagulation dysfunction, or hemostatic and thrombotic anomalies have been reported as the leading causes of death due to COVID-19. The main findings in severe and fatal COVID-19 patients make it clear that platelets play a crucial role in developing severe disease cases. Platelets are the enucleated cells responsible for hemostasis and thrombi formation; thus, platelet hyperreactivity induced by pro-inflammatory microenvironments contributes to the ""cytokine storm"" that characterizes the more aggressive course of COVID- 19.","Esparza-Ibarra, Edgar L; Ayala-Luján, Jorge L; Mendoza-Almanza, Brenda; González-Curiel, Irma; Godina-González, Susana; Hernández-Barrales, Marisa; Mendoza-Almanza, Gretel",Current molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2174/1566524021666210910112404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514997/,272

We included randomized controlled trials of adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery. We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality at the longest follow-up: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76-1.05; P=0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The intervention reduced the rate of three morbidities (renal failure, respiratory failure, and wound infections) but not the rates of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, venous thrombosis, and other types of infections. The number of patients with complications was also reduced by the intervention. Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by 1.16 days. There was no difference in critical care length of stay. The primary analysis of this review showed no difference between groups but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and was dominated by a single large study. Patients receiving this intervention stayed in hospital 1 day less with fewer complications. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.","Grocott, M P W; Dushianthan, A; Hamilton, M A; Mythen, M G; Harrison, D; Rowan, K",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23661403/,272
155523,Viral infections in the ICU.,2008,"Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.","Dost, Burhan; Koksal, Ersin; Terzi, Özlem; Bilgin, Sezgin; Ustun, Yasemin Burcu; Arslan, Hatice Nilden",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2020.097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275463/,272

TM4SF1-AS1 is recently identified as a tumor-promoting factor in lung cancer. Nevertheless, its function in HCC and related molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, our data indicated that either hypoxia or hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (DMOG) induced the upregulation of TM4SF1-AS1 in HCC cells. HIF-1α knockdown rather than HIF-2α silencing remarkably abrogated hypoxia-upregulated TM4SF1-AS1 expression. Furthermore, we confirmed the elevated expression of TM4SF1-AS1 in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. The silencing of TM4SF1-AS1 prominently inhibited the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of HCC cells. TM4SF1-AS1 depletion significantly blocked hypoxia-enhanced Hep3B cell proliferation and mobility. Interfering TM4SF1-AS1 remarkably reduced TM4SF1 mRNA and protein levels in HCC cells. But TM4SF1-AS1 knockdown did not impact the stability of TM4SF1 mRNA. Hypoxia enhanced the expression of TM4SF1 mRNA, which was subsequently decreased by TM4SF1-AS1 knockdown in HCC cells. We confirmed the positive correlation between TM4SF1 mRNA and TM4SF1-AS1 expression in HCC specimens. Finally, TM4SF1 prominently reversed the inhibitory role of TM4SF1-AS1 depletion in Hep3B cells. In summary, hypoxia-responsive TM4SF1-AS1 was overexpressed in human HCC and contributed to the malignant behaviors of tumor cells by enhancing TM4SF1-AS1 expression.","Zeng, Zhi; Shi, Zhan; Liu, Yang; Zhao, Junjun; Lu, Qiliang; Guo, Jinhui; Liu, Xin; Huang, Dongsheng; Xu, Qiuran",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118595/,272

Methods We conducted a prospective study on 68 patients who underwent LSG and 58 cases, who were enrolled as a control group, to whom conservative measures of weight loss were adopted. Both groups were followed for 12 months. Results At the baseline, the serum GDF15 was comparable between LSG and conservative groups (409.93±119 versus 385.8±120.2 pg/mL, p =0.246). However, at 12 months after the operation, the serum GDF15 was significantly higher in the LSG than conservative groups (699.941 ±193.5 versus 559 ±159.7; p <0.001). The degree of serum GDF15 increase was higher in the LSG group (290.01 ±189.9 versus 173.14 ±116.7; p <0.001). The degree of serum GDF15 increase correlated negatively with the final BMI (r = -0.352, p =0.001) and weight loss (r = -0.793, p =0.001) at 12 months after the operation. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the initial GFD15 did not correlate with any baseline parameters. Multiple regression analysis of change in serum GDF15 showed a statistical significance of the weight loss after 12 months. Conclusion The present work confirms the impact of successful weight loss on the circulating level of GDF15. Our study demonstrated that the circulating GDF15 increased significantly after LSG and it was correlated to the degree of weight loss.","Salman, Ahmed; Shaaban, Hossam El-Din; Salman, Mohamed; M Seif El Nasr, Sayed; Soliman, Ahmed; Salem, Abdoh; Tag El-Din, Mohamed; Mikhail, Hani Maurice Sabri; El Domiaty, Heba; Abd Allah, Nesrin; GabAllah, Ghada M K; Youssef, Ahmed",Journal of inflammation research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s304929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880052/,272

An intensive external facilitation intervention may enhance uptake in low-adopting VHA facilities by engaging stakeholders from multiple clinical settings within a facility (e.g., mental health, primary care, pain specialty clinic, substance use disorder clinics). Our study identified pre-intervention determinants of implementation through qualitative interviews, described strategies employed during the first 6 months of intensive external facilitation, and explored patterns of implementation determinants in relation to early outcomes. METHODS Guided by the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, we interviewed stakeholders at low-adopting VHA facilities prior to external facilitation, employed a rapid qualitative analytic process, presented findings during facility visits, and collaboratively created facilitation action plans to achieve goals set by the facilities that would increase M-OUD uptake. The primary outcome was the Substance Use Disorder (SUD)-16, which is a VHA facility-level performance metric consisting of the percent of patients receiving M-OUD among those with an OUD diagnosis. We examined the relationship between pre-implementation factors and 6-month SUD-16 outcomes. RESULTS Across eight VHA facilities, we interviewed 68 participants. Implementation determinants included barriers and facilitators across innovation, context, and recipients constructs of i-PARIHS. Each facility selected goals based on the qualitative results. At 6 months, two facilities achieved most goals and two facilities demonstrated progress. The SUD-16 from baseline to 6 months significantly improved in two facilities (8.4% increase (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4.4-12.4) and 9.9% increase (95% CI 3.6-16.2), respectively). Six-month implementation outcomes showed that the extent to which M-OUD aligns with existing clinical practices and values was a primary factor at all facilities, with six of eight facilities perceiving it as both a barrier and facilitator. External health system barriers were most challenging for facilities with the smallest change in SUD-16. CONCLUSIONS Early impacts of a multi-faceted implementation approach demonstrated a strong signal for positively impacting M-OUD prescribing in low-adopting VHA facilities. This signal indicates that external facilitation can influence adoption of M-OUD at the facility level in the early implementation phase. These short-term wins experienced by stakeholders may encourage continued adoption and long-term sustainability M-OUD.","Gustavson, Allison M; Wisdom, Jennifer P; Kenny, Marie E; Salameh, Hope A; Ackland, Princess E; Clothier, Barbara; Noorbaloochi, Siamak; Gordon, Adam J; Hagedorn, Hildi J",Implementation science communications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00119-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588952/,272

160130,Apnoeic ventilation for shared airway surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"INTRODUCTION With a focus on raising the quality of hernia care through creation of educational programs, SAGES formed the Hernia Task Force (HTF). This study used needs assessment survey to target opportunities for improving surgical training and thus patient outcomes and experience. METHODS This qualitative study included structured interviews and online surveys of key stakeholders: HTF members, surgeons, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, healthcare payers and medical suppliers. Questions included perceptions of recurrence and complication rates, their etiologies, perceived deficits in current hernia care and the most effective and training modalities. RESULTS A total of 841 participants included 665 surgeons, 66 patient care team members, 12 hospital administrators and 14 medical supply providers. Assessment of technical approach revealed that nearly 26 % of surgeons apply the same, limited range of techniques to all patients without evaluation of patient-specific factors. The majority (71 %) of surgeon respondents related hernia recurrence rates nearing 25 % or more. HTF members implicated surgeon factors (deficits in knowledge/technique, etc.) as primary determinants of recurrences, whereas nurses, medical supply providers and hospital administrators implicated patient health factors. Surgeons preferred attending conferences (82 %), reading periodicals/publications (71 %), watching videos (59 %) and communicating with peers (57 %) for learning and skill improvement. Topics of the greatest interest were advanced techniques for hernia repairs (71 %), preoperative and intraoperative decision making (56 %) and patient outcomes (64 %). Eighty-six percent of nurses felt that there was room for improvement in hernia patient safety and teamwork in the OR. Only 24 % believed that the patients had adequate preoperative education. CONCLUSIONS Major reported deficits in hernia care include: lack of standardization in training and care, ""one size fits all"" technical approach and inadequate patient follow-up/outcome measures. There is a need for a comprehensive, flexible and tailored educational program to equip surgeons and their teams to raise the quality of hernia care and bring greater value to their patients.","Park, Adrian E; Zahiri, Hamid Reza; Pugh, Carla M; Vassiliou, Melina; Voeller, Guy",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4309-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26123329/,272

Haematol. 2017; 176:498) reported that CD56 positive is associated with poor prognosis of patients with intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (IR-AML). However, our data were inconsistent with the finding. Thus, in this study, we provided the different results to discuss. METHODS A total of 262 bone marrow transcriptomic data of IR-AML in the GSE12417-GPL96 and GSE71014-GPL-10558 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) database, and 92 IR-AML patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database were obtained for prognostic analysis and validation. RESULTS Compared with low CD56 expression, IR-AML patients with high CD56 expression had a longer overall survival (OS) time and restricted mean survival time (RMST) and favorable OS rate in the GSE12417-GPL96 dataset. These results were confirmed in both GSE71014-GPL-10558 and TCGA datasets. Importantly, the inconsistency between our findings and the previous finding may be due to the following reasons: different detection methods, age stratification, countries, treatment options etc. CONCLUSIONS The prognostic value of CD56 expression in IR-AML may need to be comprehensively evaluated based on different detection methods, age stratification, countries, treatment options, and other factors. If confirmed, CD56 may be a biomarker for further risk stratification for IR-AML patients.","Chen, Cunte; Chio, Chi Leong; Zeng, Hui; Li, Yangqiu",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2021.1880734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594945/,272

METHODS Data were collected on all croup hospitalizations for patients aged 1 month to 17 years admitted through a community hospital's emergency department (ED) between 2012 and 2017. Potential predictors were obtained from the electronic medical records including demographics, vital signs, ED length of stay, preintervention and postintervention Westley Croup Score (WCS), number of racemic epinephrine nebulizations administered, time to dexamethasone administration, preexisting conditions, and additional interventions during hospitalization. Statistical analysis used the outcome ""patient received racemic epinephrine after hospital admission (yes/no)"" to identify characteristics of the child or ED visit associated with that outcome. Preliminary analyses using stepwise logistic regression, tree models, and random forests suggested predictors, interactions among predictors, and the form of their association with the outcome. A final analysis used logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 116 croup admissions were included, of which 19 (16%) received racemic epinephrine posthospitalization. These characteristics were identified as having some predictive power: sex, preexisting conditions, and preintervention and postintervention WCS, along with the interaction between sex and postintervention WCS. Logistic regression estimated an equation describing the probability of postadmission intervention, permitting the choice among admission thresholds giving different sensitivities and specificities. CONCLUSIONS There appear to be promising predictors in croup patients presenting to the ED, which might help stratify risk for interventions after the ED encounter and thus reduce the number of potentially avoidable admissions.","Maalouli, Walid M; Hodges, James S",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000001829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925569/,272
161646,Increased occurrence of hand eczema in young children following the Danish hand hygiene recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-10-21,"Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular alpha-synuclein (eSNCA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies by inducing neurotoxicity directly or indirectly via microglial or astroglial activation. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be characterized. To explore these mechanisms, we combined three biochemical techniques - stable isotope labeling of amino acid in cell cultures (SILAC), biotin labeling of plasma membrane proteins followed by affinity purification, and analysis of unique proteins binding to SNCA peptides on membrane arrays. The SILAC proteomic analysis identified 457 proteins, of which, 245 or 172 proteins belonged to membrane or membrane associated proteins, depending on the various bioinformatics tools used for interpretation. In dopamine neuronal cells treated with eSNCA, the levels of 86 membrane proteins were increased and 35 were decreased compared with untreated cells. In peptide array analysis, 127 proteins were identified as possibly interacting with eSNCA. Of those, seven proteins were overlapped with the membrane proteins that displayed alterations in relative abundance after eSNCA treatment. One was ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor, which appeared to modulate eSNCA-mediated neurotoxicity via mechanisms related to JAK1/STAT3 signaling but independent of eSNCA endocytosis.","Liu, Jun; Shi, Min; Hong, Zhen; Zhang, JianPeng; Bradner, Joshua; Quinn, Thomas; Beyer, Richard P; Mcgeer, Patrick L; Chen, ShengDi; Zhang, Jing",Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.200900745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20340160/,272

Several studies demonstrated improved recanalization and clinical outcomes with the stent retriever devices compared with the Merci device. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) and recanalization success in a substudy of the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. METHODS The investigator-initiated NASA registry recruited 24 clinical sites within North America to submit demographic, clinical, site-adjudicated angiographic, and clinical outcome data on consecutive patients treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device. BGC use was at the discretion of the treating physicians. RESULTS There were 354 patients included in the NASA registry. BGC data were reported in 338 of 354 patients in this subanalysis, of which 149 (44%) had placement of a BGC. Mean age was 67.3±15.2 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18. Patients with BGC had more hypertension (82.4% versus 72.5%; P=0.05), atrial fibrillation (50.3% versus 32.8%; P=0.001), and were more commonly administered tissue plasminogen activator (51.6% versus 38.8%; P=0.02) compared with patients without BGC. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture and number of passes were similar between the 2 groups. Procedure time was shorter in patients with BGC (120±28.5 versus 161±35.6 minutes; P=0.02), and less adjunctive therapy was used in patients with BGC (20% versus 28.6%; P=0.05). Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 reperfusion scores were higher in patients with BGC (53.7% versus 32.5%; P<0.001). Distal emboli and emboli in new territory were similar between the 2 groups. Discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (mean, 12±14.5 versus 17.5±16; P=0.002) and good clinical outcome at 3 months were superior in patients with BGC compared with patients without (51.6% versus 35.8%; P=0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of BGC was an independent predictor of good clinical outcome (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9). CONCLUSIONS Use of a BGC with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device resulted in superior revascularization results, faster procedure times, decreased need for adjunctive therapy, and improved clinical outcome.","Nguyen, Thanh N; Malisch, Timothy; Castonguay, Alicia C; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman O; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; English, Joey D; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Marden, Franklin A; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael T; Badruddin, Aamir; Taqi, Muhammad; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Novakovic, Roberta; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng R; Britz, Gavin W; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; Issa, Mohammad A; Masoud, Hesham; Nogueira, Raul G; Norbash, Alexander M; Zaidat, Osama O",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.002407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24302483/,272

Patients were divided into two groups according to the date of the positive laboratory test result: the first surge (February 1 to May 22) and the second surge (May 23 to August 31). Patients' characteristics were compared between the two groups. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model was applied to compare severity and mortality between the two groups, where sex, age group at the onset date, city of residence, and days to test positive were adjusted. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 8,541 patients included 1,780 and 6,761 patients in the first and second surges, respectively. Age at the onset date was younger in the second surge (p < 0.001), and median of days from the onset date to the positive test date shortened from 7 to 6 days (p < 0.001).

163231,Edible dry fruits and seeds in combating second wave of COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Norwegian kveik are a recently described family of domesticated Saccharomyces cerevisiae brewing yeasts used by farmhouse brewers in western Norway for generations to produce traditional Norwegian farmhouse ale. Kveik ale yeasts have been domesticated by farmhouse brewers through serial repitching of the yeast in warm wort (>30°C) punctuated by long periods of dry storage. Kveik yeasts are alcohol tolerant, flocculant, capable of utilizing maltose/maltotriose, phenolic off flavour negative, and exhibit elevated thermotolerance when compared to other modern brewer’s yeasts belonging to the ‘Beer 1’ clade. However, the optimal fermentation and growth temperatures (Topt) for kveik ale yeasts and the influence of fermentation temperature of the production of flavour-active metabolites like fusel alcohols and sulfur compounds (H2S, SO2) are not known. Here we show that kveik ale yeasts have an elevated optimal fermentation temperature (Topt) when compared to commercial American Ale yeast (SafAle™ US-05) and that they produce fewer off-flavours at high temperatures (>30°C) when compared to commercial American Ale yeasts. The tested kveik yeasts show significantly higher maximum fermentation rates than American Ale yeast not only at elevated temperatures (>30°C), but also at ‘typical’ ale fermentation temperatures (20°C-25°C). Finally, we demonstrate that kveik ale yeasts are heterogeneous in their Topt and that they attenuate standard wort robustly above their Topt unlike our control American Ale yeast which showed very poor apparent attenuation in our standard wort at temperatures ≫ Topt. Our results provide further support that kveik yeasts may possess favourable fermentation kinetics and sensory properties compared to American Ale yeasts. The observations here provide a roadmap for brewers to fine tune their commercial fermentations using kveik ale yeasts for optimal performance and/or flavour impact.","Kits, Dimitri; Garshol, Lars Marius",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.448505,272
163769,Immediate psychological effects of COVID-2019 in people sheltered in place living in New York state,2021,"Families are the natural environment for children to grow. Children have the right to be cared for by their parents;parents have a responsibility to provide for their children?s upbringing and development. States have the responsibility to provide special protection and assistance to millions of children in South Asia who no longer have families, who have become separated from their families, or whose families represent a serious danger to their health or development. There is a spectrum of services available to children whose parents no longer provide adequate care, known as Out of Home Care or Alternate Care.There are growing concerns about the situation of children outside parental care and the provision of suitable alternatives in South Asia. These children often find themselves at a high risk of violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, and their well-being is often insufficiently monitored. An inadequate care environment can impair a child?s emotional and social development, and leave children extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, including sexual abuse and physical violence.Across the South Asian region, the combined impacts of widespread poverty, prolonged armed conflict, frequent natural disasters and the spread of COVID-19 is exerting extreme pressure on families and communities, as well as on the limited social services available to support them.The present article aims to study the various policies, laws & schemes supporting two forms of alternate care, namely, foster care & adoption in South Asia, identify the gaps in the implementation and make certain recommendations.","Saxena, Ratna Bhardwaj Bhavyaa",Institutionalised Children Explorations and Beyond,https://doi.org/10.1177/23493003211001133,272

A successful clinical translation of GAGs as biomarkers depends on the availability of standardized GAG measurements. However, owing to the analytical complexity associated with the quantification of GAG concentration and structural composition, a standardized method to simultaneously measure multiple GAGs is missing. In this study, we sought to characterize the analytical performance of a liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based kit for the quantification of 17 GAG disaccharides. The kit showed acceptable linearity, selectivity and specificity, accuracy and precision, and analyte stability in the absolute quantification of 15 GAG disaccharides. In native human samples, here using urine as a reference matrix, the analytical performance of the kit was acceptable for the quantification of CS disaccharides. Intra- and inter-laboratory tests performed in an external laboratory demonstrated robust reproducibility of GAG measurements showing that the kit was acceptably standardized. In conclusion, these results indicated that the LC-MS/MS kit was standardized for the simultaneous measurement of GAG disaccharides allowing for comparability of measurements and enabling translational research.","Tamburro, Davide; Bratulic, Sinisa; Shameh, Souad Abou; Soni, Nikul K; Bacconi, Andrea; Maccari, Francesca; Galeotti, Fabio; Mattsson, Karin; Volpi, Nicola; Nielsen, Jens; Gatto, Francesco",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.04.429694,272

It identifies key themes and compares the main topics studied in both the tourism and hospitality management and marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach: A narrative (thematic) review and synthesis was completed based on articles published in the top 20 tourism and hospitality management journals from 2011 to March 2021. A review was conducted of the generic literature from 2016 to 2020. Findings: From 210 papers reviewed, only 47 are in the hospitality field. The authors found that 80% of papers were empirical with slightly more quantitative papers produced. The majority of the papers focused on crises. Three key themes were found from the review and future research proposed to address gaps based on these findings and a review of 26 papers from the generic risk, crisis and disaster management field. Practical implications: Research is required into planning and preparedness, not just response and recovery to crises and disasters. Future research should consider hospitality rather than tourism, particularly focusing attention outside of the accommodation sector. Hospitality studies also need to go beyond the micro-organizational level to include more meso- and macro-level studies. Originality/value: The review provides a number of future research directions for tourism and hospitality research in the field. The paper provides a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework to synthesize studies and identifies research gaps. It also provides recommendations on methodologies required to progress these research directions.

Immune changes associated with severe disease include pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expansion of immature myeloid populations. The relative importance of the immunological changes in driving progression to severe disease remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify and rank clinical and immunological features associated with progression to severe COVID-19. We sought to use tests available in an on-site diagnostic hospital laboratory to identify an immunological signature for severe disease development which could be detected prior to peak severity thereby allowing initiation of therapeutic interventions. We used univariate and multivariate analysis, including unbiased machine learning, to investigate the relationships between clinical and demographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, and leukocyte immunophenotypes with progression to severe disease in 108 patients and to rank these in importance. A combination of four features (elevated levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, coupled with reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression and reduced neutrophil CD10 expression), were strongly predictive of severe disease with an average prediction score of 0.925.","Townsend, L.; Dyer, A.

The author examines differences between the two business models and analyses various strategies of Airbnb hosts to cope with the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: A detailed empirical analysis is presented based on data from STR and Inside Airbnb for the period January 2018–September 2020. To assess the impact of the pandemic on the hotel industry, year-to-year changes in various performance metrics are presented. The author also investigates the impact of the pandemic on Airbnb prices with panel data regression analysis. Using text-mining methods, signs for new use-cases are explored, including renting flats for home-office or quarantine. Findings: The results support that Airbnb supply is more flexible. While hotel supply quickly returned to a level close to 2019, the average number of Airbnb listings was lower by more than 15%. Furthermore, the price analysis showed that Airbnb rates decreased more moderately than hotel prices. These findings suggest that a significant share of hosts pivoted from short-term accommodation provision and used their property differently, e.g. rented on a long-term basis. The analysis of listing characteristics revealed that the role of longer stays increased;however, the results do not support a shift towards advertising listings for home-office or quarantine purposes.

169341,Psychiatric morbidity among patients tested positive and isolated for COVID-19,2021,"Background: Since the beginning of the pandemic in Switzerland, immunosuppressed people were strongly advised to be tested for SARS-CoV2 when symptomatic as it was conjectured that they might be more at risk for infection and/ or severe disease. While patients with autoimmune diseases might be indeed more at risk of death from COVID-191, it remains unknown, whether there are differences in infection or complication rates between patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), and whether this relates to their disease or their treatment. Additionally, the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 testing in this population is not known. Objectives: This study aimed to assess and compare the rate of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 testing in patients with RA, AxSpA and PsA, the potential association with their treatment and, for testing, the number of symptoms. Methods: We included patients with RA, AxSpA and PsA from the Swiss Clinical Quality Management register (SCQM) using a smartphone app (mySCQM) to record information between March and December 2020. The outcomes of interest were self-reported SARS-CoV2 testing, symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during the previous month and confirmed COVID-19 through PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Outcomes were evaluated over the complete length of the aforementioned period (i.e. the outcome has been reported at least once during the period). Outcomes were compared between diseases groups, using logistic regression. We also evaluated the association of baseline treatment (TNF-inhibitors, b/tsDMARDs with other modes of action (OMA), no b/tsDMARDs) on the odds of symptoms and testing and the association of the number of symptoms (0-9) on the odds of testing. The analyses of SARS-CoV2 testing and COVID-19 symptoms were additionally adjusted for age, gender, glucocorticoids and csDMARDs. Confirmed cases were not adjusted for treatment and other covariates considering the low number of events. Results: We included 927 patients with RA, 805 with AxSpa and 453 with PsA (Table 1). 1010 patients reported COVID-19-like symptoms (mostly fever, runny nose and cough), but only 455 of them (45%) reported being tested. 151 patients were tested without symptoms. In between March and December 2020, 7.6% of RA, 8.5% of AxSpA and 10.5% of PsA patients were tested positive for COVID-19 (p=0.678). The odds of testing, symptoms and confirmed COVID-19 were similar between diseases and not associated with treatment for testing and symptoms (Figure 1). The number of symptoms was associated with the odds of testing (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.37-1.50 by symptom). Conclusion: Prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms and confirmed cases was similar between diseases, and for symptoms, was not associated with treatment. Despite strong advice from health authorities, less than 50% of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 symptoms were tested. This proportion was not significantly different between diseases and not influenced by type of treatment. Efforts should be made to improve rates of SARS-CoV2 testing in patients with rheumatic diseases.","Papagiannoulis, E.; Ciurea, A.; Dan, D.; Finckh, A.; Gilbert, B.; Von Loga, I.; Melong Pianta Taleng, C.; Scherer, A.; Lauper, K.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.683,272

We analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 80 unique individuals from India coming from families with two or more individuals with severe mental illness. We used Population Branch Statistics (PBS) to identify variants and genes under positive selection and identified 75 genes as candidates for positive selection. Of these, 20 were previously associated with Schizophrenia, Alzheimers disease and cognitive abilities in genome wide association studies. We then checked whether any of these 75 genes were involved in common biological pathways or related to specific cellular or molecular functions. We found that immune related pathways and functions related to innate immunity such as antigen binding were over-represented. We also evaluated for the presence of Neanderthal introgressed segments in these genes and found Neanderthal introgression in a single gene out of the 75 candidate genes. However, the introgression pattern indicates the region is unlikely to be the source for selection. Our findings hint at how selection pressures in individuals from families with a history of severe mental illness may diverge from the general population. Further, it also provides insights into the genetic architecture of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia and its link to immune factors.","Mahadevan, J.; Pathak, A.

The universality of allosteric regulation complemented by the benefits of highly specific, potentially non-toxic and protein activity modulating allosteric drugs makes uncovering allosteric sites on proteins invaluable for drug discovery. However, there are few computational methods to effectively predict them. Bond-to-bond propensity analysis, a recently developed method, has successfully predicted allosteric sites for a diverse group of proteins with only the knowledge of the orthosteric sites and the corresponding ligands in 19 of 20 cases. The method is based on an energy-weighted atomistic protein graph and allows for computationally highly efficient analysis in atomistic detail. We here extended the analysis onto 432 structures of 146 proteins from two existing benchmarking datasets for allosteric proteins: ASBench and CASBench. We further refined the metrics to account for the cumulative effect of residues with high propensities and the crucial residues in a given site with two additional measures. The allosteric site is recovered for 95/113 proteins (99/118 structures) from ASBench and 32/33 proteins (304/314 structures) from CASBench, with the only a priori knowledge being the orthosteric site residues. Knowing the orthosteric ligands of the protein, the allosteric site is identified for 32/33 proteins (308/314 structures) from CASBench.","Wu, Nan; Strömich, Léonie; Yaliraki, Sophia N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.16.456251,272

(Special Issue: Modelling that shaped the early COVID-19 pandemic response in the UK.),2021,"Spatial transcriptomics has been emerging as a powerful technique for resolving gene expression profiles while retaining tissue spatial information. These spatially resolved transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by integrating the available spatial information. Here, we introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is scalable to large ‘sample sizes’. We then employed SC-MEB to analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for investigating the structural organizations of tissues from spatial transcriptomic data.","Yang, Yi; Shi, Xingjie; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Qiuzhong; Lau, Mai Chan; Lim, Jeffrey Chun Tatt; Sun, Lei; Yeong, Joe; Liu, Jin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.05.447181,272
176192,On the continuity of rehabilitation and meeting the patients’ needs: Online psychosocial treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The observed monthly mean PM2.5concentration in South Korea during December 2020 has decreased by 2.3 μg/m3, compared to that during the same month in the previous year, but the drivers of the change have been veiled yet. This study quantitatively examines the roles of the potential drivers of the PM2.5decrease during December 2020. Air quality simulations for December 2019 and December 2020 show that the change in meteorology conditions have increased the PM2.5concentrations by 1.4 μg/m3in South Korea, but the changes in the Northeast Asian emissions have decreased the PM2.5concentrations by 3.7 μg/m3in the country. In addition, foreign emission impact on the nationwide PM2.5concentrations estimated from a set of the sensitivity simulations with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model and adjusted with the surface observations in China has increased by 1.9 μg/m3in December 2020, compared to that for December 2019. It means that the upwind foreign emission condition was not helpful in the downwind PM2.5decrease. On the contrary, the domestic impact has decreased by 4.2 μg/m3over the country, which compensated the increase in the foreign impact for the month. The observed monthly mean NO2concentrations have decreased by 5% and 8% for South Korea and the Seoul Metropolitan Area, respectively, compared to the same month in 2019. When a simple observation-based emission adjustment was applied, a 5% decrease in the national total NOxemissions for the month was estimated. The causality of NO2decrease still needs further investigations, but the seasonal PM2.5management and social distancing after the COVID-19 re-outbreak at the end of November might have led to the reduction in the anthropogenic emissions (i.e., NOx) and thus the PM2.5concentrations during the month. © 2021.

With the availability of multiple vaccines across the globe, framing vaccination policies for effectively inoculating a country’s population against such diseases is currently a crucial task for public health agencies. Social network users post their views and opinions on vaccines publicly and these posts can be put to good use in identifying vaccine hesitancy. In this paper, a vaccine hesitancy identification approach is proposed, built on novel text feature modeling based on evolutionary computation and topic modeling. The proposed approach was experimentally validated on two standard tweet datasets – the flu vaccine dataset and UK COVID-19 vaccine tweets. On the first dataset, the proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art in terms of standard metrics. The proposed model was also evaluated on the UKCOVID dataset and the results are presented in this paper, as our work is the first to benchmark a vaccine hesitancy model on this dataset. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Krishnan, G.

We report the case of a 26-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of fatigue;she was diagnosed with COVID-19 and later developed ICH after cesarean section (C/S) delivery. The patient was tested for COVID-19 as her husband tested positive for it. After COVID-19 diagnosis, labor induction was decided due to amniorrhexis. Despite eight hours of labor induction, owing to the asynclitic presentation of the fetus, vaginal delivery did not progress;therefore, a C/S was performed. The patient gave birth to a healthy baby, and favipiravir treatment was initiated. On day nine of hospitalization, she complained of nausea and headache. Brain computed tomography revealed an intraparenchymal hematoma. The patient did not have any risk factors, except pregnancy. The hematoma was removed, and hemorrhage was resolved;however, a brain edema developed. After dexamethasone and mannitol treatment, her condition improved and she was transferred to the clinic.

Methods: We report an anonymous online survey in Thailand conducted in May 2020 to assess public perceptions of three interventions in the Thai context: isolation, quarantine and social distancing. A total of 1,020 participants, of whom 52% were women, responded to the survey. Results: Loss of income was the main concern among respondents (>80% for all provinces in Thailand). Traditional media and social media were important channels for communication during the pandemic. A total of 92% of respondents reported that they changed their social behaviour even before the implementation of government policy with 94% reporting they performed social distancing, 97% reported using personal protective equipment such as masks and 95% reported using sanitizer products. Conclusions: This study showed a high level of compliance from individuals with government enforced or voluntarily controls such as quarantine, isolation and social distancing in Thailand. The findings from this study can be used to inform future government measures to control the pandemic and to shape communication strategies.","Pan-Ngum, W.; Poomchaichote, T.; Peerawaranun, P.; Kulpijit, N.; Osterrieder, A.; Waithira, N.; Mukaka, M.; Naemiratch, B.; Chanviriyavuth, R.; Asarath, S.

178622,Clozapine point of care testing in acute psychiatry: A precision approach to treatment resistant psychosis,2021,"Older humans and animals often exhibit reduced immune responses to infection and vaccination, and this often directly correlates to the numbers and frequency of naïve T (Tn) cells. We found such a correlation between reduced numbers of blood CD8+ Tn cells and severe clinical outcomes of WNV in both humans naturally exposed to, and mice experimentally infected with, West Nile virus (WNV). To examine possible causality, we sought to increase the number of CD8 Tn cells by treating C57BL/6 mice with IL-7 complexes (IL-7C, anti-IL-7 mAb bound to IL-7), shown previously to efficiently increase peripheral T cell numbers by homeostatic proliferation. T cells underwent robust expansion following IL-7C administration to old mice increasing the number of total T cells (>four-fold) and NS4b:H-2Db-restricted antigen-specific CD8 T cells (two-fold). This improved the numbers of NS4b-specific CD8 T cells detected at the peak of the response against WNV, but not survival in the face of WNV challenge. IL-7C treated old animals also showed no improvement in WNV-specific effector immunity (neutralizing antibody and in vivo T cell cytotoxicity). To test quantitative limits to which CD8 Tn cell restoration could improve protective immunity, we transferred graded doses of Ag-specific precursors into old mice and showed that injection of 5,400 (but not of 1,800 or 600) adult naïve WNV-specific CD8 T cells significantly increased survival after WNV. These results set quantitative limits to the level of Tn reconstitution necessary to improve immune defense in older organisms and are discussed in light of targets of immune reconstitution.","Uhrlaub, Jennifer L.; Jergović, Mladen; Bradshaw, Christine M.; Sonar, Sandip; Coplen, Christopher P.; Dudakov, Jarrod; Murray, Kristy O.; Lanteri, Marion C.; Busch, Michael P.; van den Brink, Marcel R.

This thesis aims to analyze the reactor temperature that yields a higher RON (octane measurement) value in isomerate product using all available information in the isomerate production network. The main explanatory variables that can affect the RON value can be divided into three categories: feed impurities, isomerization reactor operations, deizohexanizer column operations. Isomerate feed network is quite complex and fed by different crude distillation units and cracker units. Various reactions occur in the isomerization reactors, and depending on the feed content, the reaction mechanism changes. This thesis applies machine learning algorithms to build a model that can capture the relationship between RON and reactor temperature with the other explanatory variables. We implemented a number of machine learning algorithms to assess their performance on the problem, specifically Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression, and KNN. Comparing with the linear regression, we achieved 0.82 decreases in the mean absolute error. The mean absolute error of the XGBoost model is 0.08 RON. We find a temperature value with the selected model that yields a higher RON number by trying different temperature values while keeping the same values for the other variables. If we used the suggested temperature by our model, we predict that we could obtain a 0.2 RON increase in the validation zone resulting in an annual profit increase of 528 000 USD Dollar. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Serfidan, A.

181691,Evaluation of elderly patients that presented to dermatology outpatient clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective study,2021,"ABSTRACT In response to the industrial world becoming more complex and the recent social distancing caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) are gaining importance for industrial training. The novelty, however, does not lie in the sole use of VR-based technology but rather in its adaptive and flexible nature. This paper explores the synergy between VR environments and adaptive-based learning and tests the proposed approach in the railway sector. An iterative co-design approach is adopted to develop a VR-based training system for educating train conductors. The developed system is validated with ten conductors, where their learning preference, learning outcome, and learning performance were assessed. The results show an increase in individual motivation and perceived usefulness for the developed VR-based training system, demonstrating a higher learning preference, in comparison to the currently used physical simulator. Similarly, the results outline a knowledge gain in two out of six key knowledge subjects for conductor education and indicate that time improvements per exercise are needed to meet organizational performance goals. Consequently, this research presents an attractive alternative to costly and product-specific physical simulators and offers three strategic managerial implications opening new opportunities for using VR in developing learning training programmes.

Here, we parallelly investigated three important characteristics of seven SARS-CoV-2 variants, including two mink-associated variants, the B.1.617.1 variant, and the four WHO-designated variants of concerns (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2). We first investigated the ability of these variants to bind and use animal ACE2 orthologs as entry receptor. We found that, in contrast to a prototype variant, the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants had significantly enhanced affinities to cattle, pig, and mouse ACE2 proteins, suggesting increased susceptibility of these species to these SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then evaluated in vitro neutralization sensitivity of these variants to four monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We observed that all the variants were partially or completely resistant against at least one of the four tested antibodies, with B.1.351 and P.1 showing significant resistance to three of them. As ACE2-Ig is a broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidate, we then evaluated in vitro neutralization sensitivity of these variants to eight ACE2-Ig constructs previously described in three different studies. All the SARS-CoV-2 variants were efficiently neutralized by these ACE2-Ig constructs. Interestingly, compared to the prototype variant, most tested variants including the variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 showed significantly increased (up to ∼15-fold) neutralization sensitivity to ACE2-Ig constructs that are not heavily mutated in the spike-binding interface of the soluble ACE2 domain, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 evolves toward better utilizing ACE2, and that ACE2-Ig is an attractive drug candidate for coping with SARS-CoV-2 mutations.","Yao, Weitong; Ma, Danting; Wang, Haimin; Tang, Xiaojuan; Du, Chengzhi; Pan, Hong; Li, Chao; Lin, Hua; Farzan, Michael; Zhao, Jincun; Li, Yujun; Zhong, Guocai",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428353,272

Here, we determine free amino-acid levels during chronological aging of non-dividing fission yeast cells. We compare wild-type with long-lived mutant cells that lack the Pka1 protein of the protein kinase A signalling pathway. In wild-type cells, total amino-acid levels decrease during aging, but much less so in pka1 mutants. Two amino acids strongly change as a function of age: glutamine decreases, especially in wild-type cells, while aspartate increases, especially in pka1 mutants. Supplementation of glutamine is sufficient to extend the chronological lifespan of wild-type but not of pka1Δ cells. Supplementation of aspartate, on the other hand, shortens the lifespan of pka1Δ but not of wild-type cells. Our results raise the possibility that certain amino acids are biomarkers of aging, and their concentrations during aging can promote or limit cellular lifespan.","Rallis, Charalampos; Mülleder, Michael; Smith, Graeme; Au, Yan Zi; Ralser, Markus; Bähler, Jürg",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.256164,272

Tasks were referred to as essential functions of controlling. Descriptive statistics and the Student’s t-test with Cochran–Cox correction and the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test were used to analyze the data. In terms of the studied controllers, more functional than meta competence was identified. There were more hard skills than soft skills. In terms of tasks, studied controllers are preoccupied with analysis, coordination and optimization, participation in management, definition of new tools, and reporting.

Likewise, kidney involvement and acute kidney injury (AKI) were reported in many previous studies. Although a hypovolemic circulation would be the most common reason in patients with AKI, some strong proofs are suggesting a cytokine storm due to immune system exaggeration and inflammation-mediated tubular injury in COVID-19 infections. The inflammatory response in cytokine storm leads to the high release of cytokines mostly including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, INFγ, IL-2, IL-7, and endothelial mediators. The main culprits in the AKI and consequent organ failure are resident leukocytes in specific tissues, activated following the cytokine release, and systemic inflammatory response. AKI management and cytokine profile evaluation should be highly emphasized in patients with COVID-19 to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease or permanent renal failure. Treatment options in COVID-19 regarding no specific drugs should be supportive and based on stabilizing the patients;however, combination therapy with different antiviral have shown promising outcomes. As a result, utilizing the anti-TNFα and anti-IL-1 agents should be noticed if indicated.

Without the need for sub-tomogram averaging, Isonet generates tomograms with significantly reduced resolution anisotropy. Applications of IsoNet to three representative types of cryoET data demonstrate greatly improved structural interpretability: resolving lattice defects in immature HIV particles, establishing architecture of the paraflagellar rod in Eukaryotic flagella, and identifying heptagon-containing clathrin cages inside a neuronal synapse of cultured cells. Therefore, by overcoming two fundamental limitations of cryoET, IsoNet enables functional interpretation of cellular tomograms without sub-tomogram averaging. Its application to high-resolution cellular tomograms should also help identify differently oriented complexes of the same kind for near-atomic resolution sub-tomogram averaging.","Liu, Yun-Tao; Zhang, Heng; Wang, Hui; Tao, Chang-Lu; Bi, Guo-Qiang; Zhou, Z.

It can be asymptomatic or abortive, mild, moderate, severe and fulminant, i.e. having a septic course with multiple organ failure and shock. Typical leading symptoms of COVID-19 include: high fever poorly responding to drugs, severe loss of strength, chest pain, dyspnoea, headaches, bone and joint pain and muscle pain, and finally the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, other symptoms not related to the lower respiratory tract involvement are also mentioned as possible in numerous publications. These include gastrointestinal disorders, damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, catarrh of the upper respiratory tract, and dysfunctions of the sensory organs. The aim of this literature review was to determine the frequency of various head and neck dysfunctions that are part of COVID-19. Symptoms of conjunctivitis, nasal mucostis, pharyngits and laryngitis are reported by about 3/4 of patients, albeit they do not always occur at the same time, as in infections caused, for example, by rhinoviruses. Anosmia/hyposmia or ageusia/hypogeusia occur with a similar frequency. Symptoms of damage to the equilibrium system, such as dizziness, are reported by approx. 1/3 of patients, vertigo and hearing loss by approx. 5-6%, of patients, tinnitus by approx. 10% of patients. To date, reports of peripheral paresis of the facial nerve coexisting with COVID-19 are relatively scarce and the symptom is often included in the category of neurological symptoms, the frequency of which also corresponds to about 1/3 of COVID-19 cases. Importantly, both catarrhal and other symptoms listed herein may precede, co-occur or follow the onset of the leading symptoms of COVID-19. They can also be the only symptoms of this disease.

Processing of the ORF1b polyprotein was predicted to be mediated by the nsp4 serine protease, the main EAV protease. Several putative cleavage sites for this protease were detected in the ORF1b polyprotein. On the basis of this tentative processing scheme, peptides were selected to raise rabbit antisera that were used to study the processing of the EAV replicase ORF1b polyprotein (158 kDa). In immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, processing products of 80, 50, 26, and 12 kDa were detected. Of these, the 80-kDa and the 50-kDa proteins contain the putative viral polymerase and helicase domains, respectively. Together, the four cleavage products probably cover the entire ORF1b-encoded region of the EAV replicase, thereby representing the first complete processing scheme of a coronaviruslike ORF1b polyprotein. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that processing of the ORF1b polyprotein is slow and that several large precursor proteins containing both ORF1a- and ORF1b-encoded regions are generated. The localization of ORF1b-specific proteins in the infected cell was studied by immunofluorescence.

Various patterns of disease progression may be observed that have different implications for the prognosis in those affected by SARS. The appearance of the lungs on chest radiographs of patients with this condition may be normal or may include focal airspace opacity or multifocal or diffuse opacities. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive in depicting SARS than is conventional chest radiography, and CT images obtained in patients with normal chest radiographs may show extensive disease and airspace consolidation. However, because the radiologic appearance of SARS is not distinct from that of other diseases that cause lower respiratory tract infection, early identification of SARS will depend in part on the prompt recognition of clusters of cases of febrile respiratory tract illness. To aid in the differential diagnosis and management of SARS, radiologists must be familiar with the typical clinical and histopathologic findings, as well as the radiologic features of the disease.","Paul, Narinder S; Roberts, Heidi; Butany, Jagdish; Chung, TaeBong; Gold, Wayne; Mehta, Sangeeta; Konen, Eli; Rao, Anuradha; Provost, Yves; Hong, Harry H; Zelovitsky, Leon; Weisbrod, Gordon L","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15026600/,272

Characterization of six variants representing two independent epitopes on E2, E2B and E2C, by in vitro neutralization and antibody-binding assays demonstrated that selection for an alteration in epitope E2B also resulted in changes in epitope E2C and vice versa. We observed a mutation frequency of approximately 10(-4.3) to 10(-4.6), which is consistent with the expected occurrence of single point mutations. The variant virus strains were attenuated with respect to neurovirulence when compared with wild-type MHV-4. Mice normally develop encephalomyelitis and die after wild-type MHV-4 infection. Mice receiving 2- to 3-log-higher doses of the variant strains survived and developed demyelinating disease. As the disease progressed, evidence of remyelination and ongoing demyelination was observed up to 65 days after infection. Virus reisolated 15 days after infection retained the variant phenotype. The data indicate that the E2 glycoprotein plays a central role in determining the cellular tropism and virulence of MHV-4 in the mouse.","Dalziel, R G; Lampert, P W; Talbot, P J; Buchmeier, M J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3016306/,272
189300,Current awareness in geriatric psychiatry.,2001,"BACKGROUND West Nile virus (WNV) is the etiologic agent of an emerging disease in the Western Hemisphere that can be transmitted to humans by blood transfusion. WNV first appeared in the United States in 1999, in Canada in 2001, and in Mexico in 2002. The aim of this nationwide study was to determine the prevalence of WNV in blood donors in Mexico as a first step in preventing its transfusion-associated transmission. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In July and August 2004, a total of 3856 fresh plasma specimens collected from each state's center for blood transfusion in 29 of 31 Mexican states were screened with an investigational WNV assay (Procleix,(R) Gen-Probe Inc. and Chiron Corp.), a nucleic acid test based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). Reactive specimens were confirmed with a second TMA-based test, the alternative WNV assay (Gen-Probe), and with WNV capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies. In addition, 3714 frozen plasma samples collected in 2002 and 2003 were similarly tested. RESULTS One of 3856 fresh samples from an asymptomatic donor from Chihuahua was reactive by both TMA-based tests and IgM ELISA, suggesting a recently acquired infection. The observed percentage of viremic donors blood donors was 0.03 percent. Results from frozen samples were not included in the prevalence calculation and none were TMA-reactive for WNV. CONCLUSIONS WNV is present in the Mexican blood supply and measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission.","Sánchez-Guerrero, Sergio A; Romero-Estrella, Sagrario; Rodríguez-Ruiz, Antonio; Infante-Ramírez, Lilia; Gómez, Angélica; Villanueva-Vidales, Eduardo; García-Torres, Martha; Domínguez, Ana M A; Vázquez, Jaime A; Calderón, Eva D; Valiente-Banuet, Leopoldo; Linnen, Jeffrey M; Broulik, Amy; Harel, William; Marín Y López, Rafael A",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16398739/,272

It is conceivable to expect the ramifications of this pandemic in the form of depression and frustration. An increase in crime rate and violence is expected in the near future. Forensic experts along with forensic odontologists will be receiving many cases shortly and they should be ready to face the challenges. In the present paper, a critical perspective is presented on COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact. Recommendations are provided for effectively carrying out the investigative procedures related to forensic odontology. Clinical relevance: Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is the most deadly pandemic disease of the century and is now known for its high infectivity, morbidity, and mortality. Hence, it is recommended to treat every forensic sample as potential COVID-19 infected. In this regard, the present paper gives some important recommendations for handling the samples that are related to forensic odontology.

It has commonly been associated with pulmonary manifestations and there is a growing body of evidence of multisystem involvement of the virus. As evidenced by various case reports and cohort studies, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has been a common manifestation amongst the critically ill and has been associated with increased mortality. The presence of venous thromboembolic events in patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 has prompted the adoption of anticoagulation regimens aimed at preventing thromboembolic phenomena. Coagulation abnormalities have also been implicated in the progression and the severity of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is strong evidence that D-dimer levels help predict which patients are at risk of thromboembolic events, progression to ARDS, DIC, immune dysregulation and mortality. We will review the utility of D-dimer as screening tool and in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients prone to developing thromboembolic events, DIC, immune dysregulation and death. To date, the studies that have been published show the presence of elevated D-dimer levels in both the adult and pediatric populations and the measured level correlates with disease severity. Studies have also shown the relative increase of D-dimer levels in non-survivors compared to survivors. The elevation of D-dimer levels has shown to guide clinical decision making, namely the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation and mortality benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to severe non COVID-19 pneumonia. Although the current body of literature suggested the use of D-dimer as a risk stratification tool and as a test to augment clinical judgement regarding the initiation of anticoagulation, randomized control trials are needed to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the efficacy of D-dimer assays in clinical decision making.","Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Aurora, Lyudmila; Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Yadav, Vivek; Hossain, Naseem A; Akter, Nasrin; Salifu, Moro O; McFarlane, Isabel M",American journal of medical case reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851129/,272

METHODS During the three months when SARS was explosive in 2003, 524 questionnaires were collected from Xuanwu Hospital, You'an Hospital, Xiaotangshan Hospital, Renmin Hospital and Ditan Hospital in Beijing. There were 109 questionnaires finished by patients as doctors/nurses themselves. For a background matching, 109 questionnaires were also finished by the others. RESULTS From 218 questionnaires, we found that the score on emotional condition (46.6204 +/- 8.4408 vs. 41.6789 +/- 8.612 95, P < 0.001) of SARS patients whose jobs were doctor/nurse was higher than the other groups on while the score of SARS patients whose jobs were doctor/nurse was lower than the other groups (37.7615 +/- 9.026 61 vs. 41.2844 +/- 9.655 25, P = 0.006) regarding depressive condition. The scores of emotional and depressive condition were all correlated with the factor as ""I can not master my future"". CONCLUSION Doctors/nurses having SARS had less emotional and depressive conditions than the others, which might due to the difference in medical knowledge, working condition and the route of infection, suggesting that psychological intervention in the post-SARS period called for attention.","Huang, Wei; Hua, Qi; Wu, Hao; Xu, Wu-yi; Tian, Jian-hua; Chen, Hong; Yang, Feng-chi; Yang, Shen; Liu, Chao-hui; Li, Xue-wen; Ji, Xun-ming; Zhang, Jian",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15061942/,272

The immunogenicity of this S1 domain was identified and used to immunize BALB/c mice for the production of hybridomas. The identification of the mAbs against this S1 domain was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS Three hybridomas producing mAbs specific to the S1 domain was obtained, with a relative molecular mass of 48,500. None of the 3 mAbs were reactive with human coronaviruses 229E and OC43. Two of the mAbs were IgG2a isotype, and the other was IgG1. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of mAbs produced against S-protein receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV.

193366,Visits for Possible COVID-19 in a Pediatric Primary Care Practice Early in the Pandemic.,2021-08-02,"OBJECTIVES Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-CoV-2 is likely due to a cytokine storm characterised by a major release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Blocking excessive IL-6 production might be the key to the COVID-19-ARDS treatment. Beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade using a humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ) were previously reported in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. The aim of the study was to study the variation over time of several biomarkers, demonstrated to be predictors of poor prognostic, in subjects successfully treated with TCZ for severe COVID-19. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a case series of patients with COVID-19-ARDS, evidenced by RT-PCR and lung CT-scan. Patients with increasing O2 requirements, within the window of opportunity for TCZ treatment (Day 7 to Day 17 after onset of symptoms) were treated with TCZ (2 infusions of 8 mg/kg). Demographic, biological and clinical data were collected from the patients' files. Serum levels of CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, lymphocytes, platelets, creatinine, D-dimer and liver enzymes were assayed at the time of the first TCZ administration, then every two days for 8 days. RESULTS 40 patients were treated with TCZ. Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (lymphopenia, increased CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes). 30 patients (75%) benefited from TCZ and 10 patients died. In the survivors, following TCZ administration CRP decreased dramatically as early as day 4 (-86.7%, p<0.0001) and returned to normal at day 6. Fibrinogen and lymphocyte count returned to normal values at day 6. Ferritin also decreased significantly. No significant change was observed for D-dimer (p=0.68) and other studied biomarkers (haemoglobin, leucocyte count, AST). CONCLUSIONS In patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, treatment with TCZ resulted in favourable evolution in 75% of the cases. Biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen) decreased dramatically as early as the 4th day after TCZ injection. Lymphopenia, a predictor of poor prognostic, was reversed 6 days after TCZ injection.","Conrozier, Thierry; Lohse, Anne; Balblanc, Jean-Charles; Dussert, Pascale; Royer, Pierre-Yves; Bossert, Marie; Bozgan, Ana-Maria; Gendrin, Vincent; Charpentier, Aline; Toko, Lynda; Badie, Julio; Mezher, Chaouki; Roux, Marie-Françoise; Kadiane-Oussou, Ndri Juliette; Contreras, Rémy; Kessler, Julie; Mazurier, Isabelle; Klopfenstein, Timothée; Zayet, Souheil",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573419/,272

METHODS Sequential anti-coagulated blood samples were collected from 46 cases of SARS patients during the 1st week, the 2nd week, the 3rd-5th week and the 8th-12th week after the infection. T lymphocyte subsets including CD3+CD4+ cells, CD3+CD8+ cells, naive CD4+ cells (CD4+CD45RA+CD62L+) and activated CD8+ cells (CD8+CD38+) were detected by 3-color flow cytometry. Fifty-six normal healthy blood donors were also detected as normal controls. RESULTS Compared with the results of normal controls, both of the percentages of CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells of SARS patients were in normal levels during the 1st week, but the cell counts decreased significantly to (306 +/- 140)/mm3 and (270 +/- 143)/mm3, respectively. The cell count of naive CD4+ subset also remarkably decreased to (96 +/- 49)/mm3, and the percentage of CD8+CD38+ subset was higher than that of normal controls [(59.3 +/- 12.6)% vs (44.9 +/- 12.5)%]. During the 3rd-5th week, the CD8+ cell count and the percentage of CD8+CD38+ subset reached normal values, which were (581 +/- 356)/mm3 and (40.1 +/- 17.6)%, respectively. During the 8th-12th week, the cell counts of CD4+ cell [(578 +/- 193)/mm3] and naive CD4+ subset [(176 +/- 64)/mm3] were still less than those of normal controls, while compared with those of the 1st week, the increments were remarkable. CONCLUSIONS T lymphocytes of SARS patients decreased dramatically but could be obviously resumed in a short time. It will take more than 8-12 weeks for CD4+ cell and naive CD4+ subset to reach to normal levels.","Qiu, Zhi-feng; Li, Tai-sheng; Fan, Hong-wei; Han, Yang; Xie, Jing; Wang, Ai-xia; Deng, Guo-hua",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

OUTCOMES OUTCOMES evaluated include the impact of the medical and surgical management of endometriosis on women's experience of morbidity and infertility. METHODS Members of the guideline committee were selected on the basis of individual expertise to represent a range of practical and academic experience in terms of both location in Canada and type of practice, as well as subspecialty expertise along with general gynaecology background. The committee reviewed all available evidence in the English and French medical literature and available data from a survey of Canadian women. Recommendations were established as consensus statements. The final document was reviewed and approved by the Executive and Council of the SOGC. RESULTS This document provides a summary of up-to-date evidence regarding diagnosis, investigations, and medical and surgical management of endometriosis. The resulting recommendations may be adapted by individual health care workers when serving women with this condition. CONCLUSIONS Endometriosis is a common and sometimes debilitating condition for women of reproductive age. A multidisciplinary approach involving a combination of lifestyle modifications, medications, and allied health services should be used to limit the impact of this condition on activities of daily living and fertility. In some circumstances surgery is required to confirm the diagnosis and provide therapy to achieve the desired goal of pain relief or improved fecundity. Women who find an acceptable management strategy for this condition may have an improved quality of life or attain their goal of successful pregnancy. EVIDENCE Medline and Cochrane databases were searched for articles in English and French on subjects related to endometriosis, pelvic pain, and infertility from January 1999 to October 2009 in order to prepare a Canadian consensus guideline on the management of endometriosis. VALUES The quality of evidence was rated with use of the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice were ranked according to the method described by the Task Force. See Table 1.

Objective: In this brief review, the authors examine the latest available evidence to date regarding the neurological implications of COVID-19 and how the novel coronavirus might possibly impact patients with pre-existing neurological conditions. COVID-19-specific recommendations from the American Academy of Neurology and and other neurologic disease-specific organizations are summarized. Results: Current retrospective case series and cohort studies from Wuhan, China, are indicating that almost one-third of the patients with COVID-19 have shown neurological manifestations; older age and comorbid conditions are associated worsened outcomes. Abnormal laboratory findings are being reported in acute cases of patients with COVID-19.

Using this system we studied how two intergenic regions positioned in close proximity affected subgenomic RNA synthesis. When two intergenic regions were separated by more than 100 nt, slightly less of the larger subgenomic DI RNA (synthesized from the upstream intergenic region) was made; this difference was significant when the intergenic region separation was less than about 35 nucleotides. Deletion of sequences flanking the two intergenic regions inserted in close proximity did not affect transcription. No significant change in the ratio of the two subgenomic DI RNAs was observed when the sequence between the two intergenic regions was altered. Removal of the downstream intergenic region restored transcription of the larger subgenomic DI RNA. These results demonstrated the downstream intergenic sequence was suppressing subgenomic DI RNA synthesis from the upstream intergenic region.","Joo, M; Makino, S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830526/,272
196602,COVID-19 and Periodontitis: A Reality to Live with.,2020-12-01,"Many tissues including blood, skin, gut and germ cells are continuously maintained by tissue stem cells. Under certain conditions, however, other organs can undergo repair using stem-cell-like progenitors generated by cell de-differentiation. Cell fates have been broadened experimentally, but mechanisms allowing de-differentiation to a stem cell state are poorly known. Germline stem cells begin to differentiate by forming interconnected germ cell cysts (cystocytes), and under certain conditions male mouse cystocytes have been postulated to revert into functional progenitors. Here we report that four- and eight-cell Drosophila germline cystocytes generated either in second instar larval ovaries or in adults over-producing the BMP4-like stem cell signal Decapentaplegic efficiently convert into single stem-like cells. These de-differentiated cells can develop into functional germline stem cells and support normal fertility. Our results show that cystocytes represent a relatively abundant source of regenerative precursors that might help replenish germ cells after depletion by genotoxic chemicals, radiation or normal ageing. More generally, Drosophila cystocytes now provide a system for studying de-differentiation and its potential as a source of functional stem cells.","Kai, Toshie; Spradling, Allan",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15024390/,272

During the epidemic, it seemed as if the Hong Kong government and health system were barely coping, leading to calls of mismanagement and governance incapacity. In the wake of the SARS outbreak, two inquiries were conducted. The purpose of this article is to review the Hong Kong's response to SARS from the perspective of two inquiries. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An historical analysis of the institutional arrangements for health care delivery in Hong Kong is undertaken, followed by a chronology of developments in the SARS outbreak. The article then reviews outbreak management and the findings of the two inquiries. Finally, it considers whether the Hong Kong health system can be reformed to manage any future infectious disease epidemic better. FINDINGS Both leadership and coherency were lacking in Hong Kong's response to SARS. These are age-old problems in the Hong Kong health sector. The prospects for mending the health system appear limited, given that leadership and coherency have been consistently absent features of post-1997 governance in Hong Kong. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS This article reviews events in the immediate period following the SARS outbreak. A future follow-up study of the Hong Kong government and health system's capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks would be useful.

Seventy-five cases (53%) were epidemiologically linked in 32 separate clusters (median cluster size two, range two to four). The NVG rate fell from 0.63 of 100 to 0.22 of 100 admissions after March 2005 (P<0.001) when enhanced infection control precautions were instituted in response to an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS Torovirus remains the most commonly identified cause of NVG at The Hospital for Sick Children. Most NVG cases were epidemiologically linked, and a significant reduction in cases occurred after the institution of enhanced infection control practices following an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Improved education and surveillance for NVG should lead to further reduction in this problem.","Gubbay, Jb; Al-Rezqi, A; Hawkes, M; Williams, L; Richardson, Se; Matlow, A",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23730313/,272

Home therapy included lercanidipine and clonidine. A chest radiograph performed in the emergency department immediately showed images suggestive of pneumonia from COVID-19, confirmed in the following days by a positive swab for coronavirus. Kidney function parameters progressively deteriorated towards a severe acute kidney failure on the 15th day, with creatinine values of 6.6 mg/dl and urea of 210 mg/dl. The situation was managed first in the intensive care unit with CRRT cycles (continuous renal replacement therapy) and then in a ""yellow area"" devoted to COVID patients, where the patient was dialyzed by us nephrologists through short cycles of CRRT. In our short experience we have used continuous techniques (CRRT) in positive patients hemodynamically unstable and intermittent dialysis (IRRT) in our stable chronic patients with asymptomatic COVID -19. We found CRRT to be superior in hemodynamically unstable patients hospitalized in resuscitation and in the ""yellow area"". Dialysis continued with high cut-off filters until the normalization of kidney function; the supportive medical therapy has also improved the course of the pathology and contributed to the favorable outcome for our patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our Nephrology Group at Savona's San Paul Hospital has reorganized the department to better manage both chronic dialyzed patients and acute patients affected by the new coronavirus.","Caputo, Carmela; Ciabattoni, Marzia; Garneri, Debora; Repetto, Monica; Santoni, Oscar; Tarroni, Alice; Tosetti, Fanny; Vigo, Emanuela Chiara; Mancuso, Giancarlo",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026202/,272
200834,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurofibromatosis clinical care and research,2021,"Infection with dengue virus (DENV) or any other flavivirus induces cross-reactive, but weakly neutralizing or nonneutralizing, antibodies that recognize epitopes involving the fusion peptide in the envelope glycoprotein. Humanized mAb IgG 1A5, derived from a chimpanzee, shares properties of cross-reactive antibodies. mAb IgG 1A5 up-regulated DENV infection by a mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in a variety of Fc receptor-bearing cells in vitro. A 10- to 1,000-fold increase of viral yield in K562 cells, dependent on the DENV serotype, was observed over a range of subneutralizing concentrations of IgG 1A5. A significant increase of DENV-4 viremia titers (up to 100-fold) was also demonstrated in juvenile rhesus monkeys immunized with passively transferred dilutions of IgG 1A5. These results, together with earlier findings of ADE of DENV-2 infection by a polyclonal serum, establish the primate model for analysis of ADE. Considering the abundance of these cross-reactive antibodies, our observations confirm that significant viral amplification could occur during DENV infections in humans with prior infection or with maternally transferred immunity, possibly leading to severe dengue. Strategies to eliminate ADE were explored by altering the antibody Fc structures responsible for binding to Fc receptors. IgG 1A5 variants, containing amino acid substitutions from the Fc region of IgG2 or IgG4 antibodies, reduced but did not eliminate DENV-4-enhancing activity in K562 cells. Importantly, a 9-aa deletion at the N terminus of the CH(2) domain in the Fc region abrogated the enhancing activity.","Goncalvez, Ana P; Engle, Ronald E; St Claire, Marisa; Purcell, Robert H; Lai, Ching-Juh",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517625/,272

The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is already panzootic in poultry, with attendant economic consequences. It continues to cross species barriers to infect humans and other mammals, often with fatal outcomes. Therefore, H5N1 virus has rightly received attention as a potential pandemic threat. However, it is noted that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H5N1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H5N1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health. Here, we review the ecology and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, assess the pandemic risk, and address aspects of human H5N1 disease in relation to its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.","Peiris, J S Malik; de Jong, Menno D; Guan, Yi",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17428885/,272
201685,The Reliance on Positive Impacts of COVID-19 Outbreak for Psychological Mitigation,2021,"BACKGROUND Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a hyperinflammatory syndrome has appeared which develops weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been described mainly in children (MIS-C), but lately has also been found in adults (MIS-A). CASE DESCRIPTION We present a case of a woman with MIS-A. She had fever, diarrhoea, hypotension, laboratory abnormalities with high inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, troponin-T, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Her electrocardiogram had marked diffuse ST-depressions. She was diagnosed in an early stage of MIS-A and treated successfully with immune suppression, antiaggregants and anticoagulants. CONCLUSION MIS-A and MIS-C are similar, potentially life-threatening inflammatory syndromes which can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascular failure. For effective treatment and prevention of complications, timely recognition is essential. Clinicians should therefore be mindful of this multisystem inflammatory syndrome, not just in children but also in adults.","Kuijpers, Dora L; Pries, Annelotte M; Rook, Denise; Labots, Geert; Goekoop, Robbert J; Filippini, Luc H P M",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346604/,272

The PCR products were cloned then into the pMD18-T vectors, followed by sequence analysis. RESULTS Specific fragments were amplified from the sputum samples of SARS patients, which were confirmed by DNA cloning and sequencing to belong to SARS-associated coronavirus. The Result of Blast shows only the difference in one nucleic acid from the TOR2 strain of SARS-associated coronavirus. CONCLUSION Sequence analysis has confirmed the existence of SARS-associated coronavirus in the sputum samples of SARS patients, and nested RT-PCR is a quick, easy, and convenient way for the detection of the virus.","Wang, Yan; Ma, Wen-li; Song, Yan-bin; Xiao, Wei-wei; Zhang, Bao; Huang, Hai; Wang, Hong-min; Ma, Xiao-dong; Zheng, Wen-ling",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12754117/,272
202010,The escalation of the opioid epidemic due to COVID-19 and resulting lessons about treatment alternatives,2020,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in recent months has strained hospital resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency departments a necessity. Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.","Sriram, Anuroop; Muckley, Matthew; Sinha, Koustuv; Shamout, Farah; Pineau, Joelle; Geras, Krzysztof J; Azour, Lea; Aphinyanaphongs, Yindalon; Yakubova, Nafissa; Moore, William",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469559/,272
202231,Physical activity changes and correlate effects in patients with Parkinson's disease during COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"A new strain of a novel infectious disease affecting millions of people, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus. The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189. As this study is based on molecular docking, hence being particular about the results obtained, requires extensive wet-lab experimentation and clinical trials under in vitro as well as in vivo conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

202238,ECT and COVID-19 in acute inpatient psychiatry: More than clinical issues alone,2020,"The global spread of the COVID-19 virus has led to difficulties in many branches of the economy, including significant effects on the urban transport industry. Thus, countries around the world have introduced different mobility policies during the pandemic. Due to government restrictions and the changed behaviors of transport users, companies providing modern urban mobility solutions were forced to introduce new business practices to their services. These practices are also apparent in the context of the electric shared mobility industry. Although many aspects and problems of electric shared mobility have been addressed in scientific research, pandemic scenarios have not been taken into account. Noticing this research gap, we aimed to update a previously developed model of factors that influence the operation of electric shared mobility by incorporating aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on this industry. This article aims to identify the main factors influencing the electric shared mobility industry during the COVID-19 and post-lockdown periods, together with their operation areas and the involved stakeholders. The research was carried out on the basis of expert interviews, social network analysis (SNA), and the use of the R environment. The article also presents sustainable transport management recommendations for cities and transport service operators, which can be implemented after a lockdown caused by an epidemic. The results in this paper can be used to support transport modeling and the creation of new policies, business models, and sustainable development recommendations. The contents will also be helpful to researchers worldwide in preparing literature reviews for articles related to sustainable management in the COVID-19 pandemic reality.","Turoń, Katarzyna Kubik Andrzej Chen Feng",Energies,,272

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 251 medical students who have been in home confinement accepted to participate in an online questionnaire survey. They completed depression, anxiety and stress scale, beck hopelessness scale and cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire. Findings: Moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress were reported by 57.4%, 51.0% and 31.4% of medical students, respectively. Based on the cut-off value of nine, 31.1% of the participants showed high levels of hopelessness. Hierarchical regression analysis identified four cognitive emotion regulation strategies as significant independent contributors to psychopathology above and beyond home confinement related variables. Self-blame positively predicted stress. Catastrophizing positively predicted anxiety and hopelessness. Refocusing on planning negatively predicted anxiety. Positive reappraisal negatively predicted hopelessness. Practical implications: Cognitive emotion regulation strategies may constitute a valuable target of preventive and interventional measures to improve medical students’ mental health. Originality/value: A unique feature of this study is the demonstration of the important role played by cognitive emotion regulation strategies in predicting anxiety, stress and hopelessness in medical students.

204159,Design and Additive Manufacturing of Medical Face Shield for Healthcare Workers Battling Coronavirus (COVID-19 ),2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Injuries to the elbow ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) are especially common in the overhead throwing athlete. Despite preventative measures, these injuries are occurring at increasing rates in athletes of all levels. UCL reconstruction techniques generally require a prolonged recovery period and introduce the potential for intraoperative complications prompting investigations into more conservative treatment measures based on specific patient and injury characteristics. The purpose of this review is to describe the current literature regarding the use of biologic augmentation in the management of UCL injuries. Specifically, this review will focus on the basic science background and clinical investigations pertaining to biologic augmentation utilizing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous stem cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite some evidence supporting the use of PRP therapy in patients with partial UCL tears, there is no current consensus regarding its true efficacy. Similarly, due to a lack of clinical investigations, no consensus exists regarding the utilization of autologous stem cell treatments in the management of UCL injuries. Management of UCL injuries ranges from non-operative treatment with focused physical therapy protocols to operative reconstruction. The use of biologic augmentation in these injuries continues to be investigated in the orthopedic community. Currently, no consensus exists regarding the efficacy of either PRP or autologous stem cells and further research is needed to further define the appropriate role of these treatments in the management of UCL injuries.","Apostolakos, John M; Lin, Kenneth M; Carr, James B; Bedi, Asheesh; Camp, Christopher L; Dines, Joshua S",,,272
204175,A systematic review on COVID-19 pandemic with special emphasis on curative potentials of Nigeria based medicinal plants,2020,"BACKGROUND: As part of the accelerated development of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we report a dose-finding and adjuvant justification study of SCB-2019, a protein subunit vaccine candidate containing a stabilised trimeric form of the spike (S)-protein (S-Trimer) combined with two different adjuvants. METHODS: Our study is a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at a specialised clinical trials centre in Australia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers in two age groups: younger adults (aged 18-54 years) and older adults (aged 55-75 years). Participants were randomly allocated either vaccine or placebo using a list prepared by the study funder. Participants were to receive two doses of SCB-2019 (either 3 µg, 9 µg, or 30 µg) or a placebo (0·9% NaCl) 21 days apart. SCB-2019 either had no adjuvant (S-Trimer protein alone) or was adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. The assigned treatment was administered in opaque syringes to maintain masking of assignments. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies and ACE2-competitive blocking IgG antibodies by ELISA and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay. Cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04405908; this is an interim analysis and the study is continuing. FINDINGS: Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 151 volunteers were enrolled; three people withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated serious adverse event (pituitary adenoma). 148 participants had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after dose two and were included in this analysis (database lock, Oct 23, 2020). Vaccination was well tolerated, with two grade 3 solicited adverse events (pain in 9 µg AS03-adjuvanted and 9 µg CpG/Alum-adjuvanted groups). Most local adverse events were mild injection-site pain, and local events were more frequent with SCB-2019 formulations containing AS03 adjuvant (44-69%) than with those containing CpG/Alum adjuvant (6-44%) or no adjuvant (3-13%). Systemic adverse events were more frequent in younger adults (38%) than in older adults (17%) after the first dose but increased to similar levels in both age groups after the second dose (30% in older and 34% in younger adults). SCB-2019 with no adjuvant elicited minimal immune responses (three seroconversions by day 50), but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both younger and older adults (anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibody geometric mean titres at day 36 were 1567-4452 with AS03 and 174-2440 with CpG/Alum). Titres in all AS03 dose groups and the CpG/Alum 30 µg group were higher than were those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses. INTERPRETATION: The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

Purinergic signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of several viral infections which makes the purinergic system a potential target of investigation in COVID-19. During viral infections, the ATP release initiates a cascade that activates purinergic receptors. This receptor activation enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and performs the chemotaxis of macrophages and neutrophils, generating an association between the immune and the purinergic systems. This review was designed to cover the possible functions of purinergic signaling in COVID-19, focusing on the possible role of purinergic receptors such as P2X7 which contributes to cytokine storm and inflammasome NLRP3 activation and P2Y1 that activates the blood coagulation pathway. The possible role of ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, which have the function of dephosphorylating ATP in an immunosuppressive component, adenosine, are also covered in detail. Moreover, therapeutic combination or association possibilities targeting purinergic system components are also suggested as a possible useful tool to be tested in future researches, aiming to unveil a novel option to treat COVID-19 patients.","Franciosi, Maria Luiza Mukai; Lima, Millena Daher Medeiros; Schetinger, Maria Rosa Chitolina; Cardoso, Andréia Machado",Mol. cell. biochem,,272

Como una visión de conjunto, ambas pandemias se asemejan a la crisis que en el 2020 el coronavirus está generando en muchos aspectos de la vida humana. Este artículo se centra en el impacto que la peste de Cipriano tuvo en el contexto de la crisis del siglo III; su mortalidad se estima entre 10-20% de la población en los lugares afectados y finalmente sus efectos generaron varias de las condiciones necesarias para la transición del mundo antiguo al medieval.

207793,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment of Canadian young adults with rheumatic disease: longitudinal survey findings,2021,"Understanding others' speech while individuals simultaneously produce speech utterances implies neural competition and requires specific mechanisms for a neural resolution given that previous studies proposed opposing signal dynamics for both processes in the auditory cortex (AC). We here used neuroimaging in humans to investigate this neural competition by lateralized stimulations with other speech samples and ipsilateral or contralateral lateralized feedback of actively produced self speech utterances in the form of various speech vowels. In experiment 1, we show, first, that others' speech classifications during active self speech lead to activity in the planum temporale (Pte) when both self and other speech samples were presented together to only the left or right ear. The contralateral PTe also seemed to indifferently respond to single self and other speech samples. Second, specific activity in the left anterior superior temporal cortex (STC) was found during dichotic stimulations (i.e. self and other speech presented to separate ears). Unlike previous studies, this left anterior STC activity supported self speech rather than other speech processing. Furthermore, right mid and anterior STC was more involved in other speech processing. These results signify specific mechanisms for self and other speech processing in the left and right STC beyond a more general speech processing in PTe. Third, other speech recognition in the context of listening to recorded self speech in experiment 2 led to largely symmetric activity in STC and additionally in inferior frontal subregions. The latter was previously reported to be generally relevant for other speech perception and classification, but we found frontal activity only when other speech classification was challenged by recorded but not by active self speech samples. Altogether, unlike formerly established brain networks for uncompetitive other speech perception, active self speech during other speech perception seemingly leads to a neural reordering, functional reassignment, and unusual lateralization of AC and frontal brain activations.","Dietziker, Joris; Staib, Matthias; Frühholz, Sascha",Neuroimage,,272

208215,COVID-19 media coverage decreasing despite deepening crisis,2021,"As essential components in intelligent systems, printed soft electronics (PSEs) are playing crucial roles in public health, national security, and economics. Innovations in printing technologies are required to promote the broad application of high-performance PSEs at a low cost. However, current printing techniques are still facing long-lasting challenges in addressing the conflict between printing speed and performance. To overcome this challenge, we developed a new corona-enabled electrostatic printing (CEP) technique for ultra-fast (milliseconds) roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing of binder-free multifunctional e-skins. The printing capability and controllability of CEP were investigated through parametric studies and microstructure observation. The electric field generation, material transfer, and particle amount and size selecting mechanisms were numerically and experimentally studied. CEP printed graphene e-skins were demonstrated to possess outstanding strain sensing performance. The binder-free feature of the CEP-assembled networks enables them to provide pressure sensitivity as low as 2.5 Pa, and capability to detect acoustic signals of hundreds of hertz in frequency. Furthermore, the CEP technique was utilized to pattern different types of functional materials (e.g., graphene and thermochromic polymers) onto different substrates (e.g., tape and textile). Overall, this study demonstrated that CEP can be a novel contactless and ultrafast manufacturing platform compatible with R2R process for fabricating high-performance, scalable, and low-cost soft electronics.","Wang, Long; Kou, Rui; Shang, Zhaoru; Zhu, Chaoyi; Zhong, Ying",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00870v1.pdf,272

Few data are available about severe maternal morbidity (SMM) of these extremely preterm cesarean. The objective was to determine whether gestational age under 26 weeks of gestation (weeks) was associated with an increased risk of SMM compared with gestational age between 26 and 34 weeks in women having a cesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Database, PROSPERO, and ClinicalTrials.gov on January 31, 2020. The search strategy clustered terms describing SMM and preterm cesarean delivery. No restrictions on language, publication status, and study design were applied. Abstracts were included if there was sufficient information to assess study quality. The authors of all identified studies were contacted to request for aggregated data. Relative risks (RR) were calculated using the inverse variance method. The primary outcome was SMM as defined in each study. We analyzed data on preterm cesarean deliveries between 22 and 34 weeks. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration: CRD42019128644). RESULTS: Six studies involving 45,572 women (3,440 delivering < 26 weeks; 42,132 delivering between 26 and 34 weeks) were included. SMM occurred in 607 women (17.6 %) < 26 weeks and 4,483 women (10.6 %) between 26 and 34 weeks. Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM (RR, 1.65; 95 % CI [Confidence Interval], 1.52-1.78; I2 = 40 %). Gestational age < 26 weeks remained associated with SMM in the subgroup analyses depending on the type of the study (prospective or retrospective), country of the study (European or non-European), and high quality of the study. A sensitivity analysis showed that gestational age < 25 weeks was also associated with SMM in preterm cesarean delivery (RR, 1.66; 95 % CI, 1.50-1.83; I2 = 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age < 26 weeks was associated with an increased risk of SMM in women having a preterm cesarean delivery.

LIO II has not been only rule-based but has openly pursued a liberal social purpose with a significant amount of authority beyond the nation-state. While postnational liberal institutions helped increase overall well-being globally, they were criticized for using double standards and institutionalizing state inequality. We argue that these institutional features of the postnational LIO II led to legitimation problems, which explain both the current wave of contestations and the strategies chosen by different contestants. We develop our argument first by mapping the growing liberal intrusiveness of international institutions. Second, we demonstrate the increased level and variety of contestations in international security and international refugee law. We show that increased liberal intrusiveness has led to a variety of contestation strategies, the choice of which is affected by the preference of a contestant regarding postnational liberalism and its power within the contested institution.","Börzel, Tanja A.; Zürn, Michael",International Organization,,272

Here, we describe the innovative teaching approach we have established using case- based discussions via Whatsapp©. Feedback has been excellent;respondents stated the most useful aspect is flexibility to participate in-between tasks and across multiple sites, and 87% stated they use the searchable summaries when managing patients. This teaching method is highly beneficial for OMFS DCTs;it allows flexibility for fluctuating schedules, is interactive, and provides an easily- accessible resource whilst on- call. We believe other teams may benefit from this method if scheduling time for regular didactic teaching is difficult, or to supplement existing practices.","Nijamudeen, Aysha Mariam Brown Graeme Clark Stuart",British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,,272

OBJECTIVES: The current cross-sectional study characterizes post COVID-19 sequelae and persistent symptoms in patients in an outpatient rehabilitation program. METHODS: Thirty patients [16 post-ICU and 14 non-ICU; median ageâ=â54(43.8-62) years; 19 men] presenting sequelae and/or persistent symptoms (>3 months after acute COVID-19) were selected of 41 patients referred for neurorehabilitation. Patients underwent physical, neuropsychological and respiratory evaluation and assessment of impact of fatigue and quality of life. RESULTS: The main reasons for referral to rehabilitation were: fatigue (86.6%), dyspnea (66.7%), subjective cognitive impairment (46.7%) and neurological sequelae (33.3%). Post-ICU patient presented sequelae of critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy, stroke and encephalopathy and lower forced vital capacity compared to non-ICU patients. Cognitive impairment was found in 63.3% of patients, with a similar profile in both sub-groups. Increased physical fatigue, anxiety and depression and low quality of life were prevalent irrespective of acute COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The variability of post COVID-19 physical and neuropsychological impairment requires a complex screening process both in ICU and non-ICU patients. The high impact of persistent symptoms on daily life activities and quality of life, regardless of acute infection severity, indicate need for rehabilitation.","Albu, Sergiu; Zozaya, Nicolas Rivas; Murillo, Narda; Garcia-Molina, Alberto; Chacón, Cristian Andres Figueroa; Kumru, Hatice",NeuroRehabilitation,,272

METHODS: This study is a prospective, nationwide study in patients with solid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection included between 10 March to 15 June 2020. Patient's baseline characteristics were collected. The study's primary outcome was overall survival within 30 days of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission, admission to an ICU, and need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients with a cancer diagnosis and verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. After one month of follow up, hospitalization was required for 54% (n = 61) and 21% of the patients had died and 14 of the 23 deceased cancer patients were &#8805;70 years. Most patients were classified with mild COVID-19 symptoms (66%, n = 74); however, 48% (n = 23) of the &#8805;70-year-olds patients were classified with severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms.

The results suggest that states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments' decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic impact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that many states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.","Lundgren, Magnus; Klamberg, Mark; Sundstrom, Karin; Dahlqvist, Julia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00933v1.pdf,272

However, the number of COVID-19 cases is now rapidly increasing, which may indicate that vaccine protection decreases over time. ObjectiveTo determine whether time elapsed since the second BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) injection is significantly associated with the risk of post-vaccination COVID-19 infection. DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study performed in a large state-mandated health care organization in Israel. ParticipantsAll fully vaccinated adults who have received a RT-PCR test between May 15, 2021 and July 26, 2021, at least two weeks after their second vaccine injection were included. Patients with a history of past COVID-19 infection were excluded. Main Outcome and MeasurePositive result for the RT-PCR test. ResultsThe cohort included 33,993 fully vaccinated adults, 49% women, with a mean age of 47 years (SD, 17 years), who received an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The median time between the second dose of the vaccine and the RT-PCR test was 146 days, interquartile range [121-167] days. 608 (1.8%) patients had positive test results. There was a significantly higher rate of positive results among patients who received their second vaccine dose at least 146 days before the RT-PCR test compared to patients who have received their vaccine less than 146 days before: odds ratio for infection was 3.00 for patients aged over 60 (95% CI 1.86-5.11); 2.29 for patients aged between 40 and 59 (95% CI 1.67-3.17); and 1.74 for patients aged between 18 and 39 (95% CI 1.27-2.37); P<0.001 in each age group. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this large population study of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR following two doses of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, we observe a significant increase of the risk of infection in individuals who received their last vaccine dose since at least 146 days ago, particularly among patients older than 60.","Israel, Ariel; Merzon, Eugene; Schäffer, Alejandro A; Shenhar, Yotam; Green, Ilan; Golan-Cohen, Avivit; Ruppin, Eytan; Magen, Eli; Vinker, Shlomo",,,272

219982,Path to Reopening Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Neurosurgery Experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems worldwide have implemented telemedicine technologies to respond to the growing need for health care services during these unprecedented times. In the United Arab Emirates, video and audio consultations have been implemented to deliver health services during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether differences exist in physicians' attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations when delivering telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted on a cohort of 880 physicians from outpatient facilities in Abu Dhabi, which delivered telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic between November and December 2020. In total, 623 physicians responded (response rate=70.8%). The survey included a 5-point Likert scale to measure physician's attitudes and perceptions of video and audio consultations with reference to the quality of the clinical consultation and the professional productivity. Descriptive statistics were used to describe physicians' sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, designation, clinical specialty, duration of practice, and previous experience with telemedicine) and telemedicine modality (video vs audio consultations). Regression models were used to assess the association between telemedicine modality and physicians' characteristics with the perceived outcomes of the web-based consultation. RESULTS: Compared to audio consultations, video consultations were significantly associated with physicians' confidence toward managing acute consultations (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 95% CI 1.2-2.21; P=.002) and an increased ability to provide patient education during the web-based consultation (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.04-4.33; P=.04). There was no significant difference in physicians' confidence toward managing long-term and follow-up consultations through video or audio consultations (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.88-2.08; P=.17). Video consultations were less likely to be associated with a reduced overall consultation time (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P=.02) and reduced time for patient note-taking compared to face-to-face visits (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.65; P<.001). Previous experience with telemedicine was significantly associated with a lower perceived risk of misdiagnosis (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3-0.71; P<.001) and an enhanced physician-patient rapport (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.26-4.9; P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that video consultations should be adopted frequently in the new remote clinical consultations. Previous experience with telemedicine was associated with a 2-fold confidence in treating acute conditions, less than a half of the perceived risk of misdiagnosis, and an increased ability to provide patients with health education and enhance the physician-patient rapport. Additionally, these results show that audio consultations are equivalent to video consultations in providing remote follow-up care to patients with chronic conditions. These findings may be beneficial to policymakers of e-health programs in low- and middle-income countries, where audio consultations may significantly increase access to geographically remote health services.","Alhajri, Noora; Simsekler, Mecit Can Emre; Alfalasi, Buthaina; Alhashmi, Mohamed; AlGhatrif, Majd; Balalaa, Nahed; Al Ali, Maryam; Almaashari, Raghda; Al Memari, Shammah; Al Hosani, Farida; Al Zaabi, Yousif; Almazroui, Shereena; Alhashemi, Hamed; Baltatu, Ovidiu C",JMIR Med Inform,,272

PURPOSE: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. METHODS: We conducted a noninterventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19-targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: A total of 352 patients treated for COVID-19 at 15 US hospitals From April 18 to May 8, 2020, were included in the study. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies used included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 antagonists (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. The rate of use of COVID-19-directed drug therapy was higher in patients with vs patients without a history of asthma (14.9% vs 7%, P = 0.037) and in patients enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001). Among those receiving drug therapy, 8 patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were recognized at a higher rate in patients enrolled in clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%; odds ratio, 5.9; P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs were common among patients receiving drug therapy, including those enrolled in clinical trials.

We focus in particular on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression. To define these models, we exploit a representation of the Wasserstein space closely related to its weak Riemannian structure, by mapping the data to a suitable linear space and using a metric projection operator to constrain the results in the Wasserstein space. By carefully choosing the tangent point, we are able to derive fast empirical methods, exploiting a constrained B-spline approximation. As a byproduct of our approach, we are also able to derive faster routines for previous work on PCA for distributions. By means of simulation studies, we compare our approaches to previously proposed methods, showing that our projected PCA has similar performance for a fraction of the computational cost and that the projected regression is extremely flexible even under misspecification. Several theoretical properties of the models are investigated and asymptotic consistency is proven.

In this last period, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused in many cases a drastic reduction of routine breast imaging activity due to the combination of various factors. The survival of BC is directly proportional to the earliness of diagnosis, and especially during this period, it is at least fundamental to remember that a diagnostic delay of even just three months could affect BC outcomes. In this article we will review the state of the art of breast imaging, starting from morphological imaging, i.e., mammography, tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced mammography, and their most recent evolutions; and ending with functional images, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and contrast enhanced mammography.","Bicchierai, Giulia; Di Naro, Federica; De Benedetto, Diego; Cozzi, Diletta; Pradella, Silvia; Miele, Vittorio; Nori, Jacopo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272

With no drugs or vaccines available yet, a wide range of treatment regimens used are being repurposed. The need of the hour is to analyze various currently available regimens and devise a treatment plan that is most effective for COVID-19. Here we describe the case of a 68-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes, exhibiting symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, who presented at the emergency department of our hospital. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral ground glass opacities that were indicative of COVID-19, and a computed tomography score of 24 was indicative of severe pulmonary pneumonia. He tested positive for COVID-19. His treatment regimen included the use of convalescent plasma, oxygen therapy, steroids, high-dose antibiotics, broad-spectrum antiviral remdesivir, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab) at various stages of the disease. Oxygen supplementation was required at the time of admission. The patient initially developed a cytokine release storm, and oxygen supplementation was initiated to manage his condition. Supportive care and multiple treatment regimens were used to successfully recover the patient's health. With a rapid increase in number of confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a major challenge to our health care system. With no available vaccines currently, the establishment of a combination of therapeutic drugs that effectively reduce disease progression is of utmost importance.","Ali, Sabahat; Khalid, Sundas; Afridi, Maham; Akhtar, Samar; Khader, Yousef S; Akhtar, Hashaam",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,272

224323,Sustained Chemosensory Dysfunction during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has left negative spillover effects on the entire health care system. Previous studies have suggested significant declines in cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental, retrospective cohort study of ACS hospitalisations by using a multi-institutional administrative claims database in Japan. We used interrupted time series analyses to ascertain impacts on cases, treatment approaches, and in-hospital mortality before and after Japan's state of emergency to respond to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the change in ACS cases per week. RESULTS: A total of 30,198 ACS cases (including 21,612 acute myocardial infarction and 8,586 unstable angina) were confirmed between 1st July 2018 and 30th June 2020. After the state of emergency, an immediate decrease was observed in ACS cases per week (-18.3%; 95% confidence interval, -13.1 to -23.5%). No significant differences were found in the severity of Killip classification (P=0.51) or cases of fibrinolytic therapy (P=0.74). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality in ACS patients was no longer observed after adjustment for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.12; P=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the characteristics and trends of ACS cases in a Japanese population by applying interrupted time series analyses. Our findings provide significant insights into the association between COVID-19 and decreases in ACS hospitalisations during the pandemic.","Morishita, Tetsuji; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Higuchi, Takuya; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",J. atheroscler. thromb,,272
224641,Youth sports in the wake of COVID-19: a call for change,2020,"The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is the molecular target for many vaccines and antibody-based prophylactics aimed at bringing COVID-19 under control. Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD? To answer this question, we combined an analysis of the RBD structure-function with an evolutionary modeling framework. Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities.","Van Egeren, Debra; Novokhodko, Alexander; Stoddard, Madison; Tran, Uyen; Zetter, Bruce; Rogers, Michael; Pentelute, Bradley L; Carlson, Jonathan M; Hixon, Mark; Joseph-McCarthy, Diane; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,,272

Opinion surveys identified the importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure political partisanship and antiscience attitudes in the discussions about the pandemic on social media, as well as their geographic and temporal distributions. METHODS: We analyzed a large set of tweets from Twitter related to the pandemic, collected between January and May 2020, and developed methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative), and science (antiscience vs proscience) dimensions. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation in polarized views along the science and political dimensions. Moreover, politically moderate users were more aligned with proscience views, while hardline users were more aligned with antiscience views. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that polarization grew over time; instead, we saw increasing activity by moderate proscience users. We also show that antiscience conservatives in the United States tended to tweet from the southern and northwestern states, while antiscience moderates tended to tweet from the western states. The proportion of antiscience conservatives was found to correlate with COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the multidimensional nature of polarization and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.","Rao, Ashwin; Morstatter, Fred; Hu, Minda; Chen, Emily; Burghardt, Keith; Ferrara, Emilio; Lerman, Kristina",J Med Internet Res,,272

We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of functional outcomes 1-3 years after treatment. Twenty-three studies were included, reporting on 3127 patients treated for HPV-OPSCC. Gastrostomy tube dependence failed to show statistically significant difference between surgery with adjuvant therapy and chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin at 12 months (8.3% [95% CI: 3.1-15.9] vs. 4.2% [1.1-9.2], p = 0.37) and 24-36 months (10.5% [95% CI: 3.2-21.5] vs. 3.3% [2.0-4.9], p = 0.06).

226016,Impact of COVID-19 Governmental Restrictions on Emergency General Surgery Operative Volume and Severity,2021,"Data sources Experimental investigation.Study design A retrospective review to evaluate the use of a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce cross-infection through aerosol. The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team.Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.","Ali, Kamran; Raja, Mahwish",Evid Based Dent,,272

The primary outcome was the observed differences in antibiotic prescribing or clinical benefits between pharmacist-led ASP interventions and usual care. RESULTS: Of the 196 studies retrieved for full-text review, a cumulative total of 15 studies were included for final evaluation. Upon analysis, we observed that there was no consistent methodology in the implementation of ASPs and, in most cases, the outcome of interest varied. Nonetheless, there was a trend toward improvement in antibiotic prescribing with pharmacist interventions in ASPs compared with that under usual care (P < 0.05). However, the results of these studies are not easily generalizable. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a need for a consistent approach for the practical application of outpatient pharmacist-led ASPs. Managed care organizations could play a significant role in ensuring the successful implementation of pharmacist-led ASPs in outpatient settings.","St Louis, James; Okere, Arinze Nkemdirim",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,272
226137,Endoscopy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The available information on the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their prognostic value are scattered in the different literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID-19 and their prognostic value. METHODS: Published studies were identified through searching PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), and Google scholar databases. The search was performed using the different combinations of the keywords ""echocard*,"" ""cardiac ultrasound,"" ""TTE,"" ""TEE,"" ""transtho*,"" or ""transeso*"" with ""COVID-19,"" ""sars-COV-2,"" ""novel corona, or ""2019-nCOV."" Two researchers independently screened the titles and abstracts and full texts of articles to identify studies that evaluated the echocardiographic features of cardiac injury related to COVID-19 and/or their prognostic values. RESULTS: Of 783 articles retrieved from the initial search, 11 (8 cohort and 3 cross-sectional studies) met our eligibility criteria. Rates of echocardiographic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients varied across different studies as follow: RV dilatation from 15.0% to 48.9%; RV dysfunction from 3.6% to 40%; and LV dysfunction 5.4% to 40.0%. Overall, the RV abnormalities were more common than LV abnormalities. The majority of the studies showed that there was a significant association between RV abnormalities and the severe forms and death of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that RV dilatation and dysfunction may be the most prominent echocardiographic abnormality in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, especially in those with more severe or deteriorating forms of the disease. Also, RV dysfunction should be considered as a poor prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients.","Shafiabadi Hassani, Neda; Shojaee, Abbas; Khodaprast, Zeynab; Sepahvandi, Roya; Shahrestanaki, Ehsan; Rastad, Hadith",J Intensive Care Med,,272

227387,First aid and basic life support resuscitation in occupational settings in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with particle-like characteristics and a diameter of 60-140 nm, positively charged, and single-stranded RNA genomes which produce a major outbreak of human fatal pneumonia since the beginning of the 21st century. COVID-19 is currently considered as a continuous potential pandemic threat across the globe. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to develop innovative methods and technologies for suppressing the spread of viruses as well as inactivating the viruses but COVID-19 vaccines are still in the development phase. This perspective focuses on the sensing, detection and therapeutic applications of CoVs using inorganic-based nanomaterials, metal complexes, and metal-conjugates. Synthetic inorganic-based nanoparticles interact strongly with proteins of viruses due to their morphological similarities, and therefore, numerous antivirals have been tested for efficacy against different viruses in vitro through colorimetric and electrochemical assays. Metal complexes-based agents such as bismuth complexes form attractive class of drugs with a number of therapeutic applications including the inhibition and duplex-unwinding activity of SARS-CoV helicase by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), phosphate release assay and radioassay studies. Metal-conjugates show major effects on inhibiting the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV and the replication of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We anticipate that these approaches will provide rapid and accurate antiviral strategies in the development of these innovative sensors for the detection, inhibition and antiviral activities of coronaviruses.","Veerasamy, Sathish; Chandrakumar, Manivannan; Balasubramaniyan, Malathi; Arumugam, Ramesh Kumar; Pounraj, Thanasekaran",Curr. med. chem,,272

BACKGROUND: The currently used DES present certain features that have been linked separately to their better performance in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: First-in-man, prospective and multicenter study including patients treated with ihtDEStiny stent undergoing OCT examination at 9 months follow up. The ihtDEStiny stent is a sirolimus eluting stent with an oval shape ultrathin struts (68 µm) and an abluminal coating of a fluoropolymer containing the antiplatelet agent triflusal. Primary endpoint was the percentage of obstruction of the in-stent volume by the neointima. RESULTS: In 58 patients (63 lesions) in-stent late lumen loss was 0.11 ± 0.23 mm (95% CI 0.05-0.16) with only in 6% of stents being > 0.5 mm and in-segment binary stenosis was 1.6%. In OCT mean neointima volume obstruction was 10.5 ± 6.9% with a mean neointima thickness of 110.9 ± 89.8 µm. The proportion of uncovered struts was 2.5%, malapposed struts 1.1% and malapposed/uncovered struts 0.7% and no subclinical thrombi detected. Mean incomplete stent apposition area was 0.1 ± 0.1 mm2. At 12 months target lesion revascularization rate was 3% and no stent thrombosis was reported. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the ihtDEStiny stent has shown a very low degree of neointimal proliferation associated with a low rate of uncovered/malapposed struts and total absence of subclinical thrombi at 9 months follow up.","de la Torre Hernandez, Jose M; Otaegui, Imanol; Subinas, Asier; Gomez-Menchero, Antonio; Moreno, Raul; Rondan, Juan; Muñoz-Garcia, Erika; Sainz-Laso, Fermin; Garcia Del Blanco, Bruno; Rumoroso, Jose R; Diaz, Jose F; Berenguer, Alberto; Gomez-Lara, Josep; Zueco, Javier",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,272

We aimed to assess vaccine hesitancy and factors related to it among medical students in India. An online questionnaire was filled by 1068 medical students across 22 states and union territories of India from 2 February to 7 March 2021. Vaccine hesitancy was found among 10.6%. Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers. Prior adult vaccination did not have an effect on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted awareness campaigns, regulatory oversight of vaccine trials and public release of safety and efficacy data and trust building activities could further reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students.","Jain, Jyoti; Saurabh, Suman; Kumar, Prashant; Verma, Mahendra Kumar; Goel, Akhil Dhanesh; Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Raghav, Pankaja Ravi",Epidemiol Infect,,272

230304,Second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan;Reasons and mitigation measures,2020,"Objectives: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. quarantine and isolation) are used to mitigate and control viral infectious disease, but their effectiveness has not been well studied. For COVID-19, disease control efforts will rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions until pharmaceutical interventions become widely available, while non-pharmaceutical interventions will be of continued importance thereafter. Methods: This rapid evidence-based review provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the effectiveness of social distancing non-pharmaceutical interventions on disease outcomes. Literature was retrieved from MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and pre-print databases (BioRxiv.org, MedRxiv.org, and Wellcome Open Research). Results: Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria (n = 28). Early, sustained, and combined application of various non-pharmaceutical interventions could mitigate and control primary outbreaks and prevent more severe secondary or tertiary outbreaks. The strategic use of non-pharmaceutical interventions decreased incidence, transmission, and/or mortality across all interventions examined. The pooled attack rates for no non-pharmaceutical intervention, single non-pharmaceutical interventions, and multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions were 42% (95% confidence interval = 30% – 55%), 29% (95% confidence interval = 23% – 36%), and 22% (95% confidence interval = 16% – 29%), respectively. Conclusion: Implementation of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions at key decision points for public health could effectively facilitate disease mitigation and suppression until pharmaceutical interventions become available. Dynamics around R0 values, the susceptibility of certain high-risk patient groups to infection, and the probability of asymptomatic cases spreading disease should be considered.","Rizvi, R.

The disease has spread to 212 countries and territories worldwide. While this epidemic has continued to infect millions of people, several nations have resorted to complete lockdowns. People took social networks during this shutdown to share their opinions, feelings, and find a way to calm down. This study proposed a US-based sentiment analysis of the tweets using machine learning and the lexicon analysis approach. This US-based tweets dataset was collected by RStudio software from 30 January 2020 to 10th May 2020, contains 11858 tweets. We find the label corresponding to each tweet using TextBlob, that is to say, positive, negative, or neutral. To clean up the facts we pre-process the tweets. In a later step, different feature techniques such as bag-of-words (BoW) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) are used to preserve expressive information. Finally, the random forest, gradient boosting machine, extra tree classifier, logistic regression, and support vector machine models are used to categorize beliefs as being positive, negative, or neutral. Our suggested pipeline output is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall F1 score. This research study shows how TF-IDF features can increase the performance of the supervised machine learning models and in this work, the gradient boosting machine outperforms the others and achieves high accuracy of 96% when paired with TF-IDF features. This analysis was done to analyze how the situation is being handled by citizens of the United States.

In this study we aim to investigate and evaluate the impact of the pandemic on residents as well as residency training programs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including a survey of 43 questions prepared on Google forms and electronically distributed among a convenience sample of residents training at a tertiary center in North Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in the period between October 30th and November 8th of 2020. The survey included questions that addressed the impact of the pandemic on residents' health as well as training programs. The study participants included residents in training at KAUH in 2020 and were stratified according to the type of residency program (surgical residents (SRs) and non-surgical residents (NSRs)). Statistical methods included descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney U test, and Cramer's V and r statistics as measures of effect sizes. RESULTS: Of all 430 residents, 255 (59%) responded to the survey. A total of 17 (7%) of residents reported being infected with COVID-19 and a significant difference was reported between SRs and NSRs (10% vs 4%, V = .124 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .017-.229), p = 0.048). Approximately, 106 (42%) reported a decrease in the number of staff working at the clinic and 164 (64%) reported limited access to personal protective equipment during the pandemic. On a 4-point Likert scale for the feeling of anxiety, the median was 2 (2-3 IQR) in the NSRs group, vs 2 (1-2 IQR) in the SRs groups, with the NSRs being more likely to feel anxious (r = 0.13 ""small effect"" (95% CI; 0.007-0.249), p = .044). Similarly, the proportion of residents who reported feeling anxious about an inadequacy of protective equipment in the work area was significantly greater in the NSRs group (90.3% vs 75.2%; V = .201 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .078-.313), p = .001), as well as the proportion of residents who reported feeling increased stress and anxiety between colleagues being also significantly higher in the NSRs group (88.1% vs 76%; V = .158 ""small effect"" (95% CI; .032-.279), p = .012). CONCLUSION: The burden of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health status of residents is very alarming and so providing residents with psychological counseling and support is needed. Also, critical implications on the flow of residency training programs have been noticed. This necessitates adapting and adopting smart educational techniques to compensate for such limitations.","Alshdaifat, Eman; Sindiani, Amer; Khasawneh, Wasim; Abu-Azzam, Omar; Qarqash, Aref; Abushukair, Hassan; Obeidat, Nail",BMC Med Educ,,272

231939,The intertwined expansion of telehealth and buprenorphine access from a prescriber hub,2021,"The Canadian city most affected by the first wave of the Covid-19 (CV19) pandemic was Montreal. Montreal was in lockdown (LD) from Mar 13- Jun 15, 2020. The elderly, diabetics, and the economically disadvantaged are among the groups most at risk of CV19 and the psychosocial effects of LD. We sought to ascertain the effect of the LD on the wellbeing of lower income elderly T2D pts. As we felt it unethical to do non-essential testing during a pandemic we relied on clinically available HbA1c’s as surrogates for metabolic wellbeing. Most HbA1c‘s used reflect a high (r=0.91) correlation with 3 month values for the time periods of interest. The study group was composed of 38 mostly elderly T2D pts. All pts lived alone or with similarly aged spouses in non-institutional settings in a lower middle class neighborhood of Montreal. None had organized domestic help from family or the community. None had documented acute medical episodes or medication changes between Jan and Sept 2020. None have conditions known to render HbA1c non reliable. Pts were interviewed by telephone to assess their overall coping with the LD. In particular they were questioned about medical issues, difficulties obtaining medications +/- groceries and psychological or social stress. HbA1c values between Jan 1 - Mar 15, 2020 and after Aug 25, 2020 (non LD values) and between Apr 20 - Aug 15, 2020 (LD values) were recorded. Differences in the recorded non LD and LD HbA1c’s were compared and analyzed for the group as a whole, by gender, and by insulin use. There were 38 pts, 22 M 56–77 yrs (mean 72.1) and 16 F 41–90 yrs (mean 75.2), 89.5% (34/38) were &amp;gt;65 yrs. Ten M and 9 F were on insulin. No pt reported severe hypoglycemia or weight fluctuations. All claimed to be following public health guidelines. There were no significant differences (d) between the mean HbA1c’s non LD compared to LD neither for the entire group (d= 0.2), M (d=0.2), F (d=0.2), insulin treated pts (d=0.3) nor those not treated with insulin (d=0.0). There were no overt medical decompensations. No pt reported having been unable to access medications or groceries. No pt reported significant psychological distress or feelings of isolation. None had been diagnosed with CV19. This largely geriatric T2D cohort did not report any overt deleterious effects from the LD. There were no significant differences in HbA1c non LD compared to LD. It is not possible to determine how effective the LD was in protecting these pts from CV19 other than to note that none had been diagnosed as having contracted the disease. As the 2nd wave of CV19 evolves, health care professionals will have the opportunity to study the effect of public health interventions, not only on controlling the spread of CV19, but also on the general wellbeing of different pt populations.","Elstein, Jack Gilfix Reisa Elstein Eleanor",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,272

Comparative Morbidity and Mortality in Patients Undergoing Surgery 2019-2020,2021,"Human phosphoantigen-reactive VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells possess several characteristics, including MHC-independent recognition of tumor cells and potent killing potential, that make them attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapeutic approaches. Injectable preparations from the hemi-parasite plant Viscum album L. (European mistletoe) are commonly prescribed as complementary cancer therapy in European countries such as Germany, but their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated in-depth the in vitro response of human T cells towards mistletoe-extract drugs by analyzing their functional and T-cell-receptor (TCR) response using flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing respectively. Non-fermented mistletoe-extract drugs (AbnobaViscum), but not their fermented counterparts (Iscador), induced specific expansion of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells among T cells. Furthermore, AbnobaViscum rapidly induced the release of cytotoxic granules and the production of the cytokines IFNÎ³ and TNF&#945; in VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells. This stimulation of anti-cancer VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells was mediated by the butyrophilin BTN3A, did not depend on the accumulation of endogenous phosphoantigens and involved the same VÎ³9VÎ´2 TCR repertoire as those of phosphoantigen-reactive VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells. These insights highlight VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells as a potential target for mistletoe-extract drugs and their role in cancer patients receiving these herbal drugs needs to be investigated.","Ma, Ling; Phalke, Swati; Stévigny, Caroline; Souard, Florence; Vermijlen, David",,,272

232590,Experiences of nurses who have children when caring for COVID-19 patients,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 outbreak has worsened the ongoing economic crisis in Puerto Rico by creating ""parallel pandemics"" that exacerbate socioeconomic and health inequalities experienced by its most vulnerable residents. Unfortunately, conditions on the island have been largely overlooked by national media outlets and the mainland U.S. population. Thus, this research report aims to draw attention to the disparate burden multiple and compounding disasters have on older island-dwelling Puerto Rican adults' health and well-being. METHODS: We characterize the lived experiences of the older population in Puerto Rico by incorporating data from numerous sources and contextualizing the effects of compounding disasters, the fiscal pandemic, and health care challenges to provide a more nuanced portrait of existing compounding factors that negatively affect the health and well-being of older adults in the era of COVID-19. RESULTS: We highlight two main factors that exacerbate pre-pandemic inequities experienced by the older adult population amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico: 1) the impact of multiple and compounding disasters; and 2) health care challenges. DISCUSSION: The human suffering of the Puerto Rican population is compounded by the consequences of fiscal austerity, increasing levels of income and wealth inequality, the debt crisis, significant emigration, and a dysfunctional health care system. Future governmental actions are required to lessen the burden of parallel pandemics on older adults in Puerto Rico.","García, Catherine; Rivera, Fernando I; Garcia, Marc A; Burgos, Giovani; Aranda, María P",,,272

233267,Dramatic clinical response to dabrafenib plus trametinib in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"With the exponentially growing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, clinicians continue to seek accurate and rapid diagnosis methods in addition to virus and antibody testing modalities Because radiographs such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are cost-effective and widely available at public health facilities, hospital emergency rooms (ERs), and even at rural clinics, they could be used for rapid detection of possible COVID-19-induced lung infections Therefore, toward automating the COVID-19 detection, in this paper, we propose a viable and efficient deep learning-based chest radiograph classification (DL-CRC) framework to distinguish the COVID-19 cases with high accuracy from other abnormal (e g , pneumonia) and normal cases A unique dataset is prepared from four publicly available sources containing the posteroanterior (PA) chest view of X-ray data for COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases Our proposed DL-CRC framework leverages a data augmentation of radiograph images (DARI) algorithm for the COVID-19 data by adaptively employing the generative adversarial network (GAN) and generic data augmentation methods to generate synthetic COVID-19 infected chest X-ray images to train a robust model The training data consisting of actual and synthetic chest X-ray images are fed into our customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model in DL-CRC, which achieves COVID-19 detection accuracy of 93 94% compared to 54 55% for the scenario without data augmentation (i e , when only a few actual COVID-19 chest X-ray image samples are available in the original dataset) Furthermore, we justify our customized CNN model by extensively comparing it with widely adopted CNN architectures in the literature, namely ResNet, Inception-ResNet v2, and DenseNet that represent depth-based, multi-path-based, and hybrid CNN paradigms The encouragingly high classification accuracy of our proposal implies that it can efficiently automate COVID-19 detection from radiograph images to provide a fast and reliable evidence of COVID-19 infection in the lung that can complement existing COVID-19 diagnostics modalities","Sakib, Sadman; Tazrin, Tahrat; Fouda, Mostafa M.; Fadlullah, Zubair Md; Guizani, Mohsen",Ieee Access,,272
233716,Immunotherapy for ANCA-associated vasculitis during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Right lobe living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a major development in adult LDLT that has significantly increased the donor pool by providing larger graft size and by decreasing risk of small-for-size graft syndrome. However, right lobe anatomy is complex, not only from the inflow but also from the outflow perspective. Outflow reconstruction is one of the key requirements of a successful LDLT and venous drainage of the liver graft is just as important as hepatic inflow for the integrity of graft function. Outflow complications may cause acute graft failure which is not always easy to diagnose. The right lobe graft consists of two sections and three hepatic venous routes for drainage that require reconstruction. In order to obtain a congestion free graft, several types of vascular conduits and postoperative interventions are needed to assure an adequate venous allograft drainage. This review described the anatomy, functional basis and the evolution of outflow reconstruction in right lobe LDLT.","Balci, Deniz; Kirimker, Elvan Onur",Hepatobiliary pancreat. dis. int,,272

234432,Non-communicable diseases and inequalities increase risk of death among COVID-19 patients in Mexico,2020,"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have modified dispensing of colonoscopy preparations, a proxy for the number of colonoscopies performed. We therefore studied changes in dispensing of colonoscopy preparations during the pandemic in France. METHODS: Using the French national health data system, we identified colonoscopy preparations dispensed from 2018 to 2020. The expected 2020 dispensations were estimated from 2018 to 2019 dispensations. RESULTS: Dispensing of colonoscopy preparations decreased markedly during the eight weeks of national lockdown: 83,045 colonoscopy preparations were dispensed, i.e., 181,826 (68.6%) fewer than expected. After lockdown, dispensing of colonoscopy preparations gradually returned to expected numbers. Overall, this represents an estimated decrease of roughly 250,000 colonoscopy preparations during the six-month period following onset of the pandemic. This shortfall in the dispensing of colonoscopy preparations was of the same order of magnitude in people under or over 50 years of age, in men and women, and in those in the highest and the lowest quintiles of the deprivation index. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, roughly 250,000 fewer colonoscopy preparations were dispensed during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Deleterious consequences on morbidity and mortality related to gastroenterological diseases, such as colorectal cancer, are to be feared.","Meyer, Antoine; Drouin, Jérôme; Zureik, Mahmoud; Weill, Alain; Dray-Spira, Rosemary",Int. j. colorectal. dis,,272
234468,Self-reported dental treatment needs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil: an infodemiological study,2020,"2020 has been a year of cascading crises for us all. The COVID-19 pandemic threatened to eclipse the longer term crisis of global climate change. Australia's Black Summer of unprecedented bushfires in 2019-20 and Vanuatu's experience of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020 were both signs of the increasing severity of 'natural' disasters due to anthropogenic climate change. Combining personal and political reflections on these two disasters, this essay analyses how the discourse of 'resilience' can deflect blame from the ultimate causes of climate change in increased greenhouse gas emissions and from those countries and corporations who are primarily responsible for the climate crisis. In both Australia and Vanuatu, it interrogates where resilience is located: in government and corporate systems of disaster preparedness and infrastructure and/or the communities and people who are suffering disasters of increasing severity and frequency. Per capita, Australia is one of the most polluting countries in the world and its current retrograde policies on climate change and energy perpetuate both climate crisis and injustice, whereby those in the Pacific who contribute the least to climate change suffer the most. Global inequalities are both cause and consequence of climate change. Fighting climate change must entail fighting against inequalities to achieve climate justice.","Jolly, M.",Scottish Geographical Journal,,272

235461,"The COVID-19 outbreak increases maternal stress during pregnancy, but not the risk for postpartum depression",2021,"Epidemics, such as the present Covid-19 pandemic, usually spread at a rapid rate. Standard models, e.g., the SIR model, have stressed on the importance of finding the susceptible cases to flatten the growth rate of the spread of infection as early as possible. In the present scientific world, location traces in the form of GPS coordinates are logged by mobile device manufacturing and their operating systems developing companies, such as Apple, Samsung, Google etc. However, due to the sensitive nature of this data, it is usually not shared with other organisations, mainly to protect individual privacy. However, in disaster situations, such as epidemics, data in the form of location traces of a community of people can potentially be helpful to proactively locate susceptible people from the community and enforce quarantine on them as early as possible. Since procuring such data for the purpose of restricted use is difficult (time-consuming) due to the sensitive nature of the data, a strong case needs to be made that how could such data be useful in disaster situations. The aim of this article is to to demonstrate a proof-of-the-concept that with the availability of massive amounts of real check-in data, it is feasible to develop a scalable system that is both effective (in terms of identifying the susceptible people) and efficient (in terms of the time taken to do so). We believe that this proof-of-the-concept will encourage sharing (with restricted use) of such sensitive data in order to help mitigate disaster situations. In this article, we describe a software resource to efficiently (consuming a small run-time) locate a set of susceptible persons given a global database of user check-ins and a set of infected people. Specifically, we describe a system, named InfecTracer, that seeks to find out cases of close proximity of a person with another infected person.","Biswas, Chandan; Ganguly, Debasis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08851v1.pdf,272

236658,It's Time to Put Children and Young People First During the Global COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose an overwhelming demand on resources that cannot always be met by official organisations. Limited resources and human response to crises can lead members of local communities to turn to one another to fulfil immediate needs. This spontaneous citizen-led response can be crucial to a community's ability to cope in a crisis. It is thus essential to understand the scope of such initiatives so that support can be provided where it is most needed. Nevertheless, quickly developing situations and varying definitions can make the community response challenging to measure. Aim: To create an accessible interactive map of the citizen-led community response to need during the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales, UK that combines information gathered from multiple data providers to reflect different interpretations of need and support. Approach: We gathered data from a combination of official data providers and community-generated sources to create 14 variables representative of need and support. These variables are derived by a reproducible data pipeline that enables flexible integration of new data. The interactive tool is available online (www.covidresponsemap.wales) and can map available data at two geographic resolutions. Users choose their variables of interest, and interpretation of the map is aided by a linked bee-swarm plot. Discussion: The novel approach we developed enables people at all levels of community response to explore and analyse the distribution of need and support across Wales. While there can be limitations to the accuracy of community-generated data, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used alongside traditional data sources to maximise the understanding of community action. This adds to our overall aim to measure community response and resilience, as well as to make complex population health data accessible to a range of audiences. Future developments include the integration of other factors such as well-being.","Di Cara, N. H.; Song, J.; Maggio, V.; Moreno-Stokoe, C.; Tanner, A. R.; Woolf, B.; Davis, O.

Variants might become a challenge in terms of diagnostics, immunology, and effectiveness of drugs. All available whole genome sequence data from the NCBI database (March 16, 2020) were phylogenetically analyzed, and gene prediction as well as analysis of selected variants were performed. Antigenic regions and the secondary protein structure were predicted for selected variants. While some clusters are presenting the same variant with 100% identical bases, other SARS-CoV-2 lineages show a beginning diversification and phylogenetic clustering due to base substitutions and deletions in the genomes. First molecular epidemiological investigations are possible with the results by adding metadata as travelling history to the presented data. The advantage of variants in source tracing can be a challenge in terms of virulence, immune response, and immunological memory. Variants of viruses often show differences in virulence or antigenicity. This must also be considered in decisions like herd immunity. Diagnostic methods might not work if the variations or deletions are in target regions for the detection of the pathogen. One base substitution was detected in a primer binding site.","Kaden, Rene",J. Clin. Med.,,272

A total of 7,043 newly-diagnosed patients are grouped according to a clinic-molecular risk grouping system. We use a random survival forest model to simulate the monthly probability of disease recurrence, and thereby establish risk-based surveillance arrangements that can maximize the efficacy of recurrence detection per visit. Markov decision-analytic models further validate that the risk-based surveillance outperforms the control strategies and is the most cost-effective. These results are confirmed in an external validation cohort. Finally, we recommend the risk-based surveillance arrangement which requires 10, 11, 13 and 14 visits for group I to IV.

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to determine the mental health status and explore related factors of anxiety and depression among patients with (COVID-19). METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This is a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among COVID-19 patients at the Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre in Marrakech over a period of four months. We assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on admission. The significance threshold used for any data comparison test was the value of p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 103 participants were included. The average age was 44, 17 ± 17, 19 years. About 54,4% of the subjects were male. Of the 103 participants, 36.89% and 23.30% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression; respectively. The mean score of anxiety subscale and depression subscale for all patients was 6.45 ± 4.29 and 5.38 ± 4.47, respectively. The bivariate analysis showed that age (p=0, 0004; p=0, 0002), oxygen saturation level (p=0, 0003; p=0, 0059), hospital stay (p <0, 0001; p <0, 0001) and family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p=0, 0094; p=0, 0023) were associated with anxiety and depression respectively for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, gender (p=0, 0119) was associated with depression. CONCLUSION: There is an increasing level of anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures and identified viral load as a critical factor in variant identification. By leveraging clinical metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort, we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes, suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages. These results provide important context for sequence-based inference in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and epidemiology.","Valesano, Andrew L; Rumfelt, Kalee E; Dimcheff, Derek E; Blair, Christopher N; Fitzsimmons, William J; Petrie, Joshua G; Martin, Emily T; Lauring, Adam S",PLoS Pathog,,272

In this respect, the empirical and theoretical dimensions of the contents of those impacts are analyzed. Research findings reveal a significant relationship between contingency actions and positive indirect impacts such as air quality improvements, clean beaches, and the decline in environmental noise. Besides, negative indirect impacts also exist, such as the rise in waste level and curtailment in recycling, further threatening the physical spaces (land and water), besides air. It is expected that global businesses will revive in the near future (though slowly), but the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during this short time span is not a sustainable way of environmental mitigation. Thus, long-term mitigation policies should be strengthened to cope with the undesirable deterioration of the environment. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the pandemic from the perspectives of current and future indirect environmental impacts and the post-pandemic situation. Finally, it is suggested to invent and prepare action plans to induce a sustainable economic and environmental future in the post-pandemic world scenario.","Irfan, Muhammad; Ahmad, Munir; Fareed, Zeeshan; Iqbal, Najaf; Sharif, Arshian; Wu, Haitao",Int J Environ Health Res,,272
244698,"""It was close enough, but it wasn't close enough"": A qualitative exploration of the impact of direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion on access to abortion care",2021,"BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the world has created an enormous socioeconomic impact. Although there are several promising drug candidates in clinical trials, none is available clinically. Thus, the drug repurposing approach may help to overcome the current pandemic. METHODS: The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for cleaving nascent polypeptide chains. Here, FDA-approved antiviral and anti-infection drugs were screened by high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by re-docking with standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) molecular docking. The most potent drug's binding was further validated by free energy calculations (Prime/MM-GBSA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. RESULTS: Out of 1397 potential drugs, 157 showed considerable affinity toward Mpro. After HTVS, SP, and XP molecular docking, four high-affinity lead drugs (Iodixanol, Amikacin, Troxerutin, and Rutin) with docking energies -10.629 to -11.776kcal/mol range were identified. Among them, Amikacin exhibited the lowest Prime/MM-GBSA energy (-73.800kcal/mol). It led us to evaluate other aminoglycosides (Neomycin, Paramomycin, Gentamycin, Streptomycin, and Tobramycin) against Mpro. All aminoglycosides were bound to the substrate-binding site of Mpro and interacted with crucial residues. Altogether, Amikacin was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Mpro. MD simulations of the Amikacin-Mpro complex suggested the formation of a complex stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions. CONCLUSION: Aminoglycosides may serve as a scaffold to design potent drug molecules against COVID-19. However, further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies is required before using aminoglycosides as an anti-COVID-19 agent.","Ahmed, Mohammad Z; Zia, Qamar; Haque, Anzarul; Alqahtani, Ali S; Almarfadi, Omar M; Banawas, Saeed; Alqahtani, Mohammed S; Ameta, Keshav L; Haque, Shafiul",J Infect Public Health,,272

We use a dataset consisting of blood samples of 375 patients admitted to a hospital in the region of Wuhan, China. There are 201 patients who survived hospitalisation and 174 patients who died whilst in hospital. The focus of the paper is not only on seeing which Machine Learning model is able to obtain the absolute highest accuracy but more on the interpretation of what the Machine Learning models provides. We find that age, days in hospital, Lymphocyte and Neutrophils are important and robust predictors when predicting a patients mortality. Furthermore, the algorithms we use allows us to observe the marginal impact of each variable on a case-by-case patient level, which might help practicioneers to easily detect anomalous patterns. This paper analyses the global and local interpretation of the Machine Learning models on patients with COVID19.","Smith, Matthew; Alvarez, Francisco",Expert Syst Appl,,272
245261,Reproductive Care During COVID-19,2020,"In less than one year since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, were granted the first historic authorization for emergency use, while another mRNA vaccine, CVnCoV, progressed to phase 3 clinical testing. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccine products, which consist of synthetic mRNA strands encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells. This review digs deeper into the scientific breakthroughs of the last decades that laid the foundations for the rapid rise of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as providing momentum for mRNA vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 represents an ideal case study allowing to compare design-activity differences between the different mRNA vaccine candidates. Therefore, a detailed overview of the composition and (pre)clinical performance of the three most advanced mRNA vaccines is provided and the influence of choices in their structural design on to their immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile is discussed in depth. In addition to the new fundamental insights in the mRNA vaccines' mode of action highlighted here, we also point out which unknowns remain that require further investigation and possibly, optimization in future mRNA vaccine development.","Verbeke, Rein; Lentacker, Ine; De Smedt, Stefaan C; Dewitte, Heleen",J Control Release,,272

This review determined the worldwide prevalence of human faecal ESBL E. coli carriage and its trend in the community over the past two decades. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar to retrieve articles published between 1 January 2000 and 13 February 2020 that contained data on the prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL E. coli among healthy individuals. A cumulative (for the whole period) meta-analysis was used to estimate the global and regional pooled prevalence rates. Articles were grouped into study periods of 3 years, and subgroup meta-analyses were undertaken to examine the global pooled prevalence over time. RESULTS: Sixty-two articles covering 29â872 healthy persons were included in this meta-analysis. The cumulative (2003-18) global pooled prevalence of ESBL E. coli intestinal carriage in the community was 16.5% (95% CI 14.3%-18.7%; P â<â 0.001). The pooled prevalence showed an upward trend, increasing from 2.6% (95% CI 1.6%-4.0%) in 2003-05 to 21.1% (95% CI 15.8%-27.0%) in 2015-18. Over the whole period, the highest carriage rate was observed in South-East Asia (27%; 95% CI 2.9%-51.3%), while the lowest occurred in Europe (6.0%; 95% CI 4.6%-7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Globally, an 8-fold increase in the intestinal carriage rate of ESBL E. coli in the community has occurred over the past two decades. Prevention of its spread may require new therapeutic and public health strategies.","Bezabih, Yihienew M; Sabiiti, Wilber; Alamneh, Endalkachew; Bezabih, Alamneh; Peterson, Gregory M; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie M; Roujeinikova, Anna",J Antimicrob Chemother,,272

Moreover, analysis of the determined clinical outcomes is required and thus, modifiable predictor values need to identified. In Ayurveda, outcome of a disease is a multivariate function and this exploratory work is an attempt to identify one such factor "" Vyadhiksamatwa "" (immune status). Materials and methods: A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in fifty diagnosed cases of COVID-19. Study participants were subjected to a questionnaire to assess relationship between the three determinants of the disease - exposure, clinical severity and Vyadhiksamatwa (immune status). Results: Clinical Severity was found strongly correlated with Vyadhiksmatwa (with the value of Pearson Correlation - 0.740 significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). Conclusion: In the determination of clinical severity of disease, there are two epidemiological factors responsible - extrinsic (exposure) and intrinsic (Vyadhiksamatwa). It has been observed that higher the value of Vyadhiksamatwa of an individual lesser will be the clinical severity of the disease in that individual. Vyadhiksamatwa can alter the host response to infections.","Sharma, Meenakshi; Sharma, Charu; Mandal, Sisir Kumar; Nesari, Tanuja Manoj; Kumar, Anil",,,272

Of the 342 HCWs who completed the two-dose vaccination, 265 (77.5%) responded to the survey at least once. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher after the second dose compared with the first dose (89.1% vs. 80.1%, P = 0.006). The most common systemic reactions were muscle ache (69.1%), fatigue (65.7%), headache (48.7%), chills (44.2%), and fever (32.1%), and were notably more common after the second dose vaccine as well. We also noted a sex difference in which the frequency of adverse reactions after the second dose of the vaccine was significantly higher in females, which was not observed after the first dose. The rates of adverse reactions were lower in older age groups, and the rates and severities of the adverse reactions decreased during the 3-day period following vaccination.","Lee, Yun Woo; Lim, So Yun; Lee, Ji Hyang; Lim, Joon Seo; Kim, Miseo; Kwon, Seonhee; Joo, Jiyeon; Kwak, Sun Hee; Kim, Eun Ok; Jung, Jiwon; Kwon, Hyouk Soo; Kim, Tae Bum; Kim, Sung Han; Bae, Seongman",J Korean Med Sci,,272

This paper compares the experiences of Brazil, Germany, India and the United States during their 2020 responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to show that social policies such as unemployment insurance, flat payments and short-time work are crucial to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as to their political sustainability. Broadly, public health measures that constrain economic activity will only be effective and sustainable if paired with social policy measures that enable people to comply without sacrificing their livelihoods and economic wellbeing. Tough public health policies and generous social policies taken together proved a success in Germany. Generous social policies uncoupled from strong public health interventions, in Brazil and the US during the summer of 2020, enabled lockdown compliance but failed to halt the pandemic, while tough public health measures without social policy support rapidly collapsed in India. In the COVID-19 and future pandemics, public health theory and practice should recognise the importance of social policy to the immediate effectiveness of public health policy as well as to the long-term social and economic impact of pandemics.","Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly; Falkenbach, Michelle; Massard da Fonseca, Elize; Raj, Minakshi; King, Elizabeth J",Glob Public Health,,272

Several signs and symptoms have been described to be characteristic of the disease. However, there is a dearth of report on the description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in patients from Nigeria. This study was designed to provide a description of the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. METHODS: This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between May and August 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient health records were reviewed and evaluated to describe the clinical characteristics on presentation. RESULTS: A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with a mean age (S.D.) of 46.16 (13.701). Most of the patients survived (mortality rate of 2.6%), and were symptomatic (89.6%). There were more males (74.7%) than females, and the most common symptoms were fever, breathing difficulty, dry cough and malaise. Co-morbidities were also present in almost half of the study participants (49.4%). CONCLUSION: This study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Males are more likely than females to be infected with COVID-19 and the most occurring symptoms are fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain. Old age and the presence of co-morbidities may also be associated with developing the severe disease.","Otuonye, Ngozi Mirabel; Olumade, Testimony Jesupamilerin; Ojetunde, Mercy Mayowa; Holdbrooke, Susan Abba; Ayoola, Joy Boluwatife; Nyam, Itse Yusuf; Iwalokun, Bamidele; Onwuamah, Chika; Uwandu, Mabel; Abayomi, Akinola; Osibogun, Akin; Bowale, Abimbola; Osikomaiya, Bodunrin; Thomas, Babafemi; Mutiu, Bamidele; Odunukwe, Nkiruka Nnonyelum",J. natl. med. assoc,,272

Neural Arithmetic Units aim to overcome this difficulty, but current arithmetic units are either limited to operate on positive numbers or can only represent a subset of arithmetic operations. We introduce the Neural Power Unit (NPU) that operates on the full domain of real numbers and is capable of learning arbitrary power functions in a single layer. The NPU thus fixes the shortcomings of existing arithmetic units and extends their expressivity. We achieve this by using complex arithmetic without requiring a conversion of the network to complex numbers. A simplification of the unit to the RealNPU yields a highly interpretable model. We show that the NPUs outperform their competitors in terms of accuracy and sparsity on artificial arithmetic datasets, and that the RealNPU can discover the governing equations of a dynamical systems only from data.","Heim, Niklas; Pevn'y, Tom'avs; vSm'idl, V'aclav",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01681v2.pdf,272

250480,Review of COVID-19 vaccines and its evidence in older adults,2021,"Effective identification and prognostication of severe COVID-19 patients presenting to healthcare facilities are essential to reducing morbidity and mortality. Low- and middle-income country (LMIC) facilities often suffer from restrictions in availability of human resources, laboratory testing, medications, and imaging during routine functioning, and such shortages may worsen during times of surge. Low- and middle-income country healthcare providers will need contextually appropriate tools to identify and triage potential COVID-19 patients. We report on a series of LMIC-appropriate recommendations and suggestions for screening and triage of COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on a pragmatic, experience-based appraisal of existing literature. We recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease. We recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility. We recommend that, following screening and implementation of appropriate universal source control measures, suspected COVID-19 patients be triaged with a triage tool appropriate for the setting. We recommend a standardized severity score based on the WHO COVID-19 disease definitions be assigned to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients before their disposition from the emergency unit. We suggest against using diagnostic imaging to improve triage of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, unless a patient has worsening respiratory status. We suggest against the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound to improve triage of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients who are RT-PCR negative but have moderate to severe symptoms and are suspected of a false-negative RT-PCR with high risk of disease progression. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe clinical features who are without access to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.","Barros, Lia M; Pigoga, Jennifer L; Chea, Sopheakmoniroth; Hansoti, Bhakti; Hirner, Sarah; Papali, Alfred; Rudd, Kristina E; Schultz, Marcus J; Calvello Hynes, Emilie J",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,272

Massive admission of patients to the Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"" Foundation of Rome, Italy, determined the need for reengineering the entire hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article, we consider some of the structural and organizational changes that have been necessary to deal with the emergency, with particular reference to non-intensive medicine wards, and the preventive measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital staff and patients themselves. RESULTS: 577 staff members were subjected to molecular tests in 1-month period and 3.8% of the total were positive. 636 patients admitted to the COVID-19 pathway were included and analyzed: 45.4% were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive. More SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were discharged in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (59% vs. 41%, respectively). On the other hand, more SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were transferred to ICUs in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (16% vs. 1%, respectively). Occurrence of death was similar between the two groups, 11% vs. 7%, for SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients, respectively. 25% of &#8805;80 years old SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died during the hospitalization, while death rate was lower in other age groups (5% in 70-79 years old patients and 0% in remaining age groups).

Metod: In this retrospective study, a total of 117 deceased patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and undergone chest CT were enrolled. We evaluated initial chest CT findings and the relationship of each, its location, prevalence and frequency with mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 73 ±18 years, 71 of all patients were male and 46 were female.The predominant feature was pure GGO lesion (82.0%), and 59.8% of cases had pure consolidation. There was no cavitation, or architectural distorsion. Pericardial effusion was found in 9.4%, and pleural effusions were found in 15.3% of patients. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was only 11.9% in total. CONCLUSION: In deceased patients, on admission CTs, pure consolidation, pleural and pericardial effusion, mediastinal LAP were more common than ordinary cases. It was these findings that should also raise the concern when they were seen on chest CT, therefore, these radiologic features have the potential to represent prognostic imaging markers in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","GÜndÜz, YasemIn; Karabay, OGuz; Erdem, AlI Fuat; Arik, ErbIl; ÖztÜrk, Mehmet HalIl",,,272

The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity model, and then the parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and least squares calculation. The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential decay to the observational data is not satisfactory. Further, the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal transmission between regions is not significant. (3) The effect of spatial lockdown and isolation measures taken by Chinese government against the transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests that the role of urban gravity (size and distance) should be taken into account to prevent and control epidemic disease.","Chen, Yanguang; Li, Yajing; Feng, Shuo; Man, Xiaoming; Long, Yuqing",PLoS One,,272
251979,COVID-19 and Moral Distress in Healthcare Professionals: Can Ethics Committees Make a Difference?,2021,"PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools have offered a virtual application process. Minimal literature is available to guide best practices. APPROACH: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) implemented a completely virtual interview (VI) process in April/May 2020. Large-group sessions for applicants, interviews with applicants, and ISMMS Admission Committee meetings occurred via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, California). Large-group sessions and committee meetings occurred via communal conference calls, while one-on-one, semi-structured interviews occurred in individual breakout rooms. ISMMS offered live, virtual question-and-answer sessions with students and faculty, plus digital resources describing program features. After the interview day, applicants and interviewers were invited to complete anonymous surveys regarding their experiences with and perspectives of VI. OUTCOMES: Of 125 applicants and 20 interviewers, 99 (79%) and 18 (90%), respectively, completed at least part of the survey. Of the applicants, 85/95 (89%) agreed VI met or exceeded expectations, many praising the day's organization and convenience, and 71/95 (75%) agreed they received a sufficient sense of the student body. A minority (n = 39/95, [41%]) felt limited in their ability to learn about the institution (commonly related to their inability to tour campus), and a majority (n =74/91, [81%]) would have preferred an in-person interview. Most interviewers felt comfortable assessing applicants' verbal communication skills (n = 13/16, [81%]), and most (n = 12/17, [71%]) felt VI should be an option for future applicants. NEXT STEPS: VI, likely to be a temporary-but-universal fixture of upcoming application cycles, may benefit applicants and interviewers alike by saving resources and diversifying those involved. Next steps are developing programming that will permit applicants to virtually explore the institution and connect more with current students. Future research should evaluate potential bias in VI to ensure an equitable application process for all.","Garden, Evan; Loebel, Emma; Sanky, Charles; Chudow, Jacquelyn; Fallar, Robert; Parkas, Valerie",Acad. med,,272

253852,Letter: Adaptation Under Fire: Two Harvard Neurosurgical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"We analyzed COVID-19 data through May 6th, 2020 using a partially observed Markov process. Our method uses a hybrid deterministic and stochastic formalism that allows for time variable transmission rates and detection probabilities. The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 55 countries. We found evidence for a shrinking epidemic in 30 of the 55 examined countries. Of those 30 countries, 27 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases is relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. Generally, the transmission rates in Europe were lower than in the Americas and Asia. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed.","Romero-Severson, Ethan Obie; Hengartner, Nick; Meadors, Grant; Ke, Ruian",PLoS One,,272

Data Sources: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and Cochrane library between December 1, 2019, and August 26, 2020. Study Selection: Investigators screened 360 unique references, retrieved published autopsy series, and report on the postmortem histopathologic information on patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. Data Extraction: Investigators independently abstracted all available data including study design, participant demographics, key histopathologic findings, disease severity markers, duration of hospital stay, and cause of death. Data Synthesis: From the 65 eligible studies, 691 total completed autopsies were included in evidence synthesis. Histopathologic evaluation of the lungs revealed presence of diffuse alveolar damage in 323 of 443 patients and pulmonary microthrombi in 242 of 326 patients. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were found in 41% and ~15%, respectively, of the cadavers examined for thromboembolic events. d-dimer levels were generally higher in patients with severe clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019. Plasma levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein were higher in nonsurvivors when compared with survivors. Overall, microthrombi and extensive angiogenesis of lung vasculature were the most common pathologic findings in the lungs and microthrombi in most of the assessed organ-tissue. Conclusions: Diffuse alveolar damage was the most predominant feature in the lungs of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent postmortem assessment. Widespread pulmonary microthrombosis and extensive pulmonary angiogenesis, in addition to frequent pulmonary and extrapulmonary microthrombotic and thromboembolic findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, appear to be consistent with the disease-specific hypercoagulability. Further discovery efforts in assessing the link between coronavirus disease 2019, hypercoagulable state, and immunothrombosis are warranted. In the interim, increased attention to anticoagulant treatment approaches in coronavirus disease 2019 patients is needed.","Fahmy, O. H.; Daas, F. M.; Salunkhe, V.; Petrey, J. L.; Cosar, E.

254412,Sedentarism and chronic disease risk in COVID 19 lockdown - a scoping review,2020,"Purpose: To present a rare case report of Onodi cell-associated optic neuropathy, conducting a review of the literature. Methods: A 36-year-old male presented with an 18-h history of acute deterioration of vision in his left eye (LE). Ophthalmic examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were consistent with an Onodi cell-associated compressive optic neuropathy. Results: Despite immediate, successful surgical decompression, severe optic nerve atrophy and permanent visual loss occurred during early postoperative period. The reported case gives rise to different hypotheses regarding pathophysiology that may lead to irreversible blindness. A systematic review of the respective literature is provided attempting to compare different approaches in the management of Onodi cell-associated compressive optic neuropathy and assess their efficacy in the final visual outcome. Poor initial visual acuity (VA) may represent a bad prognostic factor. Moreover, age and gender do not seem to significantly influence the outcome. Conclusion: This report and associated literature review highlight the importance of the radiologic characteristics and early diagnosis in the final visual outcome of the Onodi cell-associated optic neuropathy. High level of suspicion is crucial for early diagnosis of mucoceles, which must be treated promptly by surgical and medical means to enhance visual recovery.","Tzamalis, Argyrios; Diafas, Asterios; Riga, Paraskevi; Konstantinidis, Iordanis; Ziakas, Nikolaos",J Curr Ophthalmol,,272

To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10, 2020, Italy has been under a total lockdown, forcing people into home confinement. Here we present data from 1,310 people living in the Italian territory (Mage = 23.91 ± 3.60 years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 university students), who completed an online survey from March 24 to March 28, 2020. In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17-23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3-10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.","Cellini, Nicola; Canale, Natale; Mioni, Giovanna; Costa, Sebastiano",J Sleep Res,,272

The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems, especially the lungs and heart. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. In our review of clinical analyses, we found that in 26 studies including 11,685 patients, the weighted pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was 20% (ranged from 5% to 38% depending on the criteria used). The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and 'endotheliitis' in several organs including the heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification. In patients with elevated hs-troponin, clinical context is important and myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential, along with type I and type II myocardial infarction. Irrespective of etiology, patients with acute myocardial injury should be prioritized for treatment. Clinical decisions including interventions should be individualized and carefully tailored after thorough review of risks/benefits. Given the complex interplay of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, further investigation into potential mechanisms is needed to guide effective therapies. Randomized trials are urgently needed to investigate treatment modalities to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with COVID-19 related acute myocardial injury.","Bavishi, Chirag; Bonow, Robert O; Trivedi, Vrinda; Abbott, J Dawn; Messerli, Franz H; Bhatt, Deepak L",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,,272

Cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, and HRCT imaging were collected and compared between discharged and deceased patients. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of mortality risk in these patients. 101 patients were included in this study, of whom 66 were discharged and 35 died in the hospital. The mean age was 56.6 ± 15.1 years and 67 (66.3%) were men. Of the 101 patients, hypertension (38, 37.6%), cardiovascular disease (21,20.8%), diabetes (18,17.8%), and chronic pulmonary disease (16,15.8%) were the most common coexisting conditions.

This article will discuss how patient privacy, adequate communication, and advance care planning are rights that incarcerated patients may not experience during this pandemic. We highlight the role of compassionate release and note how COVID-19 may affect this prospect. A number of pragmatic recommendations are made to attenuate the discrepancy in hospital care experienced by those admitted from prisons and jails. Physicians must be familiar with the relevant hospital policies, be prepared to adapt their practices in order to overcome barriers to care, such as continuous shackling, and advocate to change these policies when they conflict with patient care. Stigma, isolation, and concerns over staff safety are shared experiences for COVID-19 and incarcerated patients, but incarcerated patients have been experiencing this treatment long before the current pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 has an exceptionally high level of transmissibility and extremely broad tissue tropism. However, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for sustaining this degree of virulence remains largely unexplored. In this article, we review the current knowledge and crucial information about how SARS-CoV-2 attaches on the surface of host cells through a variety of receptors, such as ACE2, neuropilin-1, AXL, and antibody-FcÎ³R complexes. We further explain how its spike (S) protein undergoes conformational transition from prefusion to postfusion with the help of proteases like furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins. We then review the ongoing experimental studies and clinical trials of antibodies, peptides, or small-molecule compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and discuss how these antiviral therapies targeting host-pathogen interaction could potentially suppress viral attachment, reduce the exposure of fusion peptide to curtail membrane fusion and block the formation of six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core. Finally, the specter of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants deserves a serious review of broad-spectrum drugs or vaccines for long-term prevention and control of COVID-19 in the future.","Zhang, Qianqian; Xiang, Rong; Huo, Shanshan; Zhou, Yunjiao; Jiang, Shibo; Wang, Qiao; Yu, Fei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,272

OBJECTIVE.­: To report the histopathologic description of a series of chilblainlike lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic. DESIGN.­: The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS.­: Two main histopathologic patterns were observed: a chilblainlike histopathologic pattern (10 of 13 cases; 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 of 13 cases; 23%). The chilblainlike histopathologic pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi, and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, possibly because these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSIONS.­: The relationship of chilblainlike lesions to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires further investigations. Histopathologic features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus, and, less frequently, a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the 2 histopathologic patterns described.","Sohier, Pierre; Matar, Stéphanie; Meritet, Jean-François; Laurent-Roussel, Sara; Dupin, Nicolas; Aractingi, Selim",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,272

As no such studies have been carried out in Spain, our objective is to describe and quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients in Spanish hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter, nationwide study collected information from hospital departments treating oncology patients. An electronic questionnaire comparing outcomes and management of oncohematological patients for the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods was used. RESULTS: Information from 78 departments (36 tertiary hospitals) was analyzed. Forty-four departments implemented adapted protocols during March 2020. Most of these (n = 38/44; 86.4%) carried out COVID-19 triage, while 26 of 44 (59.1%) carried out onsite polymerase chain reaction tests for clinically suspected cases. A shift from in-person to telephone visits was observed in 43 of 44 (97.7%) departments. Comparing the March-June 2019 and March-June 2020 periods, the number of new patients decreased by 20.8% (from 160.2 to 126.4). Decreases were also seen in the mean number of total (2858.2 versus 1686.1) and cancer (465.5 versus 367.2) biopsies, as well as the mean number of bone marrow biopsies (30.5 versus 18.6). Concerning the number of patients visiting specific cancer care departments, a decrease from 2019 to 2020 was seen for mean number of chemotherapy treatments (712.7 versus 643.8) and radiation therapy (2169.9 versus 2139.9). Finally, a reduction from 2019 to 2020 of 12.9% (from 8.6 to 7.4) in the mean number of patients included in clinical trials was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first comprehensive data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care in Spain. The pandemic caused a 20.8% decrease in newly diagnosed patients, which may impact future outcomes. Measures must be taken to ensure cancer management receives priority in times of healthcare emergencies.","Amador, M; Matias-Guiu, X; Sancho-Pardo, G; Contreras Martinez, J; de la Torre-Montero, J C; Peuelas Saiz, A; Garrido, P; García-Sanz, R; Rodríguez-Lescure, Á; Paz-Ares, L",ESMO Open,,272

However, despite that nutrition may change in a lockdown situation, little is known about the influence of malnutrition among subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19. Our study aimed to assess whether the presence of malnutrition among patients admitted due to COVID-19 had any impact on clinical outcomes compared with patients with the same condition but well nourished. METHODS: 75 patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 were analyzed cross-sectionally. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was completed by phone interview. Clinical parameters included were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: According to the SGA, 27 admitted due to a COVID-19 infection had malnutrition. Patients not well nourished were older than patients with a SGA grade A (65 ± 14.1 vs 49 ± 15.1 years; p < 0.0001). Length of hospital stay among poorly nourished patients was significantly higher (18.4 ± 15.6 vs 8.5 ± 7.7 days; p = 0.001). Mortality rates and admission to ICU were greater among subjects with any degree of malnutrition compared with well-nourished patients (7.4% vs 0%; p = 0.05 and 44.4% vs 6.3%; p < 0.0001). CRP (120.9 ± 106.2 vs 60.8 ± 62.9 mg/l; p = 0.03), D-dimer (1516.9 ± 1466.9 vs 461.1 ± 353.7 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and ferritin (847.8 ± 741.1 vs 617.8 ± 598.7mcg/l; p = 0.03) were higher in the group with malnutrition. Haemoglobin (11.6 ± 2.1 vs 13.6 ± 1.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) and albumin 3.2 ± 0.7 vs 4.1 ± 0.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) were lower in patients with any degree of malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a poor nutritional status is related to a longer stay in hospital, a greater admission in the ICU and a higher mortality.","Nicolau, Joana; Ayala, Luisa; Sanchís, Pilar; Olivares, Josefina; Dotres, Keyla; Soler, Ana-Gloria; Rodríguez, Irene; Gómez, Luis-Alberto; Masmiquel, Lluís",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,272

This scientific note brings reflections on the trajectory of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional, the repercussions of its extinction in the last year, and the project to dismantle social protection policies in Brazil, with serious consequences at a time when the country is going through a crisis in public health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The absence of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional and the weakening of the set of policies for Food and Nutritional Security has mobilized the civil society to defend the human rights to food, food sovereignty, and to democracy itself. The resistance of the different social movements in order to maintain the spaces of civil participation related to Food and Nutrition Security public policies are still going to be long and arduous, demanding the continued vocalization and strengthening of partnership networks within the different movements of the organized civil society. Finally, we highlight the urgent need for restoration of the National System of Food and Nutritional Security (Sistema Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional) with all its instances, and of other social policies, so that the negative consequences of the pandemic are avoided or mitigated and the State complies with its obligations to guarantee the rights of the Brazilian population.","RECINE, Elisabetta; FAGUNDES, Andhressa; SILVA, Barbara Leone; GARCIA, Giselle Silva; RIBEIRO, Rita de Cássia Lisboa; GABRIEL, Cristine Garcia",Rev.

263906,Changing trends in psychiatric emergency service admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak: Report from a worldwide epicentre,2021,"C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) has been used as an indicator of prognosis in various diseases. Here, we intended to assess the CAR's diagnostic power in early differentiation of hospitalized severe COVID-19 cases. In this retrospectively designed study, we evaluated 197 patients in total. They were divided into two groups based on their severity of COVID-19 as non-severe (n = 113) and severe (n = 84). The comparison of groups' demographic data, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and laboratory test results were done. Laboratory data of the patients within the first 24 h after admission to the hospital were evaluated. The calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic power of CAR in differentiating severity of COVID-19. Independent risk factors predictive of COVID-19 severity were determined by using logistic regression analysis. Although lymphocyte count levels were lower, severe COVID-19 patients had higher mean age, higher levels of neutrophil count, CRP, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ferritin, and prothrombin time (P < 0.05). Compared with non-severe patients (median, 0.23 [IQR = 0.07-1.56]), patients with severe COVID-19 had higher CAR levels (median, 1.66 [IQR = 0.50-3.35]; P < 0.001). Age (OR = 1.046, P = 0.003), CAR (OR = 1.264, P = 0.037), and AST (OR = 1.029, P = 0.037) were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis. ROC curve analysis assigned 0.9 as the cut-off value for CAR for differentiation of severe COVID-19 (area under the curve = 0.718, 69.1% sensitivity, 70.8% specificity, P < 0.001). CAR is a useful marker in early differentiation of severity in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 that have longer hospital stay and higher mortality.","Karakoyun, Inanc; Colak, Ayfer; Turken, Melda; Altin, Zeynep; Arslan, Fatma Demet; Iyilikci, Veli; Yilmaz, Nisel; Kose, Sukran",Int Immunopharmacol,,272

263977,Neuroimaging findings of brain MRI and CT in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"The level of circulating interferon-Î³ (IFNÎ³) is elevated in various clinical conditions including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, and viral infections. As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFNÎ³ on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (""cardiobundles""). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20 ng/ml of IFNÎ³ on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFNÎ³ induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFNÎ³-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric &#945;-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFNÎ³-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNÎ³ on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-Î³ (IFNÎ³) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFNÎ³ can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFNÎ³-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFNÎ³, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zhan, Ren-Zhi; Rao, Lingjun; Chen, Zhaowei; Strash, Nicholas; Bursac, Nenad",Acta Biomater,,272

For both applications, data compression is a straightforward solution. However, in the literature, the number of specific protein sequence compressors is relatively low. Moreover, these specialized compressors marginally improve the compression ratio over the best general-purpose compressors. In this paper, we present AC2, a new lossless data compressor for protein (or amino acid) sequences. AC2 uses a neural network to mix experts with a stacked generalization approach and individual cache-hash memory models to the highest-context orders. Compared to the previous compressor (AC), we show gains of 2–9% and 6–7% in reference-free and reference-based modes, respectively. These gains come at the cost of three times slower computations. AC2 also improves memory usage against AC, with requirements about seven times lower, without being affected by the sequences’ input size. As an analysis application, we use AC2 to measure the similarity between each SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence with each viral protein sequence from the whole UniProt database. The results consistently show higher similarity to the pangolin coronavirus, followed by the bat and human coronaviruses, contributing with critical results to a current controversial subject. AC2 is available for free download under GPLv3 license.","Silva, Milton Pratas Diogo Pinho Armando J.",Entropy,,272

The aim of this study was to show its impacton the activity of a tertiary care Endoscopy Unit with &gt;18,000 procedures/year. Methods This is a single-center study performed at Fondazione Poliambulanza Istituto Ospedaliero, Brescia, Italy. OurInstitution was converted to COVID-19 Hospital from January to April 2020 and only emergency and oncologic procedureswere maintained to preserve both patients' and operators' health. Data about outpatients visits and endoscopicexaminations performed from January to April 2020 were compared to the same period of 2019. Results A dramatic drop of all activities was shown. In details, overall outpatient visits decreased of-45,89 % (1100 vs2033), including-39.5 % (227 vs 375) of IBD and-28.6 % (30 vs 42) biliopancreatic visits. Endoscopic examinations alsodiminished considerably as shown in table 1. Overall,-64.6 % of gastro-intestinal cancers were detected (17 vs 48). Areduction of-77.8 % and-80 % were obtained in terms of advanced neoplasia (i.e. high-grade dysplasia and villoushistology) and adenocarcinomas detected during colonoscopy between the two years (22 vs 100 and 6 vs 30, respectively).Such absolute reduction was not compensated by an increase of relative diagnostic yield, being 8.3 % vs 7.9 % (22/266 vs100/1256;Odd Ratio [OR] 1.05) and 2.3 % vs 2.4 % (6/266 vs 30/1256;OR 0.94) for advanced neoplasia and colorectalcancer, respectively. Although a reduction of-35.3 %, a significant improvement was showed comparing diagnostic yield ofgastric adenocarcinomas, being 2.1 % vs 4.6 % (17/814 vs 11/241;OR 0.44), respectively. Conclusions COVID-19 caused a notably decrease of all activities, including screening colonoscopy. This produced areduction of the total amount of neoplasia detected during endoscopy compared to the same period of the previous year.The consequences of this delay are still to be shown.

265062,Elective Operation Scheduling during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The antimalarial agent mefloquine is currently being investigated for its potential to inhibit feline coronavirus and feline calicivirus infections. A simple, high pressure liquid chromatography assay was developed to detect mefloquine plasma concentrations in feline plasma. The assay's lower limit of quantification was 250 ng/mL. The mean ± standard deviation intra- and inter-day precision expressed as coefficients of variation were 6.83 ± 1.75 and 5.33 ± 1.37%, respectively, whereas intra- and inter-day accuracy expressed as a percentage of the bias were 11.40 ± 3.73 and 10.59 ± 3.88%, respectively. Accordingly, this validated assay should prove valuable for future in vivo clinical trials of mefloquine as an antiviral agent against feline coronavirus and feline calicivirus. However, the proportion of mefloquine binding to feline plasma proteins has not been reported. The proportion of drug bound to plasma protein binding is an important concept when developing drug dosing regimens. As cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) demonstrate altered concentrations of plasma proteins, the proportion of mefloquine binding to plasma proteins in both clinically normal cats and FIP-affected cats was also investigated. An in vitro method using rapid equilibrium dialysis demonstrated that mefloquine was highly plasma protein bound in both populations (on average > 99%).","Izes, Aaron M; Kimble, Benjamin; Norris, Jacqueline M; Govendir, Merran",PLoS One,,272

At one stage, more than half of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia had been infected during a congregation of 16 000 believers from 30 countries (Beech, 2020). For weeks, the clergy in Iran refused to accept a ban on gatherings of pilgrims in holy shrines until the virus had crossed the borders of neighboring countries (Ziabari, 2020). Tableeghi Ijtima (an annual, international Muslim missionary gathering) in Raiwind, Pakistan became a super-spreader of the virus due to the 'stubbornness of the clergy', which opposed the closing of the congregation;however, it subsequently agreed to curtail the 6 days event to 3 days. Later, when cases surged in those attending the congregation, Raiwind was sealed off and declared a hotspot. More than half of the cases in Punjab (the most affected province) had emanated from the Raiwind congregation (Table 1) (Government of Pakistan, 2020).","Naeem, Mubarak",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,272

The urgent need for effective and affordable COVID-19 treatments calls for repurposing combinations of approved drugs. The challenge is to identify which combinations are likely to be most effective and at what stages of the disease. Here, we present the first disease-stage executable signalling network model of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions used to predict effective repurposed drug combinations for treating early- and late-stage severe disease. Using our executable model, we performed in silico screening of 9870 pairs of 140 potential targets and have identified 12 new drug combinations. Camostat and Apilimod were predicted to be the most promising combination in effectively supressing viral replication in the early stages of severe disease and were validated experimentally in human Caco-2 cells. Our study further demonstrates the power of executable mechanistic modelling to enable rapid pre-clinical evaluation of combination therapies tailored to disease progression. It also presents a novel resource and expandable model system that can respond to further needs in the pandemic.","Howell, Rowan; Clarke, Matthew A; Reuschl, Ann-Kathrin; Chen, Tianyi; Abott-Imboden, Sean; Singer, Mervyn; Lowe, David M; Bennett, Clare L; Chain, Benjamin; Jolly, Clare; Fisher, Jasmin",,,272
265538,Place and causes of acute cardiovascular mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia in pregnant women. The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods: We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant Spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing Spike protein (VSV-S). Findings: Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both Spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased while Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R and Placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and Angiotensin II type 1-Receptor Autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of preeclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes such as preeclampsia in pregnant women.

265945,The medical concerns of patients with thalassemias at the time of COVID-19 outbreak: The personal experience and the international recommendations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported in nursing homes and assisted living facilities; however, the extent of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk population remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted an investigation of the first known outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Illinois on March 15, 2020 and followed residents for 30 days. We tested 126/127 residents for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR and performed symptom assessments. We calculated the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and assessed symptom onset over 30-day follow-up to determine: 1) the proportion of cases who were symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic and 2) incidence of symptoms among those who tested negative. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to determine the 30-day probability of death for cases. RESULTS: Of 126 residents tested, 33 had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on March 15. Nineteen (58%) had symptoms at the time of testing, 1 (3%) developed symptoms over follow-up, and 13 (39%) remained asymptomatic. Thirty-five residents who tested negative on March 15 developed symptoms over follow-up; of these, 3 were re-tested and 2 were positive. The 30-day probability of death among cases was 29%. CONCLUSIONS: SNFs are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and residents are at risk of severe outcomes. Attention must be paid to preventing outbreaks in these and other congregate care settings. Widespread testing and infection control are key to help prevent COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in these high-risk populations.","Patel, Mahesh C; Chaisson, Lelia H; Borgetti, Scott; Burdsall, Deborah; Chugh, Rashmi K; Hoff, Christopher R; Murphy, Elizabeth B; Murskyj, Emily A; Wilson, Shannon; Ramos, Joe; Akker, Lynn; Bryars, Debra; Thomas-Smith, Evonda; Bleasdale, Susan C; Ezike, Ngozi O",Clin. infect. dis,,272

Collecting information about its complications and related conditions will help clinicians to become more confident in managing this disease. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is mostly described as a post-infectious phenomenon and its occurrence during acute phase of illness is of interest. GBS has recently been reported during the active phase of COVID-19 for the first time. Severity and fast progression of GBS associated with COVID-19 have also been shown in recent studies. Here we report three cases of GBS during the active phase of COVID-19 with severe symptoms and fast progression to quadriplegia and facial diplegia over 2 days, which led to death in one case due to severe autonomic dysfunction. We suggest SARS-CoV-2 might be associated with rather a severe, rapidly progressive and life-threatening phenotype of GBS.","Abolmaali, Meysam; Heidari, Matineh; Zeinali, Marjan; Moghaddam, Parichehr; Ramezani Ghamsari, Mona; Jamshidi Makiani, Mahin; Mirzaasgari, Zahra",J. clin. neurosci,,272
267386,Triage during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The bioethanol industry continues improving sustainability, specifically focused on plant energy and GHG emission management. Dried distiller grains with solubles (DDGS) is a byproduct of ethanol fermentation and is used for animal feed. DDGS is a relatively low-value bulk product that decays, causes odor, and is challenging to manage. The aim of this research was to find an alternative, value-added-type concept for DDGS utilization. Specifically, we aimed to explore the techno-economic feasibility of torrefaction, i.e., a thermochemical treatment of DDGS requiring low energy input, less sophisticated equipment, and resulting in fuel-quality biochar. Therefore, we developed a research model that addresses both bioethanol production sustainability and profitability due to synergy with the torrefaction of DDGS and using produced biochar as marketable fuel for the plant. Our experiments showed that DDGS-based biochar (CSF-carbonized solid fuel) lower calorific value may reach up to 27 MJ.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; d.m. (dry matter) Specific research questions addressed were: What monetary profits and operational cost reductions could be expected from valorizing DDGS as a source of marketable biorenewable energy, which may be used for bioethanol production plant's demand? What environmental and financial benefits could be expected from valorizing DDGS to biochar and its reuse for natural gas substitution? Modeling indicated that the valorized CSF could be produced and used as a source of energy for the bioethanol production plant. The use of heat generated from CSF incineration supplies the entire heat demand of the torrefaction unit and the heat demand of bioethanol production (15-30% of the mass of CSF and depending on the lower heating value (LHV) of the CSF produced). The excess of 70-85% of the CSF produced has the potential to be marketed for energetic, agricultural, and other applications. Preliminary results show the relationship between the reduction of the environmental footprint (~24% reduction in CO2 emissions) with the introduction of comprehensive on-site valorization of DDGS. The application of DDGS torrefaction and CSF recycling may be a source of the new, more valuable revenues and bring new perspectives to the bioethanol industry to be more sustainable and profitable, including during the COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks to market conditions.","O039,; Brien, S.; Koziel, J.

However, there are limited data describing their performance, in particular the performance of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR systems. We analyzed the diagnostic performance of two high-throughput systems: cobas 6800 and Panther Fusion, and their associated RT-PCR assays, with a collection of 389 nasopharyngeal specimens. The overall agreement between the platforms was 96.4% (375/389). Cohen's kappa analysis rated the strength of agreement between the two platforms as ""almost perfect"" (&#954; = 0.922; standard error, 0.051). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between corresponding cycle threshold values generated on the two systems (P value = 0.88; Student's t test).

However, there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1ß and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.","Imami, Ali S; O039,; Donovan, Sinead M; Creeden, Justin F; Wu, Xiaojun; Eby, Hunter; McCullumsmith, Cheryl B; Uvnäs-Moberg, Kerstin; McCullumsmith, Robert E; Andari, Elissar",Physiol Genomics,,272

273055,Models for mortality require tailoring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic - Authors' reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, a large number of infections have been reported among healthcare workers (HCWs). The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs involved in the first management of infected patients and to describe the measures adopted to prevent the transmission in the hospital. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between February 21 and April 16, 2020, in the Padua University Hospital (north-east Italy). The infection control policy adopted consisted of the following: the creation of the ""Advanced Triage"" area for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the implementation of an integrated infection control surveillance system directed to all the healthcare personnel involved in the Advance Triage area. HCWs were regularly tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; body temperature and suggestive symptoms were evaluated at each duty. Demographic and clinical data of both patients and HCWs were collected and analyzed; HCWs' personal protective equipment (PPE) consumption was also recorded. The efficiency of the control strategy among HCWs was evaluated identifying symptomatic infection (primary endpoint) and asymptomatic infection (secondary endpoint) with confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 7595 patients were evaluated in the Advanced Triage area: 5.2% resulted positive and 72.4% was symptomatic. The HCW team was composed of 60 members. A total of 361 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed on HCWs. All the swabs resulted negative and none of the HCWs reached the primary or the secondary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated hospital infection control strategy, consisting of dedicated areas for infected patients, strict measures for PPE use and mass surveillance, is successful to prevent infection among HCWs.","Cattelan, Anna Maria; Sasset, Lolita; Di Meco, Eugenia; Cocchio, Silvia; Barbaro, Francesco; Cavinato, Silvia; Gardin, Samuele; Carretta, Giovanni; Donato, Daniele; Crisanti, Andrea; Trevenzoli, Marco; Baldo, Vincenzo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272
273068,"Neurological, Cognitive, and Behavioral Disorders during COVID-19: The Nitric Oxide Track",2020,"Approaches are needed for therapy of the severe acute respiratory syndrome from SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin Î³1 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.","Miller, Ami; Leach, Adam; Thomas, Jemima; McAndrew, Craig; Bentley, Emma; Mattiuzzo, Giada; John, Lijo; Mirazimi, Ali; Harris, Gemma; Gamage, Nadisha; Carr, Stephen; Ali, Hanif; Van Montfort, Rob; Rabbitts, Terence",Sci Rep,,272
273512,Use of standard formulations in pediatric home parenteral nutrition – the experience of a portuguese center during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Seroprevalence studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from many countries have shown that the number of undiagnosed missing cases is much larger than that of confirmed cases, irrespective of seroprevalence levels. Considering the strategy of Korea entailing massive testing and contact tracing from the beginning of epidemic, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Korea may be negligible. This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among individuals who were never diagnosed with COVID-19 in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Serologic testing for immunoglobulin G antibody based on immunochromatographic assay was conducted in 103 patients and 95 guardians aged 18 to 82 years without any history of COVID-19 diagnosis, who visited outpatient clinics of a single university-affiliated hospital from May 25 to June 5, 2020. RESULTS: The estimated seroprevalence was 7.6% (95% confidence interval, 4.3%-12.2%) with 15 positive cases. Among them, only one had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed case among their close contacts and 13 did not experience COVID-19-related symptoms. Seroprevalence was similar between patients and guardians. Based on this figure, the number of undiagnosed missing cases in Daegu was estimated to be a dozen times more than the number of confirmed cases based on PCR testing. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitation of a small and unrepresentative sample, this is the first study on seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Korea. Our study suggested that the number of undiagnosed missing cases was substantial even with the stringent strategy adopted in Korea, similar to that of other countries.","Song, Suk Kyoon; Lee, Duk Hee; Nam, Jun Ho; Kim, Kyung Tae; Do, Jung Suk; Kang, Dae Won; Kim, Sang Gyung; Cho, Myung Rae",J Korean Med Sci,,272
273903,"[Correction: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria, Germany]",2020,"BACKGROUND: The globally devastating effects of COVID-19 breach not only the realm of public health, but of psychosocial interaction and communication as well, particularly with the advent of mask-wearing. METHODS: A review of the literature and understanding of facial anatomy and expressions as well as the effect of botulinum toxin on emotions and nonverbal communication. RESULTS: Today, the mask has become a semi-permanent accessory to the face, blocking our ability to express and perceive each other's facial expressions by dividing it into a visible top half and invisible bottom half. This significantly restricts our ability to accurately interpret emotions based on facial expressions and strengthens our perceptions of negative emotions produced by frowning. The addition of botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced facial muscle paralysis to target the muscles of the top (visible) half of the face, especially the corrugator and procerus muscles, may act as a therapeutic solution by its suppression of glabellar lines and our ability to frown. The treatment of the glabella complex not only has been shown to inhibit the negative emotions of the treated individual but also can reduce the negative emotions in those who come in contact with the treated individual. CONCLUSIONS: Mask-wearing in the wake of COVID-19 brings new challenges to our ability to communicate and perceive emotion through full facial expression, our most effective and universally shared form of communication, and BTX may offer a positive solution to decrease negative emotions and promote well-being for both the mask-wearer and all who come in contact with that individual.","Nestor, Mark S; Fischer, Daniel; Arnold, David",J. cosmet. dermatol,,272

During unexpected circumstances, such as COVID-19, many people used the internet for purposes such as education, work, and entertainment. This has led to a rapid growth in the content industry. Thus, studies of the sustainability and success of content companies are essential. Few empirical studies focus on these aspects of content companies, particularly concentrating on the importance of management and innovation capability. This study examines the roles of management and innovation capabilities and the human, technical, and organizational factors that affect these capabilities. This, in turn, positively affects the sustainability and success of content companies. The proposed research model includes content development ability and leadership as a human factor, technical support and information technology (IT) infrastructure as a technical factor, and top management and financial support as an organizational factor. A total of 255 responses were collected from upper management-level employees at various firms in the content industry. Covariance-based structural equation modeling was used with Amos 22.0. The results indicated that all proposed hypotheses were supported with the exception of the hypothesis that tests the relationship between content development and management capability.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data. SETTING: Internet survey conducted between 25 August and 30 September 2020 in Japan. Sampling weights were used to calculate national estimates. PARTICIPANTS: 25 482 survey respondents (50.3% (12 809) women; mean (SD) age, 48.8 (17.4) years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rate of five symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection (high fever, sore throat, cough, headache, and smell and taste disorder) within the past month of the survey, after adjustment for characteristics of individuals and prefecture fixed effects (effectively comparing individuals living in the same prefecture). RESULTS: At the time of the survey, 3289 (12.9%) participated in the subsidy programme. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that participants in the subsidy programme exhibited higher incidence of high fever (adjusted rate, 4.7% for participants vs 3.7% for non-participants; adjusted OR (aOR) 1.83; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.48; p<0.001), sore throat (19.8% vs 11.3%; aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.37 to 3.19; p=0.002), cough (19.0% vs 11.3%; aOR 1.96; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.01; p=0.008), headache (29.2% vs 25.5%; aOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; p=0.006) and smell and taste disorder (2.6% vs 1.8%; aOR 1.98; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.40; p=0.01) compared with non-participants. These findings remained qualitatively unaffected by additional adjustment for the use of 17 preventative measures (eg, social distancing, wearing masks and handwashing) and fear against the COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The participation of the government subsidy programme for domestic travel was associated with a higher probability of exhibiting symptoms indicative of the COVID-19 infection.","Miyawaki, Atsushi; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Tomata, Yasutake; Tsugawa, Yusuke",BMJ Open,,272

Publications made between January and October 2020, in English and Spanish. Theses and conference abstracts were excluded. The analysis and synthesis were made in a descriptive way, using a spreadsheet. Forty-three articles were selected according to the methodological quality. Results: The analysis was made by continent according to the development of the pandemic. In Asia, individual rights, privacy and human dignity were respected, but in African countries, basic needs were affected, generating major ethical dilemmas. In Europe, the principle of charity was violated by not being able to follow up on patients. The principle of autonomy was transgressed due to the mourning process. The principle of non-maleficence is linked to futility. The principle of justice has been questioned in the face of the dilemma of scarcity and allocation of resources. In addition, in North America, aggression against social justice was identified as an exacerbation of social inequalities. In Latin America, all articles mention the vulnerability of all ethical principles Conclusions: It highlights the conflict between individual rights and collective health protection. Worldwide, there have been similarities in ethical conflicts. Social, cultural, political and economic differences have had an impact on the management of the pandemic.

Metrics, site-level survey results, and examples of interventions conducted to support telemedicine in T1D are shown. Materials and Methods: Thirteen clinics (11 pediatric, 2 adult) provided monthly telemedicine metrics between December 2019 and August 2020 and 21 clinics completed a survey about their telemedicine practices. Results: The proportion of telemedicine visits in T1DX-QI before the pandemic was <1%, rising to an average of 95.2% in April 2020 (range 52.3%-99.5%). Three sites initially used mostly telephone visits before converting to video visits. By August 2020, the proportion of telemedicine visits decreased to an average of 45% across T1DX-QI (range 10%-86.6%). The majority of clinics (62%) performed both video and telephone visits; Zoom was the most popular video platform used. Over 95% of clinics reported using CareLink&#8482;, Clarity®, Glooko&#8482;, and/or t:connect® to view device data, with only one center reporting automated data upload into the electronic medical record. The majority of centers had multidisciplinary teams participating in the video visits. All sites reported reimbursement for video visits, and 95% of sites reported coverage for telephone visits early on in the pandemic. Conclusions: There was rapid adoption of telemedicine in T1DX-QI during the COVID-19 pandemic.

281868,Project Inclusive Genetics: Exploring the impact of patient-centered counseling training on physical disability bias in the prenatal setting,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is a major global concern, is characterized by a progressive disease pattern involving diverse host immune responses. Programmed cell death marker-1(PD-1) expression, a critical checkpoint for T cell exhaustion, can be modulated by interleukin-10, which also mediates apoptotic T cell cytopenia. We aimed to measure the level of PD-1 expression and to investigate its correlation with IL-10 serum levels in modulating T cell effector function, correlating the results with the level of severity of the disease. This study involved 40 patients with COVID-19 and 20 healthy controls. Using flow cytometry, the expression of PD-1 was determined on CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes. ELISA was used to determine the levels of IL-10 in the serum. We found a remarkable decrease in T cell counts with functionally exhausted surviving T cells in the patient groups, especially in patients with severe disease. PD-1 expression increased significantly in CD4+, CD8+, and total T cells, showing a higher expression in CD8+ T cells. The patient groups had significantly higher serum IL-10 levels than the control group. The ROC analysis demonstrated the predictive role of IL-10 levels in disease severity (65% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and AUC = 0.806). IL-10 serum levels and PD-1 expression in total T cells were positively correlated, suggesting that IL-10 participates in T cell exhaustion.

281877,COVID-19 pandemic and physicians in training,2020,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients' in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients' management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit. It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.","Alharbi, Ali; Alharbi, Saad; Alqaidi, Shahad",,,272

283736,What about patients with pain during and after the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has elevated mortality in severe and critical patients globally. This study examined the effect of glucocorticoids (GCS) on the time of virus clearance and absorption of lung lesions in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Severe and critical COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 7 to February 10, 2020 were analyzed. The generalized linear model was utilized to assess the effects of GCS therapy on the times of nucleic acid test turning negative and improved pulmonary imaging, respectively. RESULTS: Of 66 patients, 51 (77.3%) and 15 (22.7%) were severe and critical cases, respectively, and aged 62 ± 11 years. A total of 58 patients (87.9%) tested negative, and 56 (84.8%) showed improved lung imaging. Age, thrombocytopenia, CD8 + T cell count, course of GCS therapy, and total dose were correlated with the time of nucleic acid test turning negative (p < 0.05), and sex was correlated with the time of initial pulmonary imaging improvement (p < 0.05). The time of nucleic acid test turning negative in individuals with GCS therapy course &#8804; 10 days was shorter than that of the GCS therapy course > 10 days group (p=0.001). No statistical difference was found in the dose, course of GCS, and initial time of improved lung imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the dose of GCS and prolonging the course of treatment do not shorten the time of nucleic acid test turning negative or improved absorption of pulmonary lesions. Thus, the rational use of GCS is particularly important.","Xiong, L-Q; Jin, W; Hu, X-M; Ren, T-T; Cheng, C-H; Shaghaghi, M; Ghazi Sherbaf, F; Yu, Y; Yuan, L-H; Chen, J; Du, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,272

DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review looking at emergency referrals seen by the ophthalmology service between March 18 to April 17, 2020 (representing the COVID-19 period), and March 18 to April 17, 2019 (representing the pre-COVID-19 period). METHODS: Data gathered from referral records included patient demographics, timing and site of referral, and ophthalmic diagnosis. Referrals were categorized as urgent or nonurgent, with urgent indicating the need for ophthalmic assessment within 24 hours. RESULTS: The total number of referrals decreased by 54.2% in the COVID-19 period versus the pre-COVID-19 period. There was a similar bimodal age distribution in both periods, with fewer patients over 65 years of age presenting during the pandemic. Tertiary hospital referrals decreased by 62% in the pandemic period, while nontertiary emergency department referral trends varied and outpatient clinic referrals increased by 16%. Overall, there was a significant shift in the distribution of referral sites (pâ¯=â¯0.04). The proportion of urgent referrals increased by 14% during the pandemic; this was not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the timing of referrals or in the distribution of diagnostic segments. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology referral patterns in a Canadian context. Moving forward, it helps to guide resource allocation and public education on the importance of seeking necessary eye care.","Schlenker, Amanda; Tadrous, Carol; Ching, Geoffrey; Iovieno, Alfonso; Nathoo, Nawaaz; Liu, Tom; Yeung, Sonia N",Can. j. ophthalmol,,272

Informed implementation of government public health policies depends on accurate data on SARS-CoV-2 immunity at population scale. We hypothesized that detection of SARS-CoV-2 salivary antibodies could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity at population scale. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology that comprised 12 CoV antigens, mostly derived from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Saliva and sera collected from confirmed COVID-19 cases and from the pre-COVID-19 era were tested for IgG, IgA and IgM to the antigen panel. Matched saliva and serum IgG responses (n=28) were significantly correlated. The salivary anti-N IgG response resulted in highest sensitivity (100%), exhibiting a positive response in 24/24 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases sampled at >14 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), whereas the salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response yielded 100% specificity. Temporal kinetics of IgG in saliva were consistent with those observed in blood and indicated that most individuals seroconvert around 10 DPSO. Algorithms employing a combination of the IgG response to N and S antigens result in high diagnostic accuracy (100%) as early as 10 DPSO. These results support the use of saliva-based antibody testing as a non-invasive and scalable alternative to blood-based antibody testing.","Pisanic, Nora; Randad, Pranay R; Kruczynski, Kate; Manabe, Yukari C; Thomas, David L; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Betenbaugh, Michael J; Clarke, William A; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Caturegli, Patrizio P; Larman, H Benjamin; Detrick, Barbara; Fairley, Jessica K; Sherman, Amy C; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Granger, Douglas A; Granger, Steve W; Collins, Matthew H; Heaney, Christopher D",J. clin. microbiol,,272
284532,Considerations for Gut Microbiota and Probiotics in Patients with Diabetes amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic: a Narrative Review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected persons compared with symptomatic individuals based on a scoping review of available literature. DESIGN: Rapid scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from 1 January to 5 December 2020 using the LitCovid database and the Cochrane library. SETTING: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from presymptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: PCR result (PCR studies), the rate of infection (mathematical modelling studies) and secondary attack rate (contact tracing studies) - in each case from asymptomatic in comparison with symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: There are only a limited number of published studies that report estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. 12 studies were included after the screening process. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. PCR studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; however, the number of study subjects is generally limited. Two modelling studies estimate relative infectiousness to be 0.43 and 0.57, but both of these were more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. The results from contact tracing studies include estimates of relative infectiousness of 0, but with insufficient evidence to conclude that it is significantly different from 1. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of relative infectiousness highlighting the need for further investigation of this important parameter. It is not possible to provide any conclusive estimate of relative infectiousness, as the estimates from the reviewed studies varied between 0 and 1.","McEvoy, David; McAloon, Conor; Collins, Aine; Hunt, Kevin; Butler, Francis; Byrne, Andrew; Casey-Bryars, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Griffin, John; Lane, Elizabeth Ann; Wall, Patrick; More, Simon John",BMJ Open,,272

Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissivity has put many countries under lockdown. With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection-related independent variables to predict early containment. COVID-19 infection data across 42 countries are used. Logistic regression results show a positive significant relationship between healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies, and signs of early containment. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines are developed and show accuracies between 76.2% and 92.9% to predict early signs of infection containment. Other policies and the decisions taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.","Kasilingam, Dharun; Sathiya Prabhakaran, Sakthivel Puvaneswaran; Rajendran, Dinesh Kumar; Rajagopal, Varthini; Santhosh Kumar, Thangaraj; Soundararaj, Ajitha",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure. This atomistic model, which we present here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in our efforts to fight the spread of the virus.","Nguyen, Ngan; Strnad, Ondrej; Klein, Tobias; Luo, Deng; Alharbi, Ruwayda; Wonka, Peter; Maritan, Martina; Mindek, Peter; Autin, Ludovic; Goodsell, David S; Viola, Ivan",,,272

Ghana joined the international community by confirming first two COVID-19 cases on March 12, 2020. The study aimed to assess the public knowledge, risk perception and preparedness to respond the COVID-19 in the early stage of the outbreak in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect information from Ghanaian during the early stage of the outbreak from 12th to 20th March 2020. Electronic based questionnaire was developed to collected information on the public knowledge, risk perceptions and preparedness to respond the COVID-19. All people who were aged 18 years and over were invited to participate in the study. Results: A total of 350 participants were recruited into the analysis; 56% were males, with the majority of the study population aged between 18-30 years (61.4%), single (68.9%) and attained tertiary education (95.1%). Regarding COVID-19, 62.7% had ""good"" knowledge about the outbreak, 68.3% had a high risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection and 81.4% had a moderate preparedness skill to prevent and control the disease. Internet (77.1%) was the major sources of information. Knowledge of COVID-19 was significantly associated with education (p<0.001), age (p=0.018), employment (p=0.011) and health-related occupation (P=0.001) but only religion was associated with risk perception. Conclusion: Though overall public knowledge was good, disparity exist among the least educated population, there was high risk perceptions and moderate preparedness skill to respond to COVID-19 among our study population. We recommend that educational campaigns through timely online update on COVID-19, van mobilization and mass media broadcasting should target all groups including those in the rural communities.","Serwaa, Dorcas; Lamptey, Emmanuel; Appiah, Anthony Baffour; Senkyire, Ephraim Kumi; Ameyaw, Jude Kyeremeh",Pan Afr Med J,,272

Countries around the globe had a variable initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic from imposing massive lock downs and quarantine to surrendering to herd immunity. However, healthcare bodies worldwide recognized early on that a triumph against COVID-19 could only be achieved by maintaining the infrastructure of healthcare systems and their capacity to accommodate a potentially overwhelming increase in critical patient care needs. Therefore, they reacted by restricting medical care to emergency cases and postponing elective surgical procedures in all disciplines. The priority was made for treatment of COVID-19 patients and emergency cases. Nevertheless, the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. In the absence of vaccines or effective drug treatments, its timeline remains uncertain and it cannot be forecast how long healthcare systems will need to cope with it in managing inpatient and outpatient services. Accordingly, extreme measures and restriction may become a recipe for a disaster in the context of the potential adverse health implications imposed by delaying timely medical and surgical care. Therefore, restrictive measures should be substituted with a comprehensive surgical and medical care strategy. One that provides a safe balance between the prevention of COVID-19 and the delivery of essential surgical care.

287227,Impact Mitigation of COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric HIV Care,2021,"Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is limited and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile enough for 1 million people in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE against all infection, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Trent, Mallory",Vaccine,,272

From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers.","Abidin, Crystal; Lee, Jin; Barbetta, Tommaso; Miao, Wei Shan",Media Int.

287457,REPLY: Factors Other Than Climate Are Likely to Influence Alcohol Consumption,2020,"Objectives: To describe the implementation of a hybrid and an online active-learning-based science activity originally designed for face-to-face instruction. The goal was to verify if students used appropriate science practices while engaged in a problem solution through hybrid and fully online modalities. Epistemic practices are important markers of scientific literacy because they reflect ways of thinking and working that are similar to those performed by scientists. Methods: Numerical experimental data related to two topics of immunology were provided to students through virtual learning environments. The groups of students met on WhatsApp© mobile application to negotiate the construction reports containing graphs, discussion, and conclusion to the inquiry problem. Members of our research team coded and analyzed the reports for evidence of epistemic practices. The presence of epistemic practices in the students' writings is presented and discussed qualitatively in this paper. Results: Results show the emergence of epistemic practices in the written discourse of the students participating in online and hybrid modalities. Implication for theory and/or practice: Bringing examples from our experience teaching online and as pre-pandemic researchers allowed us to engage, inspire, and assist other teachers who are facing the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic presents to science education. Conclusions: Findings suggest that it is possible to promote student engagement in scientific practices related to biology through online and hybrid instruction. © The Author(s)","Natale, C.

287840,Lessons Learned Conducting Dialectical Behavior Therapy via Telehealth in the Age of COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to quickly and reliably prioritize clinically approved compounds for their potential effectiveness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19. We also found that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these network drugs rely on network-based mechanisms that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo drug development.","Morselli Gysi, Deisy; do Valle, Ítalo; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Ghiassian, Susan Dina; Patten, J J; Davey, Robert A; Loscalzo, Joseph; Barabási, Albert-László",Proc.

287841,Lessons Learned Conducting Dialectical Behavior Therapy via Telehealth in the Age of COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic demands the rapid identification of drug-repurpusing candidates. In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host-pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection, identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates. Here, we adapt the network-based toolset to COVID-19, recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system, and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies, relying on network proximity, diffusion, and AI-based metrics, allowing to rank all approved drugs based on their likely efficacy for COVID-19 patients, aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates. We validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently in clinical trials, and an expression-based validation of selected candidates suggests that these drugs, with known toxicities and side effects, could be moved to clinical trials rapidly.","Gysi, Deisy Morselli; Valle, 'Italo Do; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Sanchez, Helia; Baron, Rebecca Marlene; Ghiassian, Dina; Loscalzo, Joseph; Barab'asi, Albert-L'aszl'o",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07229v1.pdf,272

288074,COVID-19 and Cleft and Craniofacial Surgery in Indian Scenario,2021,"BACKGROUND: Care of the pregnant patient during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic presents many challenges, including creating parallel workflows for infected and noninfected patients, minimizing waste of materials, and ensuring that clinicians can seamlessly transition between types of anesthesia. The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS: The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize the risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS: We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience. Over time, we refined the workflows using a cyclical improvement system. We present our checklists and workflows as well as the system we used for their development, so that others may use them to their benefit.","Li, Yunping; Ciampa, Erin J; Zucco, Liana; Levy, Nadav; Colella, Meredith; Golen, Toni; Shainker, Scott A; Lunderberg, J Mark; Ramachandran, Satya Krishna; Hess, Philip E",Anesth Analg,,272

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted. The cohort consisted of adult patients (18 years of age and older) requiring ECMO in the period from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality after ECMO initiation assessed with a time to event analysis at 90 days. Multivariable Cox proportional regression was used to determine factors associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 292 patients from 17 centers comprised the study cohort. Patients were 49 (interquartile range, 39-57) years old and 81 (28%) were female. At the end of the follow-up period, 19 (6%) patients were still receiving ECMO, 25 (9%) were discontinued from ECMO but remained hospitalized, 135 (46%) were discharged or transferred alive, and 113 (39%) died during the hospitalization. The cumulative in-hospital mortality at 90 days was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-47%). Factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61 per 10 years), renal dysfunction measured according to serum creatinine level (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.45), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO placement (aHR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.01-3.46). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COVID-19 necessitating ECMO support, in-hospital mortality occurred in fewer than half of the cases.

We reasoned that a broadened temporal perspective may attenuate current mental distress and tested a letter-writing manipulation designed to connect people to their post-COVID-19 future selves. We conducted an online experiment with 738 Japanese participants recruited from two common survey platforms. They were randomly assigned to either send a letter to their future self (letter-to-future) condition, send a letter to present self from the perspective of future self (letter-from-future) condition, or a control condition. Participants in both letter-writing conditions showed immediate decrease in negative affect and increase in positive affect relative to the control condition. These effects were mediated by temporal distancing from the current situation. These findings suggest that taking a broader temporal perspective can be achieved by letter writing with a future self and may offer an effective means of regulating negative affect in a stressful present time such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chishima, Yuta; Huai-Ching Liu, I-Ting; E Wilson, Anne",Applied psychology.

METHODS: In the laboratory, Novaferon's inhibition of viral replication in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 entry into healthy cells was determined. Antiviral effects of Novaferon in COVID-19 patients with treatment of Novaferon, Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day six of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance. RESULTS: Novaferon inhibited viral replication (EC50=1.02ng/ml), and prevented viral infection (EC50=0.10ng/ml). Results from the 89 enrolled COVID-19 patients showed that both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups had significantly higher viral clearance rates on day six than Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (50.0% vs. 24.1%, p=0.0400, and 60.0% vs. 24.1%, p=0.0053). The median time to viral clearance was six days, six days, and nine days for three groups, respectively, a 3-day reduction in both the Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir/Ritonavir groups compared with the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group. CONCLUSIONS: Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro and in COVID-19 patients. These data justify further evaluation of Novaferon.

Results of an sexually transmitted infection clinic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is responsible for millions of infections worldwide, and a substantial number of these patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Our objective was to describe the characteristics, outcomes and management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a single designated pandemic centre in Montréal, Canada. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed on consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU at the Jewish General Hospital, a designated pandemic centre in Montréal, between Mar. 5 and May 21, 2020. Complete follow-up data corresponding to death or discharge from hospital health records were included to Aug. 4, 2020. We summarized baseline characteristics, management and outcomes, including mortality. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included in this study. Twenty-one patients (19.8%) died during their hospital stay, and the ICU mortality was 17.0% (18/106); all patients were discharged home or died, except for 4 patients (2 awaiting a rehabilitation bed and 2 awaiting long-term care). Twelve of 65 patients (18.5%) requiring mechanical ventilation died. Prone positioning was used in 29 patients (27.4%), including in 10 patients who were spontaneously breathing; no patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High-flow nasal cannula was used in 51 patients (48.1%). Acute kidney injury was the most common complication, seen in 20 patients (18.9%), and 12 patients (11.3%) required renal replacement therapy. A total of 53 patients (50.0%) received corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Our cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had lower mortality than that previously described in other jurisdictions.

Key aims of this analysis were to compare the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and mortality by sex and to explore whether variation in specific biomarkers could mediate this difference. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A survival analysis was conducted to compare time to the composite endpoint of IMV or death according to sex. Interaction was formally tested to compare the risk difference by sex in sub-populations. Mediation analysis with a binary endpoint IMV or death (yes/no) by day 28 of follow-up for a number of inflammation/coagulation biomarkers in the context of counterfactual prediction was also conducted. RESULTS: Among 415 patients, 134 were females (32%) and 281 males (67%), median age 66 years (IQR 54-77). At admission, females showed a significantly less severe clinical and respiratory profiles with a higher PaO2/FiO2 (254 mmHg vs. 191 mmHg; p 0.023). By 28 days from admission, 49.2% (95% CI 39.6-58.9%) of males vs. 31.7% (17.9-45.4%) of females underwent IMV or death (log-rank p < 0.0001) and this amounted to a difference in terms of HR of 0.40 (0.26-0.63, p 0.0001). The area under the curve in C-reactive protein (CRP) over the study period appeared to explain 85% of this difference in risk by sex. DISCUSSION: Our analysis confirms a difference in the risk of COVID-19 clinical progression by sex and provides a hypothesis for potential mechanisms leading to this.

Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to redefining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life.

294031,COVID-19 What are drugs and strategies now?,2021,"Widespread, convenient access to COVID-19 testing has been challenging in the United States. We make a case for provisioning COVID-19 tests through the United States Postal Service (USPS) facilities and demonstrate a simple method for selecting locations to improve access. We provide quantitative evidence that even a subset of USPS facilities could provide broad access, particularly in remote and at-risk communities with limited access to health care. Based on daily travel surveys, census data, locations of USPS facilities, and an established care-seeking model, we estimate that more than 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to an existing USPS facility if warranted. For half of the US population, this would require traveling less than 2.5 miles from home; for 90%, the distance would be less than 7 miles. In Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota, we estimate that testing at USPS facilities would provide access to an additional 4.1, 3.1, and 1.3 million people and reduce the median travel distance by 3.0, 0.8, and 1.2 miles, respectively, compared with existing testing sites per 28 July 2020. We also discuss the option of distributing test-at-home kits via USPS instead of private carriers. Finally, our proposal provides USPS an opportunity to increase revenues and expand its mission, thus improving its future prospects and relevance.","Singh, Bismark; Risanger, Simon; Morton, David; Pignone, Michael; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",Med Decis Making,,272
294272,Is Canada ready for the second wave of COVID-19?,2020,"The infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 leads lesions mainly observed at the respiratory tract level, but not exclusively. The analyses of these lesions benefited from different autopsy studies. Thus, these lesions were observed in different organs, tissues and cells. These observations allowed us to rapidly improve the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this emergent infectious disease. The virus can be detected in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology and/or electron microscopy approaches. However, many uncertainties are still present concerning the direct role of the SARS-CoV-2 on the different lesions observed in different organs, outside the lung, such as the heart, the brain, the liver, the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the skin. In this context, it is pivotal to keep going to increase the different tissue and cellular studies in the COVID-19 positive patients aiming to better understanding the consequences of this new infectious disease, notably considering different epidemiological and co-morbidities associated factors. This could participate to the development of new therapeutic strategies too. The purpose of this review is to describe the main histological and cellular lesions associated with the infection due to the SARS-CoV-2.","Hofman, Paul; Copin, Marie-Christine; Tauziede-Espariat, Arnault; Adle-Biassette, Homa; Fortarezza, Francesco; Passeron, Thierry; Salmon, Isabelle; Calabrese, Fiorella",Ann Pathol,,272
294671,Dermatologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience of a large academic center,2020,"Corticosteroids, anti-CD20 agents, immunotherapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapy are commonly used in the treatment of patients with cancer. It is unclear how these agents affect patients with cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N = 820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19 as well as level of respiratory support during corticosteroid administration. Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes prior to use of supplemental oxygen; no statistically significant difference was observed in sicker cohorts. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19. In the absence of prospective studies and evidence-based guidelines, our data may aid providers looking to assess the risks and benefits of these agents in caring for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era.","Jee, Justin; Stonestrom, Aaron J; Devlin, Sean; Nguyentran, Teresa; Wills, Beatriz; Narendra, Varun; Foote, Michael B; Lumish, Melissa; Vardhana, Santosha A; Pastores, Stephen M; Korde, Neha; Patel, Dhwani; Horwitz, Steven; Scordo, Michael; Daniyan, Anthony F",Sci Rep,,272

295872,Why COVID-19 is Less Severe in Pediatric Patients?,2020,"SIGNIFICANCE: This analysis and review demonstrate that, although emerging data indicate that the prevalence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the ocular surface and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) conjunctivitis is rare, the ocular surface remains of interest as a potential inoculation and transmission site for SARS-CoV-2. Continued safety precautions should be taken as more data become available.COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a novel, global pandemic that has infected millions and, up to this point, caused more than two million fatalities worldwide. The ocular surface has become of interest as a possible vector for transmission by acting as a direct inoculation site, being a conduit for the virus into the respiratory system or as a method of transmission from potentially infected conjunctiva or tears. The components necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to theoretically infect ocular tissues are present: binding receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cluster of differentiation 147) and mechanisms for cell entry (transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L). This meta-analysis of COVID-19 prevalence data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been infrequently found in conjunctival samples when tested with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This review estimates the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface and prevalence of conjunctivitis in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. There is much to be learned regarding ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Sopp, Nicole M; Sharda, Vandhana",Optom Vis Sci,,272

298311,Letter to Editor: Editorial: Postcards from War Zones-Personal Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that infects humans and a number of animal species causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a respiratory distress syndrome which has provoked a global pandemic and a serious health crisis in most countries across our planet. COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by IL-1, a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, until now, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than the vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations that the population is waiting for. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulate the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at the moment, the London government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK. It has been noted that the spreading rate of the British variant could be greater than 70% of cases compared to the normal SARS-CoV-2 virus, with an R index growth of 0.4. Recent studies suggest that coronavirus-19 variation occurs at the level N501Y of the spike protein and involves 23 separate mutations on the spike, 17 of which are linked to the virus proteins, thus giving specific characteristics to the virus. In general, coronaviruses undergo many mutations that are often not decisive for their biological behavior and does not significantly alter the structure and the components of the virus. This phenomenon also occurs in SARS-CoV-2. It is highly probable that the variants recently described in the UK will not hinder vaccine-induced immunity. In fact, the variant will not break the vaccine although it may have some chance of making it a little less effective. Therefore, it is pertinent to think that the vaccine will work against the SARS-CoV-2 variant as well. In today's pandemic, the D614G mutation of the amino acid of corronavirus-19, which emerged in Europe in February 2020 is the most frequent form and causes high viral growth. The previously infrequent D614G mutation is now globally dominant. This variant, which is being tested by many international laboratories, is rapidly spreading across the countries and a series of vaccinated subjects are testing to see if their antibodies can neutralize the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. This variant has a very high viral growth and is less detectable with the RT-PCR technique in the laboratory. It has been reported that the British variant that increases viral load does not cause more severe effects in the respiratory tract and lung disease, therefore, it is certain that the variant is growing rapidly and must be kept under control; for this reason, laboratory data is expected impatiently. The study on the many variants that coronavirus-19 presents is very interesting and complete and clearer data on this topic will be ready in the near future. In addition, it is still unclear whether the different variants discovered in many countries, including Africa, share the same spike protein mutation and therefore, this is another study to elaborate on. In order to be certain and to not have unexpected surprises, we need to reduce the spread and the transmission speed of viral variants that could appear around the world, creating new pandemics. For this reason, the scientific community is on the alert since laboratory tests on serum antibodies from COVID-19 survivors have been reported to be less effective in attacking the variant. In light of the above, the scientific community must be on the alert as larger variants of the spike protein could escape vaccine-induced antibodies, which for now are of great help to the community and can save millions of lives. Deepening the study of spike protein mutations will help to better understand how to combat coronavirus-19 and its variants.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Tetè, G; Pregliasco, F; Ronconi, G",J. biol. regul. homeost. agents,,272

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is a lack of proven effective treatments or cures for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-Î³, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities. In summary, this study provides a powerful, computational vaccine design platform for rapid development of vaccine candidates (including COVCCF) for effective prevention of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Governments, however, limit their expenditures not to increase the public debt. There is, however, the possibility that central banks buy new securities from the Treasury to finance such exceptional spending. Considering several economic constraints that policymakers face, this policy will not conflict with the inflation constraint. Money is an endogenous variable that does not cause but just validates a going inflation. It conflicts partially with the fiscal constraint, but avoids the increase in the public debt. And, in this case, it does not have the bad consequences of fiscal indiscipline—excess demand that, successively, causes increases in imports and current account deficits that appreciate the national currency, accelerate inflation, and lead to currency crises. Monetary financing of the COVID-19 will not cause any of these three evils.","Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos",Forum Soc. Econ.,,272

Unlike these vasculitis types, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia can develop cutaneous vasculitis-like lesions and systemic arterial and venous thromboemboli, including cryptogenic strokes and other vasculopathy features. Proposed underlying mechanisms for these severe manifestations have encompassed immune dysregulation, including an anti-phospholipid syndrome-like state, complement activation, viral dissemination with direct systemic endothelial infection, viral RNAaemia with immunothrombosis, clotting pathway activation mediated by hypoxaemia, and immobility. In this Viewpoint, we highlight how imaging and post-mortem findings from patients with COVID-19 indicate a novel thrombosis in the pulmonary venous territory distal to the alveolar capillary bed, a territory that normally acts as a clot filtration system, which might represent an unappreciated nidus for systemic microembolism. Additionally, we suggest that this mechanism represents a novel vasculitis mimic related to COVID-19 that might lead to cryptogenic strokes across multivessel territories, acute kidney injury with haematuria, a skin vasculitis mimic, intestinal ischaemia, and other organ ischaemic manifestations. This finding is supported by pathological reports of extensive pulmonary venular thrombosis and peripheral organ thrombosis with pauci-immune cellular infiltrates. Therefore, severe COVID-19 pneumonia with extensive pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy might help to explain the numerous systemic complications of COVID-19, in which the demonstration of direct organ infection has not adequately explained the pathology.","McGonagle, Dennis; Bridgewood, Charlie; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Meaney, James F M; Watad, Abdulla",,,272

Several shortcomings in the existing infectious disease management system were exposed during the pandemic, which hindered the control of the disease globally. To cope with this issue, we propose a window-period framework to reveal the general rule of the progression of management of infectious diseases and to help with decision making at the early stage of epidemics with a focus on healthcare provisions. METHODS: The framework has two significant periods (dark-window period and bright-window period). Outbreak of COVID-19 in China was used as an example for the application of the framework. RESULTS: The framework could reflect the progression of the epidemic objectively. The spread increased slowly in the dark-window period, but rocketed up in the bright-window period. The beginning of the bright-window period was the time when healthcare personnel were exposed to a substantially high risk of nosocomial infection. Additionally, proper and prompt preventive actions during the dark-window and bright-window periods were substantially important to reduce the future spreading of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: It was recommended that when possible healthcare provisions should upgrade to the highest level of alert for the control of an unknown epidemic in the dark-window period, while countermeasures in the bright-window period could be accordingly adjusted with full exploration and considerations. The framework may provide some insights into how to accelerate the control of future epidemics promptly and effectively.","Li, Ziyi; Li, Cheng; Wu, Xinyin; Li, Guanming; Li, Guowei; Tian, Junzhang",Int J Clin Pract,,272
301866,Association between telehealth use and general practitioner characteristics during COVID-19: findings from a nationally representative survey of Australian doctors,2021,"Objectives: About 15% of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients require ICU admission, and most (80%) of these require invasive mechanical ventilation. Lung-protective ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure may result in severe respiratory acidosis without significant hypoxemia. Low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal can facilitate lung-protective ventilation and avoid the adverse effects of severe respiratory acidosis. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal Co2 removal using the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System in correcting severe respiratory acidosis in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated with severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis and treated with low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal. Setting: Eight tertiary ICUs in the United States. Patients: Adult patients supported with the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System from March 1, to September 30, 2020. Interventions: Extracorporeal Co2 removal with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System under a Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was improvement in pH and Paco2 from baseline. Secondary outcomes included survival to decannulation, mortality, time on ventilator, and adverse events. Thirty-one patients were treated with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System with significant improvement in pH and Pco2 in this cohort. Two patients experienced complications that prevented treatment. Of the 29 treated patients, 58% survived to 48 hours post treatment and 38% to hospital discharge. No difference in age or comorbidities were noted between survivors and nonsurvivors. There was significant improvement in pH (7.24 ± 0.12 to 7.35 ± 0.07; p < 0.0001) and Paco2 (79 ± 23 to 58 ± 14; p < 0.0001) from baseline to 24 hours. Conclusions: In this retrospective case series of 29 patients, we have demonstrated efficacy of extracorporeal Co2 removal using the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System to improve respiratory acidosis in patients with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019.","Akkanti, Bindu; Jagpal, Sugeet; Darwish, Ribal; Saavedra Romero, Ramiro; Scott, L Keith; Dinh, Kha; Hussain, Sabiha; Radbel, Jared; Saad, Mohamed A; Enfield, Kyle B; Conrad, Steven A",Crit Care Explor,,272

The anti-infection behavior is incorporated into a classical epidemiological SIR model, by considering the behavior adoption rate across the population as an additional variable. We consider also the effects on the adoption rate produced by the disease evolution, using a dynamic payoff function and an additional differential equation. The equilibrium states of the proposed model have remarkable characteristics: possible coexistence of two locally stable endemic equilibria, the coexistence of locally stable endemic and disease-free equilibria, and even the possibility of a stable continuum of endemic equilibrium points. We show how some of the results obtained may be used to support strategic planning leading to effective control of the disease in the long-term.","B'aez-S'anchez, Andr'es David; Bobko, Nara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04581v1.pdf,272

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical scoring is built using Least Absolute Shrinkages and Selection Operator logistic regression. The prediction algorithm was constructed and cross-validated using the development cohort of 313 COVID-19 patients and was validated using independent retrospective set of 64 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Majority of patients are Omani in nationality (n=181, 58%). Multivariate logistic regression identified 8 independent predictors of ICU admission that were included in the clinical score: hospitalization (OR, 1.079; 95% CI, 1.058 - 1.100), absolute lymphocyte count (OR, 0.526; 95%CI, 0.379- 0.729), C-reactive protein (OR, 1.009; 95%CI, 1.006-1.011), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.0008; 95%CI, 1.0004-1.0012), CURB-65 score (OR, 2.666; 95%CI, 2.212-3.213), chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 70 (OR, 0.249; 95%CI, 0.155-0.402), shortness of breath (OR, 3.494; 95%CI, 2.528-6.168), and bilateral infiltrates in chest radiography (OR, 6.335; 95%CI, 3.427-11.713).

303549,A Surge in Methanol Poisoning Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Why Is This Occurring?,2020,"The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to rapid and profound changes in healthcare system delivery and society more broadly. Older adults, and those living with chronic or life-limiting conditions, are at increased risk of experiencing severe or critical symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection and are more likely to die. They may also experience non-COVID-19 related deterioration in their health status during this period. Advance care planning (ACP) is critical for this cohort, yet there is no coordinated strategy for increasing the low rates of ACP uptake in these groups, or more broadly. This paper outlines a number of key reasons why ACP is an urgent priority, and should form a part of the health system's COVID-19 response strategy. These include reducing the need for rationing, planning for surges in healthcare demand, respecting human rights, enabling proactive care coordination and leveraging societal change. We conclude with key recommendations for policy and practice in the system-wide implementation of ACP, to enable a more ethical, coordinated and person-centred response in the COVID-19 context.","Sinclair, Craig; Nolte, Linda; White, Ben P; M Detering, Karen",Intern Med J,,272

305242,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a cohort of ALS patients in Catalonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with high intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records. RESULTS: Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female. At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home. INTERPRETATION: In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies. These data suggest that the prognosis associated with critical illness due to COVID-19 may not be as poor as previously reported.","Mitra, Anish R; Fergusson, Nicholas A; Lloyd-Smith, Elisa; Wormsbecker, Andrew; Foster, Denise; Karpov, Andrei; Crowe, Sarah; Haljan, Greg; Chittock, Dean R; Kanji, Hussein D; Sekhon, Mypinder S; Griesdale, Donald E G",CMAJ,,272
305797,Clinical and Molecular Disorders Caused by COVID-19 During Pregnancy as a Potential Risk for Enamel Defects,2021,"The high mortality rate from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in humans and the lack of effective therapeutic regime for its treatment necessitates the identification of new antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 relies on non-structural proteins such as Nsp13 helicase and nsp14 which are the key components of the replication-transcription complex (RTC) to complete its infectious life cycle. Therefore, targeting these essential viral proteins with small molecules will most likely to halt the disease pathogenesis. The lack of experimental structures of these proteins deters the process of structure-based identification of their specific inhibitors. In the present study, the in silico models of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase and nsp14 protein were elucidated using a comparative homology modelling approach. These in silico model structures were validated using various parameters such as Ramachandran plot, Verify 3D score, ERRAT score, knowledge-based energy and Z-score. The in silico models were further used for virtual screening of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral drugs. Simeprevir (SMV), Paritaprevir (PTV) and Grazoprevir (GZR) were the common leads identified which show higher binding affinity to both nsp13 helicase and nsp14 as compared to the control inhibitors and therefore, they might be potential dual-target inhibitors. The leads also establish a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the key residues lining the active site pockets. The present findings suggest that these FDA approved antiviral drugs can be subjected to repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 infection after verifying the in silico results through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur",Gene Rep,,272

This article reviews the state-of-the-art in medical ultrasound image computing and in particular its application in the examination of the lungs. First, we review the current developments in medical ultrasound technology. We then focus on the characteristics of lung ultrasonography and on its ability to diagnose a variety of diseases through the identification of various artefacts. We review medical ultrasound image processing methods by splitting them into two categories: (1) traditional model-based methods, and (2) data driven methods. For the former, we consider inverse problem based methods by focusing in particular on ultrasound image despeckling, deconvolution, and line artefacts detection. Among the data-driven approaches, we discuss various works based on deep/machine learning, which include various effective network architectures implementing supervised, weakly supervised and unsupervised learning.","Yang, Tianqi; Karakucs, Oktay; Anantrasirichai, Nantheera; Achim, Alin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11366v2.pdf,272

Recently, several papers have reported ataxia-myoclonus syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to present our two cases and compare them to previously reported cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present two video-accompanied new cases with ataxia-myoclonus syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the studies published so far. RESULTS: Ataxia-myoclonus syndrome, isolated myoclonus, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome as post-COVID-19 syndrome following infection have been described in 16 patients (including our two cases). Patients have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and/or steroids except for 4 patients, which resulted in a significant improvement within 1-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The increasing number of patients with a similar symptomatology shows a significant relationship between COVID-19 infection and ataxia-myoclonus syndrome. The subacute onset of neurological symptoms after a resolved COVID-19 infection and prominent response to immunotherapy may suggest that the neurological manifestations are immune-mediated. Although recovery is highly possible, it may take several weeks/months, and clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis and the beneficial effects of immunological treatment administered as soon as possible.","Przytula, Filip; Bladek, Szymon; Slawek, Jaroslaw",Neurol Neurochir Pol,,272

307642,Immune system and COVID-19 by sex differences and age,2021,"OBJECTIVES: SARS-Cov-2 virus preferentially binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on alveolar epithelial type II cells, initiating an inflammatory response and tissue damage which may impair surfactant synthesis contributing to alveolar collapse, worsening hypoxia and leading to respiratory failure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of nebulised surfactant in COVID-19 adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a dose-escalating randomized open-label clinical trial of 20 COVID-19 patients. PARTICIPANTS: This study is conducted in two centres: University Hospital Southampton and University College London Hospitals. Eligible participants are aged &#8805;18, hospitalised with COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR), who require endotracheal intubation and are enrolled within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. For patients unable to consent, assent is obtained from a personal legal representative (PerLR) or professional legal representative (ProfLR) prior to enrolment. The following are exclusion criteria: imminent expected death within 24 hours; specific contraindications to surfactant administration (e.g. known allergy, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage); known or suspected pregnancy; stage 4 chronic kidney disease or requiring dialysis (i.e., eGFR < 30); liver failure (Child-Pugh Class C); anticipated transfer to another hospital, which is not a study site, within 72 hours; current or recent (within 1 month) participation in another study that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent enrollment for safety reasons; and declined consent or assent. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: The study is based on an investigational drug/device combination product. The surfactant product is Bovactant (Alveofact®), a natural animal derived (bovine) lung surfactant formulated as a lyophilized powder in 108 mg vials and reconstituted to 45 mg/mL in buffer supplied in a prefilled syringe. It is isolated by lung lavage and, by weight, is a mixture of: phospholipid (75% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 3% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1% phosphatidylinositol and 1% sphingomyelin), 5% cholesterol, 1% lipid-soluble surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B and SP-C), very low levels of free fatty acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, water and 0.3% calcium. The Drug Delivery Device is the AeroFact-COVID&#8482; nebulizer, an investigational device based on the Aerogen® Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. The timing and escalation dosing plans for the surfactant are as follows. Cohort 1: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 2: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours and 8 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at a dosing time of 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 3: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at a dosing time of 0 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at dosing times of 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 4: Three patients will receive 30 (3240 mg) vials each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. The trial steering committee, advised by the data monitoring committee, will review trial progression and dose escalation/maintenance/reduction after each cohort is completed (48-hour primary outcome timepoint reached) based on available feasibility, adverse event, safety and efficacy data. The trial will not be discontinued on the basis of lack of efficacy. The trial may be stopped early on the basis of safety or feasibility concerns. Comparator: No placebo intervention. All participants will receive usual standard of care in accordance with the local policies for mechanically ventilated patients and all other treatments will be left to the discretion of the attending physician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The co-primary outcome is the improvement in oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and pulmonary ventilation (Ventilation Index (VI), where VI = [RR x (PIP - PEEP) × PaCO2]/1000) at 48 hours after study initiation. The secondary outcomes include frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), Adverse Device Effects (ADEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device Events (SADEs), change in pulmonary compliance, change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirement of ventilatory support at 24 and 48 hours after study initiation, clinical improvement defined by time to one improvement point on the ordinal scale described in the WHO master protocol (2020) recorded while hospitalised, days of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilator free days (VFD) at day 21, length of intensive care unit stay, number of days hospitalised and mortality at day 28. Exploratory end points will include quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from tracheal aspirates using PCR, surfactant dynamics (synthesis and turnover) and function (surface tension reduction) from deep tracheal aspirate samples (DTAS), surfactant phospholipid concentrations in plasma and DTAS, inflammatory markers (cellular and cytokine) in plasma and DTAS, and blood oxidative stress markers. RANDOMISATION: After informed assent, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be randomised to 3:2 for the treatment and control arms using an internet-based block randomization service (ALEA tool for clinical trials, FormsVision BV) in combination with electronic data collection. Randomisation will be done by the recruiting centre with a unique subject identifier specific to that centre. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-labelled unblinded study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The total sample size is 20 COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients (12 intervention; 8 control).

308394,Work stress among Chinese nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"In response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the French government has imposed drastic lockdown measures for a period of 55 days. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery.","Malliet, Paul; Reynès, Frédéric; Landa, Gissela; Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Saussay, Aurélien",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,272

Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential. METHODS: We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wang, Xiong; Tan, Li; Wang, Xu; Liu, Weiyong; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",Int J Infect Dis,,272

We aimed to demonstrate how we proceeded with bronchoscopic procedures without published guidelines at the inception of the pandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All bronchoscopic procedures applied from the first case seen in Turkey (11 March-15 May) were evaluated retrospectively. Patient data on indications, diagnosis, types of procedures, and the results of COVID-19 tests were recorded. RESULTS: This study included 126 patients; 36 required interventional bronchoscopic techniques (28.6%), 74 required endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS; 58.7%), and 16 required flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (12.7%). All interventional rigid bronchoscopic techniques were performed for emergent indications: malignant airway obstruction (66.7%), tracheal stenosis (25%), and bronchopleural fistula (8.3%). Malignancy was diagnosed in 59 (79.7%), 12 (50%), and 4 (25%) patients who underwent EBUS, interventional procedures, and fibreoptic bronchoscopy, respectively. All personnel wore personal protective equipment and patients wore a surgical mask, cap, and disposable gown. Of the patients, 31 (24.6%) were tested for COVID-19 and all the results were negative. COVID-19 was not detected in any of the patients after a 14-day follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This study was based on our experiences and demonstrated that EBUS and/or bronchoscopy should not be postponed in patients with known or suspected lung cancer.","Ozturk, Ayperi; Sener, Melahat U; Yilmaz, Aydin",J. surg. oncol,,272

This study aimed to evaluate Cepheid Xpert® HCV Viral Load performance in comparison with the Roche Cobas® TaqMan® HCV Test using serum samples of HCV-infected patients in Indonesia. Viral load quantification was performed on 243 anti-HCV positive patients' samples using both Xpert HCV VL and Roche HCV tests, followed by HCV genotyping by reverse hybridization. Strength of the relationship between the assays was measured by Pearson correlation coefficient, while level of agreement was analyzed by Deming regression and Bland-Altman plot analysis using log10-transformed viral load values. Quantifiable viral load was detected in 180/243 (74.1%), with Xpert HCV VL sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 0.98, 1.00) and specificity of 98.4% (95% CI 0.91, 0.99) based on Roche HCV tests, while HCV genotypes were determined in 172/180 (95.6%) samples. There was a good correlation between both assays (r = 0.97, P < 0.001), overall and per genotype, with good concordance by Deming regression and a mean difference of -0.25 log10 IU/mL (95% CI -0.33, -0.18) by Bland-Altman plot analysis. Xpert HCV VL test was demonstrated as a POC platform with good performance for HCV diagnosis and treatment decision that would be beneficial for decentralized service in resource-limited areas. HCV testing sites, alongside additional GeneXpert modular systems distributed toward the fight against COVID-19, could ensure some continuity, once this pandemic is controlled.","Thedja, Meta Dewi; Wibowo, Dhita Prabasari; El-Khobar, Korri Elvanita; Ie, Susan Irawati; Setiawan, Lyana; Murti, Ignatia Sinta; Muljono, David Handojo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,272

METHODS: The population migration was embedded in the SEIR model to simulate and analyze the effects of the amount of population inflow on the number of confirmed cases. Based on numerical simulations, this study used statistical data for the empirical validation of its theoretical deductions and discussed how to improve the effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control considering population migration variables. Statistics regarding the numbers of infected people in various provinces were obtained from the epidemic-related data reported by China's National Health Commission. RESULTS: This study explored how the epidemic should be prevented and controlled from the perspective of population migration variables. It found that the combination of a susceptible population, an infected population, and transmission media were important routes affecting the number of infections and that the migration of a Hubei-related infected population played a key role in promoting epidemic spread. Epidemic prevention and control should focus on regions with better economic conditions than the epidemic region. Prevention and control efforts should focus on the more populated neighboring provinces having convenient transportation links with the epidemic region. To prevent and control epidemic spread, priority should be given to elucidating the destinations and directions of population migration from the domestic origin of infections, and then controlling population migration or human-to-human contact after such migration. CONCLUSIONS: This study enriched and expanded on simulations of the effects of population migration on the COVID-19 epidemic and China-based empirical studies while offering an epidemic evaluation and warning mechanism to prevent and control similar public health emergencies in the future.","Hu, Zhen; Wu, Yuanyang; Su, Mohan; Xie, Lin; Zhang, Anqi; Lin, Xueyu; Nie, Yafeng",BMC Public Health,,272

Regardless of the positive effects of handwashing with soap, developing countries still have a low rate of handwashing. Objective: The study aimed to determine the individual, household and community-level factors associated with handwashing behavior among households in Eswatini. Methods: Using the Eswatini Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey conducted in 2014, a secondary analysis was done of the households surveyed. A total of 1,520 households nested in communities with complete data on handwashing practices were included in the analysis. Univariate, bivariate analysis and multivariate multilevel logistic regression were used to establish the factors that were associated with handwashing behavior. Results: The prevalence of handwashing among households was 56% in 2014. Households whose heads were aged 35-54 and 55 years and older were more likely to practice handwashing (AOR=1.88, 95% CI:1.39, 2.54); and (AOR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.205, 2.62) compared to those aged 15-34 years. Households with a pit latrine or no toilet facility at all, were less likely to practice handwashing (AOR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.35); (AOR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.71) respectively compared to those with a flush toilet. Region of residence was a community-level variable associated with lower odds of handwashing, with those from the Hhohho (AOR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.35) and Manzini region (AOR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.67) compared to Lubombo region. Households from communities where access to mass media was high were more likely to practice handwashing (AOR =1.47, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.03) compared to those from communities where access to mass media was low. Conclusion: Households headed by young adults, with pit latrine or no toilet facility at all and lived in the Hhohho and Manzini regions and with low access to mass media, should be targeted for interventions aimed at improving handwashing practices.","Simelane, Maswati S",Afr Health Sci,,272

312851,Special Edition: COVID-19 Guest Editorial,2020,"This paper investigates the dynamic tail dependence risk between BRICS economies and the world energy market, in the context of the COVID-19 financial crisis of 2020, in order to determine optimal investment decisions based on risk metrics. For this purpose, we employ a combination of novel statistical techniques, including Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Markov-switching GJR-GARCH, and vine copula methods. Using a data set consisting of daily stock and world crude oil prices, we find evidence of a structure break in the volatility process, consisting of high and low persistence volatility processes, with a high persistence in the probabilities of transition between lower and higher volatility regimes, as well as the presence of leverage effects. Furthermore, our results based on the C-vine copula confirm the existence of two types of tail dependence: symmetric tail dependence between South Africa and China, South Africa and Russia, and South Africa and India, and asymmetric lower tail dependence between South Africa and Brazil, and South Africa and crude oil. For the purpose of diversification in these markets, we formulate an asset allocation problem using raw returns, MS GARCH returns, and C-vine and R-vine copula-based returns, and optimize it using a Particle Swarm optimization algorithm with a rebalancing strategy. The results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the risk contribution and asset allocation of South Africa and the crude oil market, supporting the existence of a lower tail dependence between them. This suggests that, when South African stocks are in distress, investors tend to shift their holdings in the oil market. Similar results are found between Russia and crude oil, as well as Brazil and crude oil. In the symmetric tail, South African asset allocation is found to have a well-diversified relationship with that of China, Russia, and India, suggesting that these three markets might be good investment destinations when things are not good in South Africa, and vice versa. © 2021 by the authors.

There remains a need to improve wastewater RNA extraction methods' sensitivity, speed, and reduce reliance on often expensive commercial reagents to make wastewater-based epidemiology more accessible. We present a kit-free wastewater RNA extraction method, titled ""Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2"" (4S), that employs the abundant and affordable reagents sodium chloride (NaCl), ethanol, and silica RNA capture matrices to recover sixfold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater than an existing ultrafiltration-based method. The 4S method concurrently recovered pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human 18S ribosomal subunit rRNA, which have been proposed as fecal concentration controls. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in three sewersheds corresponded to the relative prevalence of COVID-19 infection determined via clinical testing. Lastly, controlled experiments indicate that the 4S method prevented RNA degradation during storage of wastewater samples, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and in our experience, 20 samples can be processed by one lab technician in approximately 2 h. Overall, the 4S method is promising for effective, economical, and accessible wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2, providing another tool to fight the global pandemic.","Whitney, Oscar N; Kennedy, Lauren C; Fan, Vinson B; Hinkle, Adrian; Kantor, Rose; Greenwald, Hannah; Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Chaplin, Mira; Maurer, Anna C; Tjian, Robert; Nelson, Kara L",Environ Sci Technol,,272

Furthermore, the occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, headache, and seizures are frequently stated in patients with COVID-19. One of the reported neurological complications of severe COVID-19 is the demolition of the myelin sheath. Indeed, the complex immunological dysfunction provides a substrate for the development of demyelination. Nevertheless, few published reports in the literature describe demyelination in subjects with COVID-19.

ANSI/ASHRAE/ASHE Standard 170-2008 recommendations are followed for hospital applications, to facilitate effective ventilation. These negative pressure rooms prevent the spread of the contaminated particles to the surroundings and by creating a negative pressure in the room whenever the door is opened the atmospheric air is sucked in and not the one which is present inside the room. The Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the diffusion of airbone virus inside a negative pressure room with mixed mode ventilation system.

Androgen deprivation therapy, the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment, has been associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Emerging data supports decreased cardiovascular risk of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared to agonists. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the relative safety of different modalities of androgen deprivation therapy. Racial disparities in cardiovascular outcomes in prostate cancer patients are starting to be explored. An intriguing inquiry connects androgen deprivation therapy with reduced risk of COVID-19 infection susceptibility and severity. Recognition of the cardiotoxicity of androgen deprivation therapy and aggressive risk factor modification are crucial for optimal patient care.","Challa, Azariyas A; Calaway, Adam Christopher; Cullen, Jennifer; Garcia, Jorge; Desai, Nihar; Weintraub, Neal L; Deswal, Anita; Kutty, Shelby; Vallakati, Ajay; Addison, Daniel; Baliga, Ragavendra; Campbell, Courtney M; Guha, Avirup",Curr Treat Options Oncol,,272

As of April 27, 2020, provinces and territories provided the Public Health Agency of Canada with detailed information on 24,079 cases, of which 3.9% (n=938) were younger than 20 years of age. The detection rate per 100,000 population was lower in this age group (11.9 per 100,000), compared with those aged 20-59 years (72.4 per 100,000) and 60 and older (113.6 per 100,000). The median age among those younger than 20 years of age was 13 years, and cases were distributed equally across male and female genders. Among provinces and territories with more than 100 cases, 1.6% to 9.8% of cases were younger than 20 years of age. Cases in this age group were more likely to be asymptomatic: 10.7% compared with 2.4% in those aged 20-59 years and 4.1% in those aged 60 and older. Children and youth experienced severe outcomes less often, but 2.2% (n=15/672) of cases within this age group were severe enough to require hospitalization. Based on available exposure information, 11.3% (n=59/520) of cases aged younger than 20 years had no known contact with a case.

Such a curve collapse is much less convincing when normalizing by the total population. Sweden, with its no-lockdown, light-touch approach, is the only outlier that deviates considerably from the average behavior.

318605,Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers: Emergency Use of the Prismaflex HF20 Set During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The Novel Coronavirus19 (COVID19) arrived in northern New Jersey (NJ) in early March 2020, peaked at the beginning of April, and then declined. Starting in March, some patients who called 911 and required advanced life support (ALS) may have decompensated more rapidly than would have been expected, possibly because of concomitant COVID19 infection and/or delays in seeking medical care because of fear of exposure to the virus, and social isolation. In this study, our goal was to determine if there was an increase in prehospital ALS pronouncements and a decrease in ED visits for potentially serious conditions such as MI and stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ. METHODS STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of prehospital patients pronounced dead by paramedics and patients with MI and stroke in the EDs of receiving hospitals of these paramedics. Study Setting and Population: Ten ground ALS units in northern NJ and nine receiving hospital EDs. Each ALS unit is staffed by two NJ-certified mobile intensive care paramedics and respond with a paramedic flycar in a two-tiered dispatch system. DATA ANALYSIS: We identified prehospital pronouncements using the EMSCharts electronic record (Zoll Medical, Chelmsford, Massachusetts). We tabulated the number of pronouncements by week from January 1 to June 30 in 2019 and 2020. We tabulated the combined total number of pronouncements and ED visits by month along with visits for MI and stroke and calculated the changes during the same timeframe. We used Chi-square to test for statistical significance for the monthly changes from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: For January through June in 2019 and 2020, there were 12,210 and 13,200 ALS dispatches, and 366 and 555 prehospital pronouncements, respectively. In 2020, pronouncements rose from a weekly baseline of 13 in early March, reached a peak of 45 at the beginning of April, then returned to the baseline level by the end of May. April 2020, the month with the most pronouncements, had 183% more pronouncements than April 2019 but total ED visits and visits for MI and stroke were 49%, 46% and 42% less, respectively (p < 0.0001 for each of these changes). CONCLUSION: Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ, we found pre-hospital ALS death pronouncements increased and ED visits for MI and stroke decreased. Although we have speculated about the reasons for these findings, further studies are needed to determine what the actual causes were.","Jain, Nikhil; Berkenbush, Michael; Feldman, David C; Eskin, Barnet; Allegra, John R",Am J Emerg Med,,272

Even if huge efforts to control the pandemic have been done, the viral spread is still continuing. COVID-19 is reported as a zoonosis jumped from bats and pangolins to humans. After infection in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is found in the nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions. The virus has also been detected in the blood plasma of infected patients. The viral spread occurs through droplets exhaled from the nose and mouth of the infected people when they breath or talk, or through droplets propelled as a dense cloud by chough or sneeze. The virus can also be delivered as an aerosol from blood plasma, through surgical procedures. Following these ways, the virus can disperse in the air, then reaching and settling on the exposed surfaces. How long the virus will survive on a surface depends on the material the surface is made from. Infection via high-touch surfaces should be prevented. Copper alloy coatings, combined with efficient hygienic/disinfectant procedures and careful surgical practice, could be helpful to health protection in dental practice and can also be adopted in orthopedic traumatology.","Poggio, Claudio; Colombo, Marco; Arciola, Carla Renata; Greggi, Tiziana; Scribante, Andrea; Dagna, Alberto",,,272
319280,Lessons in Public (Mis)communication about the Laboratory from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy, such as leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds, and cavernomas. Cystlike lesions have been rarely described and characterized in the literature. We aimed to characterize cystlike lesions, their risk factors, and association with other late adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children treated for brain tumors during a 30-year period (n = 139) were included. We documented imaging findings, focusing on cystlike lesion development and its relationship with clinical history and other imaging findings. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: Cystlike lesions developed in 16.5% of patients treated with radiotherapy, with a median of 2 years until the development of the first lesion. For every 4-year age increase, there were 50% decreased odds of developing lesions and a 50% decrease in the average count of lesions. Females demonstrated a 4.00 rate ratio of developing a higher number of lesions. Patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy had 3.20 increased odds of developing cystlike lesions compared with patients with radiation therapy alone. A larger proportion of patients treated with methotrexate (25%) developed cystlike lesions, but this was not statistically significant. Cystlike lesions tended to develop in cerebral locations where leukoencephalopathy was worse. A strong relationship was found between the development of cystlike lesions and leukoencephalopathy severity. CONCLUSIONS: Cystlike lesions are frequent and under-reported late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy in children. Younger age, chemoradiotherapy, and the severity of leukoencephalopathy represent risk factors for the development of cystlike lesions.","Veiga, M G D; Fragata, I; Passos, J; Alves, M; Papoila, A L; Salgado, D",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,272

320734,Physician deaths from COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To highlight the current challenges in diagnosis and clinical care of pediatric rheumatic disease and barriers to research and education of pediatric rheumatologists worldwide. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies and reports demonstrate a paucity of studies on epidemiology, outcomes, and management guidelines from many regions of the world. There have been noteworthy efforts to bridge the gap in under resourced areas. An analysis of the global burden of rheumatic disease has demonstrated that while understudied, musculoskeletal diseases are prevalent and increasingly contribute to loss of years of healthy life. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two milestone publications in global pediatric rheumatology have recently been published. An international study evaluated the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and demonstrated global diversity in both clinical manifestations and outcomes. Notably, the first guidelines for managing pediatric rheumatic disease in a less resourced setting have been published for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This document offers the first publication targeted to address challenges faced by pediatric rheumatology caregivers in low-resourced settings. These documents serve as exemplars for international collaboration in pediatric rheumatology and can be used as models for other pediatric rheumatic disease research. Other efforts are making progress in various arenas towards increasing access to care, education, and training in pediatric rheumatology. SUMMARY: The global burden of rheumatic disease in the pediatric population is poorly understood but unrecognized disease greatly impacts the overall morbidity and mortality in this population. More studies in lesser resourced regions are needed to prioritize access to pediatric rheumatology care and prioritize a further increase in research capacity and education moving forward.","Lewandowski, Laura B",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,272

Difficulties to overcome such issues have caused several deaths among newborns. Therefore, studies have been carried out in order to evaluate them. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the serum lactate level in the mother, in the placenta and in the newborn. Moreover, the study measured the lactate level, blood glucose level and blood gas level in the first 24 hours. Tests were carried out right after birth, and at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after. Lactate levels were quite similar to the placental levels (p=0.991) which, in turn, were significantly different from the mother's (p=0.011). Results showed that, shortly after birth, the production of lactate in the placenta is part of the issue. Along the first 24 hours, the study observed a reduction of the levels of lactate in newborns; the levels were closer to the normal index levels for the species. Regarding the blood gas test results, we observed mild metabolic acidosis at birth; acid-base balance was completely stable at the end of the period.(AU)","Silva, Leticia Peternelli; Lourenço, Maria L.

A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.","Hassanipour, Soheil; Arab-Zozani, Morteza; Amani, Bahman; Heidarzad, Forough; Fathalipour, Mohammad; Martinez-de-Hoyo, Rudolph",Sci Rep,,272

In this study, we show that - counterintuitively - seemingly asocial behavior can also lead to successful problem solving performed by a swarm. We decided to test our new algorithm at first with real robots as a proof of concept, because this approach is of high conceptual novelty. We show that our social distancing algorithm (SocDist) performs similarly effective as a simple version of the well established bio-inspired social algorithm BEECLUST in a laboratory experiment, while avoiding some of its drawbacks. In additional agent-based computer simulation experiments we show that such an `asocial' component within a swarm robotic algorithm can lead to a significant performance increase. Beside its effectiveness, the SocDist approach also leads to specific spatial distributions of the swarm robots, which may he useful for practical applications.","Vogrin, M.; Stefanec, M.; Schmickl, T.; Ieee,",IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI),,272

322729,COVID-19 brings a new urgency for advance care planning: Implications of death education,2020,"The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus-COVID-19-have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","Gomez, Jonatan; Prieto, Jeisson; Leon, Elizabeth; Rodríguez, Arles",PLoS One,,272

OBJECTIVE: During the reopening of society, medical and nonmedical workers were compared in terms of allostatic load. METHODS: An online study was performed; 3,590 Chinese subjects were analyzed. Socio-demographic variables, allostatic load, stress, abnormal illness behavior, global well-being, mental status, and social support were assessed. RESULTS: There was no difference in allostatic load in medical workers compared to nonmedical workers (15.8 vs. 17.8%; p = 0.22). Multivariate conditional logistic regression revealed that anxiety (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.31; p < 0.01), depression (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.17-1.29; p < 0.01), somatization (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.14-1.25; p < 0.01), hostility (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.30; p < 0.01), and abnormal illness behavior (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.66; p < 0.01) were positively associated with allostatic load, while objective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.89; p < 0.01), subjective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.80-0.88; p < 0.01), utilization of support (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.72-0.88; p < 0.01), social support (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.93; p < 0.01), and global well-being (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.41; p < 0.01) were negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS: In the post-COVID-19 epidemic time, medical and nonmedical workers had similar allostatic load.

324222,The COVID-19 pandemic and follow-up for shoulder surgery: The impact of a shift toward telemedicine on validated patient-reported outcomes,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study describes the utilization of a pediatric emergency department (ED) during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the initial U.S. epicenter, including the impact on visit acuity and incidences of common diagnoses. STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years old seen in a New York City pediatric ED from March 7th to May 6th 2020, and during the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Demographics, visit details, diagnoses, and dispositions were compared. Validated algorithms were utilized to create practical diagnosis groupings and to determine the probability of a visit requiring emergent evaluation. RESULTS: ED visits during the pandemic decreased by 56% to an average daily census of 67 patients, from an anticipated 152. Admission rates rose from 13.3% to 17.4% (p&lt;0.001), and the proportion of triage Emergency Severity Index level 1 and 2 patients increased by 23.7% (p&lt;0.001). Non-emergent visits dropped from 32.3% to 27.5% (p&lt;0.001). Several common, often low-acuity diagnoses saw disproportionate reductions in visits including headache, chest pain, and minor injuries. Concerningly, visits for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or self-harm increased by 100% (p&lt;0.001) and visits for evaluating abuse or neglect decreased by 89% (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ED utilization substantially deceased during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, but left relatively higher patient acuity. Healthcare systems in early epicenters must also prepare for the disproportionate impact a pandemic has on the most vulnerable pediatric patients, particularly those at risk for self-harm or abuse.","Sokoloff, W.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: This report describes our process of 4 health systems coming together to agree on standard use criteria for remdesivir as a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment for patients in Utah. We hope our process provides a framework for remdesivir use in other states and insights on future use of other therapeutic agents that may also be in short supply, such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. SUMMARY: Emergency use authorization (EUA) criteria for COVID-19 treatments often allow for broad use of a treatment relative to limited supplies. Without national criteria, each health system must develop further rationing criteria. Health systems in Utah worked together as part of the state's crisis standards of care workgroup to develop a framework for how to limit the EUA criteria for remdesivir to match available supplies. The 4 largest health systems were represented by infectious diseases specialists, chief medical officers, and pharmacists. The group met several times online and communicated via email over a 9-day period to develop the criteria. The clinicians agreed to use this framework to develop criteria for future therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies. CONCLUSION: The unique collaboration of the 4 health systems in Utah led to statewide criteria for use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19, ensuring similar access to this limited resource for all patients in Utah.","Fox, Erin R; Shah, Mark; Vinik, Russell; Brown, Sam; Buckel, Whitney; Webb, Brandon; Zarndt, Janet; Evans, Megan; Mesdaghi, Pejman; Imlay, Hannah N; Spivak, Emily S",,,272

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. DESIGN: Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. SETTING: Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION: Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. RESULTS: T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: T-ROT combined with emotional support appears to be an effective intervention for monitoring and managing the behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs who are forced to isolate. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: Occupational therapy practitioners can use T-ROT or similar procedures not only during a pandemic but also when it is not possible to treat patients in person at a hospital or at home. Telephone-based treatment may also represent a good practice to be integrated into traditional rehabilitation programs.","Panerai, Simonetta; Raggi, Alberto; Tasca, Domenica; Musso, Sabrina; Gelardi, Donatella; Prestianni, Giuseppina; Catania, Valentina; Muratore, Stefano; Ferri, Raffaele",Am J Occup Ther,,272

327133,Letter: Maintaining Neurosurgical Resident Education and Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"This review aimed to focus on using foods to boost immunity against COVID-19 in all age groups. In human, coronavirus causes the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a major threat to public health. The novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization due to its rapid infectivity. COVID-19 infection is most probably reported in people with low immunity response. The nutrients, which show beneficial effects on the immune system, are called immune nutrients and diet is called immune diet. A healthy diet can reduce the risk of infection of COVID-19 and can prevent disease. Nutritional food intake is also necessary for people with chronic illness, obese persons, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction like anxiety and depression. All nutrients are essential for maintaining immunity and providing appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, and minerals for the surveillance mode of keeping us from getting sick. The use of plenty of water, minerals such as micronutrients, zinc, copper, selenium, iron, magnesium, food rich in vitamins, and a good lifestyle can promote health and overwhelm this coronavirus infection.

METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment administered online asked respondents (N = 306) to imagine the COVID-19 caseload had surged and that they were lay members of a panel tasked to allocate the final ICU bed. They had to decide which patient was more deserving for each of 14 patient pairs. Patients were characterized by 5 attributes: age, occupation, caregiver status, health prior to being infected, and prognosis. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of 7 sets of 14 pairs. Multinomial, mixed logit, and latent class models were used to model the observed choice behavior. RESULTS: A latent class model with 3 classes was found to be the most informative. Two classes valued active decision making and were slightly more likely to choose patients with caregiving responsibilities over those without. One of these classes valued prognosis most strongly, with a decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 65 y and older. The other valued both prognosis and age highly, with decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 45 y and older and a slight preference in favor of frontline health care workers. The third class preferred more random decision-making strategies. CONCLUSIONS: For two-thirds of those sampled, prognosis, age, and caregiving responsibilities were the important features when making allocation decisions, although the emphasis varies. The remainder appeared to choose randomly.","Street, Amelia E; Street, Deborah J; Flynn, Gordon M",Med Decis Making,,272

Here, 91 stool samples from semicaptive bonobos and bonobos reintroduced in the wild, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, were screened for different infectious agents: viruses, bacteria and parasites. We showed the presence of potentially zoonotic viral, bacterial or parasitic agents in stool samples, sometimes coinfecting the same individuals. A high prevalence of Human mastadenoviruses (HAdV-C, HAdV-B, HAdV-E) was observed. Encephalomyocarditis viruses were identified in semicaptive bonobos, although identified genotypes were different from those identified in the previous fatal myocarditis epidemic at the same site in 2009. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. including symbiotic T. succinifaciens, T. berlinense and several potential new species with unknown pathogenicity were identified. We detected DNA of non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Salmonella spp. as well as pathogenic Leptospira interrogans. Zoonotic parasites such as Taenia solium and Strongyloides stercoralis were predominantly present in wild bonobos, while Giardia lamblia was found only in bonobos in contact with humans, suggesting a possible exchange. One third of bonobos carried Oesophagostomum spp., particularly zoonotic O. stephanostomum and O. bifurcum-like species, as well as other uncharacterized Nematoda. Trypanosoma theileri has been identified in semicaptive bonobos. Pathogens typically known to be transmitted sexually were not identified. We present here the results of a reasonably-sized screening study detecting DNA/RNA sequence evidence of potentially pathogenic viruses and microorganisms in bonobo based on a noninvasive sampling method (feces) and focused PCR diagnostics.","Medkour, Hacène; Castaneda, Sergei; Amona, Inestin; Fenollar, Florence; André, Claudine; Belais, Raphaël; Mungongo, Paulin; Muyembé-Tamfum, Jean-Jacques; Levasseur, Anthony; Raoult, Didier; Davoust, Bernard; Mediannikov, Oleg",Sci Rep,,272

329506,Completion of the French Translation and Linguistic Validation of the BODY-Q,2020,"The recently emerged SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to spread rapidly among humans with alarming upsurges in global mortality rates. A major key to tackling this virus is to disrupt its RNA replication process as previously reported for Remdesivir (Rem-P3). In this study, we theorize, using computational simulations, novel mechanisms that may underlie the binding of Rem-P3 to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-NSPs complex; a multimeric assembly that drives viral RNA replication in human hosts. Findings revealed that while ATP-binding stabilized the replicative tripartite, Rem-P3 disintegrated the RdRp-NSP complex, starting with the detachment of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer followed by minimal displacement of the second NSP8 subunit (NSP8II). More so, Rem-P3 interacted with a relatively higher affinity (&#916;Gbind) while inducing high perturbations across the RdRp-NSP domains. D452, T556, V557, S682, and D760 were identified for their crucial roles in stacking the cyano-adenosine and 3,4-dihydroxyoxolan rings of Rem-P3 while its flexible P3 tail extended towards the palm domain blocking D618 and K798; a residue-pair identified for essential roles in RNA replication. However, ATP folded away from D618 indicative of a more coordinated binding favorable for nucleotide polymerization. We believe findings from this study will significantly contribute to the structure-based design of novel disruptors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA replicative machinery.","Olotu, Fisayo A; Omolabi, Kehinde F; Soliman, Mahmoud E S",Cell Biochem Biophys,,272

330899,An extended statement by the British cardiovascular intervention society president regarding the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"ObjectivesCOVID-19 has had a severe impact on morbidity and mortality among nursing home (NH) residents. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 may position us to better mitigate risk of spread. Both asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission are common in outbreaks, and threshold temperatures, such as 38C, for screening for infection could miss timely detection in the majority. DesignRetrospective cohort study using electronic health records MethodsWe hypothesized that in long-term care residents, temperature trends with SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify infection in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals earlier. We collected information about age and other demographics, baseline temperature, and specific comorbidities. We created standardized definitions, and an alternative hypothetical model to test measures of temperature variation and compare outcomes to the VA reality. Settings and participantsOur subjects were 6,176 residents of the VA NHs who underwent SARS-CoV-2 trigger testing. ResultsWe showed that a change from baseline of >0.4C identifies 47% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive NH residents early, and achieves earlier detection by 42.2 hours. Range improves early detection to 55% when paired with a 37.2C cutoff, and achieves earlier detection by 44.4 hours. Temperature elevation >0.4C from baseline, when combined with a 0.7C range, would detect 52% early, leading to earlier detection by more than 3 days in 22% of the residents. This earlier detection comes at the expense of triggering 57,793 tests, as compared to the number of trigger tests ordered in the VA system of 40,691. Conclusion and implicationsOur model suggests that current clinical screening for SARS-CoV-2 in NHs can be substantially improved upon by triggering testing using a patient-derived baseline temperature with a 0.4C degree relative elevation or temperature variability of 0.7C trigger threshold for SARS-CoV2 testing. Such triggers could be automated in facilities that track temperatures in their electronic records.","Elhamamsy, Salaheldin; Devone, Frank; Bayer, Tom; Halladay, Christopher; Cadieux, Marilyne; McConeghy, Kevin; Rajan, Ashna; Sachar, Moniyka; Mujahid, Nadia; Nanda, Aman; McNicoll, Lynn; Rudolph, James; Gravenstein, Stefan",,,272
331341,Is 2020 the golden year of Otolaryngology research? The impact of COVID-19 on the Italian academic production,2021,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic which in our region, Veneto (Italy), dates back to February, we were confronted with several challenges, but with a constant aim of keeping our Stroke Unit COVID-free. For this reason, in addition to creating a dedicated hot-spot as a pre-triage just outside the Emergency Department, together with the Neuroradiology Unit we obtained a mobile CT unit that could be used by COVID-positive or COVID-suspected patients. Furthermore, thanks to the collaboration with colleagues from different specialties (Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine), dedicated areas for COVID patients were activated. This led to a substantial change of our acute stoke management pathway. As the number of COVID patients increased, and the WHO declared a state of pandemic, this new stroke pathway has been fully tested. We would like to share our experience and send a clear message to keep a high attention on stroke as an emergency condition, because we have observed a decreased number of patients with minor strokes and TIAs, longer onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes, and a reduced number of transfers from spokes. We strongly believe that the general population and family doctors are rightly focused on COVID. However, to remain at home with stroke symptoms does not mean to ""stay safe at home"".","Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio; Viaro, Federica; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna M; Tiberio, Ivo; Munari, Marina; Causin, Francesco",Neurol Sci,,272

331995,Smoking and COVID-19: A Literature Review of Cohort Studies in Non-Chinese Population Settings,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the second wave of COVID-19 in August 2020, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government implemented public health and social measures to reduce on-site dining. Assessing the associations between human behavior, infection, and social measures is essential to understand achievable reductions in cases and identify the factors driving changes in social dynamics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nighttime population volumes, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the implementation of public health and social measures in Tokyo. METHODS: We used mobile phone location data to estimate populations between 10 PM and midnight in seven Tokyo metropolitan areas. Mobile phone trajectories were used to distinguish and extract on-site dining from stay-at-work and stay-at-home behaviors. Numbers of new cases and symptom onsets were obtained. Weekly mobility and infection data from March 1 to November 14, 2020, were analyzed using a vector autoregression model. RESULTS: An increase in the number of symptom onsets was observed 1 week after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=0.60, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). The effective reproduction number significantly increased 3 weeks after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=1.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.89). The nighttime population volume increased significantly following reports of decreasing numbers of confirmed cases (coefficient=-0.44, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.15). Implementation of social measures to restaurants and bars was not significantly associated with nighttime population volume (coefficient=0.004, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The nighttime population started to increase after decreasing incidence of COVID-19 was announced. Considering time lags between infection and behavior changes, social measures should be planned in advance of the surge of an epidemic, sufficiently informed by mobility data.","Nakanishi, Miharu; Shibasaki, Ryosuke; Yamasaki, Syudo; Miyazawa, Satoshi; Usami, Satoshi; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Nishida, Atsushi",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,272

Measuring progress in NLG relies on a constantly evolving ecosystem of automated metrics, datasets, and human evaluation standards. However, due to this moving target, new models often still evaluate on divergent anglo-centric corpora with well-established, but flawed, metrics. This disconnect makes it challenging to identify the limitations of current models and opportunities for progress. Addressing this limitation, GEM provides an environment in which models can easily be applied to a wide set of corpora and evaluation strategies can be tested. Regular updates to the benchmark will help NLG research become more multilingual and evolve the challenge alongside models. This paper serves as the description of the initial release for which we are organizing a shared task at our ACL 2021 Workshop and to which we invite the entire NLG community to participate.","Gehrmann, Sebastian; Adewumi, Tosin; Aggarwal, Karmanya; Ammanamanchi, Pawan Sasanka; Anuoluwapo, Aremu; Bosselut, Antoine; Chandu, Khyathi Raghavi; Clinciu, Miruna; Das, Dipanjan; Dhole, Kaustubh D.; Du, Wanyu; Durmus, Esin; Duvsek, Ondvrej; Emezue, Chris; Gangal, Varun; Garbacea, Cristina; Hashimoto, Tatsunori; Hou, Yufang; Jernite, Yacine; Jhamtani, Harsh; Ji, Yangfeng; Jolly, Shailza; Kumar, Dhruv; Ladhak, Faisal; Madaan, Aman; Maddela, Mounica; Mahajan, Khyati; Mahamood, Saad; Majumder, Bodhisattwa Prasad; Martins, Pedro Henrique; McMillan-Major, Angelina; Mille, Simon; Miltenburg, Emiel van; Nadeem, Moin; Narayan, Shashi; Nikolaev, Vitaly; Niyongabo, Rubungo Andre; Osei, Salomey; Parikh, Ankur; Perez-Beltrachini, Laura; Rao, Niranjan Ramesh; Raunak, Vikas; Rodriguez, Juan Diego; Santhanam, Sashank; Sedoc, Joao; Sellam, Thibault; Shaikh, Samira; Shimorina, Anastasia; Cabezudo, Marco Antonio Sobrevilla; Strobelt, Hendrik; Subramani, Nishant; Xu, Wei; Yang, Diyi; Yerukola, Akhila; Zhou, Jiawei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01672v2.pdf,272

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, poison center calls regarding exposures to cleaners, disinfectants, and hand sanitizers have increased as compared with prior years, indicating a need to evaluate household safety precautions. An opt-in Internet panel survey of 502 U.S. adults was conducted in May 2020. Survey items evaluated knowledge regarding use and storage of cleaners, disinfectants, and hand sanitizers; attitudes about household cleaning and disinfection; and safety precautions practiced during the prior month. We assigned a knowledge score to each respondent to quantify knowledge of safety precautions and calculated median scores by demographic characteristics and attitudes. We identified gaps in knowledge regarding safe use and storage of cleaners, disinfectants, and hand sanitizers; the overall median knowledge score was 5.17 (95% CI: 4.85-5.50; maximum 9.00). Knowledge scores were lower among younger than older age-groups and among black non-Hispanic and Hispanic respondents compared with white non-Hispanic respondents. A greater proportion of respondents expressed knowledge of safety precautions than the proportion who engaged in these precautions.

338947,Psychosocial burden of healthcare professionals in times of COVID-19 - a survey conducted at the University Hospital Augsburg,2020,"Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure were, at times, being intubated earlier than normal; in part because the options of heated humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) were considered potentially inadequate and to increase risk of virus aerosolization. To understand the benefits and factors that predict success and failure of HFNC in this population, we evaluated data from the first 30 sequential patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia to our center who were managed with HFNC. We conducted Cox Proportional Hazards regression models to evaluate the factors associated with high flow nasal cannula failure (outcome variable), using time to intubation (censoring variable), while adjusting for comorbidities and immunosuppression. In the majority of our patients (76.7%), the use of HFNC failed and the patients were ultimately placed on mechanical ventilation. Those at increased risk of failure had a higher sequential organ failure assessment score, and at least one comorbidity or history of immunosuppression. Our data suggest that high flow nasal cannula may have a role in some patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure, but careful patient selection is the likely key to its success.","Garner, Orlando; Dongarwar, Deepa; Salihu, Hamisu M; Barrantes Perez, Jairo H; Abraham, Jocelyn; McBride, Cameron; Mathew, Sindhu; Antony, Preethi; Collins, Keegan; Richards, Katherine L; Howard, Christopher M",Respir Med,,272

340227,Retrospective analysis of smell and taste disturbances associated with dermatologic medications reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration and relevance to COVID-19 infections,2020,"P-type H+ ATPases mediate active H+ efflux from plant cells. They generate a proton motive force across the plasma membrane providing the free energy to drive the transport of other solutes, partly by coupling to H+ influx. Wegner & Shabala (2020; New Phytol. 225:37-47) recently suggested that passive H+ influx can exceed pump-driven efflux due to 'active buffering', i.e. cytosolic H+ scavenging and apoplastic H+ generation by metabolism ('biochemical pH clamp'). Charge balance is provided by K+ efflux or anion influx. Here, this hypothesis is extended to net H+ efflux: Even though H+ pumping is faster than backflow via symporters and antiporters, a progressive increase in the transmembrane pH gradient is avoided. Cytosolic H+ release is associated with bicarbonate formation from CO2 . Bicarbonate serves as substrate for the PEPcase catalyzing the reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate subsequently reduced to malate. Organic anions like malate and citrate are released across the plasma membrane and are (partly) protonated in the apoplast, thus limiting pump-induced acidification. Moreover, a 'biophysical pH clamp' is introduced, i.e. adjustment of apoplastic/cytosolic pH involving net H+ fluxes across the plasma membrane, while the gradient between compartments is maintained. Both clamps aren't mutually exclusive but are likely to coexist.","Wegner, Lars H; Li, Xuewen; Zhang, Jie; Yu, Min; Shabala, Sergey; Hao, Zhifeng",,,272

341574,COVID-19 and Family Doctors,2020,"At the moment, little treatment options are available for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients' groups.","Boccanegra, Brigida; Verhaart, Ingrid E C; Cappellari, Ornella; Vroom, Elizabeth; De Luca, Annamaria",Pharmacol Res,,272

341936,"COVID-19 in Children: Prevalence, Clinical Characteristics, Severity, and Transmission",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to the daily habits of billions of people. Users increasingly have to rely on home broadband Internet access for work, education, and other activities. These changes have resulted in corresponding changes to Internet traffic patterns. This paper aims to characterize the effects of these changes with respect to Internet service providers in the United States. We study three questions: (1)How did traffic demands change in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?; (2)What effects have these changes had on Internet performance?; (3)How did service providers respond to these changes? We study these questions using data from a diverse collection of sources. Our analysis of interconnection data for two large ISPs in the United States shows a 30-60% increase in peak traffic rates in the first quarter of 2020. In particular, we observe traffic downstream peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13-20% while upstream peaks increased by more than 30%. Further, we observe significant variation in performance across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects, at more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video conferencing applications have increased their network footprint, more than doubling their advertised IP address space.","Liu, Shinan; Schmitt, Paul; Bronzino, Francesco; Feamster, Nick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00419v1.pdf,272

342249,Determinants of hospital outcomes for COVID-19 infections in a large Pennsylvania Health System,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly variable condition. Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Three validation cohorts were generated: 2 external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and 1 internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by reestimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N = 1477). RESULTS: The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.94, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope, 0.86, 0.94, and 0.79; intercept, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves. The updated model was also useful to predict fatal outcome in patients without respiratory distress at the time of evaluation.

342499,13 Does the ‘Canada COVID-19 alert’ app stand up to critical scrutiny? A rapid qualitative assessment,2021,"The present global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought the whole world to a standstill, causing morbidity, death, and changes in personal roles. The more common causes of morbidity and death in these patients include pneumonia and respiratory failure, which cause the patients to require artificial ventilation and other techniques that can improve respiratory function. One of these techniques is chest physiotherapy, and this has been shown to improve gas exchange, reverse pathological progression, and reduce or avoid the need for artificial ventilation when it is provided very early in other respiratory conditions. For patients with COVID-19, there is limited evidence on its effect, especially in the acute stage and in patients on ventilators. In contrast, in patients after discharge, chest physiotherapy in the form of respiratory muscle training, cough exercise, diaphragmatic training, stretching exercise, and home exercise have resulted in improved FEV1 (L), FVC (L), FEV1/FVC%, diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%), endurance, and quality of life, and a reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, there are still controversies on whether chest physiotherapy can disperse aerosols and accelerate the rate of spread of the infection, especially since COVID-19 is highly contagious. While some authors believe it is possible, others believe the aerosol generated by chest physiotherapy is not within respirable range. Therefore, measures such as the use of surgical masks, tele-rehabilitation, and self-management tools can be used to limit cross-infection.","Abdullahi, Auwal",Front. Med.,,272

In this work, a health care provider wants to detect infected people as well as people who recovered from the disease as quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally, only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates, which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.","Bastopcu, Melih; Ulukus, Sennur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13393v1.pdf,272
342989,Impact of COVID-19 on Orthopaedic Care and Practice: A Rapid Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) presents a variety of challenges for ongoing clinical trials, including an inevitably higher rate of missing outcome data, with new and non-standard reasons for missingness. International drug trial guidelines recommend trialists review plans for handling missing data in the conduct and statistical analysis, but clear recommendations are lacking. METHODS: We present a four-step strategy for handling missing outcome data in the analysis of randomised trials that are ongoing during a pandemic. We consider handling missing data arising due to (i) participant infection, (ii) treatment disruptions and (iii) loss to follow-up. We consider both settings where treatment effects for a 'pandemic-free world' and 'world including a pandemic' are of interest. RESULTS: In any trial, investigators should; (1) Clarify the treatment estimand of interest with respect to the occurrence of the pandemic; (2) Establish what data are missing for the chosen estimand; (3) Perform primary analysis under the most plausible missing data assumptions followed by; (4) Sensitivity analysis under alternative plausible assumptions. To obtain an estimate of the treatment effect in a 'pandemic-free world', participant data that are clinically affected by the pandemic (directly due to infection or indirectly via treatment disruptions) are not relevant and can be set to missing. For primary analysis, a missing-at-random assumption that conditions on all observed data that are expected to be associated with both the outcome and missingness may be most plausible. For the treatment effect in the 'world including a pandemic', all participant data is relevant and should be included in the analysis. For primary analysis, a missing-at-random assumption - potentially incorporating a pandemic time-period indicator and participant infection status - or a missing-not-at-random assumption with a poorer response may be most relevant, depending on the setting. In all scenarios, sensitivity analysis under credible missing-not-at-random assumptions should be used to evaluate the robustness of results. We highlight controlled multiple imputation as an accessible tool for conducting sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Missing data problems will be exacerbated for trials active during the Covid-19 pandemic. This four-step strategy will facilitate clear thinking about the appropriate analysis for relevant questions of interest.","Cro, Suzie; Morris, Tim P; Kahan, Brennan C; Cornelius, Victoria R; Carpenter, James R",BMC Med Res Methodol,,272

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who developed a pneumothorax with those who did not develop a pneumothorax. METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective analysis of all adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to intensive care units in 4 tertiary care centers in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 842 critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection were analyzed, out of which 594 (71%) were mechanically ventilated. The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 85/842 (10%), and 80/594 (13%) in those who were mechanically ventilated. As compared to mechanically ventilated patients in the non-pneumothorax group, mechanically ventilated patients in the pneumothorax group had worse respiratory parameters at the time of intubation (mean PaO2:FiO2 ratio 105 vs 150, P<0.001 and static respiratory system compliance: 30ml/cmH2O vs 39ml/cmH2O, P = 0.01) and significantly higher in-hospital mortality (63% vs 49%, P = 0.04).

Consequently, we sought to provide a blended and asynchronous teaching programme that would be delivered to anaesthetic trainees preparing for their postgraduate examinations. Six sessions of 90-minute duration were delivered during the months July, August and September 2020. Each of the six sessions was delivered live using a variety of online educational tools in addition to traditional didactic-style teaching by the presenters. Participants submitted requests for topics to be covered by the presenters in the final of the six sessions. The sessions were recorded and later uploaded onto an online educational learning platform for viewing at the participants' discretion. The live nature of the sessions ensured participant interaction and a sense of community that trainees had come to expect from previous face-to-face teaching sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.Evaluation was via qualitative and quantitative means using preset questions using the Likert scale and a free-text comments box.

345051,"Dealing with COVID-19 in small European island states: Cyprus, Iceland and Malta",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the lived experience of long COVID with particular focus on the role of physical activity. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: 18 people living with long COVID (9 men, 9 women; aged between 18-74 years; 10 white British, 3 white Other, 3 Asian, 1 black, 1 mixed ethnicity) recruited via a UK-based research interest database for people with long COVID. SETTING: Telephone interviews with 17 participants living in the UK and 1 participant living in the USA. RESULTS: Four themes were generated. Theme 1 describes how participants struggled with drastically reduced physical function, compounded by the cognitive and psychological effects of long COVID. Theme 2 highlights challenges associated with finding and interpreting advice about physical activity that was appropriately tailored. Theme 3 describes individual approaches to managing symptoms including fatigue and 'brain fog' while trying to resume and maintain activities of daily living and other forms of exercise. Theme 4 illustrates the battle with self-concept to accept reduced function (even temporarily) and the fear of permanent reduction in physical and cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the challenges of managing physical activity alongside the extended symptoms associated with long COVID. Findings highlight the need for greater clarity and tailoring of physical activity-related advice for people with long COVID and improved support to resume activities important to individual well-being.","Humphreys, Helen; Kilby, Laura; Kudiersky, Nik; Copeland, Robert",BMJ Open,,272

Unlike prior to the pandemic, when online and offline activities were conducted side-by-side, many aspects of consumers' daily lives are only conducted online, especially shopping and meetings. This study analysed the characteristics of consumers who have used offline shopping channels during the pandemic. In addition, participants were asked how often they will use online and offline shopping channels after society stabilizes from COVID-19 in order to analyse what determinants will be used to select either online or offline shopping channels after the pandemic. This study will contribute to provide a deeper understanding of the consumption patterns of consumers (online vs. offline) during times of deep external impact, such as a pandemic.","Moon, JiHyo; Choe, Yunseon; Song, HakJun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272
347006,Seeking Answers for Care Homes during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID SEARCH),2020,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the increase in mortality associated with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic in the autonomous community of Castilla y León (Spain). METHOD: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y León. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. RESULTS: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province. CONCLUSIONS: Although the observed increase in mortality cannot be totally attributed to the disease, it is the best estimate we have of the real impact on deaths directly or indirectly related to it. The number of declared deaths only reaches two thirds of the increase in mortality observed.","Ochoa Sangrador, Carlos; Garmendia Leiza, José Ramón; Pérez Boillos, María José; Pastrana Ara, Fernando; Lorenzo Lobato, María Del Pilar; Andrés de Llano, Jesús María","Gac. sanit.

347304,"From HIV to Coronavirus: AIDS Service Organizations Adaptative Responses to COVID-19, Birmingham, Alabama",2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 i.e. a variation of coronavirus, also known as novel corona virus causing respiratory disease is a big concern worldwide since the end of December 2019. As of September 12, 2020, it has turned into an epidemic outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around 1 million reported deaths worldwide. It has created an urgent need to monitor and forecast COVID-19 spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much attention in media. However, statistical models are showing less accuracy for long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of deep learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to statistical models. We propose a new Attention-based encoder-decoder model, named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM). LSTM based neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of fine-grained attention mechanism i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions instead of hidden state vector itself, which is capable of highlighting the importance and contribution of each hidden state dimension. It helps in detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable network. Additionally, we implement a learnable vector embedding for time. As, time in a vector representation can be easily added with many architectures. This vector representation is called Time2Vec. We have used COVID-19 data repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University to assess the proposed model's performance. The proposed model give superior forecasting accuracy compared to other existing methods.","Neeraj,; Mathew, Jimson; Behera, Ranjan Kumar; Panthakkalakath, Zenin Easa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00382v2.pdf,272

347744,Hookah: a cultural risk factor for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to droplet production and exposure to saliva and blood, dental practitioners are at high risk of COVID-19 contagion during their routine procedures. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of Italian dentists and to analyze their reactions in relation to Sars-CoV-2 pandemic professional restrictive measures. METHODS: An online structured survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dental practitioners all over Italy to investigate their behavior and to analyze their reactions in relation to Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20). RESULTS: 1109 dentists replied. To assess concerns and psychological responses the sample was divided into two groups based on the number of cases registered in their work area. In the first group were included all the responders working in the Italian regions that had more than 15,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of April 29, 2020. The second group included responders working in the Italian regions that had less than 15,000 confirmed cases. The 45.2% of the respondents showed minimal anxiety, 34.5% showed mild anxiety, 13.9% showed moderate anxiety, while 6.4% showed a score indicative of a severe level of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related emergency condition had a highly negative impact on dental practices in Italy. Those who completed the survey reported practice closure or reduction during the lockdown, and a high level of concern about the professional future for all dental practitioners. Concerns related to professional activity were accompanied by severe anxiety levels.","Bellini, Pierantonio; Checchi, Vittorio; Liani, Cristina; Bencivenni, Davide; Consolo, Ugo",Minerva stomatol,,272

349120,Critical observations on and suggested ways forward for healthcare communication during COVID-19: pEACH position paper,2021,"Having access to parenting interventions in the early years is key to improve the developmental outcomes of children with neurodevelopmental problems. The Incredible Years® (IY) Parent Program is a group intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing stress in parents, as well as improving behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes in children. The program has been recently adapted for families of children with autism or language delays (IY-ASLD®). This intervention has not yet been implemented in the Spanish Public Health System, where there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions being offered to families with young children presenting neurodevelopmental problems. The main aims of this study are to determine the feasibility of implementing the IY-ASLD® program within Spanish Child Mental Health Services and to examine parents' acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate its preliminary effectiveness in terms of reducing parental stress and behavioral difficulties in their children. The FIRST STEPS study is a multicenter, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLD® program with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Approximately 70 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties (aged 2-5 years) will be recruited. Families will be assessed prior to randomization and after the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention will consist of 22 weekly online sessions (approximately 6 months). The FIRST STEPS pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of reliably implementing the IY-ASLD® program within the Spanish Public Health System. The results of this study could represent the first step to inform policymakers in Spain when designing evidence-based healthcare pathways for families of children presenting ASD symptoms or neurodevelopmental difficulties at early stages.

349609,Physical activity during COVID-19 quarantine,2020,"Social media platforms have proven to be effective for information gathering during emergency events caused by natural or human-made disasters. Emergency response authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the public can use this information to gain situational awareness and improve disaster response. In case of emergencies, rapid responses are needed to address victims' requests for help. The research community has developed many social media platforms and used them effectively for emergency response and coordination in the past. However, most of the present deployments of platforms in crisis management are not automated, and their operational success largely depends on experts who analyze the information manually and coordinate with relevant humanitarian agencies or law enforcement authorities to initiate emergency response operations. The seamless integration of automatically identifying types of urgent needs from millions of posts and delivery of relevant information to the appropriate agency for timely response has become essential. This research project aims to develop a generalized Information Technology (IT) solution for emergency response and disaster management by integrating social media data as its core component. In this paper, we focused on text analysis techniques which can help the emergency response authorities to filter through the sheer amount of information gathered automatically for supporting their relief efforts. More specifically, we applied state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques ranging from unsupervised to supervised learning for an in-depth analysis of social media data for the purpose of extracting real-time information on a critical event to facilitate emergency response in a crisis.

349984,Novel method of performing brachial plexus block using an aerosol box during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: As coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. Hence, we performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of both infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were assessed. Over a two-month study period, we diagnosed 80 COVID-19, 61 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases eligible to multivariate analysis. Among these, we identified delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.39), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95%CI 2.21-6.55) and anosmia (OR 7.80, 95%CI 4.20-14.49) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.17, 95%CI 2.69-14.14), headache (OR 5.03, 95%CI 1.88-13.44) and retro-orbital pain (OR 5.55, 95%CI 2.51-12.28) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.09-0.79) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were associated with OFIs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates. At clinical presentation, nine basic clinical and epidemiological indicators may help to distinguish COVID-19 or dengue from each other and other febrile illnesses.","Joubert, Antoine; Andry, Fanny; Bertolotti, Antoine; Accot, Frédéric; Koumar, Yatrika; Legrand, Florian; Poubeau, Patrice; Manaquin, Rodolphe; Gérardin, Patrick; Levin, Cécile",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,272

351886,P.38 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anaesthetic technique for caesarean section,2021,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy of stem cell origin that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. The long-term prognosis remains dismal given the high likelihood for primary refractory or relapsed disease. An essential component of relapse is resurgence from the bone marrow. To date, the murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche has been clearly defined, but the human HSC niche is less well understood. The design of niche-based targeted therapies for AML must account for which cellular subsets compete for stem cell occupancy within respective bone marrow microenvironments. In this review, we highlight the principles of stem cell niche biology and discuss translational insights into the AML microenvironment as of 2021. Optimization of competition for niche occupancy is important for the elimination of measurable residual disease (MRD). Some of these novel therapeutics are in the pharmacologic pipeline for AML and may be especially useful in the setting of MRD.","Patel, Shyam A; Dalela, Disha; Fan, Amy C; Lloyd, Maxwell R; Zhang, Tian Y",Leuk Lymphoma,,272

Particular attention has been dedicated to the identification of underlying dynamics and prediction of future trend. In this work, a switching Kalman filter formalism is applied on dynamics learning and forecasting of the daily new cases of COVID-19. The main feature of this dynamical system is its ability to switch between different linear Gaussian models based on the observations and specified probabilities of transitions between these models. It is thus able to handle the problem of hidden state estimation and forecasting for models with non-Gaussian and nonlinear effects. The potential of this method is explored on the daily new cases of COVID-19 both at the state-level and the country-level in the US. The results suggest a common disease dynamics across states that share certain features. We also demonstrate the ability to make short to medium term predictions with quantifiable error bounds.","Zeng, Xiaoshu; Ghanem, Roger",Comput Mech,,272

353065,COVID-19 pandemic: a glimpse into newly diagnosed hypertensive patients,2021,"People share their emotions on social media and evidence suggests that in times of crisis people are especially motivated to post emotional content. The current Coronavirus pandemic is such a crisis. The online sharing of emotional content during the Coronavirus crisis may contribute to societal value change. Emotion sharing via social media could lead to emotional contagion which in turn could facilitate an emotional climate in a society. In turn, the emotional climate of a society can influence society's value structure. The emotions that spread in the current Coronavirus crisis are predominantly negative, which could result in a negative emotional climate. Based on the dynamic relations of values to each other and the way that emotions relate to values, a negative emotional climate can contribute to societal value change towards values related to security preservation and threat avoidance. As a consequence, a negative emotional climate and the shift in values could lead to a change in political attitudes that has implications for rights, freedom, privacy and moral progress. Considering the impact of social media in terms of emotional contagion and a longer-lasting value change is an important perspective in thinking about the ethical long-term impact of social media technology.","Steinert, Steffen",Ethics Inf Technol,,272
354085,Surgery triage during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"High throughput sequencing enables rapid genome sequencing during infectious disease outbreaks and provides an opportunity to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in near real-time. One difficulty of undertaking evolutionary analyses over short timescales is the dependency of the inferred evolutionary parameters on the timespan of observation. Here, we characterise the molecular evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza during the first 12 months of their respective pandemics. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods to estimate the dates of emergence, evolutionary rates, and growth rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 over time and investigate how varying sampling window and dataset sizes affects the accuracy of parameter estimation. We further use a generalised McDonald-Kreitman test to estimate the number of segregating non-neutral sites over time. We find that the inferred evolutionary parameters for both pandemics are time-dependent, and that the inferred rates of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 decline by [~]50% and [~]100%, respectively, over the course of one year. After at least 4 months since the start of sequence sampling, inferred growth rates and emergence dates remain relatively stable and can be inferred reliably using a logistic growth coalescent model. We show that the time-dependency of the mean substitution rate is due to elevated substitution rates at terminal branches which are 2-4 times higher than those of internal branches for both viruses. The elevated rate at terminal branches is strongly correlated with an increasing number of segregating non-neutral sites, demonstrating the role of purifying selection in generating the time-dependency of evolutionary parameters during pandemics.","Ghafari, Mahan; Plessis, Louis du; Raghwani, Jayna; Bhatt, Samir; Xu, Bo; Pybus, Oliver; Katzourakis, Aris",,,272

357844,Quarantine acceptance and adherence: qualitative evidence synthesis and conceptual framework,2021,"The world has been facing the biggest virological invasion in the form of Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of the year 2020. In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66 per cent till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.","Adak, Debadatta; Majumder, Abhijit; Bairagi, Nandadulal",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,272

Orotate is utilized in the biosynthesis of uridine-monophosphate. DHODH inhibitors have shown promise as antiviral agent against Cytomegalovirus, Ebola, Influenza, Epstein Barr and Picornavirus. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 action of DHODH inhibitors are also coming up. In this review, we have reviewed the safety and efficacy of approved DHODH inhibitors (leflunomide and teriflunomide) against COVID-19. In target-centered in silico studies, leflunomide showed favorable binding to active site of MPro and spike: ACE2 interface. In artificial-intelligence/machine-learning based studies, leflunomide was among the top 50 ligands targeting spike: ACE2 interaction. Leflunomide is also found to interact with differentially regulated pathways [identified by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and reactome pathway analysis of host transcriptome data] in cogena based drug-repurposing studies. Based on GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis), leflunomide was found to target pathways enriched in COVID-19. In vitro, both leflunomide (EC50 41.49 ± 8.8 µmol/L) and teriflunomide (EC50 26 µmol/L) showed SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. In clinical studies, leflunomide showed significant benefit in terms of decreasing the duration of viral shredding, duration of hospital stay and severity of infection. However, no advantage was seen while combining leflunomide and IFN alpha-2a among patients with prolonged post symptomatic viral shredding. Common adverse effects of leflunomide were hyperlipidemia, leucopenia, neutropenia and liver-function alteration. Leflunomide/teriflunomide may serve as an agent of importance to achieve faster virological clearance in COVID-19, however, findings needs to be validated in bigger sized placebo controlled studies.","Kaur, Hardeep; Sarma, Phulen; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Sharma, Saurabh; Chhimpa, Neeraj; Prajapat, Manisha; Prakash, Ajay; Kumar, Subodh; Singh, Ashutosh; Singh, Rahul; Avti, Pramod; Thota, Prasad; Medhi, Bikash",Eur J Pharmacol,,272
358894,Feeding Low-Income Children during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"The purpose of this research is to determine the unwanted condition as a strategic criterion in measuring the economic resilience of a city. A new approach in determining economic resilience was developed to overcome the weaknesses of the index method commonly used internationally. Based on the output of this research, the development priority program for each city becomes distinctive depending on the status of the city’s economic resilience. Quality improvement programs are used for cities that do not have resilience and retention programs for cities that already have economic resilience. Five piecewise linear regression parameters are applied to identify a statistical model between Income per capita and Pc as a concern variable and modifier variable, and a Z. Model is tested massively involving all 514 cities in Indonesia from 2015 to 2019, covering the components of the modifier variable: local revenue (PAD), poverty, unemployment and concern variable ;GRDP and population. The value of the Fraction of variance unexplained (FVU) of the model is 40%. This value is obtained using the Rosenbrock Pattern Search estimation method with a maximum number of iterations of 200 and a convergence criterion of 0.0001. The FVU area is a condition of uncertainty and unpredictability, so that people will avoid this area. This condition is chaotic and declared as an unwanted condition. The chaotic area is located in the value of UZ less than IDR 5,097,592 and Pc &lt; Pc (UZ) = 27,816,310.68, and thus the coordinates of the chaotic boundary area is (5,097,592: 27,816,310.68). FVU as a chaotic area is used as the basis for stating whether or not a city falls into unwanted conditions. A city is claimed not to be economically resilient if the modifier variable Z is in a chaotic boundary.","Hidayat, Yuyun Titi Purwandari Subiyanto Sukono",Sustainability,,272

The A-SIR model, i.e. a SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Removed) model with a compartment for infected individuals with no symptoms or few symptoms was proposed by Gaeta (2020). In this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and São Paulo state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemic. In both cases we see strong evidence that the adoption of social distancing measures contributed to a slower increase in the number of deceased individuals when compared to the baseline of no reduction in the infection rate. Both for Lombardy and São Paulo we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic.","Neves, Armando G.M.; Guerrero, Gustavo",Phys D Nonlinear Phenom,,272

362954,Risks from Deferring Treatment for Genitourinary Cancers: A Collaborative Review to Aid Triage and Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Reproductive health is a significant public health issue during pandemics; however, the impacts of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on noninfected pregnant women are still unknown. This study intends (1) to examine whether emotional eating (EE) occurred during the pandemic triggered by disease concerns and (2) to explore the associations among EE, dietary changes, and gestational weight gain (GWG). Based on an online survey, 640 new mothers who experienced the lockdown in their third trimester were recruited from seven provinces in China. EE was evaluated with the Chinese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, EE domain. A self-designed e-questionnaire was used to collect the data of participants on the sociodemographic characteristics, concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, maternity information, physical activities, and dietary changes during lockdown. The results show that the average EE score was 26.5 ± 8.3, and women living in a severely affected area, who are very worried about the pandemic and who had less physical activity had a higher tendency of EE. Although there is a dietary pattern changed during pandemic, the average GWG in the studied group was in the normal range. However, a higher EE score was associated with a significant excess of GWG in women not from Wuhan (EE score 33-65 vs. 13-22: adjusted Odd Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.90, 1.08-3.32). The sensitivity analysis that additionally adjusted for the pregestational body mass index and gestational metabolic disease was consistent with this result. The mediation model was also examined and showed that, after adjusting for living area and exercise, EE was associated with significantly increased consumption of cereals (EE score 33-65 vs. 13-22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 2.22, 1.29-3.82) and oil (EE score 33-65 vs. 13-22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 3.03, 1.06-8.69) but decreased consumption of fish and seafood (EE score 33-65 vs. 13-22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.88, 1.14-3.11; 23-32 vs. 13-22: adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.79, 1.20-2.66). In conclusion, this study indicated that EE occurred in a proportional number of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and is associated with excess GWG mediated by increased intake of certain foods. The findings suggest the need for psychosocial and nutritional education and interventions during pregnancy checkups. Further studies are needed to determine modifiable psychosocial predictors and potential nutritional concerns in pregnant women during disease outbreaks.","Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Yumei; Huo, Shanshan; Ma, Yidi; Ke, Yalei; Wang, Peiyu; Zhao, Ai",Nutrients,,272

363085,Path to Reopening Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Neurosurgery Experience,2020,"The development of efficient vaccines against COVID-19 is an emergent need for global public health. The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major target for the COVID-19 vaccine. To quickly respond to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a nucleic acid-based vaccine is a novel option, beyond the traditional inactivated virus vaccine or recombinant protein vaccine. Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. These data suggest that DNA vaccination could be a promising approach for protecting against COVID-19.","Chai, Kit Man; Tzeng, Tsai-Teng; Shen, Kuan-Yin; Liao, Hung-Chun; Lin, Jhe-Jhih; Chen, Mei-Yu; Yu, Guann-Yi; Dou, Horng-Yunn; Liao, Ching-Len; Chen, Hsin-Wei; Liu, Shih-Jen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,272

364976,Impact of Strategies for Mitigating Delays and Disruptions in Cancer Care Due to COVID-19: Systematic Review,2021,"2,3-Butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH), also known as acetoin/diacetyl reductase, is a pivotal enzyme for the formation of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), a chiral compound with potential roles in the virulence of certain pathogens. Here, a NAD(H)-dependent (2R,3R)-BDH from Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090 (NgBDH), the causative agent of gonorrhoea, was functionally characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that it belongs to zinc-containing medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The recombinant NgBDH migrated as a single band with a size of around 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE and could be confirmed by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. For the oxidation of either (2R,3R)-2,3-BD or meso-2,3-BD, the enzyme exhibited a broad pH optimum between pH 9.5 to 11.5. For the reduction of (3R/3S)-acetoin, the pH optimum was around 6.5. The enzyme could catalyze the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (Km = 0.16 mM, kcat/Km = 673 s-1 · mM-1) and meso-BD (Km = 0.72 mM, kcat/Km = 165 s-1 · mM-1). Moreover, it could also reduce (3R/3S)-acetoin with a Km of 0.14 mM and a kcat/Km of 885 s-1 · mM-1. The results presented here contribute to understand the 2,3-BD metabolism in N. gonorrhoeae and pave the way for studying the influence of 2,3-BD metabolism on the virulence of this pathogen in the future.","Tang, Wanggang; Lian, Chaoqun; Si, Yu; Chang, Jianrong",Mol. biotechnol,,272

365777,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Barrett's Esophagus and Esophago-gastric Cancer,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the time-varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China, Wuhan City and Guangdong province, and compared them with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Data on COVID-19 cases by March 20, 2020 in China was collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on SARS cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 and SARS. RESULTS: As of March 20, 2020, 80,739 COVID-19 indigenous cases were identified in mainland China. Most cases were reported between January 20 and February 29. The R0 of COVID-19 nationwide and in Wuhan were 5.0 and 4.8 respectively, which were greater than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hong Kong (R0 = 2.3), and Beijing (R0 = 2.6). During the epidemic of COVID-19, the Rt nationwide first increased to a peak of 8.4 and declined quickly to below 1 in one month. In terms of SARS, the Rt curve saw a fluctuation change with more than one peak though the peak was lower than COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has much higher transmissibility than SARS, and a series of major actions for suppressing the outbreak are effective. However, persistent efforts are needed to prevent the rebound of the epidemic in the context of the global pandemic.","Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; He, Guanhao; Liu, Tao; Kang, Min; Rong, Zuhua; Lin, Lifeng; Zhong, Haojie; Huang, Qiong; Deng, Aiping; Zeng, Weilin; Tan, Xiaohua; Zeng, Siqing; Zhu, Zhihua; Li, Jiansen; Gong, Dexin; Wan, Donghua; Chen, Shaowei; Guo, Lingchuan; Li, Yihan; Li, Yan; Sun, Limei; Liang, Wenjia; Song, Tie; He, Jianfeng; Ma, Wenjun",Int J Infect Dis,,272
365805,Proton pump inhibitor on susceptibility to COVID-19 and its severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: In pandemics, local hospitals need to anticipate a surge in health care needs. We examined the modelled surge because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that was used to inform the early hospital-level response against cases as they transpired. METHODS: To estimate hospital-level surge in March and April 2020, we simulated a range of scenarios of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, using the best available data at the time. We applied outputs to hospital-specific data to estimate surge over 6 weeks at 2 hospitals (St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre). We examined multiple scenarios, wherein the default (R0 = 2.4) resembled the early trajectory (to Mar. 25, 2020), and compared the default model projections with observed COVID-19 admissions in each hospital from Mar. 25 to May 6, 2020. RESULTS: For the hospitals to remain below non-ICU bed capacity, the default pessimistic scenario required a reduction in non-COVID-19 inpatient care by 38% and 28%, respectively, with St. Michael's Hospital requiring 40 new ICU beds and St. Joseph's Health Centre reducing its ICU beds for non-COVID-19 care by 6%. The absolute difference between default-projected and observed census of inpatients with COVID-19 at each hospital was less than 20 from Mar. 25 to Apr. 11; projected and observed cases diverged widely thereafter. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. INTERPRETATION: Scenario-based analyses were reliable in estimating short-term cases, but would require frequent re-analyses. Distribution of the city's surge was expected to vary across hospitals, and community-level strategies were key to mitigating each hospital's surge.","Mishra, Sharmistha; Wang, Linwei; Ma, Huiting; Yiu, Kristy C Y; Paterson, J Michael; Kim, Eliane; Schull, Michael J; Pequegnat, Victoria; Lee, Anthea; Ishiguro, Lisa; Coomes, Eric; Chan, Adrienne; Downing, Mark; Landsman, David; Straus, Sharon; Muller, Matthew",CMAJ Open,,272

366024,P.17 An audit of workload and changes to anaesthetic practice during the initial wave of COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"On August 30, 2021, the WHO classified the SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant (B.1.621 lineage) as a new variant of interest. The WHO defines ""comparative assessment of virus characteristics and public health risks"" as primary action in response to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/). Here, we demonstrate that the Mu variant is highly resistant to sera from COVID-19 convalescent and BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. Direct comparison of different SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins revealed that Mu spike is more resistant to serum-mediated neutralization than all other currently recognized variants of interest (VOI) and concern (VOC). This includes the Beta variant (B.1.351) that has been suggested to represent the most resistant variant to convalescent and vaccinated sera to date (e.g., Collier et al, Nature, 2021; Wang et al, Nature, 2021). Since breakthrough infection by newly emerging variants is a major concern during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Bergwerk et al., NEJM, 2021), we believe that our findings are of significant public health interest. Our results will help to better assess the risk posed by the Mu variant for vaccinated, previously infected and naive populations.","Uriu, Keiya; Kimura, Izumi; Shirakawa, Kotaro; Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi; Nakada, Taka-aki; Kaneda, Atsushi; Consortium, - The Genotype to Phenotype Japan; Nakagawa, So; Sato, Kei",,,272

367702,Hypothesis of COVID-19 therapy with sildenafil,2020,"In weathered bedrock aquifers, groundwater is stored in pores and fractures that open as rocks are exhumed and minerals interact with meteoric fluids. Little is known about this storage because geochemical and geophysical observations are limited to pits, boreholes, or outcrops or to inferences based on indirect measurements between these sites. We trained a rock physics model to borehole observations in a well-constrained ridge and valley landscape and then interpreted spatial variations in seismic refraction velocities. We discovered that P-wave velocities track where a porosity-generating reaction initiates in shale in three boreholes across the landscape. Specifically, velocities of 2.7 ± 0.2 km/s correspond with growth of porosity from dissolution of chlorite, the most reactive of the abundant minerals in the shale. In addition, sonic velocities are consistent with the presence of gas bubbles beneath the water table under valley and ridge. We attribute this gas largely to CO2 produced by 1) microbial respiration in soils as meteoric waters recharge into the subsurface and 2) the coupled carbonate dissolution and pyrite oxidation at depth in the rock. Bubbles may nucleate below the water table because waters depressurize as they flow from ridge to valley and because pores have dilated as the deep rock has been exhumed by erosion. Many of these observations are likely to also describe the weathering and flow path patterns in other headwater landscapes. Such combined geophysical and geochemical observations will help constrain models predicting flow, storage, and reaction of groundwater in bedrock systems.","Gu, Xin; Mavko, Gary; Ma, Lisa; Oakley, David; Accardo, Natalie; Carr, Bradley J; Nyblade, Andrew A; Brantley, Susan L",Proc.

Patients with hip fractures, due to their age and comorbidity, were high-risk patients in this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to observe how the pandemic affected the management of hip fractures in elderly patients. METHODS: This is a descriptive, retrospective study of all patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with a hip fracture that came to the emergency room of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in the COVID-19 pandemic period, from the 11th of March to the 24th of April 2020. They were followed up during their hospital stay and 30 days after the fracture. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included, 18 (28.6%) of whom had a positive RT-qPCR for COVID-19. Four could not be operated on due to the severity of the disease they presented with upon admission, dying a few days afterwards. Three of these patients had COVID-19. The 83.3% of the patients with positive RT-qPCR presented respiratory symptoms during their hospitalization. The length of hospital stays of patients with a positive RT-qPCR (18.25±8.99 days) was longer than that of patients that were RT-qPCR negative (10.9±4.52 days) (P=.01). In-hospital mortality in operated patients was 20% in patients with a positive RT-qPCR, compared with 2.3% in the group of patients who tested negative (P=.018). Mortality at 30 days was 40% in the group with positive RT-qPCR vs 6.8% in patients not infected by SARS-CoV-2 (P=.002). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients with hip fractures increases both the length of hospital stay, as well as in-hospital and 30-day mortality.","Biarnés-Suñé, A; Solà-Enríquez, B; González Posada, M Á; Teixidor-Serra, J; García-Sánchez, Y; Manrique Muñóz, S",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,,272
368261,Shifting psychosocial oncology care to telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to delay inpatient elective surgery to increase US health care capacity. This study examined the extent to which common inpatient elective operations consume acute care resources. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the Premier Healthcare Database to examine the distribution of inpatient elective operations in the United States from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2018. Primary outcomes were measures of acute care use after 4 common elective operations: joint replacement, spinal fusion, bariatric surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting. A framework for matching changing demand with changes in supply was created by overlaying acute care data with publicly available outbreak capacity data. RESULTS: Elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 117 423) had the highest acute care use: 92.8% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 89.1% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 41.0% required red blood cell transfusions, and 13.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. Acute care use was also substantial after spinal fusion (n = 203 789): 8.3% of patients used intensive care unit beds, 2.2% required postoperative mechanical ventilation, 9.2% required red blood cell transfusions, and 9.3% were readmitted within 90 days of surgery. An example of a framework for matching hospital demand with elective surgery supply is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care needs after elective surgery in the United States are consistent and predictable. When these data are overlaid with national hospital capacity models, rational decisions regarding matching supply to demand can be achieved to meet changing needs.","Krishnamoorthy, Vijay; Ohnuma, Tetsu; Bartz, Raquel; Fuller, Matthew; Khandelwal, Nita; Haines, Krista; Scales, Charles; Raghunathan, Karthik",Am J Crit Care,,272

We screened all unselected and consecutive patients who were scheduled for neuro-diagnostic testing in our facility by infrared thermometer, a standard Covid 19 questionnaire and a single Covid 19 PCR nasal/throat swab prior to these tests. 542 consecutive unselected neurological or sleep/wake disorder patients aged 18 - 90, 65% males, 35% females were tested over six months as a part of this project. A total of 1109 diagnostic tests were performed. No test was limited in scope or duration. Standard PPE precautions were still taken despite the negative screening, room door left open and relatives' presence limited during the test procedure. All were afebrile and negative on questionnaire and only 3 were found to be positive for Covid 19 PCR, indicating that a negative infrared temperature reading and a standard Covid 19 questionnaire is over 99 percent effective in prescreening for intimate neurological diagnostic testing. The technician, administering most of these tests, never contracted the virus. The technician collecting the nasal/throat swab never contracted the virus. One PA, two sleep technicians and one medical assistant came down with Covid 19 but were all felt to have contracted that from domestic exposure from family members or friends and not when at the job. All had mild disease and rapidly recovered.

370899,COVID-19 detection via oropharyngeal secretion,2020,"Diabetes is among the most frequently reported comorbidities in patients infected with COVID-19. According to current data, diabetic patients do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population. On the other hand, diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe and critical forms of COVID-19, the latter requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or use of invasive mechanical ventilation, with high mortality rates. The characteristics of diabetic patients at risk for developing severe and critical forms of COVID-19, as well as the prognostic impact of diabetes on the course of COVID-19, are under current investigation. Obesity, the main risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes, is more common in patients with critical forms of COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, COVID-19 is usually associated with poor glycemic control and a higher risk of ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. There are currently no recommendations in favour of discontinuing antihypertensive medications that interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 owing to the risks of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis.

Alternative methods to reach these people have become necessary. We assessed the feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness of video teleconsultation using mobile phones for managing persons with epilepsy (PWEs) on follow-up at a tertiary care center in the southern part of India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included PWEs aged 18â¯years and over who have been evaluated in person within the past six months, with details available in electronic health records (EHRs), and advised regular follow-up after getting telephonic consent. We excluded those requiring emergency care and those seeking teleconsultation for new symptoms. Participants were sent a message in English and in the local language about the possibility of a video teleconsultation. If willing, they were informed about the date, time, and technical requirements such as smartphones, browsing facilities, etc. Feasibility and effectiveness were assessed. Satisfaction/acceptability was assessed using Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: From June 2020 to October 2020, we selected 336 PWEs after screening 1100 records, and we tried video teleconsultation in 141 (41.8%) PWEs. We achieved successful video connections in 95 (28.2%) and audio consultations in 46 (13.6%). The median duration for calling the participants, making successful connections, and consultation was 8 (5-14) min. The majority required two (47.4%) or three (32.6%) attempts. Sixty-five PWEs (68.4%) used caretaker's mobile phones. We gave prescriptions to all, and 18 received new drugs. Out of 95 PWEs, 90% either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' on 12 out of 14 telemedicine satisfaction questions. CONCLUSION: Although we need to make video teleconsultation more feasible, our synchronous mobile video teleconsultation model is an effective and acceptable method to follow up PWEs. This real-time model has the advantage that it does not require any mobile application to be downloaded and installed. Further studies are needed to evaluate methods to improve the reach of these services particularly to vulnerable groups of the population.","Nair, Pradeep Pankajakshan; Aghoram, Rajeswari; Thomas, Bitty; Bharadwaj, Balaji; Chinnakali, Palanivel",Epilepsy Behav,,272

This prospective randomized, controlled study aims to examine the analgesic efficacy and safety profile of ultrasound-guided PECSII versus serratus blocks in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast cancer. Patients and Methods: One-hundred and eighty adult females scheduled for MRM were randomly allocated to three groups. PECS group patients received a PECSII block with 30mL of bupivacaine 0.25%, whereas SAPB group received a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) using the same volume of bupivacaine 0.25% before induction of anesthesia. The control group received general anesthesia alone. Outcomes included 24 hours morphine consumption, intraoperative fentanyl requirements, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain at rest and during movement, time to first rescue analgesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and sedation scores. Results: Both PECSII and serratus blocks were associated with reduced postoperative morphine consumption compared to the control group (p<0.001). Both blocks were associated with reduced intraoperative fentanyl requirements, VAS scores, and PONV as compared with the control group. Also, they were associated with prolonged time to first rescue analgesia and better sedation scores in comparison with the control group. However, there were no differences between both blocks for all outcomes. Conclusion: PECSII and serratus blocks provide similarly adequate analgesia following modified radical mastectomy.

373561,The future is now: a call for action for cardiac telerehabilitation in the COVID-19 pandemic from the secondary prevention and rehabilitation section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology,2020,"The generalized propensity score (GPS) is an extension of the propensity score for use with quantitative or continuous exposures (e.g., dose of medication or years of education). Current GPS methods allow estimation of the dose-response relationship between a single continuous exposure and an outcome. However, in many real-world settings, there are multiple exposures occurring simultaneously that could be causally related to the outcome. We propose a multivariate GPS method (mvGPS) that allows estimation of a dose-response surface that relates the joint distribution of multiple continuous exposure variables to an outcome. The method involves generating weights under a multivariate normality assumption on the exposure variables. Focusing on scenarios with two exposure variables, we show via simulation that the mvGPS method can achieve balance across sets of confounders that may differ for different exposure variables and reduces bias of the treatment effect estimates under a variety of data generating scenarios. We apply the mvGPS method to an analysis of the joint effect of two types of intervention strategies to reduce childhood obesity rates.","Williams, Justin R.; Crespi, Catherine M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13767v1.pdf,272

Hence, a single-phase cannot be sufficient to analyse a distribution network of three-phase lines and one neutral. In this study, Carson's equation, which is a suitable approach for modelling the series impedance and shunt admittance of overhead line, is deployed to analyse a three-phase distribution network for which a computer-based WindMil application is used to verify.

373696,A simple remote nutritional screening tool and practical guidance for nutritional care in primary practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was formally characterized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since that time, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demand for healthcare resources. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in laboratory test utilization in the setting of increasing local incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective assessment of laboratory test order and specimen container utilization at a single, urban tertiary care medical center. Data were extracted from the laboratory information system database over a 10-week period, spanning the primordial inflection of COVID-19 incidence in our region. Total testing volumes were calculated during the first 2 and last 2 weeks of the observation period and used as reference points to examine the absolute and relative differences in test order volume between the prepandemic and COVID-19 surge periods. RESULTS: Between February 2, 2020, and April 11, 2020, there were 873 397 tests ordered and final verified. The in-house SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate for admitted patients in the last week of the observation period was 30.8%. Significant increases in workload were observed in the send-out laboratory section and for COVID-19 diagnosis (PCR) and management-related testing. Otherwise, there was a net decrease in overall demand across nearly all laboratory sections. Increases in testing were noted for tests related to COVID-19 management. Viral transport media and citrated blue top containers demonstrated increases in utilization. CONCLUSION: Increasing local incidence of COVID-19 had a profound impact on laboratory operations. While volume increases were seen for laboratory tests related to COVID-19 diagnostics and management, including some with limited evidence to support their use, overall testing volumes decreased substantially. During events such as COVID-19, monitoring of such patterns can help inform laboratory management, staffing, and test stewardship recommendations for managing resource and supply availability.","Durant, Thomas J S; Peaper, David R; Ferguson, David; Schulz, Wade L",J Appl Lab Med,,272
373876,Is gradual and controlled approach to herd protection a valid strategy to curb the COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Efficiency of care chain response and hospital reactivity were and are challenged for stroke acute care management during the pandemic period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in North-Eastern Italy (Veneto, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Trentino-Alto-Adige), counting 7,193,880 inhabitants (ISTAT), with consequences in acute treatment for patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data collection of patients admitted to stroke units eventually treated with thrombolysis and thrombectomy, ranging from January to May 2020 from the beginning to the end of the main first pandemic period of COVID-19 in Italy. The primary endpoint was the number of patients arriving to these stroke units, and secondary endpoints were the number of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy. Chi-square analysis was used on all patients; furthermore, patients were divided into two cohorts (pre-lockdown and lockdown periods) and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test differences on admission and reperfusive therapies. RESULTS: In total, 2536 patients were included in 22 centers. There was a significant decrease of admissions in April compared to January. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease of thrombectomy during the lockdown period, while thrombolysis rate was unaffected in the same interval across all centers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a decrease in admission rate of stroke patients in a large area of northern Italy during the lockdown period, especially during the first dramatic phase. Overall, there was no decrease in thrombolysis rate, confirming an effect of emergency care system for stroke patients. Instead, the significant decrease in thrombectomy rate during lockdown addresses some considerations of local and regional stroke networks during COVID-19 pandemic evolution.","Manganotti, Paolo; Naccarato, Marcello; Scali, Ilario; Cappellari, Manuel; Bonetti, Bruno; Burlina, Alessandro; Turinese, Emanuele; Bogo, Sabrina; Teatini, Francesco; Franchini, Enrica; Caneve, Giorgio; Ruzza, Giampietro; Gaudenzi, Anna; Bombardi, Roberto; Bozzato, Giulio; Padoan, Roberta; Gentile, Carolina; Rana, Michele; Turazzini, Michelangelo; Alessandra, Danese; Brigo, Francesco; Nardone, Raffaele; Quatrale, Rocco; Menegazzo, Elisabetta; Masato, Maela; Novello, Stefano; Passadore, Paolo; Baldi, Antonio; Valentinis, Luca; Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio; Basile, Anna Maria; Semplicini, Claudio; Piffer, Silvio; Giometto, Bruno; Tonello, Simone; Bonifatti, Domenico Marco; Lorenzut, Simone; Merlino, Giovanni; Valente, Maria Rosaria; Paladin, Francesco; Tonon, Agnese; de Luca, Cristina; Perini, Francesco; Centonze, Sandro; Bovi, Paolo",Neurol. sci,,272
374135,What Should Surgeons Do In Face of the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Beijing Experience,2020,"Purpose of the Study: Viral respiratory diseases, like those caused by novel strains of influenza and Coronaviridae, have historically disproportionately affected pregnant women and conferred increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Initial reports published from Wuhan, China identified only limited symptoms in pregnant women and no cases of mortality, but more recent reports from other regions of the world have reported contrasting information. The purpose of the study was to evaluate initially published cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in China and compare them to subsequently published studies from the remainder of the world. Materials and Methods: This review curates 199 maternal published cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 initially reported in the literature from China and contrasts them to more recent literature reporting clinical findings and outcomes of 729 selected cases from the rest of the world, including the United States. Results: Overall, initial case reports and series from China reported no cases of maternal mortality, which contrasts with subsequent reports from other regions of the world demonstrating significant morbidity and mortality can and does occur in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: While initial reports suggest limited risks of infection in pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2, subsequent findings have demonstrated pregnant women are at risk for severe morbidity and mortality. Case studies and series that are imperative in the early stages of a pandemic to provide data on a novel pathogen cannot be used to provide generalizable information predicting group risks.","Sulentic, Rose O; Seferovic, Maxim D; Aagaard, Kjersti M; Valentine, Gregory C",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,272

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still need to be treated at percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers with relevant safety measures. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the therapeutic outcomes of PCI performed under the safety measures and normal conditions. AMI patients undergoing PCI between January 24 to April 30, 2020 were performed under safety measures for COVID-19. Patients received pulmonary computed tomography (CT) and underwent PCI in negative pressure ICU. Cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) staff and physicians worked with level III personal protection. Demographic and clinical data, such as door-to-balloon (DTB) time, operation time, complications for patients in this period (COVID-19 group) and the same period in 2019 (2019 group) were retrieved and analyzed. COVID-19 and 2019 groups had 37 and 96 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, gender, BMI and comorbidity between the two groups. DTB time and operation time were similar between the two groups (60.0 ± 12.39 vs 58.83 ± 12.85 min, p = 0.636; 61.46 ± 9.91 vs 62.55 ± 10.72 min, p = 0.592). Hospital stay time in COVID-19 group was significantly shorter (6.78 ± 2.14 vs 8.85 ± 2.64 days, p < 0.001). The incidences of malignant arrhythmia and Takotsubo Syndrome in COVID-19 group were higher than 2019 group significantly (16.22% vs 5.21%, p = 0.039; 10.81% vs 1.04% p = 0.008). During hospitalization and 3-month follow-up, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in the two groups were statistically similar (35.13% vs 14.58%, p = 0.094; 16.22% vs 8.33%, p = 0.184). The risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was associated with cardiogenic shock (OR, 11.53; 95% CI, 2.888-46.036; p = 0.001), malignant arrhythmias (OR, 7.176; 95% CI, 1.893-27.203; p = 0.004) and advanced age (&#8805; 75 years) (OR, 6.718; 95% CI, 1.738-25.964; p = 0.006).

Our analysis showed that safety measures undertaken in this hospital, including screening of COVID-19 infection and use of personal protection equipment for conducting PCI did not compromise the surgical outcome as compared with PCI under normal condition, although there were slight increases in incidence of malignant arrhythmia and Takotsubo Syndrome.","Guan, Xiaonan; Zhang, Jianjun; Li, Yanbing; Ma, Ning",Sci Rep,,272
376071,Letter to the Editor: CORR® Curriculum-Orthopaedic Education: What's Best for Medical Students in the COVID-19 Era? Just Ask Them,2021,"Employees around the world have experienced sudden, significant changes in their work and family roles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, applied psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of work-family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a person-centered approach, we examine transitions in employees' work-family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First, in Study 1, using latent profile analysis (N = 379; nonpandemic data), we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment, including beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment), active (medium conflict and enrichment), and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2, with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether employees transition between work-family profiles during the pandemic. Results suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles, positive (from active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation preferences, engaged in emotion-focused coping, experienced higher technostress, and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn, negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g., lower job satisfaction and job performance, and higher turnover intent). We discuss implications for future research and for managing during societal crises, both present and future.

However, no study on somatization in anxiety and its relationship with insomnia has been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, somatization and insomnia and explore the relationships between different psychological states in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A total of 1,172 respondents were recruited from 125 cities in mainland China by an online questionnaire survey. All subjects were evaluated with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: The percentages of anxiety, somatization, and insomnia were 33.02%, 7.59%, and 24.66%, respectively. The prevalence of somatization was 19.38% in participants with anxiety. Compared to the anxiety without somatization group, the anxiety with somatization group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a history of physical disease and insomnia, as well as higher GAD-7 scores and SCL-90 somatization subscores (all p &lt; 0.001). The SCL-90 somatization subscores were positively correlated with age, history of physical disease, GAD-7 scores, and ISI scores (all p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression showed that GAD-7 score, ISI score, and age were risk factors for somatization in the anxious population. Conclusions: Somatic and psychological symptoms were common in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Somatic symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia are closely related, and improving anxiety and sleep quality may help relieve somatic symptoms.","Huang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yanxia; Zeng, Lingyun; Yang, Jiezhi; Song, Xiuli; Rao, Wenwang; Li, Hehua; Ning, Yuping; He, Hongbo; Li, Ting; Wu, Kai; Chen, Fengjuan; Wu, Fengchun; Zhang, Xiangyang",Front.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients included in RELACOEM, a LATAM registry of MS and NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: RELACOEM is a longitudinal, strictly observational registry of MS and NMOSD patients who suffer COVID-19 and Dengue in LATAM. Inclusion criteria to the registry were either: (1) a biologically confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis based on a positive result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab; or (2) COVID-19-typical symptoms (triad of cough, fever, and asthenia) in an epidemic zone of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic and clinical variables. The cohort was later stratified for MS and NMOSD and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with hospitalizations/intensive critical units (ICU) admission. RESULTS: 145 patients were included in the registry from 15 countries and 51 treating physicians. A total of 129 (89%) were MS patients and 16 (11%) NMOSD. 81.4% patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 18.6% were suspected cases. 23 (15.8%) patients were hospitalized, 9 (6.2%) required ICU and 5 (3.4 %) died due to COVID-19. In MS patients, greater age (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.25) and disease duration (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.14-1.69) were associated with hospitalization/ICU. In NMOSD patients, a greater age (54.3 vs. 36 years, p=<0.001), increased EDSS (5.5 vs 2.9, p=0.0012) and disease duration (18.5 vs. 10.3 years, p=0.001) were significantly associated with hospitalization/ICU.

We find that short-term cycles of deaths in Italy in the first days of March, and soon afterwards, cycles of deaths in the world are able to lead out-of-phase US stock market. We find that low frequency cycles of the US market index in the first half of April are useful to anticipate in an anti-phasic way the cycles of deaths in the US. We also explore sectoral contagion, based on dissimilarities, Granger causality and partial coherencies between S&P sector indices.

Are we facing a publication pandemic?",2021,"In the Wuhan Province of China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract leading to an acute respiratory syndrome. Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines ""cytokine storm"" leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.","Tufan, Abdurrahman; Avanoglu Güler, Aslihan; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco",Turk J Med Sci,,272

377612,Saliva: Both a threat and an opportunity in covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The use of Wide Awake Local Anaesthetic No Tourniquet (WALANT) amongst Plastic and Orthopaedic Hand Surgeons has been accelerated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risks of general anaesthesia. Benefits of WALANT include a bloodless field, improved recovery, on-table testing, as well as cost and time savings. Whilst more clinical trials are underway to fully elucidate safety-profile and outcomes, there is a lack of consensus and clarity over contraindications to WALANT. A survey of trainees identified that only one-in-five were aware of the appropriate reversal agent in the event of inadequate perfusion. We feel that a WALANT checklist should be developed and implemented for use immediately prior to administration of local anaesthetic with adrenaline to an extremity, building on the successes of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Royal College of Anaesthetists checklists. Such a checklist should include contraindications to WALANT and make the operator aware of the availability, dose and location of Phentolamine as a reversal agent. Introducing this checklist will help to facilitate safer and more effective use of WALANT within Hand Surgery.","Zargaran, David; Zargaran, Alexander; Nikkhah, Dariush; Mosahebi, Afshin",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,272

In response, we designed a virtual radiation oncology medical student clerkship. Methods and Materials: We convened an advisory panel to design a virtual clerkship curriculum. We implemented clerkship activities using a cloud-based learning management system, video web conferencing systems, and a telemedicine portal. Students completed assessments pre- and postclerkship to provide data to improve future versions of the clerkship. Results: The virtual clerkship spans 2 weeks and is graded pass or fail. Students attend interactive didactic sessions during the first week and participate in virtual clinic and give talks to the department during the second week. Didactic sessions include lectures, case-based discussions, treatment planning seminars, and material adapted from the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group curriculum. Students also attend virtual departmental quality assurance rounds, cancer center seminars, and multidisciplinary tumor boards. The enrollment cap was met during the first virtual clerkship period (April 27 through May 8, 2020), with a total of 12 students enrolling. Conclusions: Our virtual clerkship can increase student exposure and engagement in radiation oncology.

380223,COVID-19: a new turning point for dental practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disorder related to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 ±63 vs 36.2 ±67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination. CONCLUSIONS: To maintain ERT, FD patients prefer home infusions or those given in the nearest hospital, especially during a pandemic.","Kusztal, Mariusz; Klopotowski, Mariusz; Bazan-Socha, Stanislawa; Blazejewska-Hyzorek, Beata; Pawlaczyk, Krzysztof; Oko, Andrzej; Krajewska, Magdalena; Nowicki, Michal",Adv Clin Exp Med,,272
380715,Sports Medicine Considerations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates adherence to scientifically supported prevention strategies, such as social distancing. Although most Americans support social distancing, a subset of conservatives reject the scientific consensus on this matter. We explored why some conservatives reject social distancing, focusing on how trust in science contributes to ideological differences in social distancing intentions. In two studies, we replicated recent research demonstrating that conservatives report lower support for social distancing compared to liberals. However, in Study 1 we found support for a moderating role of trust in science, such that conservatives reported stronger intentions to socially distance when they had high trust in science. In Study 2, we enhanced trust in messaging about social distancing - and in turn, social distancing intentions among conservatives - by having the messages come from a Republican (vs. unidentified) government official. These studies provide insight into how we can increase adherence to public health recommendations regarding COVID-19.","Koetke, J.; Schumann, K.; Porter, T.",Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations,,272

381243,"COVID-19 and Trauma Care: Improvise, Adapt and Overcome!",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Women with terminal cancer are assumed to choose hospice care over aggressive treatment at the end of life. With new chemotherapy and target therapy options, it becomes more difficult to decide between hospice care and aggressive management. It is also crucial to consider the cost increases leading to severe financial burdens on healthcare systems. To better understand treatment options at the individual level, this study set out to describe trends in end-of-life care for the four leading cancers in women in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The data source was obtained between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 98,575 women with a diagnosis of breast (18,596), colorectal (23,734), liver and biliary (28,795) or lung (27,450) cancer who had died during the study period. Hospital data for services provided in the last 6 months of life, including hospice services and aggressive managements (chemotherapy, frequent hospitalisation, emergency room [ER] visits, intensive care unit [ICU] admission and endotracheal intubation), were collected. RESULTS: Hospice utilisation increased over the study period, with 25.85%, 25.34%, 21.23% and 26.55% of female patients with breast, colorectal, liver and biliary, and lung cancer receiving hospice care, respectively. However, the number of women undergoing aggressive treatments in the last 6 months of life remained high, with the breast cancer group having the highest chemotherapy rate, the colorectal cancer group having frequent hospitalisation and the liver and biliary cancer group having frequent ER visits and ICU admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing hospice utilisation among women with the four most common cancers in Taiwan indicates that hospice services have gradually become well accepted over the past 13 years; however, the real focus is on the ineffective treatment preceding hospice care, and late referral was also a notable problem.","Pan, H-J; Chang, H-T; Huang, W-C; Lin, H-C",Public Health,,272

This paper develops a procedure to estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy under limited supply, exploiting social network data containing individual demographic characteristics and health status. We model spillover effects of the vaccines based on a Heterogeneous-Interacted-SIR network model and estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy by maximizing an estimated social welfare (public health) criterion incorporating the spillovers. While this optimization problem is generally an NP-hard integer optimization problem, we show that the SIR structure leads to a submodular objective function, and provide a computationally attractive greedy algorithm for approximating a solution that has theoretical performance guarantee. Moreover, we characterise a finite sample welfare regret bound and examine how its uniform convergence rate depends on the complexity and riskiness of social network. In the simulation, we illustrate the importance of considering spillovers by comparing our method with targeting without network information.","Kitagawa, Toru; Wang, Guanyi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04055v4.pdf,272

OBJECTIVE: We attempt to better understand the relationship of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based, observational study. All patients with normal baseline QTc interval who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at two hospitals in Ohio, USA were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had QTc prolongation, and 210 patients continued to have normal QTc during hospitalization. The baseline QTc intervals were comparable in the two groups. Patients with QTc prolongation were older (mean age 67 vs. 60, P 0.003), more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease (48% versus 26%, P 0.001), ischemic heart disease (29% versus 17%, P 0.026), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (16% versus 8%, P 0.042), chronic kidney disease (23% versus 10%, P 0.005), and end-stage renal disease (12% versus 1%, P < 0.001). Patients with QTc prolongation were more likely to have received hydroxychloroquine (75% versus 59%, P 0.018), azithromycin (18% vs. 14%, P 0.034), a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (29% vs 7%, P < 0.001), more than 1 QT prolonging agents (59% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Patients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) were less likely to develop QTc prolongation (11% versus 26%, P 0.014). QTc prolongation was not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, ESRD, underlying cardiovascular disease, potential virus mediated cardiac injury, and drugs like hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, contribute to QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients. The role of ACEi in preventing QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients needs to be studied further.","Changal, Khalid; Paternite, David; Mack, Sean; Veria, Spiro; Bashir, Rehana; Patel, Mitra; Soni, Ronak; Ali, Muhammad; Mir, Tanveer; Sheikh, Mujeeb; Ramanathan, P Kasi",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,272

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","Wang, Xiaohan; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Chen, Haiqian; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,,272

In this generic setting for confined motion we demonstrate that LWs equilibrate exponentially and may assume a bimodal stationary distribution. We also show that the stationary distribution has a horizontal slope next to a reflecting boundary placed at the origin, in contrast to correlated superdiffusive processes. Our results generalize LWs to confining forces and settle some long-standing puzzles around LWs.","Xu, Pengbo; Zhou, Tian; Metzler, Ralf; Deng, Weihua",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09775v1.pdf,272

The high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in the circulation of COVID-19 patients with severe lung disease suggest the involvement of the innate immune system in this process.

This paper sets out a hypothetical case of Patient X (who is a nurse) and Patient Y (who is a non-health care worker). They are both in need of a ventilator due to COVID-19 with the same clinical situation and expected outcomes. However, there is only one ventilator available. In addressing the question of who should get priority, the proposal is made that the answer may lie in how the pandemic is metaphorically described using military terms. If nursing is understood to take place at the 'frontline' in the 'battle' against COVID-19, a principle of military medical ethics-namely the principle of salvage-can offer guidance on how to prioritise access to a life-saving resource in such a situation. This principle of salvage purports a moral direction to return wounded soldiers back to duty on the battlefield. Applying this principle to the hypothetical case, this paper proposes that Patient X (who is a nurse) should get priority of access to the ventilator so that he/she can return to the 'frontline' in the fight against COVID-19.","Kearns, Alan J",Nurs Inq,,272

Their urgent deployment was defended with modelling and observational data of spurious credibility. There is major debate on whether these measures are effective and there is also uncertainty about the magnitude of the harms that these measures might induce. Given that there is equipoise for how, when and if specific social distancing interventions for COVID-19 should be applied and removed/modified during reopening, we argue that informative randomised-controlled trials are needed. Only a few such randomised trials have already been conducted, but the ones done to-date demonstrate that a randomised trials agenda is feasible. We discuss here issues of study design choice, selection of comparators (intervention and controls), choice of outcomes and additional considerations for the conduct of such trials.

Materials and Methods: This was a single center, retrospective, descriptive and observational study using cross-sectional data, which were collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients at a tertiary education hospital. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality rates, and the factors associated with hospitalization were analyzed. Result: By May 15, 2020, 480 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital where 49 (10.2%) of whom were HCWs. The mean age was 40.0 ± 8.45 (75.5% female). The most common symptoms were cough (32.7%), fever (30.6%), and myalgia (14.3%). Comorbidities were present in 32.7% of the patients. Most of the HCWs were nurses (53.1%) and physicians (18.4%), and the remaining 14 (28.6%) were cleaning and administrative staff. The severity of the disease was mild in 65.3% and severe in 34.7% HCWs. Leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet values were statistically lower in hospitalized patients. There was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of infiltration on the chest X-ray, and the patient's symptoms with the severity of the disease (respectively p= 0.002 and 0.009). Conclusions: In conclusion, the frequency of COVID-19 in healthcare workers is high.

The diagnosis of acute infection relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from health-care staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS: The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a combined testing strategy utilizing assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay. This study provides an important indicator of prior infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.","Heffernan, Emma; Kennedy, Lisa; Hannan, Margaret M; Ramlaul, Navneet; Denieffe, Stephanie; Courtney, Garry; Watt, Alison; Hurley, John; Lynch, Maureen; Fitzgibbon, Maria",Ann Clin Biochem,,272

The outbreak was characterised by a rapid increase in case numbers and a comparatively high crude case fatality ratio (CFR; 11%). Until the beginning of May 2020, 1122 cases were reported in the district. To investigate the outbreak, we analysed surveillance and other data available at the district health department, including data on cases living in care facilities and public health measures applied. Furthermore, we compared the number of tests performed in Tirschenreuth and in Germany as a whole. We interviewed the first 110 cases in order to investigate potential exposures at the beginning of the outbreak. We found that returning ski-travellers from Austria and Italy and early undetected community transmission likely initiated the outbreak which was then accelerated by Bavarian beer festivities. Testing of mainly acute cases in the district of Tirschenreuth resulted in a higher rate of positive tests compared to the whole of Germany. Despite adjustment for age, the CFR continued to exceed the German mean which was due to spread to vulnerable populations. Strict public health measures likely contributed to control the outbreak by mid-April 2020.","Brandl, M; Selb, R; Seidl-Pillmeier, S; Marosevic, D; Buchholz, U; Rehmet, S",Epidemiol Infect,,272

391539,How the COVID-19 pandemic changed cellular therapy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital,2020,"BackgroundThe serological evaluations of IgG, IgM, and IgA to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins are widely used for the epidemiological assessment of COVID-19. The Health Care Workers (HCWs) are presumably exposed to a higher risk of acquiring the disease owing to their regular contact with the patients. MethodsCOVID-19 prevalence was investigated by classifying 313 HCWs into four groups based on their degree of exposure and estimating the IgG and total antibody. The serological assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was conducted 21 days post-vaccination of first or both doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among 174 HCWs. The vaccinated HCWs were followed up for 3 months for SARS-CoV-2 infection. FindingsThe levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were comparable among different groups, but the seroprevalence gradually decreased from the most exposed to the less exposed group. The neutralizing antibody was positively correlated with IgG as well as total antibody. IgG was marginally decreased after 2 months followed by a significant drop after 4-6 months post-infection. However, 80% of the HCWs developed a detectable amount of IgG after the first dose of vaccination, the median titer of which was comparable to the seropositive HCWs after natural infection. Almost 100% of the HCWs developed antibodies after the second dose of vaccine with boosting effect among the seropositive HCWs. Although [~]11.5% of the vaccinated HCWs were infected with the SARS-CoV-2, [~]94% of them showed mild symptoms and recovered in home isolation without any O2 support. InterpretationsThe varying level of seroprevalence among the four groups suggested stratified spread of the disease. One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was found to be effective in terms of the antibody titer, while the second dose was required to cover the larger population.

It is hypothesized the epidemic is differentially progressing in different countries. AIM: To investigate how the COVID-19 epidemic is going on in different countries by analyzing representative countries. METHODS: The status of COVID-19 epidemic in over 60 most affected countries was characterized. The data of daily new cases of each country were collected from Worldometer. The data of daily tests for the United States, Italy, and South Korea were collected from the Website of One World Data. Levels of daily positive COVID-19 tests in the two most affected states of the United States (New York and New Jersey) were collected from the website of the COVID Tracking Project. Statistics were analyzed using Microcal Origin software with ANOVA algorithm, and significance level was set at a P value of 0.05. RESULTS: The COVID-19 epidemic was differentially progressing in different countries. Comparative analyses of daily new cases as of April 19, 2020 revealed that 61 most affected countries can be classified into four types: Downward (22), upward (20), static-phase (12), and uncertain ones (7). In particular, the 12 static-phase countries including the United States were characterized by largely constant numbers of daily new cases in the past over 14 d. Furthermore, these static-phase countries were overall significantly lower in testing density (P = 0.016) but higher in the level of positive COVID-19 tests than downward countries (P = 0.028). These findings suggested that the testing capacity in static-phase countries was lagging behind the spread of the outbreak, i.e., daily new cases (confirmed) were likely less than daily new infections and the remaining undocumented infections were thus still expanding, resulting in unstoppable epidemic. CONCLUSION: Increasing the testing capacity and/or reducing the COVID-19 transmission are urgently needed to stop the potentially unstoppable, severing crisis in static-phase countries.","Long, Cheng; Fu, Xin-Miao; Fu, Zhi-Fu",World J Clin Cases,,272

393815,"Making a complex dental care tailored to the person: population health in focus of predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 mortality rate in Belgium has been ranked among the highest in the world. To assess the appropriateness of the country's COVID-19 mortality surveillance, that includes long-term care facilities deaths and deaths in possible cases, the number of COVID-19 deaths was compared with the number of deaths from all-cause mortality. Mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic was also compared with historical mortality rates from the last century including those of the Spanish influenza pandemic. METHODS: Excess mortality predictions and COVID-19 mortality data were analysed for the period March 10th to June 21st 2020. The number of COVID-19 deaths and the COVID-19 mortality rate per million were calculated for hospitals, nursing homes and other places of death, according to diagnostic status (confirmed/possible infection). To evaluate historical mortality, monthly mortality rates were calculated from January 1900 to June 2020. RESULTS: Nine thousand five hundred ninety-one COVID-19 deaths and 39,076 deaths from all-causes were recorded, with a correlation of 94% (Spearman's rho, p < 0,01). During the period with statistically significant excess mortality (March 20th to April 28th; total excess mortality 64.7%), 7917 excess deaths were observed among the 20,159 deaths from all-causes. In the same period, 7576 COVID-19 deaths were notified, indicating that 96% of the excess mortality were likely attributable to COVID-19. The inclusion of deaths in nursing homes doubled the COVID-19 mortality rate, while adding deaths in possible cases increased it by 27%. Deaths in laboratory-confirmed cases accounted for 69% of total COVID-19-related deaths and 43% of in-hospital deaths. Although the number of deaths was historically high, the monthly mortality rate was lower in April 2020 compared to the major fatal events of the last century. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in all-cause mortality during the first wave of the epidemic was a key indicator to validate the Belgium's high COVID-19 mortality figures. A COVID-19 mortality surveillance limited to deaths from hospitalised and selected laboratory-confirmed cases would have underestimated the magnitude of the epidemic. Excess mortality, daily and monthly number of deaths in Belgium were historically high classifying undeniably the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic as a fatal event.","Bustos Sierra, Natalia; Bossuyt, Nathalie; Braeye, Toon; Leroy, Mathias; Moyersoen, Isabelle; Peeters, Ilse; Scohy, Aline; Van der Heyden, Johan; Van Oyen, Herman; Renard, Françoise",Arch Public Health,,272

394908,Are aptitude tests the solution to widening participation during COVID-19?,2021,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to evaluate smell and taste dysfunction (STD) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive and negative patients, and to assess the factors associated with STD in COVID-19 positive patients. METHODS: Patients who had been tested with the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 were identified, and according to the RT-PCR test results, patients were separated into Positive and Negative Groups. A telephone-based assessment was applied to both groups using the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Anosmia Reporting Tool. Patients in Positive Group were also asked to rate STD, nasal breathing, and anxiety in three different time periods (pre-/during-/post-COVID) using the visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: A total of 53 COVID-19 positive and 51 negative patients completed the surveys. STD was eightfold more frequent (OR 8.19; CI 95% 3.22-20.84) in the Positive Group. Of the 53 COVID-19 positive patients, 32 reported STD and 21 did not. 'Ground-glass appearance' on chest-computed tomography was more frequent and median lymphocyte count was significantly lower in COVID-19 positive patients with STD. During-COVID STD and nasal breathing VAS scores were significantly lower than the pre- and post-COVID scores. During-COVID STD scores were significantly correlated with anxiety scores (Spearman's rho-0.404, p = 0.022) but not correlated with nasal breathing scores. CONCLUSION: STD may be related to increased inflammatory response as well as damage of olfactory neuronal pathway or non-neuronal olfactory mucosa. Understanding the exact cause of chemosensory impairment in COVID-19 can be helpful in explaining the pathophysiology of the disease.","Kavaz, Esra; Tahir, Emel; Bilek, Heval Can; Kemal, Özgür; Deveci, Aydin; Aksakal Tanyel, Esra",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,272

Despite new guidelines being published recently, a number of important questions remained unanswered including the role of taxis, as initial non-operative management. This is particularly relevant now due to the possibility of a lack of immediate surgical care as a result of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to assess the role of taxis in the management of emergency inguinal hernias. METHODS: A review of the literature was undertaken. Available literature published until March 2019 was obtained and reviewed. 32,021 papers were identified, only 9 were of sufficient value to be used. RESULTS: There was a large discrepancy in the terminology of incarcerated/strangulated used. Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients. The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind. Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged. CONCLUSIONS: The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency surgery remains the mainstay of management in the strangulated hernia setting.","East, B; Pawlak, M; de Beaux, A C",Hernia,,272

398833,COVID-19 and residential care facilities: issues and concerns identified by the international network prevention of elder abuse (INPEA),2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.Importance:The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","de Vries, Maren; Mohamed, Adil S; Prescott, Rachel A; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Desvignes, Ludovic; O039,; Connor, Rebecca; Steppan, Claire; Devlin, Joseph C; Ivanova, Ellie; Herrera, Alberto; Schinlever, Austin; Loose, Paige; Ruggles, Kelly; Koralov, Sergei B; Anderson, Annaliesa S; Binder, Joseph; Dittmann, Meike",J. virol,,272

398840,The power of social isolation on paediatric emergency visits during COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published several guidelines addressing the medical health services helping to detect SARS CoV­2. Needing an available and specific test strategy regarding SARS-CoV­2, our own test strategy strictly followed these testing criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective analysis, we verified if such a test strategy was an effective tool in the context of infection prevention control and as reliable SARS-CoV­2 detection. Therefore, we analysed our own test results of suspected SARS-CoV­2 cases between 26 February and 6 April 2020. Additionally, we used a geovisualisation tool to visualise test frequencies and positive test results within different districts of Mannheim based on people's addresses. RESULTS: There were on average 7% positive test results of SARS-CoV­2 within a population with typical symptoms of COVID-19 (nâ¯= 2808). There was no positive test result within an asymptomatic population (nâ¯= 448). However, one positive test result turned out to be a nosocomial infection. Finally, geovisualisation highlighted a shift of test frequencies and local positive rates for SARS-CoV­2 from one district of Mannheim to another. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our test strategy strictly based on testing criteria suggested by the Robert Koch Institute resulted in a steady rate of positive tests and allowed us to increase test capacity without causing numbers of nosocomial infections of COVID-19. Geovisualisation tools can offer support in analysing an ongoing spread of transmissible diseases. In the future, they could be used as helpful tools for infection prevention control, for example in the context of vaccination programs.","Trimborn, Anna; Gerigk, Marlis; Heininger, Alexandra; Santhanam, Nandhini; Walter, Thomas; Lange, Bettina",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,272
398939,The Stanford Hall consensus statement for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation,2020,"Purpose: This is mainly because the restrictive condition of intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy number (IHFN) is relaxed by the membership functions of Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy number (PyPHFN), so the range of domain value of PyPHFN is greatly expanded. The paper aims to develop a novel decision-making technique based on aggregation operators under PyPHFNs. For this, the authors propose Algebraic operational laws using algebraic norm for PyPHFNs. Furthermore, a list of aggregation operators, namely Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted average (PyPHFWA) operator, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (PyPHFWG) operator, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted average (PyPHFOWA) operator, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (PyPHFOWG) operator, Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted average (PyPHFHWA) operator and Pythagorean probabilistic hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric (PyPHFHWG) operator, are proposed based on the defined algebraic operational laws. Also, interesting properties of these aggregation operators are discussed in detail. Design/methodology/approach: PyPHFN is not only a generalization of the traditional IHFN, but also a more effective tool to deal with uncertain multi-attribute decision-making problems. Findings: In addition, the authors design the algorithm to handle the uncertainty in emergency decision-making issues. At last, a numerical case study of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an emergency decision-making is introduced to show the implementation and validity of the established technique. Besides, the comparison of the existing and the proposed technique is established to show the effectiveness and validity of the established technique.

METHOD: The study included 14 patients infected with COVID-19 who had presented to the Erzurum City Hospital Emergency Department between August 2020 and December 2020 with the complaint of renal colic in which distal ureteral stones were detected in the tests. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients, laboratory and radiological examinations, characteristics of ureteral stones, details of treatments applied to patients, treatment procedures of patients who had undergone surgical treatment, patient files, visit and operation notes and the patient discharge reports were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 14 patients. The average age of the patients was 35.7 (±14.35). The average stone size was 6.2 (±1.8) mm. Analgesic treatment and MET for distal ureteral stones were begun in 11 (78.6%) of the patients. Pain control was achieved in nine patients (64.2%) with analgesic treatment and MET, and the stone was removed without invasive intervention. Surgical intervention was performed in a total of five patients (35.7%). CONCLUSION: In most COVID-19 infected patients with renal colic and a distal ureteral stone, results can be obtained using MET. Patients with a distal ureteral stone and persistent renal colic can be safely and effectively treated by endoscopic ureteral stone treatment after taking necessary precautions. Prospective, randomised, and controlled studies are required on this subject.","Demirdogen, Saban Oguz; Cinislioglu, Ahmet Emre; Cinislioglu, Nazan; Altay, Mehmet Sefa; Karabulut, Ibrahim; Polat, Ozkan; Adanur, Senol",Int J Clin Pract,,272

We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Twenty-nine patient files were investigated in group 1 and group 2 was created with 52 consecutive patients with COVID-19 having age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, and disease course. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of inhospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in the group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay, and transferred to intensive care unit were found to be statistically significantly higher in the group 1. In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared with consecutive patients with COVID-19 presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters.","Ikitimur, Hande; Borku Uysal, Betul; Cengiz, Mahir; Ikitimur, Baris; Uysal, Harun; Ozcan, Erkan; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Seyhan, Serhat; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",J. med. virol,,272

A growing body of journalistic accounts raised the possibility that the lockdown caused by the pandemic affects women and men in different ways, due mostly to the traditionally gendered division of labor in the society. We attempt to test this oft-cited argument by conducting an original survey with nearly 200 academics. Specifically, we explore the extent to which the effect of the lockdown on child-care, housework and home-office environment varies across women and men. Our results show that a number of factors are associated with the effect of the lockdown on the work conditions of academics at home, including gender, having children, perceived threat from COVID-19, and satisfaction with work environment. We also show that having children disproportionately affects women in terms of the amount of housework during the lockdown.","Yildirim, T Murat; Eslen-Ziya, Hande","Gender, work and organization",,272

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate current internet and social media usage for breast reconstruction patients and its impact on patients. METHODS: Eighty-six breast reconstruction patients over a 7-month period answered an anonymous survey, which queried demographics, reconstruction type, internet usage, social media usage, expectations, and impact on decisions. Fisher's exact test was performed to evaluate the use of social media. RESULTS: 95% of patients used the internet for breast reconstruction information. The information was easy to understand 70%, helpful 76%, and trustworthy 60%. The information influenced decisions regarding procedure 23%, surgeon 23%, and hospital 22%. Social media was used 71% of the time. 62% found it easy to understand, 57% helpful, and 48% trustworthy. The information influenced decisions regarding procedure 16%, surgeon 11%, and hospital 10%. 26% of women expected final breast reconstruction appearance to look better than their native pre-mastectomy breasts, 55% as good or similar, and 12% reported appearance as being unimportant. Women found social media information to be less helpful than internet information. There was no significant association between expectations and social media versus no social media usage. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo breast reconstruction use the internet and social media for their information. Though the information is generally trusted, it does not seem to heavily influence patient decision making. Providers remain patient's main source of information, and need to direct patients to quality and accessible resources.","Nguyen, Jonathan; Thompson, Peter; Losken, Albert",,,272

The primary objective of our analysis was to categorize online, open-source guidance to determine how US institutions approached their recommendations for management of patients with COVID-19 in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A search for open-source, online institutional guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted using predefined criteria. The search was limited to the United States and conducted from April 12 through 14, 2020, and again on April 22, 2020. Searches were conducted at 2 points in time in order to identify changes in treatment recommendations due to evolving literature or institutional experience. Treatment recommendations, including guidance on antiviral therapy, corticosteroid and interleukin-6 inhibitor use, and nutritional supplementation were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 institutions that met initial screening criteria, 14 institutions (13.3%) had online COVID-19 guidance available. Supportive care and clinical trial enrollment were the primary recommendations in all evaluated guidance. Recommendations to consider antimicrobial and adjunctive therapy varied. Eighty-six percent of guidelines contained recommendations for use, or consideration of use, of hydroxychloroquine. Guidance from 2 institutions mentioned use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in combination. Of the 13 institutions listing hydroxychloroquine dosing recommendations, 62% recommended maintenance dosing of 200 mg twice daily. Infectious diseases or other specialty consultation was required by 89% of institutions using interleukin-6 inhibitors for COVID-19 management. CONCLUSION: Overall, the analysis revealed variability in treatment or supplemental pharmacologic therapy for the management of COVID-19.","Collins, Curtis D; Huang, Jean; Potoski, Brian A",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,272

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.","Wang, K; Kang, S; Tian, R; Zhang, X; Wang, Y",Clin Radiol,,272

However, the specific active compounds responsible for the individual pharmacological effects of in R. rugosa extract (95% EtOH) remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that terpenoid structure, the most abundant constituents in R. rugosa extract, are responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity. We investigated the phytochemical substituents (compounds 1-13) and newly purified 11-methoxy polisin A, and 13-methoxy bisaborosaol F using NMR and ESI-MS and to screened their effects on NO production in LPS-induced macrophages. Rugosic acid A (RA) induced to ameliorate NO production, iNOS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with the NF-&#954;B. And, RA suppressed IL-6 secretion and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in LPS-mediated inflammation. In addition, RA was evaluated in LPS-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) model similar to acute pneumonia. Our results suggested that RA was suppressed to translocate nuclear NF-&#954;B and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Finally, RA led to amelioration of ALI by decreasing myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3. Our group originally found that R. rugosa extract had new methoxy compounds and RA may be alternative natural agent for acute pneumonia similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus.","Kim, Kang-Hoon; Park, Ye-Ji; Jang, Hyun-Jae; Lee, Seung-Jae; Lee, Soyoung; Yun, Bong-Sik; Lee, Seung Woong; Rho, Mun-Chual",Phytother Res,,272

Early and accurate diagnosis and quarantine remain the most effective mitigation strategy. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, recent studies suggest that nucleic acids were undetectable in a significant number of cases with clinical features of COVID-19. Serologic assays that detect human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as a complementary method to diagnose these cases, as well as to identify asymptomatic cases and qualified convalescent serum donors. However, commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are laborious and non-quantitative, while point-of-care assays suffer from low detection accuracy. To provide a serologic assay with high performance and portability for potential point-of-care applications, we developed DNA-assisted nanopore sensing for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 related antibodies in human serum. Different DNA structures were used as detection reporters for multiplex quantification of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens from patients with conformed or suspected infection. Comparing to a clinically used point-of-care assay and an ELISA assay, our technology can reliably quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with higher accuracy, large dynamic range, and potential for assay automation.","Zhang, Zehui; Wang, Xiaoqin; Wei, Xiaojun; Zheng, Sophia W; Lenhart, Brian J; Xu, Peisheng; Li, Jie; Pan, Jing; Albrecht, Helmut; Liu, Chang",Biosens Bioelectron,,272

In countries of the Global South, due to often weaker socioeconomic options and health care systems, effective local countermeasures remain debated. We combine large-scale socioeconomic and traffic survey data with detailed agent-based simulations of local transportation to analyze COVID-19 spreading in a regional model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in South Africa under a range of countermeasure scenarios. The simulations indicate that any realistic containment strategy, including those similar to the one ongoing in South Africa, may yield a manifold overload of available intensive care units (ICUs). Only immediate and the most severe countermeasures, up to a complete lock-down that essentially inhibits all joint human activities, can contain the epidemic effectively. As South Africa exhibits rather favorable conditions compared to many other countries of the Global South, our findings constitute rough conservative estimates and may support identifying strategies towards containing COVID-19 as well as any major future pandemics in these countries.","Bossert, Andreas; Kersting, Moritz; Timme, Marc; Schroder, Malte; Feki, Azza; Coetzee, Justin; Schluter, Jan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05513v1.pdf,272

410312,Anxiety and depression during pregnancy in the era of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Precise differential diagnosis between acute viral and bacterial infections is important to enable appropriate therapy, avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and optimize the use of hospital resources. A systems view of host response to infections provides opportunities for discovering sensitive and robust molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We combine blood transcriptomes from six independent datasets (n = 756) with a knowledge-based human protein-protein interaction network, identifies subnetworks capturing host response to each infection class, and derives common response cores separately for viral and bacterial infections. We subject the subnetworks to a series of computational filters to identify a parsimonious gene panel and a standalone diagnostic score that can be applied to individual samples. We rigorously validate the panel and the diagnostic score in a wide range of publicly available datasets and in a newly developed Bangalore-Viral Bacterial (BL-VB) cohort. FINDING: We discover a 10-gene blood-based biomarker panel (Panel-VB) that demonstrates high predictive performance to distinguish viral from bacterial infections, with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) in eleven independent datasets (n = 898). We devise a new stand-alone patient-wise score (VB10) based on the panel, which shows high diagnostic accuracy with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.98) in 2996 patient samples from 56 public datasets from 19 different countries. Further, we evaluate VB10 in a newly generated South Indian (BL-VB, n = 56) cohort and find 97% accuracy in the confirmed cases of viral and bacterial infections. We find that VB10 is (a) capable of accurately identifying the infection class in culture-negative indeterminate cases, (b) reflects recovery status, and (c) is applicable across different age groups, covering a wide spectrum of acute bacterial and viral infections, including uncharacterized pathogens. We tested our VB10 score on publicly available COVID-19 data and find that our score detected viral infection in patient samples. INTERPRETATION: Our results point to the promise of VB10 as a diagnostic test for precise diagnosis of acute infections and monitoring recovery status. We expect that it will provide clinical decision support for antibiotic prescriptions and thereby aid in antibiotic stewardship efforts.

METHODS: Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 22, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed. with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. COVID-19 disease severity was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE) or LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (all outcomes: low QoE). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have an effect on AEs or severe AEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.","Roman, Yuani M; Burela, Paula Alejandra; Pasupuleti, Vinay; Piscoya, Alejandro; Vidal, Jose E; Hernandez, Adrian V",Clin. infect. dis,,272
412107,Risk estimation of SUDEP during COVID-19 pandemic era in a tertiary referral center,2021,"Demographic changes increase the necessity to base the pension system more and more on the second and the third pillar, namely the occupational and private pension plans; this paper deals with Target Date Funds (TDFs), which are a typical investment opportunity for occupational pension planners. TDFs are usually identified with a decreasing fraction of wealth invested in equity (a so-called glide path) as retirement comes closer, i.e., wealth is invested more risky the younger the saver is. We investigate whether this is actually optimal in the presence of non-tradable income risk in a stochastic volatility environment. The retirement planning procedure is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. We find it is the (random) contributions that induce the optimal path exhibiting a glide path structure, both in the constant and stochastic volatility environment. Moreover, the initial wealth and the initial contribution made to a retirement account strongly influence the fractional amount of wealth to be invested in risky assets. The risk aversion of an individual mainly determines the steepness of the glide path.","Bosserhoff, Frank; Chen, An; Sorensen, Nils; Stadje, Mitja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08956v1.pdf,272

However, there is no clear evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be different across SES in Portugal. This work identifies the COVID-19 worst-affected municipalities at four different time points in Portugal measured by prevalence of cases, and seeks to determine if these worst-affected areas are associated with SES. METHODS: The worst-affected areas were defined using the spatial scan statistic for the cumulative number of cases per municipality. The likelihood of being in a worst-affected area was then modelled using logistic regressions, as a function of area-based SES and health services supply. The analyses were repeated at four different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: 1st of April, 1st of May, 1st of June, and 1st of July, corresponding to two moments before and during the confinement period and two moments thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty municipalities were identified as worst-affected areas in all four time points, most in the coastal area in the Northern part of the country. The areas of lower unemployment were less likely to be a worst-affected area on the 1st of April [AOR = 0.36 (0.14; 0.91)], on the 1st of May [AOR = 0.03 (0.00; 0.41)], and on the 1st of July [AOR = 0.40 (0.16; 1.05)]. CONCLUSION: This study shows a relationship between being in a worst-affected area and unemployment. Governments and public health authorities should formulate measures and be prepared to protect the most vulnerable groups.","Alves, Joana; Soares, Patrícia; Rocha, João Victor; Santana, Rui; Nunes, Carla",Eur. j. public health,,272

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Volume, Management, and Outcomes of Acute Appendicitis in a Nationwide, Multicenter Analysis",2021,"We consider inference from non-random samples in data-rich settings where high-dimensional auxiliary information is available both in the sample and the target population, with survey inference being a special case. We propose a regularized prediction approach that predicts the outcomes in the population using a large number of auxiliary variables such that the ignorability assumption is reasonable while the Bayesian framework is straightforward for quantification of uncertainty. Besides the auxiliary variables, inspired by Little&An (2004), we also extend the approach by estimating the propensity score for a unit to be included in the sample and also including it as a predictor in the machine learning models. We show through simulation studies that the regularized predictions using soft Bayesian additive regression trees yield valid inference for the population means and coverage rates close to the nominal levels. We demonstrate the application of the proposed methods using two different real data applications, one in a survey and one in an epidemiology study.","Liu, Yutao; Gelman, Andrew; Chen, Qixuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05192v1.pdf,272

Here, we have carried out comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction and viral protein localization analyses for all three viruses. Subsequent functional genetic screening identified host factors that functionally impinge on coronavirus proliferation, including Tom70, a mitochondrial chaperone protein that interacts with both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b, an interaction we structurally characterized using cryo-electron microscopy. Combining genetically validated host factors with both COVID-19 patient genetic data and medical billing records identified molecular mechanisms and potential drug treatments that merit further molecular and clinical study.","Gordon, David E; Hiatt, Joseph; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Rezelj, Veronica V; Ulferts, Svenja; Braberg, Hannes; Jureka, Alexander S; Obernier, Kirsten; Guo, Jeffrey Z; Batra, Jyoti; Kaake, Robyn M; Weckstein, Andrew R; Owens, Tristan W; Gupta, Meghna; Pourmal, Sergei; Titus, Erron W; Cakir, Merve; Soucheray, Margaret; McGregor, Michael; Cakir, Zeynep; Jang, Gwendolyn; O039,; Meara, Matthew J; Tummino, Tia A; Zhang, Ziyang; Foussard, Helene; Rojc, Ajda; Zhou, Yuan; Kuchenov, Dmitry; Hüttenhain, Ruth; Xu, Jiewei; Eckhardt, Manon; Swaney, Danielle L; Fabius, Jacqueline M; Ummadi, Manisha; Tutuncuoglu, Beril; Rathore, Ujjwal; Modak, Maya; Haas, Paige; Haas, Kelsey M; Naing, Zun Zar Chi; Pulido, Ernst H; Shi, Ying; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Memon, Danish; Petsalaki, Eirini; Dunham, Alistair; Marrero, Miguel Correa; Burke, David; Koh, Cassandra; Vallet, Thomas",Science (Wash.),,272

There is also evidence of possible links among COVID-19, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Emerging evidence suggests a pro-inflammatory milieu and hypercoagulable state in patients with this infection. Despite anticoagulation, a large proportion of patients requiring intensive care may develop life-threatening thrombotic complications. Indeed, the levels of some markers of hemostatic activation, such as D-dimer, are commonly elevated in COVID-19, indicating potential risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. In this review, we critically examine and discuss aspects of hypercoagulability and inflammation in COVID-19 and the possible benefits of statins in this scenario, with emphasis on their underlying molecular mechanisms. Moreover, we present recommendations on the use of antiviral drugs in combination with statins.","Ferrari, Filipe; Martins, Vítor M; Teixeira, Marcelo; Santos, Raul D; Stein, Ricardo",Clinics,,272

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of addition of TOC to standard of care (SOC) versus SOC in patients with COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, WHO COVID, LitCOVID, and Cochrane databases. Pooled outcomes (overall mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and secondary infections) were compared using DerSimonian-Laird/Random-effects approach. Risk difference (RD), confidence interval (CI), and p values were generated. A total of 23 studies with 6279 patients (1897 in TOC and 4382 in SOC group, respectively) were included. The overall mortality was lower in TOC group compared to SOC group (RD: -0.06; CI: -0.12 to -0.01; p = .03). Subgroup analysis including studies with only severe cases revealed lower mortality (RD: -0.12; CI: -0.18 to -0.06; p < .01) and need for mechanical ventilation (RD: -0.11; CI: -0.19 to -0.02; p = .01) in TOC group compared to SOC group. The addition of TOC to SOC has the potential to reduce mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.

414517,Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric dental attendance,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute loss of smell and taste are well-recognized symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the correlation between self-reported and psychophysical olfactory function remains unclear. Understanding the reliability of self-reported smell loss in ambulatory cases can assess the utility of this screening measure. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating patient-reported and measured olfactory function using the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) was conducted on adult outpatients with COVID-19. Patient-reported olfaction scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) were obtained at baseline, time of COVID-19 testing, and time of BSIT completion. Linear associations between VAS and BSIT were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of VAS scores were calculated. Logistic regression identified characteristics associated with accurate assessment of olfactory function. RESULTS: A total of 81 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 positive subjects, of whom 54 self-reported smell loss, were prospectively recruited &#8804;5 days from diagnosis date between May 8, 2020, and July 8, 2020. Self-reported smell loss had good discriminative ability in identifying abnormal BSIT (area under receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.92). A VAS <5 demonstrated sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.94 for predicting hyposmia (BSIT &#8804;8) with accuracy of 82.7%, whereas a VAS <9 had highest sensitivity at 0.86. Moderate bivariate linear associations were found between VAS and BSIT scores (rs = 0.59, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported olfactory loss associated with COVID-19 has a strong ability to predict abnormal olfactory function though the 2 measures are moderately correlated. Subjective olfactory assessment is useful in screening olfactory dysfunction at early disease time points when psychophysical testing cannot be conducted.","Prajapati, Divya P; Shahrvini, Bita; MacDonald, Bridget V; Crawford, Kayva L; Lechner, Matt; DeConde, Adam S; Yan, Carol H",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,272

However, considerable variation in the prevalence estimates of comorbidities and their effects on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have been observed in prior studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine geographical, age, and gender related differences in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated severity and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. We conducted a search using PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to include all COVID-19 studies published between January 1st, 2020 to July 24th, 2020 reporting comorbidities with severity or mortality. We included studies reporting the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 on human patients that also provided information on comorbidities or disease outcomes. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects method for calculating estimates. Of 120 studies with 125,446 patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (32%), obesity (25%), diabetes (18%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) while chronic kidney or other renal diseases (51%, 44%), cerebrovascular accident (43%, 44%), and cardiovascular disease (44%, 40%) patients had more COVID-19 severity and mortality respectively. Considerable variation in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated disease severity and mortality in different geographic regions was observed. The highest mortality was observed in studies with Latin American and European patients with any medical condition, mostly older adults (&#8805; 65 years), and predominantly male patients. Although the US studies observed the highest prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, the severity of COVID-19 among each comorbid condition was highest in Asian studies whereas the mortality was highest in the European and Latin American countries. Risk stratification and effective control strategies for the COVID-19 should be done according to comorbidities, age, and gender differences specific to geographical location.","Thakur, Bhaskar; Dubey, Pallavi; Benitez, Joseph; Torres, Joshua P; Reddy, Sireesha; Shokar, Navkiran; Aung, Koko; Mukherjee, Debabrata; Dwivedi, Alok Kumar",Sci Rep,,272
415661,Transitions of care from our inception to COVID-19: What have we learned?,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the certification and auditing services of Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS). The traditional approach to auditing-on-site visits-has been significantly curtailed, and it is unclear when, and under what conditions, it might resume in full. The purpose of this paper is to study the initial responses to COVID-19 of leading VSS-a group of 21 standards that are members of ISEAL, a global membership organization for VSS. This is a qualitative study, and data are collected from publiclyavailable sources (i.e., official announcements, policy amendments, derogations) in order to inductively analyze how individual VSS have adjusted their certification services in response to travel bans and lockdowns. The emphasis of the analysis was understanding the role of technologies in the VSS responses to the COVID-19 crisis. The findings demonstrate significant uptake of remote auditing and information and communications technology (ICT), even though that uptake is constrained by limiting conditions and it is not currently expected by VSS to extend beyond the crisis. Lessons learned from the crisis are discussed, and the potential for remote auditing during this period to encourage the adoption of more advanced technologies (such as artificial intelligence and satellite monitoring) in certification services is explored. A set of research questions to guide future work grounded in the analysis is also provided.","Castka, Pavel; Searcy, Cory; Fischer, Sönke",Sustainability,,272

Radio-frequency sensors (e.g., radars) offer the means to monitor cardiorespiratory activity of people without compromising their privacy, however, only limited information can be obtained via movement, traditionally related to heart or breathing rate. We investigated whether five complex hemodynamics scenarios (resting, apnea simulation, Valsalva maneuver, tilt up and tilt down on a tilt table) can be classified directly from publicly available contact and radar input signals in an end-to-end deep learning approach. A series of robust k-fold cross-validation evaluation experiments were conducted in which neural network architectures and hyperparameters were optimized, and different data input modalities (contact, radar and fusion) and data types (time and frequency domain) were investigated. We achieved reasonably high accuracies of 88% for contact, 83% for radar and 88% for fusion of modalities. These results are valuable in showing large potential of radar sensing even for more complex scenarios going beyond just heart and breathing rate. Such contact-free sensing can be valuable for fast privacy-preserving hospital screenings and for cases where traditional werables are impossible to use.","Slapnicar, Gasper; Wang, Wenjin; Lustrek, Mitja",Sensors (Basel),,272
416664,Implementation Guide for Rapid Integration of an Outpatient Telemedicine Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: The current novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have originated from a point-source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","Abbott, Sam; Hellewell, Joel; Munday, James; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome Open Res.,,272

Challenges and prospects,2021,"Discovered in the 1960s, the common anthelminthic levamisole has seen widespread use in veterinary applications. Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Due to reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the US and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least two known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses. It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue. Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen options. Because of its varying presence in illicit drug markets, both the medical and forensic communities need to be aware of levamisole and its potential impact on toxicological investigations.","Midthun, Kari M; Nelson, Lewis S; Logan, Barry K",Ther. drug monit,,272

418895,Concerns in Redirecting Uro-oncologic Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Individual behaviors play an essential role in the dynamics of transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID--19. This paper studies a dynamic game model that describes the social distancing behaviors during an epidemic, assuming a continuum of players and individual infection dynamics. The evolution of the players' infection states follows a variant of the well-known SIR dynamics. We assume that the players are not sure about their infection state, and thus they choose their actions based on their individually perceived probabilities of being susceptible, infected or removed. The cost of each player depends both on her infection state and on the contact with others. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium and characterize Nash equilibria using nonlinear complementarity problems. We then exploit some monotonicity properties of the optimal policies to obtain a reduced-order characterization for Nash equilibrium and reduce its computation to the solution of a low-dimensional optimization problem. It turns out that, even in the symmetric case, where all the players have the same parameters, players may have very different behaviors. We finally present some numerical studies that illustrate this interesting phenomenon and investigate the effects of several parameters, including the players' vulnerability, the time horizon, and the maximum allowed actions, on the optimal policies and the players' costs.","Kordonis, Ioannis; Lagos, Athanasios-Rafail; Papavassilopoulos, George P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12431v1.pdf,272

First identified in November/December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread world-wide. We analyzed 2790 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 56 countries that were available on April 2, 2020 to assess the evolution of the virus during this early phase of its expansion. We aimed to assess sequence variations that had evolved in virus genomes, giving greatest attention to the S gene. We also aimed to identify haplotypes that the variations may define and consider their geographic and chronologic distribution. Variations at 1930 positions that together cause 1203 amino acid changes were identified. The frequencies of changes normalized to lengths of genes and encoded proteins were relatively high in ORF3a and relatively low in M. A variation that causes an Asp614Gly near the receptor binding domain of S was found at high frequencies, and it was considered that this may contribute to the rapid spread of viruses with this variation. Our most important findings relate to haplotypes. Sixty-six haplotypes that constitute thirteen haplotype groups (H1-H13) were identified, and 84.6% of the 2790 sequences analyzed were associated with these haplotypes. The majority of the sequences (75.1%) were associated with haplotype groups H1-H3. The distribution pattern of the haplotype groups differed in various geographic regions. A few were country/territory specific. Location and time of emergence of some haplotypes are discussed. Importantly, nucleotide variations that define the various haplotypes and Tag/signature variations for most of haplotypes are reported. The practical applications of these variations are discussed.

420325,Flank Pain as a Symptom of COVID-19,2020,"Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize the performance gain of the model by marking the fewest samples. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize massive parameters, so that the model learns how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we are in an era of information torrents and we have massive amounts of data. In this way, DL has aroused strong interest of researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, researchers have relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples. Therefore, early AL is difficult to reflect the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to the publicity of the large number of existing annotation datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, which is not allowed in some fields that require high expertise, especially in the fields of speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc. Therefore, AL has gradually received due attention. A natural idea is whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotations, while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. Therefore, deep active learning (DAL) has emerged. Although the related research has been quite abundant, it lacks a comprehensive survey of DAL.

421003,Rational perioperative utilisation and management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Challenges arise when treatment to improve maternal health brings the possibility of risk to fetal health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant women's right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physician's desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical consequences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treatments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patient's own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed.","Minkoff, Howard; Ecker, Jeffrey",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,272

Given the initially indiscriminate travel restrictions adopted in March 2020, many seafarers have been stranded on their ships, well beyond their initial labour contracts. Notwithstanding repeated calls by the United Nations, the shipping industry, and maritime unions to designate seafarers as “key workers” in all jurisdictions, many countries still do not allow crew change. While crew change is however generally possible in many ports, the number of people stranded at sea remains unacceptably high, which signals wide-spread breaches of the United Nations 2006 Maritime Labour Convention (MLC, 2006). This humanitarian crisis needs to be resolved soon, as its continuation risks eroding the hard-won Maritime Labour Convention.","De Beukelaer, Christiaan",Marine Policy,,272

425435,Benefits and Risks of Visitor Restrictions for Hospitalized Children During the COVID Pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has been associated with cardiovascular complications including acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiogenic shock. The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.","Chow, Justin; Alhussaini, Anhar; Calvillo-Argüelles, Oscar; Billia, Filio; Luk, Adriana",,,272

426513,"Otorhinolaryngology, head and surgery practice during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the limited evidence for its effectiveness, thermal screening at points of entry has increasingly become a standard protocol in numerous parts of the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15th May and 30th July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. RESULTS: Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1-7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31-45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5°C (IQR: 36.3-36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5°C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3-99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5-68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3-94.4) respectively. The positive and negative Likelihood Ratios (LRs) were 19 (95% CI: 12.4-29.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study population, the use of Thermal screening alone is ineffective in the detection of potential COVID-19 cases at point of entry. We recommend a combination of screening tests or additional testing using highly sensitive molecular diagnostics such as Polymerase Chain Reaction.","Nsawotebba, Andrew; Ibanda, Ivan; Ssewanyana, Isaac; Ogwok, Patrick; Ocen, Francis; Okiira, Christopher; Kagirita, Atek; Mujuni, Dennis; Tugumisirize, Didas; Kabugo, Joel; Nyombi, Abdunoor; Majwala, Robert Kaos; Bagaya, Bernard Ssentalo; Kalyesubula-Kibuuka, Simeon; Ssengooba, Willy; Nabadda, Susan",PLoS One,,272

SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the United States or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside California, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.","Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Kantor, Rose S; Olm, Matthew R; Whitney, Oscar N; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Lou, Yue Clare; Flamholz, Avi; Kennedy, Lauren C; Greenwald, Hannah; Hinkle, Adrian; Hetzel, Jonathan; Spitzer, Sara; Koble, Jeffery; Tan, Asako; Hyde, Fred; Schroth, Gary; Kuersten, Scott; Banfield, Jillian F; Nelson, Kara L",mBio (Online),,272

The problem can be naturally modelled using the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework with countably many arms. The standard MAB algorithms for countably many arms begin with selecting a random set of candidate arms and then applying standard MAB algorithms, e.g., UCB, on this candidate set downstream. We show that such a selection strategy often results in higher cumulative regret and to this end, we propose a selection strategy based on the maximum utility of the arms. We show that in tasks like online information gathering, where sequential query recommendations are employed, the sequences of queries are correlated and the number of potentially optimal queries can be reduced to a manageable size by selecting queries with maximum utility with respect to the currently executing query.

432144,The simulation-CT: Radiotherapy's useful tool in the race against COVID-19 pandemic. A serendipity approach,2020,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic found Italy unprepared to cope with the large concentrated numbers of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who often required hospital admission and in many cases intensive care. This pandemic very quickly overwhelmed the Italian Healthcare System. This paper describes the Active Home Surveillance System (Operations Center for Discharged Patients; COD19) and the Home Hospital Care System (COD20) and presents the clinical data collected and the level of user satisfaction with the service. The Operations Center for Discharged Patients (COD19) is an active surveillance service for home-care patients which involves: (1) monitoring critical clinical conditions; (2) recognizing social and health issues; (3) and providing necessary clinical services in the form of a telemedicine service. COD20 is a patient-specialist video consultation service that allows to perform an assessment of clinical conditions and any need to visit; defining the priority of access to specialist outpatient visits in the presence or manageable with the new video consultation model. This service was immediately necessary during the COD19 monitoring. COD19 and COD20 are based on the Amazon Web Services Serverless certified platform. The COD19 and COD20 platform can be intrinsically utilized for future epidemic outbreaks; also those with non-respiratory transmission; and is sufficiently flexible to adapt to natural catastrophes.,"Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Bertoli, Simona; Foppiani, Andrea; Verduci, Elvira; Battezzati, Alberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272

Does co-infection increase the risk of severe illness or amplify virus shedding? Actually, we do not yet know the answers to these questions;so, in this article, first, we attempt to define the similarities and differences between COV-Flu Then, we will have a brief discussion on how to manage patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of both diseases However, as COVID-19 has been recognized as a pandemic since December 2019, the management of this emerging disease is rapidly evolving as new information is collected from different parts of the world","Karimi, A.; Tabatabaei, S.

433506,Telemedicine in Ibd: Good Trust from Outpatients during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Milan (lombardy),2021,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the essential derivative of vitamin A and is of interest due to its various biological key functions. As shown in the recent literature, atRA also plays a role in the failing heart during myocardial infarction, the leading cause of death globally. To date insufficient mechanistic information has been available on related hypoxia-induced cell damage and reperfusion injuries. However, it has been demonstrated that a reduction in cellular atRA uptake abrogates hypoxia-mediated cell and tissue damage, which may offer a new route for intervention. Consequently, in this study, the effect of the novel cardio-protective compound 5-methoxyleoligin (5ML) on cellular atRA uptake was tested in human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). For this purpose, a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to assess intra-cellular levels of the active substance and corresponding levels of vitamin A and its derivatives, including potential cis/trans isomers. This work also focused on light-induced isomerization and the stability of biological sample material to ensure sample integrity and avoid biased conclusions. This study provides evidence of the inhibitory effect of 5ML on cellular atRA uptake, a promising step toward a novel therapy for myocardial infarction.","Guntner, Armin Sebastian; Doppler, Christian; Wechselberger, Christian; Bernhard, David; Buchberger, Wolfgang",,,272

Patient satisfaction with telemedicine is an important metric, but survey-based questionnaires do not capture the nuances of the patient experience. This study aims to understand head and neck patients' perceptions about telemedicine clinic visits during COVID-19. METHODS: Fifty-six established patients who had video-based telemedicine visits with an otolaryngology-head and neck surgery faculty member between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, completed unstructured telephone interviews. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to determine the patients' demographic, disease, and treatment information. RESULTS: The primary benefits of telemedicine were accessibility and cost and time savings. Primary limitations included the ability to perform a physical examination. Most patients expressed a willingness to participate in future remote visits if appropriate or necessitated by social circumstances. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine is a disruptive process, and long-term adoption requires understanding patient perception of and satisfaction with telemedicine. Head and neck cancer patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine. The study elucidated patient perceived benefits and limitations of telemedicine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Continued implementation of telemedicine in otolaryngology-head and neck ambulatory clinics will require consideration of contextual features surrounding the virtual delivery of care, with particular attention to visit appropriateness for telemedicine and social circumstances.","Triantafillou, Vasiliki; Layfield, Eleanor; Prasad, Aman; Deng, Jie; Shanti, Rabie M; Newman, Jason G; Rajasekaran, Karthik",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,272

Now more than 15 lakhs peoples have been infected in India, out of the 26816 patients were deceased. COVID 19 outbreaks become an additional hazard to the health-care workers (HCWs), leading to fatigue, anxiety, depression and fear of death. The objective of this questionnaire-based study is to know about the knowledge of HCWs about COVID 19, their experiences while dealing with the disease, and the protective measures taken to prevent the infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted for 1 month starting from the 2nd week of June 2020 after getting institutional ethical clearance. This study included 240 HCWs posted in the medical and surgical Departments of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. This questionnaire was prepared in online Google forms and required 2 min to complete. Mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used to describe the continuous variables, and percentages were used to describe the categorical data. RESULTS: Among 240 HCWs, 79.16% (n = 190) participants have good knowledge and adapted good precautions (score 15-23) for COVID 19 infection. Rest 20% (n = 48) and 0.8% (n = 2) participants has average (score 8-14) or poor knowledge (score &lt;8) with adaptation of average or poor precautionary measures against COVID 19, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that we have the requirement of more educational training programs for awareness of HCWs and precautionary measures against COVID 19. Thereby, HCWs can improve their knowledge and participate in this fight against COVID 19 with more efficiency and confidence.","Meena, S. P.; Jhirwal, M.; Puranik, A. K.; Sharma, N.; Rodha, M.

Results: A total of 148 MS patients with an average age of 35.73 years completed the questionnaire. The most important concern of the participants was ""a high prevalence of COVID-19"" following by the ""MS symptoms worsening"". Many participants (35%) believed that, if they catch COVID-19 they will be cured. However, the treatment will take more time for them in comparison with the general population. About 39.8% of the patients stated that COVID-19 infection does not affect the MS symptom, but others noted that, it can cause relapse (30.8%) or worsen MS symptoms (29.3%). Conclusion: This study revealed that MS patients are more anxious about the effects of COVID-19 on their underlying disease rather than the infection itself.","Rezaeimanesh, Nasim; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Moghadasi, Abdorreza Naser",Basic Clin.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. All the patients had complete follow-up to death or recovery. Severe COVID-19 was defined by a 3-level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID-19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)-weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results. RESULTS: Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID-19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty-eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized. After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti-CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID-19. Recent use (<1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20-12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS-weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged.

Many guidelines have been developed to guide nutrition care. AIM: To identify key guidelines or practice recommendations for nutrition support practices in critically ill adults admitted with COVID-19, to describe similarities and differences between recommendations, and to discuss implications for clinical practice. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify guidelines affiliated with or endorsed by international nutrition societies or dietetic associations which included recommendations for the nutritional management of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19. Data were extracted on pre-defined key aspects of nutritional care including nutrition prescription, delivery, monitoring and workforce recommendations, and key similarities and discrepancies, as well as implications for clinical practice were summarized. RESULTS: Ten clinical practice guidelines were identified. Similar recommendations included: the use of high protein, volume restricted enteral formula delivered gastrically and commenced early in ICU and introduced gradually, while taking into consideration non-nutritional calories to avoid overfeeding. Specific advice for patients in the prone position was common, and non-intubated patients were highlighted as a population at high nutritional risk. Major discrepancies included the use of indirect calorimetry to guide energy targets and advice around using gastric residual volumes (GRVs) to monitor feeding tolerance. CONCLUSION: Overall, common recommendations around formula type and route of feeding exist, with major discrepancies being around the use of indirect calorimetry and GRVs, which reflect international ICU nutrition guidelines.","Chapple, Lee-Anne S; Tatucu-Babet, Oana A; Lambell, Kate J; Fetterplace, Kate; Ridley, Emma J",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,272
439723,Current Overview on the Effects of COVID-19 Disease on Maternal and Neonatal Health;Narrative Review,2020,"Epidemiological studies have highlighted the disparate impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on racial and ethnic minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, but data at the neighborhood-level is sparse. The objective of this study was to investigate the disparate impact of COVID-19 on disadvantaged neighborhoods and racial/ethnic minorities in Chicago, Illinois. Using data from the Cook County Medical Examiner, we conducted a neighborhood-level analysis of COVID-19 decedents in Chicago and quantified age-standardized years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to COVID-19 among demographic subgroups and neighborhoods with geospatial clustering of high and low rates of COVID-19 mortality. We show that age-standardized YPLL was markedly higher among the non-Hispanic (NH) Black (559 years per 100,000 population) and the Hispanic (811) compared with NH white decedents (312). We demonstrate that geomapping using residential address data at the individual-level identifies hot-spots of COVID-19 mortality in neighborhoods on the Northeast, West, and South areas of Chicago that reflect a legacy of residential segregation and persistence of inequality in education, income, and access to healthcare. Our results may contribute to ongoing public health and community-engaged efforts to prevent the spread of infection and mitigate the disproportionate loss of life among these communities due to COVID-19 as well as highlight the urgent need to broadly target neighborhood disadvantage as a cause of pervasive racial inequalities in life and health.","Pierce, Jacob B; Harrington, Katharine; McCabe, Megan E; Petito, Lucia C; Kershaw, Kiarri N; Pool, Lindsay R; Allen, Norrina B; Khan, Sadiya S",Health Place,,272

Buzzwords, such as e­learning and digitalization suggest the possibility of innovative teaching approaches that are readily available to solve the problems of teaching in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The current conversion to digital teaching is not primarily driven by didactic rationale or institutional strategy but by external circumstances. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the teaching situation at national university ENT clinics and academic teaching hospitals at the start of the virtual corona summer semester in 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A specifically self-designed questionnaire regarding the local situation and conditions as well as nationwide scenarios was sent to all 39 national university ENT clinics and 20 ENT departments at academic teaching hospitals. RESULTS: A total of 31 university hospitals and 10 academic teaching hospitals took part in the survey. There were obvious discrepancies between available resources and effectively available digital teaching and learning contents. Further criticism was expressed regarding the communication with the medical faculty, the digital infrastructure and particularly the frequent lack of collaboration with central support facilities, such as media, didactics and datacenters.

This might help showing which comorbidity might pose the patients at risk of more severe symptoms. Methods: We searched all relevant databases on April 7th, 2020 using the keywords (""novel coronavirus"" OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (comorbidities OR clinical characteristics OR epidemiologic∗). We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis. Results: The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45. The most prevalent finding in the confirmed COVID-19 patients was hypertension, which was found in 1/5 of the patients (21%). Other most prevalent finding was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 11%, cerebrovascular disease in 2.4%, cardiovascular disease in 5.8%, chronic kidney disease in 3.6%, chronic liver disease in 2.9%, chronic pulmonary disease in 2.0%, malignancy in 2.7%, and smoking in 8.7% of the patients. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection seems to be affecting every race, sex, age, irrespective of health status. The risk of symptomatic and severe disease might be higher due to the higher age which is usually accompanied with comorbidities. However, comorbidities do not seem to be the prerequisite for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection, except hypertension.","Baradaran, Ashkan; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad H.; Baradaran, Aslan; Kachooei, Amir R.",Arch.

We describe a fully remote perceptual study with a gamified protocol to encourage participant engagement, which allowed us to quickly collect high-quality data from a large, diverse participant pool (N=60). Our study aims to understand medium-field size and egocentric distance perception in real-world usage of consumer VR devices. We utilized two perceptual matching tasks -- distance bisection and size matching -- at the same target distances of 1--9 metres. While the bisection protocol indicated a near-universal trend of nonlinear distance compression, the size matching estimates were more equivocal. Varying eye-height from the floor plane showed no significant effect on the judgements. We also discuss the pros and cons of a fully remote perceptual study in VR, the impact of hardware variation, and measures needed to ensure high-quality data.","Arora, Rahul; Li, Jiannan; Shi, Gongyi; Singh, Karan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00584v1.pdf,272

Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and four themes were developed: the beginning of suffering, social cognitive suppression, reflection on rural contexts, and critical approaches to the pandemic based on rural standards. The daily activities of rural older people were suppressed due to social norms and pandemic-related standard precautionary measures based on urban areas. Specific infection control standards for rural areas and the provision of direct information to individuals in the community to sustain social support are needed.

Older adults are under a high risk of infection because of weaker immune systems. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent scientific evidence that outlines the effects of exercise on influenza or pneumonia in older adults. An electronic literature search was conducted using the WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCEDIRECT and GOOGLE SCHOLAR databases using the following keywords, ""Exercise,"" ""Older adult,"" ""Influenza,"" and ""Pneumonia."" Any randomized control trials, cross-sectional and observational studies that related to this topic were all included. Twenty studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. Thirteen randomized control trials investigated the effects of exercise on the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination: seven trials employed moderate aerobic exercise, three employed resistance exercise, and the remaining three used Asian martial arts or special home-based exercises. Five cross-sectional and two observational studies examined the associations between exercise/physical condition and influenza/pneumonia. Most of the current studies suggested that prolonged moderate aerobic exercise may help to reduce the risk of influenza-related infection and improve the immune responses to influenza or pneumonia vaccination in older adults. In addition, training in traditional Asian martial arts was also found to be beneficial. Future research should focus on the different effects of moderate and vigorous exercise on influenza-related diseases.","Song, Yang; Ren, Feng; Sun, Dong; Wang, Meizi; Baker, Julien S; István, Bíró; Gu, Yaodong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272

The starting point of this assessment is a procedure to evaluate in naturally ventilated environments, the current infectious risk by using measurements of indoor/outdoor CO2 concentrations to calculate actual air changes per hour. The method was applied to some typical school environments in Italy. The results indicated very infectious situations with reproduction number Ro values up to exceed 13. But, the simulations assessed an extraordinary reduction of indoor viral concentration and consequently of the infection risk by a strong mechanical ventilation. High ventilation rates make facemasks effective even with use levels (from 50%) reasonable also for pupils. This way, R0 goes down the value one. As regards energy performance, the behavior of an autonomous high efficiency air handling unit (HEAHU), to be installed in an existing naturally ventilated classroom, was simulated in the monitored days.

444331,A novel dental biosafety device to control the spread of potentially contaminated dispersion particles from dental ultrasonic tips,2021,"Antibody responses are important in the control of viral respiratory infection in the human host. What is not clear for SARS-CoV-2 is how rapidly this response occurs, or when antibodies with protective capability evolve. Hence, defining the events of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and the time frame for the development of antibodies with protective potential may help to explain the different clinical presentations of COVID-19. Furthermore, accurate descriptions of seroconversion are needed to inform the best use of serological assays for diagnostic testing and serosurveillance studies. Here, we describe the humoral responses in a cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients (n = 19) shortly following the onset of symptoms. Commercial and 'in-house' serological assays were used to measure IgG antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens-Spike (S) S1 sub-unit and Nucleocapsid protein (NP)-and to assess the potential for virus neutralisation mediated specifically by inhibition of binding between the viral attachment protein (S protein) and cognate receptor (ACE-2). Antibody response kinetics varied amongst the cohort, with patients seroconverting within 1 week, between 1-2 weeks, or after 2 weeks, following symptom onset. Anti-NP IgG responses were generally detected earlier, but reached maximum levels slower, than anti-S1 IgG responses. The earliest IgG antibodies produced by all patients included those that recognised the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were capable of inhibiting binding to ACE-2. These data revealed events and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion that may be important predictors of the outcome of infection and guide the delivery of clinical services in the COVID-19 response.","Murrell, Isa; Forde, Donall; Zelek, Wioleta; Tyson, Linda; Chichester, Lisa; Palmer, Nicki; Jones, Rachel; Morgan, B Paul; Moore, Catherine",PLoS One,,272

However, to our knowledge, syncope in COVID-19 patients has not been systematically evaluated. We sought to characterize syncope and/or presyncope in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with either syncope or presyncope. This ""study"" group (n = 37) was compared with an age and gender-matched cohort of patients without syncope (""control"") (n = 40). Syncope was attributed to various categories. We compared telemetry data, treatments received, and clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Among 1000 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital, the incidence of syncope/presyncope was 3.7%. The median age of the entire cohort was 69 years (range 26-89+ years) and 55% were men. Major comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Syncopal episodes were categorized as (a) unspecified in 59.4% patients, (b) neurocardiogenic in 15.6% patients, (c) hypotensive in 12.5% patients, and (d) cardiopulmonary in 3.1% patients with fall versus syncope and seizure versus syncope in 2 of 32 (6.3%) and 1 of 33 (3.1%) patients, respectively. Compared with the ""control"" group, there were no significant differences in both admission and peak blood levels of d-dimer, troponin-I, and CRP in the ""study"" group. Additionally, there were no differences in arrhythmias or death between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Syncope/presyncope in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is uncommon and is infrequently associated with a cardiac etiology or associated with adverse outcomes compared to those who do not present with these symptoms.","Oates, Connor P; Turagam, Mohit K; Musikantow, Daniel; Chu, Edward; Shivamurthy, Poojita; Lampert, Joshua; Kawamura, Iwanari; Bokhari, Mahmoud; Whang, William; Miller, Marc A; Choudry, Subbarao; Langan, Noelle; Sofi, Aamir; Dukkipati, Srinivas R; Reddy, Vivek Y; Koruth, Jacob S",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,272

This implies that treatments are not necessarily transferrable: and indeed it is unknown which treatments are effective at all. Outcomes, as far as are known, are good, but long term data is lacking. The international cooperation has been an example of how today's connected medicine can be a force for good, however calm assessment of evidence remains necessary to ensure the best outcomes for our patients. This short article identifies what we have learnt from the first surge of COVID-19 cases about paediatric inflammatory syndrome and how it affects children.","Evans, Claire; Davies, Patrick",,,272
445733,Recommendations of the Laparoscopic Surgery Society of Nigeria on the Conduct of Minimal Access Surgeries during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic in Nigeria,2021,"BACKGROUND: To analyse the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic and the lockdown measures on the follow-up and control of chronic diseases in primary care. METHODS: Retrospective study in 288 primary care practices (PCP) of the Catalan Institute of Health. We analysed the results of 34 indicators of the Healthcare quality standard (EQA), comprising different types: treatment (4), follow-up (5), control (10), screening (7), vaccinations (4) and quaternary prevention (4). For each PCP, we calculated each indicator's percentage of change in February, March and April 2020 respective to the results of the previous month; and used the T-Student test for paired data to compare them with the percentage of change in the same month of the previous year. We defined indicators with a negative effect those with a greater negative change or a lesser positive change in 2020 in comparison to 2019; and indicators with a positive effect those with a greater positive change or a lesser negative change. RESULTS: We observed a negative effect on 85% of the EQA indicators in March and 68% in April. 90% of the control indicators had a negative effect, highlighting the control of LDL cholesterol with a reduction of - 2.69% (95%CI - 3.17% to - 2.23%) in March and - 3.41% (95%CI - 3.82% to - 3.01%) in April; and the control of blood pressure with a reduction of - 2.13% (95%CI - 2.34% to - 1.9%) and - 2.59% (95%CI - 2.8% to - 2.37%). The indicators with the greatest negative effect were those of screening, such as the indicator of diabetic foot screening with a negative effect of - 2.86% (95%CI - 3.33% to - 2.39%) and - 4.13% (95%CI - 4.55% to - 3.71%) in March and April, respectively. Only one vaccination indicator, adult Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, had a negative effect in both months. Finally, among the indicators of quaternary prevention, we observed negative effects in March and April although in that case a lower inadequacy that means better clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic and the lockdown measures have significantly reduced the results of the follow-up, control, screening and vaccination indicators for patients in primary care. On the other hand, the indicators for quaternary prevention have been strengthened and their results have improved.","Coma, Ermengol; Mora, Núria; Méndez, Leonardo; Benítez, Mència; Hermosilla, Eduardo; Fàbregas, Mireia; Fina, Francesc; Mercadé, Albert; Flayeh, Souhel; Guiriguet, Carolina; Balló, Elisabet; Martinez Leon, Nuria; Mas, Ariadna; Cordomí, Sílvia; Lejardi, Yolanda; Medina, Manuel",BMC Fam Pract,,272
445989,Dementia wellbeing and COVID-19: Review and expert consensus on current research and knowledge gaps,2021,"In this paper, two novel, powerful, and robust convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are designed and proposed for two different classification tasks using publicly available data sets. The first architecture is able to decide whether a given chest X-ray image of a patient contains COVID-19 or not with 98.92% average accuracy. The second CNN architecture is able to divide a given chest X-ray image of a patient into three classes (COVID-19 versus normal versus pneumonia) with 98.27% average accuracy. The hyperparameters of both CNN models are automatically determined using Grid Search. Experimental results on large clinical data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed architectures and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can overcome the disadvantages mentioned above. Moreover, the proposed CNN models are fully automatic in terms of not requiring the extraction of diseased tissue, which is a great improvement of available automatic methods in the literature. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first study to detect COVID-19 disease from given chest X-ray images, using CNN, whose hyperparameters are automatically determined by the Grid Search. Another important contribution of this study is that it is the first CNN-based COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification study that uses the largest possible clinical data set. A total of 1,524 COVID-19, 1,527 pneumonia, and 1524 normal X-ray images are collected. It is aimed to collect the largest number of COVID-19 X-ray images that exist in the literature until the writing of this research paper.","Irmak, Emrah",Physiol Genomics,,272

In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases. METHOD: We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families. RESULT: Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.","Song, Rui; Han, Bing; Song, Meihua; Wang, Lin; Conlon, Christopher P; Dong, Tao; Tian, Di; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Zhihai; Zhang, Fujie; Shi, Mang; Li, Xingwang",J Infect,,272

447645,"Have we learnt anything from COVID-19, and can we put it to good use in the future?",2020,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an inflammatory condition with high mortality rates, is common in severe COVID-19, whose risk is reduced by metformin rather than other anti-diabetic medications. Detecting of inflammasome assembly in post-mortem COVID-19 lungs, we asked whether and how metformin inhibits inflammasome activation while exerting its anti-inflammatory effect. We show that metformin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1ß production in cultured and alveolar macrophages along with inflammasome-independent IL-6 secretion, thus attenuating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. By targeting electron transport chain complex 1 and independently of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or NF-&#954;B, metformin blocked LPS-induced and ATP-dependent mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis and generation of oxidized mtDNA, an NLRP3 ligand. Myeloid-specific ablation of LPS-induced cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2), which is rate limiting for mtDNA synthesis, reduced ARDS severity without a direct effect on IL-6. Thus, inhibition of ATP and mtDNA synthesis is sufficient for ARDS amelioration.","Xian, Hongxu; Liu, Yuan; Rundberg Nilsson, Alexandra; Gatchalian, Raphaella; Crother, Timothy R; Tourtellotte, Warren G; Zhang, Yi; Aleman-Muench, German R; Lewis, Gavin; Chen, Weixuan; Kang, Sarah; Luevanos, Melissa; Trudler, Dorit; Lipton, Stuart A; Soroosh, Pejman; Teijaro, John; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Arditi, Moshe; Karin, Michael; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa",Immunity,,272
447680,Amabié-A Japanese Symbol of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Journal of the American Medical Association,2020,"The reports of Chao et al and DeBiasi et al from the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York City (NYC) and Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC (DC) provide their SARS-CoV-2 experience over 4- and 6-week periods, respectively, beginning on March 15, 2020. Although SARS-CoV-2 generally has been said to be a mild infection in the pediatric age group, a picture of severe COVID-19 in US children and youth emerges through these reports. Together, 91 hospitalized patients with 22 critically ill are reported, with demographic and other patient characteristics compared between groups. Hospitalized patients were representative of the Bronx, NYC, and DC communities served, with high proportion of Hispanic/Latinos in NCY and Hispanic/Latinos and African Americans in DC. Obesity (BMI &gt;30kg/m 2) was present in 26% of Bronx patients and 2% of DC patients. Although underlying medical conditions were common in hospitalized patients, 37% of hospitalized and 22% of critically ill patients in DC had no underlying condition. Of the combined studies' 22 critically ill patients, 63% were male and 82% were &gt;10 years of age. PICU admission predominantly was due to respiratory compromise and was associated with briskly elevated inflammatory markers, lung opacities on chest radiograph, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both reports show that approximately 20% of COVID-19 hospitalizations were comprised of patients with asthma, but neither shows an excess of asthmatics among the critically ill. Because substantial SAR-CoV-2 testing of symptomatic outpatients was occurring in DC (1804 tests over 6 weeks), we also know that 21% of infected outpatients had asthma. Taken together, there likely is a signal that SARS-CoV-2 may exacerbate asthma but itself is not a major risk factor for the severe COVID-19 pulmonary syndrome. Additionally, from the DC study, we see that although children &lt;1 year and &gt;15 years of age were over-represented among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, only those &gt;15 years were overrepresented among the critically ill (Figure). [Formula presented] These 2 reports have limitations of small numbers. Characteristics of COVID-19 in these dense urban populations of special racial/ethnic groups where there is known high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may not be generalizable to all pediatric and US populations. They provide, however, a sobering reality check that is vital to our current and upcoming considerations of social distancing. Children and youth are susceptible to life-threatening COVID-19.

447792,Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on hangings attended by emergency medical services,2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that limits activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and also serves as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. Binding of S protein to ACE2 causes internalization which activates local RAS. ACE2 is on the X chromosome and its expression is regulated by sex hormones. In this study, we defined ACE2 mRNA abundance and examined effects of S protein on ACE2 activity and/or angiotensin II (AngII) levels in pivotal tissues (lung, adipose) from male and female mice. In lung, ACE2 mRNA abundance was reduced following gonadectomy (GDX) of male and female mice and was higher in XX than XY mice of the Four Core Genotypes (FCG). Reductions in lung ACE2 mRNA abundance by GDX occurred in XX, but not XY FCG female mice. Lung mRNA abundance of ADAM17 and TMPRSS2, enzymes that shed cell surface ACE2 and facilitate viral cell entry, was reduced by GDX in male but not female mice. For comparison, adipose ACE2 mRNA abundance was higher in female than male mice and higher in XX than XY FCG mice. Adipose ADAM17 mRNA abundance was increased by GDX of male and female mice. S protein reduced ACE2 activity in alveolar type II epithelial cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Administration of S protein to male and female mice increased lung AngII levels and decreased adipose ACE2 activity in male but not female mice. These results demonstrate that sex differences in ACE2 expression levels may impact local RAS following S protein exposures.","Ensor, Charles M.; AlSiraj, Yasir; Shoemaker, Robin; Sturgill, Jamie; Keshavamurthy, Suresh; Gordon, Elizabeth; Dong, Brittany; Waters, Christopher M; Cassis, Lisa C",,,272

Patients with non-communicable diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are vulnerable to this stress [4, 5]. Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the most critical type of AMI, is associated with high mortality even with modern medicine [6-8]. Timely reperfusion therapy is critical for STEMI patients because a short ischemia time is associated with better clinical outcomes and lower acute and long -term mortality [9-12]. The COVID-19 pandemic placed the management of STEMI patients in a difficult situation due to the need to balance timely reperfusion therapy and maintaining strict infection control practices [13, 14]. Telemedicine, which is used to deliver health care services using information or communication technology, provides an opportunity to carry out the evaluation, diagnosis, and even monitor the patients after discharge when social distancing is needed [15]. In this article, we reported our preliminary experience with the usefulness of telemedicine in managing STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This process occurs when a large number of innate and adaptive immune cells activate and start producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. It is one of the factors contributing to the mortality observed with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) for a subgroup of patients. CRS is not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 infection; it was prevalent in most of the major human coronavirus and influenza A subtype outbreaks of the past two decades (H5N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H7N9). With a comprehensive literature search, we collected changing the cytokine levels from patients upon infection with the viral pathogens mentioned above. We analyzed published patient data to highlight the conserved and unique cytokine responses caused by these viruses. Our curation indicates that the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is different compared to other CRS-causing respiratory viruses, as SARS-CoV-2 does not always induce specific cytokines like other coronaviruses or influenza do, such as IL-2, IL-10, IL-4, or IL-5. Comparing the collated cytokine responses caused by the analyzed viruses highlights a SARS-CoV-2-specific dysregulation of the type-I interferon (IFN) response and its downstream cytokine signatures. The map of responses gathered in this study could help specialists identify interventions that alleviate CRS in different diseases and evaluate whether they could be used in the COVID-19 cases.","Olbei, Marton; Hautefort, Isabelle; Modos, Dezso; Treveil, Agatha; Poletti, Martina; Gul, Lejla; Shannon-Lowe, Claire D; Korcsmaros, Tamas",Front Immunol,,272

Part I: How to set up a treatment system in each hospital,2020,"Drones are effective for reducing human activity and interactions by performing tasks such as exploring and inspecting new environments, monitoring resources and delivering packages. Drones need a controller to maintain stability and to reach their goal. The most well-known drone controllers are proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and proportional-derivative (PD) controllers. However, the controller parameters need to be tuned and optimized. In this paper, we introduce the use of two evolutionary algorithms, biogeography-based optimization~(BBO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), for multi-objective optimization (MOO) to tune the parameters of the PD controller of a drone. The combination of MOO, BBO, and PSO results in various methods for optimization: vector evaluated BBO and PSO, denoted as VEBBO and VEPSO; and non-dominated sorting BBO and PSO, denoted as NSBBO and NSPSO. The multi-objective cost function is based on tracking errors for the four states of the system. Two criteria for evaluating the Pareto fronts of the optimization methods, normalized hypervolume and relative coverage, are used to compare performance. Results show that NSBBO generally performs better than the other methods.","Shamshirgaran, Azin; Javidi, Hamed; Simon, Dan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08650v1.pdf,272

Different measures and extraordinary steps are being taken to contain the transmission of the virus. The levels of knowledge and implementation of preventive practices related to COVID-19 in sub-Saharan African countries are unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence regarding the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. This study aimed to describe knowledge and practices related to COVID-19 and to assess mental health status among adults in three sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. A total of 1,797 adults were included in the survey, and data were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews. The proportions of adults who identified more than 80% of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, and prevention mechanisms were 69.9%, 79.2%, and 90.7%, respectively. The practice of preventive measures was relatively lower for avoiding social gatherings and disinfecting contaminated surfaces. Better education, urban residence, and believing the pandemic is real were factors associated with good knowledge on COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, and preventive actions.

However, the popular inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator could be biased in the presence of weak IVs, a common challenge in MR studies. In this article, we develop a novel penalized inverse-variance weighted (pIVW) estimator, which adjusts the original IVW estimator to account for the weak IV issue by using a penalization approach to prevent the denominator of the pIVW estimator from being close to zero. Moreover, we adjust the variance estimation of the pIVW estimator to account for the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. We show that the recently proposed debiased IVW (dIVW) estimator is a special case of our proposed pIVW estimator. We further prove that the pIVW estimator has smaller bias and variance than the dIVW estimator under some regularity conditions. We also conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed pIVW estimator. Furthermore, we apply the pIVW estimator to estimate the causal effects of five obesity-related exposures on three coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Notably, we find that hypertensive disease is associated with an increased risk of hospitalized COVID-19, and peripheral vascular disease and higher body mass index are associated with increased risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19 and critically ill COVID-19.

453093,Risk/caution of vitamin D insufficiency for quarantined athletes returning to play after COVID-19,2020,"Ample evidence exists on the role of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the response against many pathogens, as well as on its remarkable antitumor properties. However, the unexpected toxicity and disappointing results in some clinical trials are prompting the design of new strategies and/or vectors for IL-12 delivery. This study was conceived to further endorse the use of gemini cationic lipids (GCLs) in combination with zwitterionic helper lipid DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl ethanol amine) as nanovectors for the insertion of plasmid DNA encoding for IL-12 (pCMV-IL12) into cells. Optimal GCL formulations previously reported by us were selected for IL-12-based biophysical experiments. In vitro studies demonstrated efficient pCMV-IL12 transfection by GCLs with comparable or superior cytokine levels than those obtained with commercial control Lipofectamine2000*. Furthermore, the nanovectors did not present significant toxicity, showing high cell viability values. The proteins adsorbed on the nanovector surface were found to be mostly lipoproteins and serum albumin, which are both beneficial to increase the blood circulation time. These outstanding results are accompanied by an initial physicochemical characterization to confirm DNA compaction and protection by the lipid mixture. Although further studies would be necessary, the present GCLs exhibit promising characteristics as candidates for pCMV-IL12 transfection in future in vivo applications.","Sánchez-Arribas, Natalia Martínez-Negro María Aicart-Ramos Clara Conchita Tros de Ilarduya Aicart Emilio Guerrero-Martínez Andrés Junquera Elena",Pharmaceutics,,272

454284,Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess,2020,"BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma accounts for 7% of paediatric malignancies but is responsible for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Despite rigorous treatment involving chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate of high-risk disease remains &lt; 40%, highlighting the need for improved therapy. Since neuroblastoma cells exhibit aberrant metabolism, we determined whether their sensitivity to radiotherapy could be enhanced by drugs affecting cancer cell metabolism. METHODS: Using a panel of neuroblastoma and glioma cells, we determined the radiosensitising effects of inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DG) and mitochondrial function (metformin). Mechanisms underlying radiosensitisation were determined by metabolomic and bioenergetic profiling, flow cytometry and live cell imaging and by evaluating different treatment schedules. RESULTS: The radiosensitising effects of 2-DG were greatly enhanced by combination with the antidiabetic biguanide, metformin. Metabolomic analysis and cellular bioenergetic profiling revealed this combination to elicit severe disruption of key glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolites, causing significant reductions in ATP generation and enhancing radiosensitivity. Combination treatment induced G(2)/M arrest that persisted for at least 24 h post-irradiation, promoting apoptotic cell death in a large proportion of cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the radiosensitising effect of 2-DG was significantly enhanced by its combination with metformin. This clearly demonstrates that dual metabolic targeting has potential to improve clinical outcomes in children with high-risk neuroblastoma by overcoming radioresistance.","Nile, D.

455032,"Outcomes of an In Vitro Fertilization Pregnancy With COVID-19 and the Perinatal Outcome in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",2020,"The popularity of Islamic financial instruments among Muslims is not surprising. The Islamic capital market is where sharia-compliant financial assets are transacted. It works parallel to the conventional market and helps investors find sharia-compliant investment opportunities. At a time of collective confusion when the COVID-19 epidemic is contributing to unprecedented change, this paper is keen to understand how attractive conventional and Islamic stock markets have been to investors recently. Second, this paper takes advantage of the time-scale decomposition property of the wavelet to simultaneously capture risk exposure and distinguish the risks faced by short- and long-term investors. To this end, this research conducted a two-step investigation of the daily closing equity market price indices for three Islamic stock markets and their conventional counterparts. Given that different financial decisions occur with greater or less frequency, the paper examines the connectedness of stock markets operating at heterogeneous rates and identifies the timescales using wavelet-DCC-GARCH analysis to take account of both the time and the frequency domains of stock market connectedness. The paper findings highlight the strong evidence of contagion that can be seen in nearly all conventional stock markets in the COVID-19 pandemic;they reach a high level of dependency in such health crises. Furthermore, Islamic stock markets prove to be a rich ground for global diversification.","Alqaralleh, H.; Abuhowmmous, A. A.",Journal of Asian Finance Economics and Business,,272

Aerosol transmission of COVID-19, although plausible, has not been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a general transmission route. Considering the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially nosocomial outbreaks and other superspreading events, there is an urgent need to study the possibility of airborne transmission and its impact on the lung, the primary body organ attacked by the virus. Here, we review the complete pathway of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from aerosol dispersion in air to subsequent biological uptake after inhalation. In particular, we first review the aerodynamic and colloidal mechanisms by which aerosols disperse and transmit in air and deposit onto surfaces. We then review the fundamental mechanisms that govern regional deposition of micro- and nanoparticles in the lung. Focus is given to biophysical interactions between particles and the pulmonary surfactant film, the initial alveolar-capillary barrier and first-line host defense system against inhaled particles and pathogens. Finally, we summarize the current understanding about the structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its interactions with receptors at the atomistic and molecular scales, primarily as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. This review provides urgent and multidisciplinary knowledge toward understanding the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its health impact on the respiratory system.","Zuo, Yi Y; Uspal, William E; Wei, Tao",ACS nano,,272

Besides, glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were determined to evaluate the glycolysis ability of cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to confirm the interactions among circ-KIAA0907, miR-96-5p, and UNC13C. And RNA pull-down assay was used to verify the binding degree of miR-96-5p to its targets. Moreover, UNC13C protein level was examined using western blot (WB) analysis. OSCC xenograft models were constructed to perform in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Circ-KIAA0907 was a stability circRNA with lowly expression in OSCC. Overexpressed circ-KIAA0907 could inhibit migration, invasion, and glycolysis, while promoting apoptosis and radiosensitivity in OSCC cells. In the terms of mechanism, circ-KIAA0907 could sponge miR-96-5p to regulate UNC13C expression. MiR-96-5p overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effect of circ-KIAA0907 on OSCC progression, and UNC13C knockdown also could overturn the suppressive effect of miR-96-5p inhibitor on OSCC progression. Animal experiments revealed that circ-KIAA0907 could reduce the tumor growth of OSCC by regulating the miR-96-5p/UNC13C axis. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that circ-KIAA0907 restrains OSCC progression via the miR-96-5p/UNC13C axis, indicating that it may be a potential target for OSCC treatment.","Dong, Wenjie; Zhao, Lei; Zhang, Shiyang; Zhang, Shijie; Si, Hongyun",World J Surg Oncol,,272
461366,Dental practice during the era of COVID-19 pandemic: An Egyptian experience,2021,"Background Individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and poorer outcomes. Little is known about the impact social distancing guidelines have had on the health behaviors of this population. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine levels of social isolation, anxiety, depression, loneliness, stress, cognitive function, alcohol use, substance use and health appointment engagement pre-pandemic and after social distancing guidelines were initiated among individuals with CVD. Methods A secondary analysis was completed of a cross-sectional study that utilized a web-based survey. The parent sample included 184 participants recruited using social media. Forty-nine participants (27%) reported a history of CVD that included hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or peripheral artery disease. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare levels of social isolation, anxiety, depression, loneliness, stress, cognitive function, alcohol use, substance use, and delay/canceled healthcare appointments before and during social distancing recommendations. Results The majority of participants with CVD were female (92%), white (94%), college graduates (92 %), working full-time (45%), and living with two or more people (71%). There were significant differences (p&lt;0.001) between pre- and during COVID-19 restrictions for levels of social isolation, anxiety, cognitive function, and loneliness, while depression (p=0.006), perceived stress (p=0.108), alcohol use (p=0.056), and substance use (p=0.141) were not significantly different. About half of the participants (45%) delayed or canceled healthcare appointments because they were afraid to be exposed to COVID-19. One-third (37%) of participants had a healthcare provider delay an appointment, 27% of participants' healthcare providers canceled, and 67% of respondents had a healthcare provider change to telehealth appointments. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has concerning repercussions on the mental health of individuals with CVD. A heightened awareness by healthcare providers regarding the psychosocial needs of patients with CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic is warranted. The sample in this study is homogenous, limiting generalization, however, telehealth appointments with the above sample emerged as a viable mechanism for providers to interact with individuals with CVD. Psychosocial and biophysical outcomes from telehealth engagements are areas for further investigation.","Viveiros, Jennifer Chin Elizabeth Chung Joohyun McCurry Mary Sethares Kristen Sosa Mary-Elizabeth",Heart &amp; Lung,,272
461393,COVID-19 Pandemic Significantly Decreases Acute Surgical Complaints,2020,"The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein, as well as the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients, needs further longitudinal investigation. Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed, validated and applied in three patients of a family which underwent an ambulatory course of COVID-19 for six months. The virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks. Serum IgA levels to the S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau at approximately six weeks, and stayed elevated over the observation period. Virus-neutralizing activity reached a peak about 4 weeks after disease onset but dropped slowly. The longitudinal associations of virus neutralization and the serological immune response suggest immunity in patients even after a mild clinical course of COVID-19.","Flehmig, Bertram; Schindler, Michael; Ruetalo, Natalia; Businger, Ramona; Bayer, Manfred; Haage, Angelika; Kirchner, Thomas; Klingel, Karin; Normann, Andrea; Pridzun, Lutz; Tougianidou, Despina; Ranke, Michael B",Viruses,,272

462588,COVID-19 and non-communicable diseases,2020,"Chronic low-grade inflammation negatively impacts health and is associated with aging and obesity, among other health outcomes. A large number of immune mediators are present in the digestive tract and interact with gut bacteria to impact immune function. The gut microbiota itself is also an important initiator of inflammation, for example by releasing compounds such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that may influence cytokine production and immune cell function. Certain nutrients (e.g., probiotics, &#969;-3 fatty acids [FA]) may increase gut microbiota diversity and reduce inflammation. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, among others, prevent gut hyperpermeability and lower LPS-dependent chronic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, &#969;-3 FA generate positive effects on inflammation-related conditions (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes) by interacting with immune, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. &#937;-3 FA also increase LPS-suppressing bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacteria) and decrease LPS-producing bacteria (i.e., Enterobacteria). Additionally, &#969;-3 FA appear to promote short-chain FA production. Therefore, combining probiotics with &#969;-3 FA presents a promising strategy to promote beneficial immune regulation via the gut microbiota, with potential beneficial effects on conditions of inflammatory origin, as commonly experienced by aged and obese individuals, as well as improvements in gut-brain-axis communication.","Hutchinson, Ashley N; Tingö, Lina; Brummer, Robert Jan",Nutrients,,272

We report on two cases (spouses) with SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported OTDs, but otherwise no typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his nineties (index patient) had respiratory symptoms and dysgeusia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19. His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms. However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient. Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. INTERPRETATION: Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues. Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Hjelmesæth, Jøran; Skaare, Dagfinn",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,272

463615,Reducing COVID-19 infection Exposures: autonomy versus non-malificence,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) anti-spike IgG responses in healthcare workers (HCWs) following one or two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. METHODS: HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: &#8805;50 AU/mL). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalized additive models to track antibody responses over time. RESULTS: 3570/3610 HCWs (98.9%) were seropositive >14 days post first vaccination and prior to second vaccination: 2706/2720 (99.5%) were seropositive after the Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890 (97.1%) following the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after the second vaccination were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median (IQR) >21 days post first Pfizer-BioNTech 14 604 (7644-22 291) AU/mL versus 1028 (564-1985) AU/mL without prior infection (p < 0.001). Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine recipients had lower readings post first dose than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients, with and without previous infection, 10 095 (5354-17 096) and 435 (203-962) AU/mL respectively (both p < 0.001 versus Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses >21 days post second Pfizer vaccination in those not previously infected, 10 058 (6408-15 582) AU/mL, were similar to those after prior infection followed by one vaccine dose. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to detectable anti-spike antibodies in nearly all adult HCWs. Whether differences in response impact vaccine efficacy needs further study.","Eyre, David W; Lumley, Sheila F; Wei, Jia; Cox, Stuart; James, Tim; Justice, Anita; Jesuthasan, Gerald; O039,; Donnell, Denise; Howarth, Alison; Hatch, Stephanie B; Marsden, Brian D; Jones, E Yvonne; Stuart, David I; Ebner, Daniel; Hoosdally, Sarah; Crook, Derrick W; Peto, Tim E A; Walker, Timothy M; Stoesser, Nicole E; Matthews, Philippa C; Pouwels, Koen B; Walker, A Sarah; Jeffery, Katie",Clin. microbiol. infect,,272

463810,The challenges of keeping psychiatric patients safe in rehabilitation centers during coronavirus outbreak,2020,"Importance: Active SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) transmission continues in the US. It is unclear whether better access to coronavirus testing and more consistent use of testing could substantially reduce transmission. Objective: To describe coronavirus testing in persons with new onset of febrile illness and analyze whether there are changes over time and differences by race and ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. Results: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge. Black participants reported receiving a test result about half as often as others (7% [7 of 103] of survey responses vs 12% [53 of 461] for Hispanic vs 13% [693 of 5516] for not Black, not Hispanic; P = .03). This association was not statistically significant in adjusted time-to-event models (hazard ratio = 0.59 vs not Black, not Hispanic participants; 95% CI, 0.26-1.34). Conclusions and Relevance: Systematic underuse of coronavirus testing was observed in this cohort study through late October 2020, at the beginning of the winter COVID-19 surge, which may have contributed to preventable coronavirus transmission.","Pletcher, Mark J; Olgin, Jeffrey E; Peyser, Noah D; Modrow, Madelaine Faulkner; Lin, Feng; Martin, Jeffrey; Carton, Thomas; Beatty, Alexis L; Vittinghoff, Eric; Marcus, Gregory M",JAMA Netw Open,,272

Given the recent increases in daily positive cases and hospitalizations, this decision was not surprising. However, given the political and economic pressures which are forcing the state to reopen, it is not clear what actions will help North Carolina to avoid the worst. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of social distancing measures and testing capacity combined with contact tracing on the evolution of the pandemic in North Carolina until the end of the year. We find that going back to restrictions that were in place during Phase 1 will slow down the spread but if the state wants to continue to reopen or at least remain in Phase 2 or Phase 3 it needs to significantly expand its testing and contact tracing capacity. Even under our best-case scenario of high contact tracing effectiveness, the number of contact tracers the state currently employs is inadequate.","Housni, Omar El; Sumida, Mika; Rusmevichientong, Paat; Topaloglu, Huseyin; Ziya, Serhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04765v1.pdf,272

466614,Surgery and COVID-19: a rapid scoping review of the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on surgical services,2021,"The kidnapping of the lipid metabolism of the host's cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) allows the virus to transform the cells into optimal machines for its assembly and replication. Here we evaluated changes in the fatty acid (FA) profile and the participation of the activity of the desaturases, in plasma of patients with severe pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 alters the FA metabolism in the cells of the host. Changes are characterized by variations in the desaturases that lead to a decrease in total fatty acid (TFA), phospholipids (PL) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). These alterations include a decrease in palmitic and stearic acids (p &lt;= 0.009) which could be used for the formation of the viral membranes and for the reparation of the host's own membrane. There is also an increase in oleic acid (OA;p = 0.001) which could modulate the inflammatory process, the cytokine release, apoptosis, necrosis, oxidative stress (OS). An increase in linoleic acid (LA) in TFA (p = 0.03) and a decreased in PL (p = 0.001) was also present. They result from damage of the internal mitochondrial membrane. The arachidonic acid (AA) percentage was elevated (p = 0.02) in the TFA and this can be participated in the inflammatory process. EPA was decreased (p = 0.001) and this may decrease of pro-resolving mediators with increase in the inflammatory process. The total of NEFAs (p = 0.03), PL (p = 0.001), cholesterol, HDL and LDL were decreased, and triglycerides were increased in plasma of the COVID-19 patients. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 alters the FA metabolism, the changes are characterized by alterations in the desaturases that lead to variations in the TFA, PL, and NEFAs profiles. These changes may favor the replication of the virus but, at the same time, they are part of the defense system provided by the host cell metabolism in its eagerness to repair damage caused by the virus to cell membranes.","Perez-Torres, I.; Guarner-Lans, V.; Soria-Castro, E.; Manzano-Pech, L.; Palacios-Chavarria, A.; Valdez-Vazquez, R.

467729,Writing on Sports Medicine in Pandemic Times,2020,"Infection with the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulates an immune response which can serve as a marker for current or past exposure to this pathogen, and possibly for resistance to re-infection. This response to COVID-19 can be monitored based on the production of antibodies, and thus, serologic tests have become available for diagnostic purposes. Despite progress in this area, concerns have been raised that too many of the commercially available serologic detection systems are not completely reliable. To address this issue, Western blots should be considered for confirming a positive or borderline-positive result from a screening test, such as an ELISA. An additional benefit of Western blots would be to identify antigens that could form the basis for developing a vaccine. Little is known about the cell-mediated immune response against COVID-19. One way to address this would be to use skin testing to measure the delayed-type hypersensitivity response in patients recovering from COVID-19.","Pavia, Charles S; Wormser, Gary P",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,272

This study aimed to determine the factors that influence psychosocial stress during a period of strict quarantine and lockdown to curb the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea. A total of 338 adults participated in a cross-sectional online survey conducted from 19-25 May 2020, which measured knowledge of COVID-19, health belief, resilience, and psychosocial stress. According to the results, there was no difference between the participants' scores from the Daegu area (with concentrated confirmed COVID-19 cases) and the non-Daegu area except for health belief. Eighty-two percent of participants constituted the high-risk group for psychosocial stress. Individual resilience was positively correlated with health belief and negatively correlated with psychosocial stress (p < 0.001). Further, the following factors affected the level of psychosocial stress: resilience, subjective health status, and monthly household income, with an explanatory power of 39.8%. Therefore, those with higher subjective health and higher monthly household income experienced higher psychosocial stress, whereas higher resilience indicated lower psychosocial stress.","Kim, Jina; Lee, Ogcheol",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,272

470063,The crux of Pakistan's prolonged rabies vaccine shortage: A rising mortal threat in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

471327,"Perception analysis of E-scooter riders and non-riders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Survey outputs",2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak has forced countries to introduce severe restrictive measures to contain its spread. In particular, physical distancing and restriction of movement have had important consequences on human behaviour and potentially also on illicit drug use and supply. These changes can be associated with additional risks for users, in particular due to reduced access to prevention and harm reduction activities. Furthermore, there have been limitations in the amount of data about drug use which can be collected due to restrictions. To goal of this study was to obtain information about potential changes in illicit drug use impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Wastewater samples were collected in seven cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy at the beginning of lockdowns (March-May 2020). Using previously established and validated methods, levels of amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), MDMA, benzoylecgonine (BE, the main metabolite of cocaine) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-&#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH, main metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) were measured and compared with findings from previous years. Important differences in levels of consumed drugs were observed across the considered countries. Whilst for some substances and locations, marked decreases in consumption could be observed (e.g., 50% decrease in MDMA levels compared to previous years). In some cases, similar or even higher levels compared to previous years could be found. Changes in weekly patterns were also observed, however these were not clearly defined for all locations and/or substances. Findings confirm that the current situation is highly heterogeneous and that it remains very difficult to explain and/or predict the effect that the present pandemic has on illicit drug use and availability. However, given the current difficulty in obtaining data due to restrictions, wastewater analysis can provide relevant information about the situation at the local level, which would be hard to obtain otherwise.","Been, Frederic; Emke, Erik; Matias, João; Baz-Lomba, Jose Antonio; Boogaerts, Tim; Castiglioni, Sara; Campos-Mañas, Marina; Celma, Alberto; Covaci, Adrian; de Voogt, Pim; Hernández, Félix; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara; Laak, Thomas Ter; Reid, Malcolm; Salgueiro-González, Noelia; Steenbeek, Ruud; van Nuijs, Alexander L N; Zuccato, Ettore; Bijlsma, Lubertus",Environ Int,,272

Moreover, under crisis conditions, these factors may demonstrate a different dynamic. The ongoing economic uncertainly inherent in the development of Russian regions has intensified with the unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic. The structural heterogeneity of the domestic economy, manifested in the underfunding of human development, led to an increase in poverty, population decline and, ultimately, to a decrease in welfare. The principle of catch-up modernization has not justified itself for over almost three decades of its application. We propose a diagnostic approach to assessing the state of a region's economy taking into account the dynamics of indicators and impulse response behaviour of turning points.

At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. RESULTS: Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, people's mental state is affected by the geographical and temporal distributions.","Ren, Yali; Qian, Wei; Li, Zezhi; Liu, Zhengkui; Zhou, Yongjie; Wang, Ruoxi; Qi, Ling; Yang, Jiezhi; Song, Xiuli; Zeng, Lingyun; Zhang, Xiangyang",J Affect Disord,,272

473960,Preterm birth rates during the COVID-19 lockdown in Queensland Australia,2021,"Contact-tracing apps have potential benefits in helping health authorities to act swiftly to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals. Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the U.S.","Li, Tianshi; Yang, Jackie; Faklaris, Cori; King, Jennifer; Agarwal, Yuvraj; Dabbish, Laura; Hong, Jason I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11957v1.pdf,272

A retrospective cohort study from urology departments",2021,"Flipped teaching (FT) is known to foster active learning and increase student engagement The flipped classroom design organizes learning in such a way that the lower-order thinking such as memorization is expected at the individual student level in the form of homework and the higher-order thinking including application and analysis occurs in the classroom in the presence of the instructor With the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors and students were given no time to adjust to the remote educational set up Flipped teaching, like most other instructional modalities, had to be transformed into an online platform The present study assessed the effectiveness of FT in a remote setting in a graduate-level physiology course (n=33) The course content included lecture videos, slides, and reading assignments which were made available on BlackBoard, the Learning Management System Students were expected to have reviewed the assigned content prior to the virtual synchronous sessions During the synchronous meeting, a question-answer (Q&A) session allowed students to review the content yet again Followed by the Q&A session, an individual quiz, containing lower-order questions, was given to assess student preparation Soon after the review of the quiz, students in small groups (4-5 students per group) were allowed to use breakout rooms to complete a set of questions which were designed at the higher order of Bloom's taxonomy and expected students to apply knowledge, analyze or synthesize their collaborative responses The answers to these questions were reviewed during the first part of the following synchronous session where students were selected randomly to answer these questions which prompted them to come prepared Student surveys were administered at the beginning and the end of the course to assess their knowledge gain, perception of the remote FT format, and confidence in completing the course Based on the survey results, it was found that the students adjusted well to the remote course setting (p&lt;0 001) and their confidence in completing the course successfully increased from the beginning to the end of the semester (p&lt;0 05) Students also found that the collaborative activities (93 55%) and the in-class discussions (96 77%) were effective and were well adjusted to the synchronous computerized exams (90 32%) and the individual in-class assessments (80 65%) Overall, the remote FT method was successful and therefore, the principles behind FT could be employed in virtual teaching","Gopalan, Chaya",The FASEB Journal,,272
474745,Treating hidradenitis suppurativa during the COVID-19 pandemic: teledermatology exams of sensitive body areas,2020,"Background: Countries have introduced a variety of measures to prevent and treat COVID-19 with medicines and personal protective equipment (PPE), with some countries adopting preventative strategies earlier than others. However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments. This includes hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation lead to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages have also been seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic effects on patients where there are high co-payment levels and issues of affordability. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in the availability, utilization and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic among a range of Asian countries. Our approach: Narrative literature review combined with interviews among community pharmacists to assess changes in consumption, prices and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 until end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: 308 pharmacists took part from five Asian countries. There was an appreciable increase in the utilization of antimicrobials in Pakistan (in over 88% of pharmacies), with lower increases or no change in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Vietnam. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries, as well as limited price rises for antimicrobials in India, Malaysia and Vietnam, although greater price rises seen for analgesics and vitamin C/immune boosters. Appreciable price increases were also seen for PPE across some countries. Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in utilization of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, increases in the utilization and prices of antimicrobials is a concern that needs addressing alongside misinformation and any unintended consequences from the pandemic. Community pharmacists can play a key role in providing evidence-based advice, helping to moderate prices, as well as helping address some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic.","Godman, Brian; Haque, Mainul; Islam, Salequl; Iqbal, Samiul; Urmi, Umme Laila; Kamal, Zubair Mahmood; Shuvo, Shahriar Ahmed; Rahman, Aminur; Kamal, Mustafa; Haque, Monami; Jahan, Iffat; Islam, Md Zakirul; Hossain, Mohammad Monir; Kumar, Santosh; Charan, Jaykaran; Bhatt, Rohan; Dutta, Siddhartha; Abhayanand, Jha Pallavi; Sharma, Yesh; Saleem, Zikria; Phuong, Thuy Nguyen Thi; Kwon, Hye-Young; Kurdi, Amanj; Wale, Janney; Sefah, Israel",Front Public Health,,272

We performed a systematic review including 20 peer-reviewed English language studies reporting mortality in CAPA published till 18 February 2021from PubMed, Ovid SP, Web of Science, Embase and CINHAL. The pooled mortality in CAPA was 51.2% (95% CI: 43.1-61.1, I2 = 38%). The leave one out sensitivity analysis and influential case diagnostics revealed one outlier and its exclusion resulted in a mortality estimate of 54% (95% CI: 45-62). Higher odds of mortality: 2.83 (95% CI: 1.8-4.5) were seen in CAPA compared to controls. No significant difference in various subgroups according to the country of study, the continent of study, income category of country and quality of the included study was seen. None of the host risk factors, mycological test results, therapy for COVID-19 and antifungal therapy affected mortality. Thus, patients with CAPA have a high probability of mortality and early diagnosis with prompt therapy must be ensured to optimally manage these patients. However, more prospective studies with global and multi-centre coordination may help to address CAPA in a better way.","Singh, Shreya; Verma, Nipun; Kanaujia, Rimjhim; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M",Mycoses,,272

Asymmetry Effects: Ambivalent, Uneven, and Dynamic Smaller states view China’s BRI through the prism of power asymmetry. Because of the vast disparities between Southeast Asian states and China, the smaller states have always viewed China with ambivalence, seeing China as a source of both apprehensions and attractions (Ba and Kuik 2018).","Cheng-Chwee, Kuik",Asian Perspective,,272

478097,Lessons Learned for Orthopaedic Care Within the NYC COVID Epicenter Using the United States Naval Ship Comfort,2020,"The novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread world widely and is currently a major healthcare challenge around the world. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray images have been well recognized to be two effective techniques for clinical COVID-19 disease diagnoses. Due to faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT, detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray (CXR) images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However, considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by the hyper-planes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and overlook the uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel deep network named {\em RCoNet$^k_s$} for robust COVID-19 detection which employs {\em Deformable Mutual Information Maximization} (DeIM), {\em Mixed High-order Moment Feature} (MHMF) and {\em Multi-expert Uncertainty-aware Learning} (MUL). With DeIM, the mutual information (MI) between input data and the corresponding latent representations can be well estimated and maximized to capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile, MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally, MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the data.","Dong, Shunjie; Yang, Qianqian; Fu, Yu; Tian, Mei; Zhuo, Cheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11099v1.pdf,272

OBJECTIVE: We carried out an evaluation of the clinical performance of ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" (Bioneer, South Korea) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (IDT, USA) as a gold standard. RESULTS: 48 clinical specimens were included on the study, 38 tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 10 SARS-CoV-2 negative for 2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit. For ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"", only 30 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, indicating a low clinical performance with sensitivity of 78.9%. Moreover, the limit of detection for ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" was estimated to be higher than 40,000 viral RNA copies/mL of sample. CONCLUSIONS: Proper clinical performance evaluation studies from government agencies at developing countries should be mandatory prior to clinical use authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis kits, particularly when those kits lack of either FDA or its country of origin clinical use authorization, to prevent the distribution of low quality products that may have a negative impact of COVID19 surveillance at developing countries.","Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Virol J,,272

479264,The Role of Infectious Disease trainees during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey,2021,"We present pore-scale simulations of two-phase flows in a reconstructed fibrous porous layer. The three dimensional microstructure of the material, a fuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and used as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics. Liquid transport is affected by the presence of a microstructure-induced capillary pressure acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanisms even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure. Finally, we underline the significance of the results for the optimal design of face masks in an effort to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Farzaneh, Meisam; Strom, Henrik; Zanini, Filippo; Carmignato, Simone; Sasic, Srdjan; Technology, Dario Maggiolo Chalmers University of; Padova, University of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12607v1.pdf,272
479790,Outcomes of asymptomatic hospital employees in COVID-19 post-exposure quarantine during the second pandemic wave in Zurich,2021,"Background: During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, there was a supply shortage of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Limited access to medication and the life changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may predispose patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to disease flares. Objective: This study aimed to investigate self-reported symptoms of disease flares among patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 512 completed online surveys from patients with SLE or RA were collected. The data included sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported physical symptoms, health service utilization, and availability of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Results: Seventy-nine percent of respondents had lupus, while 21% had RA. One-third of the cohort had contact with their attending physician during the two-month quarantine period prior to the survey. Eighty-two percent were prescribed hydroxychloroquine and 23.4% were prescribed methotrexate;but 68.6% and 65%, respectively, had “irregular” intake of these medicines due to unavailability. The current health status was reported as good by 66.2%;24% had no symptoms during the two-week period prior to the survey. The most common symptoms experienced were joint pain (51%), muscle pain (35%), headache (26.8%), and skin rash (19.1%). Five percent had a combination of these four most common symptoms. Irregular supply of hydroxychloroquine among patients with SLE (n=323) was associated with more frequent occurrence of muscle pain (40.6% vs 27.9%, p=0.03) or rash (27.4% vs 11.7%, p&lt;0.001). Irregular supply of methotrexate among RA patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate (n=36) was associated with more frequent occurrence of joint pains with or without swelling (73.9% vs 38.5%, p=0.04). Irregular supply of hydroxychloroquine was associated with less frequent occurrence of dizziness (0 vs 66.7%, p&lt;0.001) among RA patients (n=18). Conclusion: In our cohort of RA and SLE, the majority reported at least one symptom that may indicate disease flare. There was a significant association between the irregular supply of hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate with the presence of muscle pain, rash, or joint pains during the 14-day period prior to the survey.","Salido, E.

In addition, thousands of healthcare workers have also got infected with the virus. COVID-19 patients release large amounts of infectious viral particles in form of droplets from cough, sneeze and respiratory secretions. These droplets are the main modes of transmission of COVID-19. This mode of transmission puts the healthcare professionals at an increased risk of infection, especially from asymptomatic patients. As a result, during the current pandemic, most routine surgeries all around the world have been suspended, and only emergency surgeries are being performed. Facial trauma surgery is one such emergency surgery that cannot be delayed or suspended even in this pandemic. This review focuses on precautions surgeons have to take while managing facial trauma patients in the emergency department and while performing emergency surgeries on these patients during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ghai, Suhani",Curr.

Herein we report the first human PET/CT images using the integrin &#945;vß6-binding peptide (18F-&#945;vß6-BP) in a patient 2 mo after the acute phase of infection. Minimal uptake of 18F-&#945;vß6-BP was noted in normal lung parenchyma, with uptake being elevated in areas corresponding to opacities on CT. This case suggests that 18F-&#945;vß6-BP PET/CT is a promising noninvasive approach to identify the presence and potentially monitor the persistence and progression of lung damage.","Foster, Cameron C; Davis, Ryan A; Hausner, Sven H; Sutcliffe, Julie L",J Nucl Med,,272
480546,COVID-19 pandemic impact on gynaecological cancers: a perspective,2020,"Chromatin organization is critical for cell growth, differentiation, and disease development, however, its functions in peripheral myelination and myelin repair remain elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a crucial chromatin organizer, is essential for Schwann cell myelination and myelin regeneration after nerve injury. Inhibition of CTCF or its deletion blocks Schwann cell differentiation at the pro-myelinating stage, whereas overexpression of CTCF promotes the myelination program. We find that CTCF establishes chromatin interaction loops between enhancer and promoter regulatory elements and promotes expression of a key pro-myelinogenic factor EGR2. In addition, CTCF interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive-complex 2 (PRC2), to repress the transcriptional program associated with negative regulation of Schwann cell maturation. Together, our findings reveal a dual role of CTCF-dependent chromatin organization in promoting myelinogenic programs and recruiting chromatin-repressive complexes to block Schwann cell differentiation inhibitors to control peripheral myelination and repair.","Wang, Jincheng; Wang, Jiajia; Yang, Lijun; Zhao, Chuntao; Wu, Laiman Natalie; Xu, Lingli; Zhang, Feng; Weng, Qinjie; Wegner, Michael; Lu, Q Richard",Nat Commun,,272

CORD-19 contains not only research that deals directly with COVID-19 and coronaviruses, but also research on viruses in general. Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses; influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical medicine. CORD-19 publications that appeared in 2020, especially editorials and letters, are disproportionately popular on social media.

These health professionals include tutors and resident intern specialists, due to the growing demand for the former and the high work overload of the latter. Mindfulness training programs can support these professionals during times of crisis, such as the current global pandemic caused by the coronavirus-19 disease. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training program in relation to a standard training program on the levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-perceived empathy in tutors and resident intern specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing. A total of 112 professionals attached to six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated in this randomized and controlled clinical trial. Experimental Group (GE) participants were included in the standard or abbreviated MBSR programs. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-SF), and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) were administered three times during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant increase in mindfulness (F(2,91) = 3.271; p = 0.042; Î·2 = 0.067) and self-compassion (F(2,91) = 6.046; p = 0.003; Î·2 = 0.117) in the post-test visit, and in self-compassion (F(2,79) = 3.880; p = 0.025; Î·2 = 0.089) in the follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program. The standard MBSR and MSC training program improves levels of mindfulness and self-compassion, and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident intern specialists.

This study examined the association between preinfection blood pressure (BP) control and COVID-19 outcomes using data from 460 general practices in England. Eligible patients were adults with hypertension who were tested or diagnosed with COVID-19. BP control was defined by the most recent BP reading within 24 months of the index date (January 1, 2020). BP was defined as controlled (<130/80 mm Hg), raised (130/80-139/89 mm Hg), stage 1 uncontrolled (140/90-159/99 mm Hg), or stage 2 uncontrolled (&#8805;160/100 mm Hg). The primary outcome was death within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between BP control and outcomes. Of the 45 418 patients (mean age, 67 years; 44.7% male) included, 11 950 (26.3%) had controlled BP. These patients were older, had more comorbidities, and had been diagnosed with hypertension for longer. A total of 4277 patients (9.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 877 died within 28 days. Individuals with stage 1 uncontrolled BP had lower odds of COVID-19 death (odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62-0.92]) compared with patients with well-controlled BP. There was no association between BP control and COVID-19 diagnosis or hospitalization. These findings suggest BP control may be associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, possibly due to these patients having more advanced atherosclerosis and target organ damage. Such patients may need to consider adhering to stricter social distancing, to limit the impact of COVID-19 as future waves of the pandemic occur.","Sheppard, James P; Nicholson, Brian D; Lee, Joseph; McGagh, Dylan; Sherlock, Julian; Koshiaris, Constantinos; Oke, Jason; Jones, Nicholas R; Hinton, William; Armitage, Laura; Van Hecke, Oliver; Lay-Flurrie, Sarah; Bankhead, Clare R; Liyanage, Harshana; Williams, John; Ferreira, Filipa; Feher, Michael D; Ashworth, Andrew J; Joy, Mark P; de Lusignan, Simon; Hobbs, F D Richard",Hypertension,,272

483166,Professional and Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oncology Residents: A National Survey,2020,"INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus and its resulting pandemic status in March 2020 all routine elective orthopaedic surgery was cancelled in our institution. The developing picture in Italy, of acute hospitals becoming overwhelmed with treating patients suffering with severe and life-threatening symptoms from the disease, prompted the orthopaedic surgeons to formulate a plan to transfer trauma patients requiring surgery to the elective hospital to unburden the acute hospital system. METHODS: Under the threat of this pandemic; protocols and algorithms were established for referral, acceptance and care of trauma patients from acute hospitals in the region. Each day, as new guidance on COVID-19 emerged, our process and algorithms were adjusted to reflect pertinent change. RESULTS: The screening of all patients referred, worked well in keeping our hospital ""COVID-free"" with respect to patients undergoing operations. An upward trend in cases referred reflected the decreased capacity in the acute hospitals due to rising cases of COVID-19 within the hospital network. During the first 7 weeks of the pandemic 308 operations were performed, (31.1% upper limb, 33.4% lower limb, 4.1% spine, 14.1% urgent elective, 17.4% plastic surgery cases). Regular review and audit of the activity in the hospital as well as communication with the referring teams enabled appropriate planning to accommodate the increase in case-mix as the need arose. DISCUSSION: This paper details the steps that were taken in planning for such a change in management specific to the orthopaedic surgery setting and the lessons learnt during this process. The success of the development of this pathway was facilitated by clear communication channels, flexibility to adapt to changing process and feedback from all stakeholders. The implementation of this pathway allowed the unburdening of acute hospitals dealing with the pandemic that was steadily reducing access to operating theatres and anaesthetic resources.","Gibbons, John P; Forman, Siobhan; Keogh, Peter; Curtin, Paul; Kiely, Ruth; O039,; Leary, Geraldine; Skerritt, Conor; Sullivan, Kathy; Synnott, Keith; Cashman, James P; Byrne, John M",Surg.

484608,"Context, design and conduct of the longitudinal COVID-19 psychological research consortium study-wave 3",2021,"BACKGROUND: Social media is one of the most rapid and impactful ways of obtaining and delivering information in the modern era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rapidly obtain information on public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 in order to identify deficiencies in key areas of public education. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. ""Fever or chills"" (n=4973, 87.6%) and ""shortness of breath"" (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (<35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19, which future efforts should aim at correcting.","Ali, Khawla F; Whitebridge, Simon; Jamal, Mohammad H; Alsafy, Mohammad; Atkin, Stephen L",J Med Internet Res,,272

The increased susceptibility to severe disease in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities argues for an initial defect in anti-viral host defense mechanisms. Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed ""trained immunity,"" by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections through epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. We propose that induction of trained immunity by whole-microorganism vaccines may represent an important tool for reducing susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2.","Netea, Mihai G; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Curtis, Nigel; van Crevel, Reinout; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Bonten, Marc",Cell,,272
486053,Evaluation of knowledge and health behavior of University of Medical Sciences students about the prevention of COVID-19,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to report on a post-confinement reflection (not post-COVID-19) resulting from a series of online forums that took place during the peak moments of the pandemic, with the intention of raising awareness and mobilising tourism agents for the development of tourism planning and tourism intelligence, taking advantage of the period of stagnation of the tourism industry. The project was named ""Tourism in flight mode: Thinking together the post COVID-19 tourism"". Design/methodology/approach: The project was based on the sharing of information and experiences in virtual forums where participants from all over the world had the opportunity to explain how the pandemic was influencing their work/business, the regional or national tourism activity, GDP and jobs and how they and their regions were preparing for the recovery of tourism. On a biweekly basis, virtual forums were organised, with participants from three continents and 12 countries. The results were contextualised by carrying out a review of the most recent literature and authors' tourism know-how in the field. Findings: The results of the discussions allowed for an identification of new potential successful tourism products and new proposals for the design of basic pillars for destinations planning. Practical implications: This paper offers practical recommendations for public administration and others on dealing with unexpected crises in the tourism sector and how to respond through the development of new and adapted products and approaches to tourism. Originality/value: This paper creates awareness in public administration and other agencies about the opportunities and the needs for this ""new era"".","Pardo, C.; Ladeiras, A.",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,,272

METHOD: The global online survey was circulated in the occupational therapy community by the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) between April and July 2020, collecting responses to closed-ended questions, in addition to free-text comments. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to assess relationships between respondent characteristics and the utilisation of telehealth. Thematic statement analysis provided further insight regarding factors impacting telehealth use. RESULTS: Findings revealed a significant increase in the use of telehealth strategies with the onset of the pandemic among survey respondents, with many reported benefits. Bivariate analyses indicated telehealth users were more likely to score higher feelings of safety and positive work morale, as well as perceive employer expectations to be reasonable. Restricted access to technology, limitations of remote practice, funding issues and slow pace of change were identified as barriers for some respondents to utilising telehealth. Facilitators included availability of supportive policy, guidelines and strategies, in addition to education and training. CONCLUSION: This study advances the understanding of the current scope of occupational therapy telehealth practice in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although results suggest long-term potential for telehealth use as an adjunct to traditional service provision, important considerations were identified regarding factors influencing integration of such strategies.","Hoel, Viktoria; von Zweck, Claudia; Ledgerd, Ritchard",Work,,272

In view of the fragmentation of the large amount of information, knowledge gaps in relation to laboratory markers, and scarcity of papers in Portuguese, we propose a Literature review on laboratory changes observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Analysis of articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 on the PubMed and SciELO databases. The articles were identified, filtered, and evaluated based on the approach to the subject, language, and impact. Then, the articles were subjected to a thorough reading, in full, by 4 (four) independent researchers. RESULTS: Leukopenia and lymphopenia were included in most studies, even in case definitions. Platelet count and platelet-lymphocyte ratio, at peak platelet, were associated with advanced age and longer hospital stay. Eosinopenia showed a sensitivity of 74.7% and specificity of 68.7% and, together with increased CRP, these are one of the future prospects for screening for disease. A high level of procalcitonin may indicate bacterial co-infection, leading to a worse prognosis. COVID-19 manifests itself with increased levels of many inflammatory markers such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IP10, IFN-Î³, MIP1A, MCP1, GSCF, TNF-&#945;, and MCP1/CCL2, as well as LDH, ESR, D-dimer, CK, ALT, and AST. CONCLUSION: There is a need for further studies on the new SARS-CoV-2. So far, there is no consensus regarding laboratory findings and their usefulness, whether as a prognostic marker, mortality, or disease severity.","Pereira, Miguel Augusto Martins; Barros, Isabella Carolina de Almeida; Jacob, Ana Luiza Veríssimo; Assis, Mayara Lopes de; Kanaan, Salim; Kang, Hye Chung",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,272

Their crystal structures have been studied using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. (I) is a new member of the A+M2+M3+[PO4]2 family. Its open 3D framework built by AlO5 and PO4 polyhedra includes small channels populated by columns of CuO6 octahedra sharing edges, and large channels where K+ ions are deposited. It is assumed that the stability of this structure type is due to the pair substitution of Cu/Al with Ni/Fe, Co/Fe or Mg/Fe in different representatives of the series. From the KCuAl[PO4]2 structural features, one may suppose it is a potentially electrochemically active material and/or possible low-temperature antiferromagnet. In accordance with results obtained from X-ray diffraction data, using scanning electron microscopy, microprobe analysis and detailed crystal chemical observation, (II) is considered as a product of epitaxial intergrowth of phosphate KAlZn[PO4]2 and silicate KAlSi[SiO4]2 components having closely similar crystal structures.

We use the model to simulate relative transmission risk for (i) isolation of symptomatic individuals, (ii) contact person management and (iii) quarantine of incoming travelers. We estimated that testing travelers at entry reduces transmission risks to 21.3% ([20.7, 23.9], PCR) and 27.9% ([27.1, 31.1], rapid diagnostic tests; RDT), compared to unrestricted entry. We calculated that 4 (PCR) vs. 5 (RDT) days pre-test quarantine are non-inferior to a 10 days quarantine for incoming travelers and that 8 (PCR) vs. 10 (RDT) days of pre-test quarantine are non-inferior to 14 days post-exposure quarantine.

488356,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urology practice: Review of literature,2020,"Biological sex is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of health and disease, particularly relevant to the topical COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Epidemiological data and observational reports from both the original SARS epidemic and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have a common feature: males are more likely to exhibit enhanced disease severity and mortality than females. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 share mechanistic foundations, namely the involvement of both the innate immune system and the canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Immunological differences suggest that females mount a rapid and aggressive innate immune response, and the attenuated antiviral response in males may confer enhanced susceptibility to severe disease. Further, the ACE2 enzyme is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, either to serve as a protective mechanism by deactivating the renin-angiotensin system or as the receptor for viral entry, respectively. Loss of membrane ACE2 and a corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 are associated with worsened cardiovascular disease outcomes, a mechanism attributed to A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM)17. SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to ADAM17 activation, a positive feedback cycle that exacerbates ACE2 loss. Therefore, the relationship between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is critically dependent on the loss of membrane ACE2 by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage. This article will explore potential mechanisms involved in COVID-19 that may contribute to sex-specific susceptibility focusing on the innate immune system and the RAS, namely genetics and sex hormones. Finally, we will highlight the added challenges of gender in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Viveiros, Anissa; Rasmuson, Jaslyn; Vu, Jennie; Mulvagh, Sharon L; Yip, Cindy Y Y; Norris, Colleen M; Oudit, Gavin Y","Am. j. physiol, Heart circ. physiol",,272
488374,Surgeon and Preparedness for COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common, and so far, there is no digital technology with a standard procedure to estimate the muscle strength of these patients. Quadriceps maximal isometric voluntary contraction (QMVC) is a precise and reliable procedure to detect quadriceps muscle strength. Therefore, this research aimed to explore whether QMVC measurements can be used in critically ill patients at the bedside as a potential diagnostic method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tailor-made computerized equipment was designed to measure the QMVC of critically ill patients at the bedside, following a standard procedure. A total of 22 critically ill patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were divided into group 1 and group 2, respectively. SPASS 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: All subjects showed good endurance with the QMVC measurements and there were no side effects among these subjects. There was a significant decline in QMVC between group 1 and group 2 (p=0.000). QMVC was correlated closely with the APACHE II Score in group 1 (Pearson correlation, r=-0.427, p=0.047). Among the 10 patients with a Medical Research Council sum score (MRC SS) less than 60 in group 1, it was also correlated closely with the MRC SS (Pearson correlation, r=0.837, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a standard technique for quantifying quadriceps muscle strength that is feasible for use with critical patients. QMVC can accurately detect the decline of quadriceps muscle strength of critical patients, and it may also decline with the severity of the disease. In the future, this technique might be a potential diagnostic tool for ICUAW.","Wang, J-L; Qin, Y; Shi, S-R; Fu, Y-L; Huang, S-J; Tian, Z-Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,272

489064,Response of Clinical Laboratories to the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Aberrant expression of the chemokine CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4) is closely associated with cancer progression and drug-resistance in multiple cancers, and we first investigated the role of CXCR4 in regulating cancer pathogenesis and cisplatin (DDP)-resistance in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the present study. Here, we identified that CXCR4 acted as an oncogene to promote cancer progression and genetically silencing of CXCR4 increased cisplatin (DDP)-sensitivity in ccRCC in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, analysis from the clinical and cellular data indicated that CXCR4 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and cells, compared to their normal counterparts. Next, the loss-of-function experiments validated that knock-down of CXCR4 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ccRCC cells, while CXCR4 overexpression had opposite effects on the above cellular functions. Consistently, the xenograft tumor-bearing mice models were established, and the results supported that knock-down of CXCR4 inhibited tumor growth and the expression levels of Ki67 protein in vivo. In addition, the ccRCC cells were exposed to DDP treatment, and we surprisingly found that upregulation of CXCR4 increased DDP-resistance in ccRCC cells, and conversely, CXCR4 ablation sensitized ccRCC cells to DDP stimulation. Taken together, we concluded that CXCR4 ablation hindered cancer progression and enhanced DDP-sensitivity in ccRCC, and the present study identified a novel therapeutic biomarker for ccRCC.","Wang, Wenguang; Gan, Zhilu; Liu, Qiang; Yan, Shenshen; Mulati, Rexiti; Wang, Yujie",Bioengineered,,272

We conceptualise the social responses triggered by the crisis as particular forms of public sphere resilience and assess the role of digitalisation and digital spaces in the emergence of distinct modes and dynamics of resilience. Four areas of enhanced public sphere experimentation are examined with respect to our conceptualisation: political consumerism, digital modes of solidarity, political protest mobilisation, and news consumption. We discuss overarching features of public sphere resilience across societal sub-spheres and highlight the dynamics and hybridities which structure the emerging public spaces. Resilience practices are accompanied by dynamics of politicisation and depoliticisation coupled with shifting boundaries of publicness and privateness. Our observations likewise reveal the dynamic interplay between resilience and resistance.

In this paper, we have evaluated the influence of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Our hypothesis is that obesity is associated with reduced amounts of specific IgG antibodies. Results have confirmed our hypothesis and have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known influence of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein), and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids). These results altogether could help to identify an inflammatory signature with strong predictive value for immune dysfunction. Inflammatory markers identified may subsequently be targeted to improve humoral immunity in individuals with obesity and in individuals with other chronic inflammatory conditions.","Frasca, Daniela; Reidy, Lisa; Cray, Carolyn; Diaz, Alain; Romero, Maria; Kahl, Kristin; Blomberg, Bonnie B",PLoS One,,272

METHODS: We collected wastewater from 24 random locations at Bangkok city center and 26 nearby suburbs from July to December 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater from both the city center and suburbs. Except for July, there were no significant differences in copy numbers between the city center and suburbs. Between October and November, a sharp rise in copy number was observed in both places followed by two to three times increase in December, related to SARS-CoV-2 cases reported for same month. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided the first dataset related to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the wastewater of Bangkok. Our results suggest that wastewater could be used as a complementary source for detecting viral RNA and predicting upcoming outbreaks and waves.","Wannigama, Dhammika Leshan; Amarasiri, Mohan; Hurst, Cameron; Phattharapornjaroen, Phatthranit; Abe, Shuichi; Hongsing, Parichart; Rad, S M Ali Hosseini; Pearson, Lachlan; Saethang, Thammakorn; Luk-In, Sirirat; Kueakulpattana, Naris; Storer, Robin James; Ounjai, Puey; Jacquet, Alain; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Chatsuwan, Tanittha",Int. j. infect. dis,,272

DesignA retrospective Bayesian modelling study to reconstruct transmission chains amongst 2181 patients and healthcare workers using combined viral genomic and epidemiological data. SettingA large UK NHS Trust with over 1400 beds and employing approximately 17,000 staff. Participants780 patients and 522 staff testing SARS-CoV-2 positive between 1st March 2020 and 25th July 2020 (Wave 1); and 580 patients and 299 staff testing SARS-CoV-2 positive between 30th November 2020 and 24th January 2021 (Wave 2). Main outcome measuresTransmission pairs including who-infected-whom; location of transmission events in hospital; number of secondary cases from each individual, including differences in onward transmission from community and hospital onset patient cases. ResultsStaff-to-staff transmission was estimated to be the most frequent transmission type during Wave 1 (31.6% of observed hospital-acquired infections; 95% CI 26.9 to 35.8%), decreasing to 12.9% (95% CI 9.5 to 15.9%) in Wave 2. Patient-to-patient transmissions increased from 27.1% in Wave 1 (95% CI 23.3 to 31.4%) to 52.1% (95% CI 48.0 to 57.1%) in Wave 2, to become the predominant transmission type. Over 50% of hospital-acquired infections were concentrated in 8/120 locations in Wave 1 and 10/93 locations in Wave 2. Approximately 40% to 50% of hospital-onset patient cases resulted in onward transmission compared to less than 4% of definite community-acquired cases. ConclusionsPrevention and control measures that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had a significant impact on reducing infections between healthcare workers, but were insufficient during the second wave to prevent a high number of patient-to-patient transmissions. As hospital-acquired cases appeared to drive most onward transmissions, more frequent and rapid identification and isolation of these cases will be required to break hospital transmission chains in subsequent pandemic waves.","Lindsey, Benjamin B; Villabona-Arenas, Ch.

493204,Letter from China: Managing the second-wave COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Preliminary reports indicated that smokers could be less susceptible to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. However, once infected an increased risk of severe disease is reported. We investigated the association between smoking and COVID-19 during an outbreak of the disease on a naval vessel. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on the 1769 sailors of a same navy aircraft carrier at sea exposed at the same time to SARS-CoV2 to investigate the link between tobacco consumption and Covid-19. RESULTS: Among the 1688 crewmembers (87% men; median age= 28 (IQR 23-35)) included, 1279 (76%) developed Covid-19 (1038 (62%) RT-PCR-positive and 241 (14%) with only clinical signs). One hundred and seven patients were hospitalized. The univariable analysis odds ratio (OR) for Covid-19 infection was 0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.78; P<0.001) for current smokers vs. former and nonsmokers; sex, body mass index or blood group had no significant impact. Crewmembers >50 years old had an increased risk of contracting Covid-19 (OR, 2.84 [95% CI, 1.30-7.5]; P=0.01). Multivariable analysis retained the lower risk of current smokers becoming infected (OR, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]; P<0.001) and age >50 years was significatively associated with Covid-19 (OR, 2.6 [1.17-6.9]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking status was associated with a lower risk of developing Covid-19 but cannot be considered as an efficient protection against infection. Mechanism of the lower susceptibility of smokers to SARS-CoV-2 requires further research. IMPLICATIONS: Recent epidemiologic data suggest a paradoxical link between smoking and Covid-19. Among the 1688 crewmembers (with an attack rate of 76% and exposed at the same time in the same place to SARS-CoV2), we found a significant lower risk for developing COVID-19 in current smokers (71%) versus former and non smokers (80%). This finding strongly supports the need for further research on nicotine physiological pathway and its impact on COVID-19 infection whilst emphasizing that tobacco smoking should not be considered as an efficient protection against COVID-19.","Paleiron, Nicolas; Mayet, Aurélie; Marbac, Vanessa; Perisse, Anne; Barazzutti, Hélène; Brocq, François-Xavier; Janvier, Frédéric; Bertrand, Dautzenberg; Bylicki, Olivier",Nicotine tob. res,,272

Workplace or employees’ clinics play a vital role in disease outbreaks as there could be an influx of sick personnel. Processes and patient flows during pandemics should be documented to identify good practices and sources of operational inefficiencies. Objective. To describe the patient flow, health delivery processes, and areas for improvement at the UPHS during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from May to June 2020. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study involving patient flow analysis of processes at the employees’ clinic of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital. The study was divided into two major components: clinic process time measurement and process flow mapping. Data collection involved time elements and narrative descriptions of good practices and problems in the process flow. Results. The UPHS staff attended to 1,514 employees’ visits during the 15 working days from May to June 2020. The total UPHS service time from arrival to end of consultation of an employee with a COVID-19-related concern was an average of 1 hour 3 minutes (SD±39 minutes) with a mean total waiting time of 46 minutes (SD±37 minutes). Good practices identified were personnel flexibility in doing other tasks, good communication, and infection control measures. Areas for improvement included symptom screening, implementation of physical distancing, and disinfection practices. Conclusion. The process flows in the UPHS clinic consisted of COVID-19 related consultations, non-COVID-19 related concerns, and swabbing services. Good communication, staff flexibility, infection control measures, and leadership were identified as good practices. Occasional lapses in symptom screening at triage, physical distancing among employees in queuing lines, and inconsistent disinfection practices were the areas for improvement. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

The initial recognized symptoms were respiratory, sometimes culminating in severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation, and causing death in a percentage of those infected. As time has passed, other symptoms have been recognized. The initial reports of cutaneous manifestations were from Italian dermatologists, probably because Italy was the first European country to be heavily affected by the pandemic. The overall clinical presentation, course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children differ from those in adults as do the cutaneous manifestations of childhood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in children after thorough and critical review of articles published in the literature and from the personal experience of a large panel of paediatric dermatologists in Europe. In Part 1, we discuss one of the first and most widespread cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19, chilblain-like lesions. In Part 2, we review other manifestations, including erythema multiforme, urticaria and Kawasaki disease-like inflammatory multisystemic syndrome, while in Part 3, we discuss the histological findings of COVID-19 manifestations, and the testing and management of infected children, for both COVID-19 and any other pre-existing conditions.","Andina, D; Belloni-Fortina, A; Bodemer, C; Bonifazi, E; Chiriac, A; Colmenero, I; Diociaiuti, A; El-Hachem, M; Fertita, L; van Gysel, D; Hernández-Martín, A; Hubiche, T; Luca, C; Martos-Cabrera, L; Maruani, A; Mazzotta, F; Akkaya, A D; Casals, M; Ferrando, J; Grimalt, R; Grozdev, I; Kinsler, V; Morren, M A; Munisami, M; Nanda, A; Novoa, M P; Ott, H; Pasmans, S; Salavastru, C; Zawar, V; Torrelo, A",Clin. exp. dermatol,,272

We used a snowball sampling approach with backward and forward citation search along with co-citations. RESULTS: We found 20 articles examining the role of hospitality venues in the epidemiology of COVID-19. Modeling studies showed that interventions reducing social contacts in indoor venues can reduce COVID-19 transmission. Studies using statistical models showed similar results, including that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures in reducing incidence or mortality. Case studies highlighted the role of hospitality venues in generating super-spreading events, along with the importance of airflow and ventilation inside these venues. CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent results across studies showing that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19.

494536,Correction to: Virtual visits for chronic neurologic disorders during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 have caused widespread and catastrophic public health and economic impact, requiring governments to restrict societal activity to reduce the spread of the disease. The role of household transmission in the population spread of SARS-CoV-2, and of host immunity in limiting transmission, is poorly understood. This paper describes a protocol for a prospective observational study of a cohort of households in Liverpool City Region, UK, which addresses the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between household members and how immunological response to the infection changes over time. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Households in the Liverpool City Region, in which members have not previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a nucleic acid amplification test, are followed up for an initial period of 12 weeks. Participants are asked to provide weekly self-throat and nasal swabs and record their activity and presence of symptoms. Incidence of infection and household secondary attack rates of COVID-19 are measured. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be investigated against a range of demographic and behavioural variables. Blood and faecal samples are collected at several time points to evaluate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence and risk factors for faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee; REC Reference: 20/HRA/2297, IRAS Number: 283 464. Results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and peer-reviewed open access publications. A report of the findings will also be shared with participants. The study will quantify the scale and determinants of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, immunological responses before and during the different stages of infection will be analysed, adding to the understanding of the range of immunological response by infection severity.","Setiabudi, Wega; Hungerford, Daniel; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; Vaselli, Natasha Marcella; Shaw, Victoria E; Wilton, Moon; Vivancos, Roberto; Aston, Stephen; Platt, Gareth; Moitt, Tracy; Jones, Ashley P; Gabbay, Mark; Buchan, Iain; Carrol, Enitan D; Iturriza-Gomara, Miren; Solomon, Tom; Greenhalf, William; Naisbitt, Dean J; Adams, Emily R; Cunliffe, Nigel A; Turtle, Lance; French, Neil",BMJ Open,,272

495689,"COVID-19 will severely impact older people's lives, and in many more ways than you think!",2020,"OBJECTIVES: Rapid, high throughput diagnostics are a valuable tool, allowing the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in populations so as to identify and isolate people with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Reagent shortages and restricted access to high throughput testing solutions have limited the effectiveness of conventional assays such as quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly throughout the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We investigated the use of LamPORE, where loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is coupled to nanopore sequencing technology, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. METHODS: In an asymptomatic prospective cohort, for 3 weeks in September 2020, health-care workers across four sites (Birmingham, Southampton, Basingstoke and Manchester) self-swabbed with nasopharyngeal swabs weekly and supplied a saliva specimen daily. These samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Oxford Nanopore LamPORE system and a reference RT-qPCR assay on extracted sample RNA. A second retrospective cohort of 848 patients with influenza-like illness from March 2020 to June 2020 were similarly tested from nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: In the asymptomatic cohort a total of 1200 participants supplied 23 427 samples (3966 swab, 19 461 saliva) over a 3-week period. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection using LamPORE was 0.95%. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LamPORE was >99.5% (decreasing to approximately 98% when clustered estimation was used) in both swab and saliva asymptomatic samples when compared with the reference RT-qPCR test. In the retrospective symptomatic cohort, the incidence was 13.4% and the sensitivity and specificity were 100%. CONCLUSIONS: LamPORE is a highly accurate methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic population settings and can be used as an alternative to RT-qPCR.","Ptasinska, Anetta; Whalley, Celina; Bosworth, Andrew; Poxon, Charlotte; Bryer, Claire; Machin, Nicholas; Grippon, Seden; Wise, Emma L; Armson, Bryony; Howson, Emma L A; Goring, Alice; Snell, Gemma; Forster, Jade; Mattocks, Chris; Frampton, Sarah; Anderson, Rebecca; Cleary, David; Parker, Joe; Boukas, Konstantinos; Graham, Nichola; Cellura, Doriana; Garratt, Emma; Skilton, Rachel; Sheldon, Hana; Collins, Alla; Ahmad, Nusreen; Friar, Simon; Burns, Daniel; Williams, Tim; Godfrey, Keith M; Deans, Zandra; Douglas, Angela; Hill, Sue; Kidd, Michael; Porter, Deborah; Kidd, Stephen P; Cortes, Nicholas J; Fowler, Veronica; Williams, Tony; Richter, Alex; Beggs, Andrew D",Clin. microbiol. infect,,272

496880,Initial Assessment of the Impact of the Emergency State Lockdown Measures on the 1st Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal,2020,"The multidimensional crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic has implications for the country's economy. Foreign investors are sought to help extinguish the threat of a deficit in state finances through foreign investment (FI). Access to investment, which was initially limited in nature, has become quite flexible due to the promulgation of the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Legislative reform which was colored by intrigue and controversy was packaged as a way out for national development and economy, especially as a response to the prevention of the country's financial crisis. This research examines the implementation of FI regulations on the investment climate in Indonesia, especially during the period of COVID-19 pandemic and a critical narrative towards the Omnibus Law on Job Creation which represents the investment legal revolution. By using normative legal research methods, this research is expected to be able to answer the above legal issues through a statutory approach and literature law materials which include scientific works and research results. The results show that the implementation of FI regulations in Indonesia is still classified as complicated so that the effect is the low interest of foreign investors to invest their capital in Indonesia. Although the government through the Capital Investment Coordinating Board has attempted to overcome this problem by pioneering the establishment of the One Stop Integrated Service and Investment Service, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for the realization of foreign investment in Indonesia. On the other hand, Government policy in reforming investment law in Indonesia through the Omnibus Law on Job Creation too prioritizing economic targets that are not proportional to the threat of state sovereignty and guarantee of people's welfare.","Atikasari, Hartini; en,",Journal Of Private And Commercial Law,,272

We outline our deployment of a virtual tabletop simulation (TTS) method in primary care (PC) clinics across Alberta, Canada. We summarise the quality and safety improvements from this method and report end users' perspectives on key elements. Methods: Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. Results: These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. Discussion: TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices. While our sessions were conducted in Alberta, our results suggest this method may be deployed in other contexts, including low-resource settings. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Graduate students have shown an increase in online course enrollment, and similar trends are anticipated among nurses with limited access to on-site education due to the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Faculty must utilize preferred teaching/learning strategies to provide high-quality online education courses that engage learners and improve outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed preferred teaching/learning strategies for graduate students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous nursing course. Correlational data assessed the relationship between preferred teaching/learning strategies and selected demographic information. METHODS: All graduate nursing students enrolled in at least 1 asynchronous course at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing during a 3-month period were invited to participate in a survey to assess preferred teaching/learning methods. RESULTS: Sixty-six graduate students completed the survey. Most participants were comfortable with computer skills, had previously enrolled in a web-enhanced course, and did not enjoy group work. Preferred teaching/learning strategies included voice-over PowerPoints, simulation, case studies, guest speakers, and faculty communication. CONCLUSION: Preferred teaching/learning strategies that incorporate asynchronous and synchronous learning should be developed. These strategies will enhance the knowledge base of nurses in all settings and populations.","Harlan, Melissa Dawn; Rosenzweig, Margaret Quinn; Hoffmann, Rosemary Labarbera",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,,272

Whether liver fibrosis might be a relevant player in the natural history of COVID-19 is currently unknown. We aimed to evaluate the association between FIB-4 and the risk of progression to critical illness in middle-aged patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study with prospective follow-up of 160 patients aged 35-65 years with COVID-19, FIB-4, clinical, and biochemical variables were collected at baseline. FIB-4 &#8805;2.67 defined patients with risk for advanced liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Risk for advanced fibrosis was estimated in 28.1% of patients. Patients with FIB-4 &#8805;2.67 more frequently required mechanical ventilation (37.8% vs 18.3%; P = .009). In multivariate analysis, FIB-4 &#8805;2.67 (odds ratio [OR], 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-8.92), cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 5.05; 95% CI, 1.90-13.39), previous respiratory diseases (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.36-15.10), and C-reactive protein (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) increased significantly the risk of ICU admission. Bootstrap confirmed FIB-4 as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged patients with COVID-19, FIB-4 may have a prognostic role.

The three essential elements in the contemporary understanding of motherhood reflect neoliberal concerns and are related to mothers’ unpaid work, the female body and mothers’ participation in the labour market. These three elements have been distilled with the help of secondary literature and are based on initial observations and interview results that had been conducted as part of an ongoing research project on contemporary motherhood practices of upper-middle-class mothers from Switzerland, Turkey and Germany. Consequently, the focus in this article lies on upper-class and upper-middle-class women. In contrast to optimistic visions that envision the end of neoliberalism, I argue that the neoliberal understanding of motherhood is likely to persist and to re-emerge as the dominant model of motherhood in the wake of the pandemic.","Güney-Frahm, Irem",Gender Work Organ.,,272

This study focuses on how America?s largest publicly traded firms use these two nonmarket strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Results suggest that public firms actively engaged in both CSR and CPA after the outbreak. The preliminary estimation shows that firms listed in Russell 1000 have donated or pledged over $3.9 billion to corporate philanthropy and invested over 2.1 billion in observed political donations and lobbying in Congress in the early pandemic.

So far, no studies have found SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke, and if it was found, whether it was infectious or not is unknown. To date, no evidence shows that respiratory viruses can be transmitted through a surgical plume or an aerosolized gas. There are various advantages of laparoscopy over laparotomy that must be kept in mind in the COVID-19 era, such as early recovery and shorter hospital stay, which can greatly help to conserve valuable hospital resources, and reduced risk of spillage of blood and body fluids, which can help to reduce transmission risk; most importantly, the distances between surgeons and between surgeons and patients are greater. Certain precautionary measures can be taken to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission during laparoscopy.

Prioritising vaccination for certain groups of society is placed in a context of uncertainty due to changing evidence on the available vaccines and changing infection dynamics. To meet accepted ethical standards of procedural justice and individual autonomy, vaccine allocation strategies need to state reasons for prioritisation explicitly while at the same time communicating the expected risks and benefits of vaccination at different times and with different vaccines transparently. In this article, we provide a concept summarising epidemiological considerations underlying current vaccine prioritisation strategies in an accessible way. We define six priority groups (vulnerable individuals, persons in close contact with the vulnerable, key workers with direct work-related contact with the public, key workers without direct work-related contact to the public, dependents of key workers and members of groups with high interpersonal contact rates) and state vaccine priorities for them. Additionally, prioritisation may follow non-epidemiological considerations including the aim to increase intra-societal justice and reducing inequality. While national prioritisation plans integrate many of these concepts, the international community has so far failed to guarantee equitable or procedurally just access to vaccines across settings with different levels of wealth.","Kohns Vasconcelos, Malte; Marazia, Chantal; Koniordou, Markela; Fangerau, Heiner; Drexler, Ingo; Afum-Adjei Awuah, Anthony",Pathog Glob Health,,272

The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.","Cao, Jiabao; Wang, Cheng; Zhang, Yuqing; Lei, Guanglin; Xu, Kun; Zhao, Na; Lu, Jingjing; Meng, Fanping; Yu, Linxiang; Yan, Jin; Bai, Changqing; Zhang, Shaogeng; Zhang, Ning; Gong, Yuhuan; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Chen, Zhu; Dai, Lianpan; Wang, Jun; Yang, Penghui",Gut Microbes,,272

Methods: Participants were recruited to the study via social media advertisements and consented to participate in up to three semi-structured interviews between January and July 2021. Initial semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 participants in January 2021. Participants completed measures of resilience (2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and distress (The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically. Results: Participants reported low levels of distress and moderate to high levels of resilience on average. Three themes were generated from analysis of the first phase of cross-sectional interviews. Participants described a counterbalance of being cautious of infection and keeping safe through prevention and shielding strategies. Although hospitals felt safe and were working efficiently, some participants felt COVID-19 had compromised person-centredness and empathy in care. While participants valued the restrictions being taken to minimize infection risk, substitution of face-to-face appointments with telehealth services and attending essential face-to-face appointments alone restricted participants' access to professional and social support. Despite this, many participants felt public health measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 had created a sense of not missing out, feeling safe and reduced difficult social interactions requiring explanation of their diagnosis. Conclusions: There is an opportunity to learn from the experiences of healthcare delivery from the perspectives of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the complexities and dualities of living with, after or caring for someone with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities for longitudinal qualitative research to explore the evolving experiences, concerns and persistent and emerging unmet information and clinical needs within the rapidly changing socio-political, socio-cultural and healthcare contexts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highlighted.","Drury, Dr Amanda; Eicher, Professor Manuela; Dowling, Dr Maura",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,,272

500516,Thoughts on home exercise during COVID-19,2020,"Coronaviruses first garnered widespread attention in 2002 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from bats in China and rapidly spread in human populations. Since then, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged and still actively infects humans. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the resulting disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID19) have rapidly and catastrophically spread and highlighted significant limitations to our ability to control and treat infection. Thus, a basic understanding of entry and replication mechanisms of coronaviruses is necessary to rationally evaluate potential antivirals. Here, we show that polyamines, small metabolites synthesized in human cells, facilitate coronavirus replication and the depletion of polyamines with FDA-approved molecules significantly reduces coronavirus replication. We find that diverse coronaviruses, including endemic and epidemic coronaviruses, exhibit reduced attachment and entry into polyamine-depleted cells. We further demonstrate that several molecules targeting the polyamine biosynthetic pathway are antiviral in vitro. In sum, our data suggest that polyamines are critical to coronavirus replication and represent a highly promising drug target in the current and any future coronavirus outbreaks.","Firpo, Mason R; Mastrodomenico, Vincent; Hawkins, Grant M; Prot, Matthieu; Levillayer, Laura; Gallagher, Tom; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Mounce, Bryan C",ACS infect. dis,,272

Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the degree of severity of six emotional and mood states (sadness, boredom, little enjoyment/interest, irritability, temper tantrums, anxiety) and five disrupted behaviours (verbal and physical aggression, argument, opposition, restlessness) based on their frequency/week (absent; low: 1-2 days/week; moderate: 3-4 days/week; severe: 5-7 days/week) before and during the lockdown. Important fluctuations were found in all dimensions during the lockdown independently by the severity degree. Subjects with previous low severity degree of these behaviors significantly worsened in almost all dimensions during the lockdown. On the contrary, ADHD patients with moderate and severe degree showed important improvement during the lockdown. Little enjoyment/interests and boredom resulted the dimensions more strongly affected by the condition of restriction, overall in children. Children vs. adolescents showed substantially similar trend but the former resulted significantly more vulnerable to emotive changes. The results provided both the individuation of domains affected, and the indirect benefits produced by restriction condition.","Melegari, M G; Giallonardo, M; Sacco, R; Marcucci, L; Orecchio, S; Bruni, O",Psychiatry Res,,272

Indeed, new case definitions of vulnerability that emerge in a crisis may push previously unrecognized groups (e.g. service employees, ‘care’ facility residents) into extreme vulnerability, as borderline coping quickly becomes calamity coping. To understand emerging vulnerability, it is therefore critical for social scientists to have a seat at the table where scarce resources are being allocated – before, during and after a crisis.","Napier, A.

We investigated the results of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs tested from December 2020 to February 2021 to verify any difference on the viral load and persistence between people infected by lineage B.1.1.7 and others. Statistically significant lower values of CT associated with the detection of the N protein encoding gene (CT N) were observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (median CT N = 15.8)in comparison to those infected by other lineages (median CT N = 16.9). A significantly longer duration of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs was observed in persons with lineage B.1.1.7 infection (16 days) in comparison to those infected by other lineages (14 days).","Calistri, Paolo; Amato, Laura; Puglia, Ilaria; Cito, Francesca; Di Giuseppe, Alessandra; Danzetta, Maria Luisa; Morelli, Daniela; Di Domenico, Marco; Caporale, Marialuigia; Scialabba, Silvia; Portanti, Ottavio; Curini, Valentina; Perletta, Fabrizia; Cammà, Cesare; Ancora, Massimo; Savini, Giovanni; Migliorati, Giacomo; D039,; Alterio, Nicola; Lorusso, Alessio",Int J Infect Dis,,272

This risk can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, shortage of PPE has emerged as an important issue in managing the pandemic in both traditionally high and low-resource areas. A group of clinicians and researchers from thirteen countries representing low, middle, and high-income areas has developed recommendations for optimal utilization of PPE before, during, and after gastrointestinal endoscopy with particular reference to low-resource situations. We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures. This guidance aims to optimize utilization of PPE and protection of health care providers.","Leddin, Desmond; Armstrong, David; Raja Ali, Raja A; Barkun, Alan; Butt, Amna S; Chen, Ye; Khara, Harshit S; Lee, Yeong Yeh; Leung, Wai Keung; Macrae, Finlay; Makharia, Govind; Malekzadeh, Reza; Makhoul, Elias; Sadeghi, Anahita; Saurin, Jean-Christophe; Topazian, Mark; Thomson, Sandie R; Veitch, Andrew; Wu, Kaichun",J Clin Gastroenterol,,272

Based on the urgent need for therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, the identification and characterization of antibodies has been accelerated, since they have been fundamental in treating other viral diseases. Here, we summarized in an integrative manner the present understanding of the immune response and physiopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, including the activation of the humoral immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore, the synthesis of antibodies. Furthermore, we also discussed about the antibodies that can be generated in COVID-19 convalescent sera and their associated clinical studies, including a detailed characterization of a variety of human antibodies and identification of antibodies from other sources, which have powerful neutralizing capacities. Accordingly, the development of effective treatments to mitigate COVID-19 is expected.

503708,Preferred practice guidelines for glaucoma management during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic many schools were forced to interrupt in-person delivery of educational services and switched to delivery of instruction in a remote setting. The educational impacts of school closures and remote instructional delivery have become a concern for the impact on an entire generation of students. Although delivery of behavioral interventions remotely is a topic that has been reported on in behavior analytic literature for over 15 years before this pandemic, few studies directly compared delivery of equivalent services across in-person and remote settings. Further, no studies included in recent literature reviews included comparative analyses between acquisition of novel instructional objectives across in-person and remote settings. Additionally, no studies are reported using verbal behavior developmental measures to identify potential prerequisites for benefitting from remote instruction. I therefore present a series of experiments to investigate the relative effectiveness of in-person and remote instruction as well as comparing outcomes for students grouped by level of verbal behavior development. In Experiment I, I conducted a carefully controlled experiment to compare rate of learning, rate of instructional presentation, and maintenance of objectives mastered across in-person and remote settings. I used a reversal design across 6 preschool aged participants with disabilities. The results indicate that some participants reliably mastered objectives and completed instruction faster in-person for 3 of 6 participants while the results for the other 3 participants were mixed. Overall, participants mastered objectives and completed instruction faster in-person in approximately half of the comparisons while showing no difference or learning faster remotely in the remaining comparisons. No consistent difference was shown in 14 and 21-day follow up maintenance measures. No consistent difference in the outcomes of students who demonstrated Naming compared to those who did not demonstrate any Naming. In Experiment II, I extend the findings of the previous experiments by comparing system wide educational outcomes of a hybrid in-person and remote educational model to the outcomes of the same model in a pure in-person setting in terms of fidelity of instruction, educational outcomes, and a cost analysis to determine how much the transition to remote provision of instruction costs stakeholders. Further, I compared educational outcomes across students categorized by level of verbal behavior development. The results indicate that the total number of learning opportunities and objectives mastered are significantly higher during a fully in-person model when compared to a hybrid educational model containing a remote instructional component. Further, when comparing educational outcomes across groups of students categorized by level of verbal behavior development, the results indicate that the rate of learning and objectives masted are significantly increased once students demonstrate joining of the listener and speaker repertoires as indicated by the presence of the Naming capability. The implication of the results are discussed in terms of feasibility of remote instruction as an alternative to in-person instruction as well as the importance of identifying and establishing the Naming capability for students to best benefit from remote instruction.Keywords: Telehealth, COVID-19, remote instruction, virtual instruction, verbal behavior development.

503896,Outpatient Telehealth Implementation in the United States during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic: A Systematic Review,2021,"Personal protective equipment has become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately 1 metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol generating procedures. Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.","Cook, T M",Anaesthesia,,272

This study examined the contributions of the peer-to-peer learning interactions within integrated peer-assisted learning clusters to learning among students in universities in Harbin, China, and Akure, Nigeria respectively. The frequency of peer-to-peer interactions in peer-assisted learning clusters in both locations were studied in 2019, and followed by a study to assess the changing characteristics and nature of the learning interactions during the transition to online learning in 2020. Data was curated using Excel, Origin-Pro, and Wordcloud generator. Approximately 60 % of the participants used social media for peer-to-peer learning interactions daily within their peer-assisted learning cluster before the transition. The frequency of usage of all the communication technology-mediated means of peer-assisted learning interactions considered during online learning except emails. The increase in the frequency of learning interaction among students in universities in Harbin ranges from 32.1 % to 94.4 %. Students in Nigeria could not make this quick transition because of other factors highlighted. The learning interactions within their online cluster contribute positively to the online learning of 83.6% of the participants. Peer-to-peer learning interactions was successfully leveraged in the transition to the online learning occasioned by the pandemic.

This perspective article reflects on some emerging concerns on the socio-economic effects of a pandemic on the environment from a rebound effect perspective. Although the pandemic offers potential to improve the environmental conditions, it brings also a high risk to produce Jevons' Paradox, i.e., increase environmental burdens rather than decrease them, as initially expected. Governments should be aware of these risks and assess the possibility to implement additional measures, like environmental taxation or limiting the use of resources, to help achieving sustainability targets.","Freire-González, Jaume; Font Vivanco, David",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,272

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the association between CRD (including disease overlap) and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Data of diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were extracted from the national COVID-19 reporting system. CRD was diagnosed based on International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. The primary endpoint was the composite outcome of needing invasive ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death within 30 days after hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was death within 30 days after hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 39,420 laboratory-confirmed patients from the electronic medical records as of May 6, 2020. Any CRD and CRD overlap was present in 2.8% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most common (56.6%), followed by bronchiectasis (27.9%) and asthma (21.7%). COPD-bronchiectasis overlap was the most common combination (50.7%), followed by COPD-asthma (36.2%) and asthma-bronchiectasis overlap (15.9%). After adjustment for age, sex, and other systemic comorbidities, patients with COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-2.03) and asthma (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05-1.98), but not bronchiectasis, were more likely to reach to the composite endpoint compared with those without at day 30 after hospitalization. Patients with CRD were not associated with a greater likelihood of dying from COVID-19 compared with those without. Patients with CRD overlap did not have a greater risk of reaching the composite endpoint compared with those without. CONCLUSION: CRD was associated with the risk of reaching the composite endpoint, but not death, of COVID-19.","Guan, Wei-Jie; Liang, Wen-Hua; Shi, Ying; Gan, Lan-Xia; Wang, Hai-Bo; He, Jian-Xing; Zhong, Nan-Shan",J.

505850,Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Demographics and Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Medically Necessary Non-Emergent Surgeries During the Pandemic,2021,"In response to light, plants efficiently induce photosynthesis. Light activation of thiol enzymes by the thioredoxin (Trx) systems and cyclic electron transport by the PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5)-dependent pathway contribute substantially to regulation of photosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking f-type Trxs (trx f1f2) show delayed activation of carbon assimilation due to impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes. To further study regulatory mechanisms that contribute to efficiency during the induction of photosynthesis, we analyzed the contributions of PSI donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the trx f1f2 mutant background. The cytochrome b6f complex is involved in PSI donor-side regulation, whereas PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport is required for both donor and acceptor functions. Introduction of the pgr1 mutation, which is conditionally defective in cytochrome b6f complex activity, into the trx f1f2 mutant background did not further affect the induction of photosynthesis, but the combined deficiency of Trx f and PGR5 severely impaired photosynthesis and suppressed plant growth under long-day conditions. In the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant, the acceptor-side of PSI was almost completely reduced, and quantum yields of PSII and PSI hardly increased during the induction of photosynthesis. We also compared the photoreduction of thiol enzymes between the trx f1f2 and pgr5 trxf1f2 mutants. The pgr5 mutation did not result in further impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes or ATP synthase in the trx f1f2 mutant background. These results indicated that acceptor-side limitations in the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant suppress photosynthesis initiation, suggesting that PGR5 is required for efficient photosynthesis induction.","Okegawa, Yuki; Basso, Leonardo; Shikanai, Toshiharu; Motohashi, Ken",Plant physiol,,272

Nevertheless, all efforts should be made in planning judicial and possible methods of delivering health care, particularly to pregnant woman with GDM. GDM may play a crucial role in the increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity and also may be the origin of cardiometabolic diseases. Methods: It is mandatary to diagnose and care pregnant woman with GDM. The test suggested to diagnose GDM has to be evidence based and in this regard ""a single test procedure"" evaluated meets this requirement. This doable test has been accepted by the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) and approved by MHFW-GOI, WHO, International Diabetes Federation, and International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. MHFW-GOI also recommends testing at first antenatal visit and then at 24-28 weeks of gestation. This opportunity can also be utilized for performing ultrasonography for assessing fetal development. Result: The first-line management is MNT and life style modifications. Non-responders may require insulin or OHA. The target glycemic control is FPG ~ 5.0 mmol/dl (90 mg/dl) and 2 h PPPG ~ 6.7 mmol/dl (120 mg/dl).

This typically involves a preoperative symptom screen and nasal swab RT-PCR test for viral RNA. Asymptomatic patients with a negative COVID-19 test are cleared for surgery. However, little is known about the rate of postoperative COVID-19 positivity among elective surgical patients, risk factors for this group and rate of complications. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study included all patients undergoing elective surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. Patients were divided into groups based on first positive COVID-19 test within 30 days after surgery (COVID[-/+]), before surgery (COVID[+/-]) or negative throughout (COVID[-/-]). The cumulative incidence, risk factors for and complications of COVID[-/+], were estimated using univariate analysis, exact matching, and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Between March 1 and December 1, 2020 90,093 patients underwent elective surgery. Of these, 60,853 met inclusion criteria, of which 310 (0.5%) were in the COVID[-/+] group. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression identified female sex, end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cancer, cirrhosis, and undergoing neurosurgical procedures as risk factors for being in the COVID[-/+] group. After matching on current procedural terminology code and month of procedure, multivariable Poisson regression estimated the complication rate ratio for the COVID[-/+] group vs. COVID[-/-] to be 8.4 (C.I. 4.9-14.4) for pulmonary complications, 3.0 (2.2, 4.1) for major complications, and 2.6 (1.9, 3.4) for any complication. DISCUSSION: Despite preoperative COVID-19 screening, there remains a risk of COVID infection within 30 days after elective surgery. This risk is increased for patients with a high comorbidity burden and those undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Higher intensity preoperative screening and closer postoperative monitoring is warranted in such patients because they have a significantly elevated risk of postoperative complications.","Prasad, Nikhil K; Lake, Rachel; Englum, Brian R; Turner, Douglas J; Siddiqui, Tariq; Mayorga-Carlin, Minerva; Sorkin, John D; Lal, Brajesh K",Am. j. surg,,272
506600,Sport stadium as spreading source of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the adoption of protocols to minimize risk of periprocedural complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This typically involves a preoperative symptom screen and nasal swab RT-PCR test for viral RNA. Asymptomatic patients with a negative COVID-19 test are cleared for surgery. However, little is known about the rate of postoperative COVID-19 positivity among elective surgical patients, risk factors for this group and rate of complications. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study included all patients undergoing elective surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. Patients were divided into groups based on first positive COVID-19 test within 30 days after surgery (COVID[-/+]), before surgery (COVID[+/-]) or negative throughout (COVID[-/-]). The cumulative incidence, risk factors for and complications of COVID[-/+], were estimated using univariate analysis, exact matching, and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Between March 1 and December 1, 2020 90,093 patients underwent elective surgery. Of these, 60,853 met inclusion criteria, of which 310 (0.5%) were in the COVID[-/+] group.

507552,"Impact of covid 19 pandemic on presentation,treatment and outcome of paediatric surgical emergencies",2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: COVID-19 is characterized by super spread events occurring in communities, e.g., hospitals. To limit virus diffusion among healthcare workers the use of personal protective equipment and screening tests are highly advised; also, isolation of virus positive professionals while monitoring their health condition is recommended. This study aims to assess, in a cohort of COVID-19 positive quarantined healthcare workers, the perceived source of infection and exposure risk as well as the clinical evolution of the disease through a surveillance interview. METHODS: A retrospective observational study accounting 896 observations on 93 healthcare professionals tested positive for COVID-19. Data were collected from the Nursing and Technical Directorate of Romagna, Ravenna, Local Health Company, Italy. RESULTS: 99.5% of the positive workers accepted phone interviews with management staff. 2.6% of workers were positive with increasing records in the specialist medical area. Nurses and social health professionals were mostly affected. Patient exposure at a distance <1 m and a contact time > 2 hours was the first cause of positivity. In COVID-19 and territorial emergency departments, the first cause was the contact with colleagues. At the time of the infection, most of the staff wore a surgical mask. Cough, asthenia, fever, anosmia, dysgeusia, and rhinitis were common symptoms. Asymptomatic percentage was about 10%. The self-perceived physical condition was high (>7) and improved during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion rate of COVID-19 among healthcare workers is relatively low, probably due to the use of personal protective equipment. The distancing, also among colleagues, is a fundamental measure to reduce the possibility of infection. Symptoms are mild and can be controlled by surveillance measures. Constant contact with the organization is an essential strategy for promoting recovering of workers and reducing the spread of the virus within the healthcare organization.","Rubbi, Ivan; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea; Brighenti, Aura; Fanelli, Marcella; Gualandi, Patrizia; Nanni, Eleonora; D039,; Antoni, Viviana; Fabbri, Cristina",Acta Biomed,,272

Because the severity of the disease is highly variable, predictive models to stratify patients according to their mortality risk are needed. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a model able to predict the risk of fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 that could be used easily at the time of patients' arrival at the hospital. METHODS: We constructed a prospective cohort with 611 adult patients in whom COVID-19 was diagnosed between March 10 and April 12, 2020, in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. The analysis included 501 patients who had been discharged or had died by April 20, 2020. The capacity of several biomarkers, measured at the beginning of hospitalization, to predict mortality was assessed individually. Those biomarkers that independently contributed to improve mortality prediction were included in a multivariable risk model. RESULTS: High IL-6 level, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, ferritin level, d-dimer level, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were all predictive of mortality (area under the curve >0.70), as were low albumin level, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2). A multivariable mortality risk model including the SpO2/FiO2 ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH level, IL-6 level, and age was developed and showed high accuracy for the prediction of fatal outcome (area under the curve 0.94). The optimal cutoff reliably classified patients (including patients with no initial respiratory distress) as survivors and nonsurvivors with 0.88 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity. CONCLUSION: This mortality risk model allows early risk stratification of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 before the appearance of obvious signs of clinical deterioration, and it can be used as a tool to guide clinical decision making.","Laguna-Goya, Rocio; Utrero-Rico, Alberto; Talayero, Paloma; Lasa-Lazaro, Maria; Ramirez-Fernandez, Angel; Naranjo, Laura; Segura-Tudela, Alejandro; Cabrera-Marante, Oscar; Rodriguez de Frias, Edgar; Garcia-Garcia, Rocio; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Aguado, Jose Maria; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin; Lopez, Elena Ana; Catalan, Mercedes; Serrano, Antonio; Paz-Artal, Estela",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,272

The present study aimed at examining the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health of HPs in Italy, investigating the role of attachment style, personality traits, and sociodemographic variables. An online survey was administered from 18 to 22 March 2020. Respondents were 296 HPs (77% female, 23% male;aged 21–77 years). The measures employed were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5-BF (PID-5-BF), the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale–21 (DASS-21). The findings showed that PID-5-BF Negative Affect, female gender, and ASQ Preoccupation with Relationships predicted high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Furthermore, PID-5-BF Detachment predicted higher psychological distress, as captured in the DASS-21 total score and DASS-21 Depression score, and having an infected loved one was associated with high psychological distress. Overall, the results suggest that HPs are experiencing high rates of psychological distress during the pandemic, and that specific attachment styles and personality traits might be useful in identifying those at greatest risk for developing mental health symptoms.","Mazza, Cristina Colasanti Marco Ricci Eleonora Di Giandomenico Serena Marchetti Daniela Fontanesi Lilybeth Verrocchio Maria Cristina Ferracuti Stefano Roma Paolo",Sustainability,,272

METHODS: This study used data from the 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 1,089 patients with diabetes aged >40 years were included. The duration of daily sunlight exposure was assessed via health interviews. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including standard retinal fundus photography after pupil dilation, were conducted. Diabetic retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House Classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS: The risk of diabetic retinopathy was 2.66 times higher in the group with &#8805;5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure after adjusting for risk factors such as duration of diabetes, serum hemoglobin A1c level, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (P = 0.023). Furthermore, the risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.13 times higher in the group with &#8805;5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure (P = 0.009). In patients with diabetes for <10 years, the risks of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 4.26 and 4.82 times higher in the group with &#8805;5 h of daily sunlight exposure than the group with less exposure, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that sunlight exposure for &#8805;5 h a day was significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with diabetes. The risks were significantly higher in patients with diabetes for <10 years. Therefore, reducing daily sunlight exposure could be an early preventive strategy against diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes.","Lee, Hye Jun; Kim, Choon Ok; Lee, Duk Chul",PLoS One,,272

Here, we present a simulation study of the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a cysteine hydrolase essential for the life cycle of the virus. The free energy landscape for the mechanism of the inhibition process is explored by QM/MM umbrella sampling and free energy perturbation simulations at the M06-2X/MM level of theory for two proposed peptidyl covalent inhibitors sharing the same recognition motif while featuring distinct cysteine-targeting warheads. Regardless of intrinsic reactivity of the modelled inhibitors, namely a Michael acceptor and a hydroxymethylketone activated carbonyl, our results confirm that the inhibitory process takes place by means of a two-step mechanism, in which the formation of an ion pair C145/H41 dyad precedes the protein-inhibitor covalent bond formation, in both cases. The nature of this second step appears to be strongly dependent on the functional groups introduced in the warhead: in the present study, while the nucleophilic attack of the C145 sulfur atom on the C of the double bond of the Michael acceptor takes place concertedly to the proton transfer from H41 to C, in the compound with an activated carbonyl the sulfur attacks the carbonyl carbon concomitant to the proton transfer from H41 to the carbonyl oxygen through the hydroxyl group. Analysis of the free energy profiles, structures along the reaction path, and interactions between the inhibitors and the different pockets of the active site on the protein shows a measurable impact of the warhead on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process. The present results can be used as a guide to select warheads to design efficient irreversible and reversible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Sergio, Marti Kemel Arafet Alessio Lodola Adrian Mulholland Katarzyna Swiderek Vicent Moliner",,,272
509542,Temporal estimates of case-fatality rate for COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada and the United States,2020,"Purpose: The rapid growth of tourism prior to the COVID-19 pandemic prompts the need for critical reflection of tourism’s “local-global” responsibility in the wake of that pandemic. Conceptually driven by the ancient Greek notion of hubris, this study reflects on the perception of tourists as actors disconnected from citizens’ necessities, safety and well-being. In so doing we develop further knowledge on the relationship between the spaces of tourism and citizenship and how this might build a sustainable future-proof tourism. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected daily for two weeks via three Google Alert queries set to mine Italian online news media contents immediately after the Italian Government’s adoption of mobility restrictions due to COVID-19. This study uses a thematic narrative analysis to examine the contents related to tourists during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings: The exploratory findings reveal how tourists are largely presented as taking over the space of local residents and, by breaking the rules set by national and local authorities, as disregarding those residents’ safety and well-being. Hence, they appear disconnected from any sense of belonging to a local or global community, and from a space to which they owe a duty of care. Originality/value: By framing tourists as hubristic subjects ontologically belonging to a neoliberal leisure space disentangled from the citizenship space, this study establishes a novel theoretical grounding from which a sustainable future-proof tourism that is rooted in citizenship space can be rethought. © 2021, Lucia Tomassini, Leanne Schreursa and Elena Cavagnaroa.","Tomassini, L.; Schreurs, L.; Cavagnaro, E.",Journal of Tourism Futures,,272

The mortality rate and follow-up periods in patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged widely. Antivirals, including remdesivir and convalescent plasma, have shown no definitive mortality benefit in this population despite positive results in other COVID-19 patients. Dexamethasone was associated with an absolute reduction in 28-day mortality by 12.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 17.6), after adjusting for age. Reduced mortality has been demonstrated with tocilizumab use alongside corticosteroids. Evidence is inconclusive for therapeutic anticoagulation, and further studies are needed to determine the comparative benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation.Expert opinion: Significant variation and high mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients necessitate more standardized outcome measurements, increased consideration of risk factors to reduce intubation, and improved treatment practices. Anticoagulation and dexamethasone should be incorporated in the treatment of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, while more rigorous studies are required for other potential treatments.","Tsikala Vafea, Maria; Zhang, Raina; Kalligeros, Markos; Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Expert Rev Med Devices,,272

512494,Preparing for COVID-19 in Nursing Homes,2020,"PURPOSE: Since the outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. We analyzed and compared the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics between survivors and non-survivors and identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory variables, radiological features, treatment approach, and complications were retrospectively collected in two centers of Hubei province, China. Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify the risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were enrolled, and the median patient age was 54 years. The overall mortality rate was 5.09% (22/432). As compared with the survivor group (n = 410), those in the non-survivor group (n = 22) were older, and they had a higher frequency of comorbidities and were more prone to suffer from dyspnea. Several abnormal laboratory variables indicated that acute cardiac injury, hepatic damage, and acute renal insufficiency were detected in the non-survivor group. Non-surviving patients also had a high computed tomography (CT) score and higher rate of consolidation. The most common complication causing death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (18/22, 81.8%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin (Hb) <90 g/L (hazard ratio, 10.776; 95% confidence interval, 3.075-37.766; p<0.0001), creatine kinase (CK-MB) >8 U/L (9.155; 2.424-34.584; p = 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >245 U/L (5.963; 2.029-17.529; p = 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT) >0.5 ng/ml (7.080; 1.671-29.992; p = 0.008), and CT score >10 (39.503; 12.430-125.539; p<0.0001) were independent risk factors for the mortality of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Low Hb, high LDH, PCT, and CT score on admission were the predictors for mortality and could assist clinicians in early identification of poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Xiao-Bin; Hu, Lan; Ming, Quan; Wei, Xiao-Jie; Zhang, Zhen-Yu; Chen, Li-Da; Wang, Ming-Hui; Yao, Weng-Zhen; Huang, Qiu-Fen; Ye, Zhang-Qiang; Cai, Yu-Qing; Zeng, Hui-Qing",PLoS One,,272
512715,When COVID-19 affects muscle: effects of quarantine in older adults,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Air-dried slide preparation for fine needle aspiration cytology procedures is currently considered unsafe because of the risk of infectious aerosols of coronavirus 19. This study compares the safety and accuracy of two different protocols, one with and one without air-dried slides. METHODS: Starting from 3 March 2020, we discontinued the use of air-dried slides during breast fine needle aspiration procedures. We selected cases collected during two periods: 2 months before and 2 months after 3 March. In both groups, the number of procedures was recorded together with the distribution of the diagnostic categories and the concordance between cytological and histological results on surgical specimens for lesions suggestive of malignancy, using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: Of the 100 procedures performed during the pre-COVID-19 period, 55% were negative (C2), 3% were non-diagnostic (C1) and 40% were positive (C4 or C5). Of the 75 procedures obtained during the COVID-19 period, 44% were negative (C2), 2.7% were non-diagnostic (C1) and 52% were positive (C4 or C5). Despite the use of a new protocol during the COVID-19 period, we observed concordance between cytological and histological results for lesions suggestive of malignancy. There was no statistically significant difference concerning the distribution of the diagnostic categories in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the slightly lower number of procedures being analysed during the COVID-19 period, the introduction of a new protocol that does not include air-dried slides is safe and reliable.","Nicosia, Luca; Bozzini, Anna Carla; Latronico, Antuono; Addante, Francesca; Mastropasqua, Mauro Giuseppe; Meneghetti, Lorenza; Mauri, Giovanni; De Fiori, Elvio; Montesano, Marta; Di Tonno, Clementina; Midolo De Luca, Valeria; Casadio, Chiara; Cassano, Enrico",Cytopathology,,272
513415,Turning a surgical unit into a COVID-19 facility: Governance counts,2020,"Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.","Ye, Jiachen; Hu, Qitong; Ji, Peng; Barthelemy, Marc",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07276v1.pdf,272
513416,Turning a surgical unit into a COVID-19 facility: Governance counts,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to guideline-directed oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) improves outcomes, but limited data are available from China. AIM: To evaluate the adherence to guideline-directed anticoagulation and its impact on clinical outcomes in a high-risk cohort of elderly Chinese patients. METHODS: The Optimal Thromboprophylaxis in Elderly Chinese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ChiOTEAF) registry is a prospective, multicenter study conducted from October 2014 to December 2018. Endpoints of interest were all-cause death, thromboembolic (TE) events and major bleedings in patients with a guideline-directed indication for OACs (CHA2DS2VASc &#8805;1 if male or &#8805;2 if female). RESULTS: The eligible cohort consisted of 5742 patients, of whom 2567 (44.7%) patients were treated with an OAC. Seven independent predictors of OAC undertreatment were identified: age (OR: 1.04; 95%CI 1.03-1.05, P < 0.001), first diagnosed AF (OR: 1.71; 95%CI 1.44-2.03, P < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.36-2.06, P < 0.001), liver disease (OR: 1.69; 95%CI 1.19-2.41, P = 0.003), dementia (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.06-2.64, P = 0.026), prior extracranial bleeding (OR: 1.89; 95%CI 1.35-2.64, P < 0.001), and the use of antiplatelet drug (OR: 6.97; 95%CI 5.89-8.23, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, OAC undertreatment was significantly associated with a higher risk all-cause death (OR: 3.79; 95%CI: 2.61-5.53; P < 0.001) and TE events (OR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.39-3.72; P = 0.001), and a similar risk of major bleeding as compared to guideline-directed OAC therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Only 44.7% of all eligible patients were prescribed OAC in accordance with guideline recommendations. The independent predictors for OAC undertreatment were age, first diagnosed AF, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior extracranial bleeding, and the use of the antiplatelet drugs. Guideline-adherent thromboprophylaxis was safe and may be associated with improved survival and less TE among elderly Chinese patients with AF.","Guo, Yutao; Kotalczyk, Agnieszka; Imberti, Jacopo F; Wang, Yutang; Lip, Gregory Y H",Eur.

People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-Î³ (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.","Sun, Dan; Li, Hui; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Xiao, Han; Ren, Jie; Zhang, Fu-Rong; Liu, Zhi-Sheng",World J Pediatr,,272
515148,Acral edema during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: This descriptive, unplanned investigation has been undertaken to report reactions, attitudes and countermeasures which have been put in place and implemented by medical oncology units facing the COVID-19 outbreak in Southern Italy. Materials and methods: Data have been retrospectively obtained from the time-related analysis of conversations via a WhatsApp messenger-based group chat between the medical directors belonging to the Italian College of Medical Oncology Directors. Overall number, intensity and time trend of conversations related to reactions during the 4 weeks of observation related to the crucial events which occurred between 24 February and 28 March, 2020 are included. A sentiment analysis of conversations was also carried out. Results: We report 956 conversations among 19 medical oncology units related to reactions to the crucial events, such as epidemic spread, Government ordinances and guidelines during the 4 weeks of observation. Data show significant awareness of problems linked to the COVID-19 spread among oncologists and rapid diffusion of countermeasures. Actions taken were correlated time wise to crucial events. A correlation between conversations and the volume of activity of oncology units was found. By analysing the sentiment analysis of raw data, positive emotions were reduced in percentage over the weeks. A significant increase in negative emotions was observed as the outbreak impacted on the healthcare system. Conclusion: In our experience, the WhatsApp instant-messaging system seems to be a useful tool to share news and reactions between medical oncologists to rapidly implement necessary health measures and answers to most cancer patients' needs and queries in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.","Blasi, Livio; Bordonaro, Roberto; Borsellino, Nicolò; Butera, Alfredo; Caruso, Michele; Cordio, Stefano; Liborio, Di Cristina; Ferraù, Francesco; Giuffrida, Dario; Parra, Hector Soto; Spada, Massimiliano; Tralongo, Paolo; Valenza, Roberto; Verderame, Francesco; Vitello, Stefano; Zerilli, Filippo; Piazza, Dario; Firenze, Alberto; Gebbia, Vittorio",ecancermedicalscience,,272

BACKGROUND: Modern situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are rapidly accelerating the need for organizations to move employee teams to virtual environments, sometimes with little to no opportunities to prepare for the transition. It is likely that organizations will continually have to adapt to evolving conditions in the future. METHOD: This review synthesizes the literature from several sources on best practices, lessons learned, and strategies for virtual teams. Information from each article deemed relevant was then extracted and de-identified. Over 64 best practices were independently and blindly coded for relevancy for the swift deployment of virtual teams. RESULTS: As a result of this review, tips for virtual teams undergoing rapid transition to remote work were developed. These tips are organized at the organization, team, and individual levels. They are further categorized under six overarching themes: norm setting, performance monitoring, leadership, supportive mechanisms, communication, and flexibility. CONCLUSION: There is a significant deficit in the literature for best practices for virtual teams for the purposes of rapid deployment, leaving it to organizations to subjectively determine what advice to adhere to. This manuscript synthesizes relevant practices and provides insights into effective virtual team rapid deployment.","Kilcullen, Molly; Feitosa, Jennifer; Salas, Eduardo",Hum Factors,,272

The pandemic has already infected more than one hundred and three million people, killing about two and a quarter million of them. Recently, several vaccines to inoculate people against the ongoing pandemic have been approved. People in most of the countries are being injected with these vaccines. While the world awaits for the outcome of the ongoing vaccinations, a more aggressive strain of coronavirus is killing many people in several countries, including the UK, the USA, Netherland, South Africa, and Australia. The ongoing pandemic has severely affected almost all aspects of our lives; education being one of them. As a result, majority of students in the world have completely lost access to the traditional way of institutional learning, while others have suffered in different ways and to a lesser degree. Many universities, colleges, and schools were closed during the initial pandemic lockdown during March-May, 2020. Luckily, some higher education institutions were better equipped to switch over to online teaching, either using a Learning Management System (LMS) or use some other online tools to connect with their students. With the help of surveys of students and teachers from several countries, this article aims to analyze the damage caused to the education sector by the pandemic at the global level. Guided by our literature review, and analysis of responses to our two surveys, we also provide a framework for a national education system, which could withstand future global crises like the one created by the COVID-19, and ensure continuity of education to all, especially the poor sections of the society.","Bajaba, Saleh; Mandurah, Khider; Yamin, Mohammad",Int J Inf Technol,,272

An effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution. This study aims to evaluate Jordanian intent to be vaccinated. Methods: This is a cross-sectional web-based study. Sample characteristics were gathered, and the participants were classified according to the degree of COVID-19 risk based on the categories of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Participants' KAP toward COVID-19 were assessed, and two scores were calculated: knowledge score and practice score. The association between different sample characteristics and these scores was identified using binary logistical regressions. The participants' vaccination intention was evaluated and multinomial logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of vaccination intention. Finally, the reasons behind the participants' vaccination refusal/hesitation were determined and categorized into different groups. Results: 1,144 participants were enrolled in the study (females = 66.5%). 30.4% of the participants were at high risk of COVID-19 complications, and 27.5% were at medium risk. Overall, participants' knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, protective measures, and availability of cure were high (median of knowledge score = 17 out of 21). High protective practices were followed by many participants (median of practice score = 7 out of 10). 3.7% of participants were infected, and 6.4% suspected they were infected with the COVID-19 virus. 36.8% of the participants answered ""No"" when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, and 26.4% answered, ""Not sure."" The main reasons for the participants' vaccination refusal or hesitancy were concerns regarding the use of vaccines and a lack of trust in them. Conclusion: Participants reported high refusal/hesitancy. Several barriers were identified, and efforts should be intensified to overcome these barriers.","Al-Qerem, Walid A; Jarab, Anan S",Front Public Health,,272

519539,Emergency Colorectal Surgery in a COVID-19 Pandemic Epicenter,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed enormous strain on intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe. Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns.

Global research targeting COVID-19 treatments has produced numerous therapy-related data and established data repositories. However, these data are disseminated throughout the literature and web resources, which could lead to a reduction in the levels of their use. In this review, we introduce resource repositories for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics, from the genome and proteome to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. We briefly describe the data and usage, and how they advance research for therapies.

A challenge for the future,2020,"Amphipathic peptides with amino acids arranged in alternating patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues efficiently self-assemble into ß-sheet bilayer nanoribbons. Hydrophobic side chain functionality is effectively buried in the interior of the putative bilayer of these nanoribbons. This study investigates consequences on self-assembly of increasing the surface area of aromatic side chain groups that reside in the hydrophobic core of nanoribbons derived from Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides (X = hydrophobic residue). A series of Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides incorporating aromatic amino acids of increasing molecular volume and steric profile (X = phenylalanine [Phe], homophenylalanine [Hph], tryptophan [Trp], 1-naphthylalanine [1-Nal], 2-naphthylalanine [2-Nal], or biphenylalanine [Bip]) were assessed to determine substitution effects on self-assembly propensity and on morphology of the resulting nanoribbon structures. Additional studies were conducted to determine the effects of incorporating amino acids of differing steric profile in the hydrophobic core (Ac-X1 KFEFKFE-NH2 and Ac-(X1,5 KFE)-NH2 peptides, X = Trp or Bip). Spectroscopic analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated ß-sheet formation for all variants. Self-assembly rate increased with peptide hydrophobicity; increased molecular volume of the hydrophobic side chain groups did not appear to induce kinetic penalties on self-assembly rates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging indicated variation in fibril morphology as a function of amino acid in the X positions. This study confirms that hydrophobicity of amphipathic Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides correlates to self-assembly propensity and that the hydrophobic core of the resulting nanoribbon bilayers has a significant capacity to accommodate sterically demanding functional groups. These findings provide insight that may be used to guide the exploitation of self-assembled amphipathic peptides as functional biomaterials.","Jones, Christopher W; Morales, Crystal G; Eltiste, Sharon L; Yanchik-Slade, Francine E; Lee, Naomi R; Nilsson, Bradley L",J Pept Sci,,272

521645,COVID-19 pandemic in India,2020,"The vaginal microbiota influences sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Colonization of the vaginal tract is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species. Both Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis may secrete reutericyclin, which inhibits the growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing evidence suggests a potential therapeutic role for an analogue of reutericyclin, glycerol monolaurate (GML), against microbial pathogens. Previous studies using a macaque vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission model demonstrated that GML reduces transmission and alters immune responses to infection in vitro Previous studies showed that structural analogues of GML negatively impact other enveloped viruses. We sought to expand understanding of how GML inhibits HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses and show that GML restricts HIV-1 entry post-CD4 engagement at the step of coreceptor binding. Further, HIV-1 and yellow fever virus (YFV) particles were more sensitive to GML interference than particles ""matured"" by proteolytic processing. We show that high-pressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)-purified reutericyclin and reutericyclin secreted by Lactobacillus inhibit HIV-1. These data emphasize the importance and protective nature of the normal vaginal flora during viral infections and provide insights into the antiviral mechanism of GML during HIV-1 infection and, more broadly, to other enveloped viruses.IMPORTANCE A total of 340 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired each year. Antimicrobial agents that target multiple infectious pathogens are ideal candidates to reduce the number of newly acquired STIs. The antimicrobial and immunoregulatory properties of GML make it an excellent candidate to fit this critical need. Previous studies established the safety profile and antibacterial activity of GML against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. GML protected against high-dose SIV infection and reduced inflammation, which can exacerbate disease, during infection. We found that GML inhibits HIV-1 and other human-pathogenic viruses (yellow fever virus, mumps virus, and Zika virus), broadening its antimicrobial range. Because GML targets diverse infectious pathogens, GML may be an effective agent against the broad range of sexually transmitted pathogens. Further, our data show that reutericyclin, a GML analog expressed by some lactobacillus species, also inhibits HIV-1 replication and thus may contribute to the protective effect of Lactobacillus in HIV-1 transmission.","Welch, Jennifer L; Xiang, Jinhua; Okeoma, Chioma M; Schlievert, Patrick M; Stapleton, Jack T",mBio (Online),,272

Scientific research in medicine is the only means to overcome novel and complex diseases like COVID-19. To sum up the therapeutic wild-goose chase, many available antivirals and repurposed drugs have failed to show successful clinical evidence in patient recovery, several vaccine candidates are still waiting in the trial pipelines and a few have become available to the common public for administration in record time. Objective and Method: However, with upcoming evidence of coronavirus mutations, available vaccines may thrive on the spirit of doubt about efficacy and effectiveness towards these new strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). In all these collective uncertainties, plasma therapy has shown a ray of hope for critically ill patients. Results: To date, with very few published case studies of convalescent plasma in COVID-19, there are two school of thought process in the scientific community regarding plasma therapy efficiency and this leads to confusion due to the lack of optimal randomized and controlled studies. Conclusion: Without undertaking any robust scientific studies, evidence or caution, accepting any therapy unanimously may cause more harm than good, but with a clearer understanding of SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and drug response, plasma therapy might be the silver lining against COVID-19 for the global community.","Saha, Sumit; Kadam, Sachin","Hematol., Transfus.

We examined moderation by parent gender, education, family income, and coparenting conflict. We found large deteriorations from before the pandemic to the first months of the pandemic in child internalizing and externalizing problems and parent depression, and a moderate decline in coparenting quality. Smaller changes were found for parent anxiety and parenting quality. Mothers and families with lower levels of income were at particular risk for deterioration in well-being.

Recurrent asthma exacerbations cause a decline in lung function and, in childhood, are linked to development of persistent asthma. This position paper, from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, highlights the shortcomings of current treatment guidelines for patients suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations and those with difficult‐to‐treat asthma and severe treatment‐resistant asthma. It reviews current evidence that supports a call for increased awareness of (i) the seriousness of asthma exacerbations and (ii) the need for novel treatment strategies in specific forms of severe treatment‐resistant asthma. There is strong evidence linking asthma exacerbations with viral airway infection and underlying deficiencies in innate immunity and evidence of a synergism between viral infection and allergic mechanisms in increasing risk of exacerbations. Nonadherence to prescribed medication has been identified as a common clinical problem amongst adults and children with difficult‐to‐control asthma. Appropriate diagnosis, assessment of adherence and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors) have to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult‐to‐control asthma. Further studies with improved designs and new diagnostic tools are needed to properly characterize (i) the pathophysiology and risk of asthma exacerbations, and (ii) the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity of severe asthma.","Custovic, A.; Johnston, S.

With full emphasis on the pandemic, patients suffering from other diseases and palliative oncology patients requiring essential palliative care services were affected due to the shutting down of regular health-care services. AIM: In this study, we emphasize that in the middle of a pandemic, we need to continue serving the needs of palliative care patients, and simultaneously, necessary steps should be taken for the prevention of the spread of virus by following guidelines, training, support, and monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed electronic medical record of 1161 patients who received palliative care from our institute in the first two lockdown periods, regarding their demographics, extent of travel, type of malignancy, and opioid utilization. RESULTS: Of 1161 patients, male outnumbered female and the patient suffering from head-and-neck malignancy were in the maximum number (48.7%). Our essential opioids utilization rate was 34.2%, and patients who traveled from different states were 21.6%. CONCLUSION: During this pandemic, we cannot overlook the need for essential palliative care services. We can continue regular services with proper precautions as advised and by training the staff.

Social isolation measures were applied. Medical attention was focused on COVID-19. Primary and social care were mainly performed by telephone. This exceptional situation may affect especially vulnerable patients such as people living with dementia. Our aim was to describe the influence of restrictive measures on patients living with mild cognitive decline and dementia evaluating SARS-CoV2 infection, changes in routines, cognitive decline stage, neuropsychiatric symptoms, delirium, falls, caregiver stress, and access to sanitary care. Materials and Methods: We gathered MCI and dementia patients with clinical follow-up before and after confinement from DegMar registry (Hospital del Mar). A telephone ad-hoc questionnaire was administered. Global status was assessed using CDR scale. Changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and retrospective interview for pre-confinement base characteristics. Results: We contacted a total of 60 patients, age 75.4 years ± 5,192. 53.3% were women. Alzheimer's Disease (41.7%) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (25%) were the most prevalent diagnosis. Remaining cases included different dementia disorders. A total of 10% of patients had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. During confinement 70% of patients abandoned previous daily activities, 60% had cognitive worsening reported by relatives/caretakers, 15% presented delirium episodes, and 13% suffered increased incidence of falls. Caregivers reported an increased burden in 41% cases and burnout in 11% cases. 16% reported difficulties accessing medical care, 33% received medical phone assistance, 20% needed emergency care and 21% had changes in psychopharmacological therapies.

This review aims to provide the information available so far on the likely animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible hosts/reservoirs as well as all natural animal infections and experimental evidence using animal models. Horseshoe bats from the species Rhinolophus affinis seem to be a natural reservoir and pangolins (Manis javanica) appear to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. Humans remain the most likely spreading source of SARS-CoV-2 to other humans and also to domestic, zoo and farm animals. Indeed, human-to-animal transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions, a puma and minks. Animal-to-human transmission is not a sustained pathway, although mink-to-human transmission remains to be elucidated. Through experimental infections, other animals seem also to be susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2, namely ferrets, some non-human primate species, hamsters and transgenic mice, while dogs, pigs and poultry are resistant.

Inflammation response, thought to be associated with severe illness and death, is an important research topic in COVID-19. Inflammation is also an essential condition explored in psychiatric illnesses. Our knowledge about the relationship between the inflammation response and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 is very limited. In this study, the relationship between anxiety and depression levels and inflammation response of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the hospital was examined. METHODS: 175 patients were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied to the patients. To evaluate the inflammation responses, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and IL-6 levels were examined. RESULTS: In our study, no relationship was found between anxiety and depression levels and inflammatory responses in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Anxiety and depression levels of women were higher than men, and NLR, ferritin, IL-6 levels were found to be lower than men. Anxiety levels increase with age. There is a positive correlation between NLR and ferritin levels and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our study examining the relationship of psychiatric comorbidities with the inflammation response and our increasing literature knowledge, together with studies evaluating the mental effects of COVID-19, suggest that determining the relationship between inflammation responses and psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19, whose pathophysiology has not been clarified yet, maybe an essential step in interventions on the course of the disease.","Kahve, Aybeniz Civan; Kaya, Hasan; Okuyucu, Merve; Goka, Erol; Barun, Sureyya; Hacimusalar, Yunus",Psychiatry Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130442/; https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0029,272

We employed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 659) specific for the unique and intact thrombin-sensitive site in OPN using an inhibition ELISA. We found significantly higher levels of OPN in 33 cervical cancer patients in both the plasma (mean +/- SD, 612 +/- 106 ng/mL) and serum (424 +/- 121 ng/mL) compared to healthy subjects [409 +/- 56 ng/mL, from 31 plasma samples (P < 0.0001), and 314 +/- 98 ng/mL, from 32 serum samples (P = 0.0002), respectively]. Similar results were obtained when the plasma from a bigger group (147 individuals) of cervical cancer patients (560 +/- 211 ng/mL) were compared with the same plasma samples of the healthy individuals (P = 0.0014). More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 +/- 210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and non-discriminatory in stage I (473 +/- 110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318). No such discrimination was found when a mAb of a different specificity (mAb 446) was used in a similar inhibition ELISA to compare the two groups in the first study; a commercial capture ELISA also failed. The possibility that the target epitope recognized by the antibody probe in these assays was absent from the circulating OPN due to protein truncation was supported by gel fractionation of the OPN found in patients’ plasma: 60–64 kDa fragments were found instead of the presumably full-length OPN (68 kDa) seen in healthy people.

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we use data from the SMART Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the prevalence (i.e., survey-weighted %) of six risk factors for severe COVID-19 (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], asthma, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease) for veterans and nonveterans at the national level, in 155 metropolitan/micropolitan statistical areas, and in Veteran Integrated Service Networks (veterans only). We examine differences in these outcomes among veterans and between geographic areas using chi-square analysis or multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS In the national aggregate, veterans exhibited higher prevalence rates of COPD, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease than nonveterans, but not asthma and obesity. However, we show significant variation in the prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 among veterans by geographic location. DISCUSSION This study provides a dataset that can be used by healthcare providers in order to prioritize prevention programming for veterans who may be at higher risk for COVID-19 due to their increased risk for certain chronic diseases.","McDaniel, Michelle; McDaniel, Justin T",Chronic illness,https://doi.org/10.1177/17423953211028280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34486413/,272
593238,Exploring the Role of Self-Kindness in Making Healthier Eating Choices: A Preliminary Study,2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 has had a dramatic effect on society and healthcare. Preparations were based on predictive models of need, and with uncertainty regarding risk to patients and healthcare workers. Actions taken had both immediate and ongoing ethical impacts. The most obvious of these was the shift in duty of care from individual patients to public health centred ethics and decision making. RELEVANCE: In ENT, many procedures are aerosol-generating and so our capacity to provide care will remain significantly reduced. This reduction in capacity may result in difficult choices for patients when optimal care may be replaced by acceptable care. ENT surgeons may also be faced with unaccustomed paternalism when capacity prevents them from acting within the patients’ wishes. CONCLUSION: Despite these challenges, the novel uses of technology highlight the desire to preserve and enhance the autonomy of our patients.","Leonard, C G",The Journal of laryngology and otology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981538/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s002221512000208x,272
593376,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers: a tertiary center perspective,2021-09-24,"Assessment of airway is recommended by every airway guideline to ensure safe airway management. Numerous unifactorial and multifactorial tests have been used for airway assessment over the years. However, there is none that can identify all the difficult airways. The reasons for the inadequacy of these methods of airway assessment might be their dependence on difficult to remember and apply mnemonics and scores, inability to identify all the variations from the “normal”, and their lack of stress on evaluating the non-patient factors. Airway Management Foundation (AMF) experts and members have been using a different approach, the AMF Approach, to overcome these problems inherent to most available models of airway assessment. This approach suggests a three-step model of airway assessment. The airway manager first makes the assessment of the patient through focused history, focused general examination, and focused airway assessment using the AMF “line of sight” method. The AMF “line of sight” method is a non-mnemonic, non-score-based method of airway assessment wherein the airway manager examines the airway along the line of sight as it moves over the airway and notes down all the variations from the normal. Assessment of non-patient factors follows next and finally there is assimilation of all the information to help identify the available, difficult, and impossible areas of the airway management. The AMF approach is not merely intubation centric but also focuses on all other methods of securing airway and maintaining oxygenation. Airway assessment in the presence of contagion like COVID-19 is also discussed.","Kumar, Rakesh; Kumar, Sunil; Misra, Anil; Kumar, Neera G.; Gupta, Akhilesh; Kumar, Prashant; Jain, Divya",J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.4103/joacp.joacp_236_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33487896/,272

There is a need to design a scale, which can assess empathy among health professionals and is relevant to community and culture. Therefore, this study was undertaken to measure the empathy among Syrian health professionals and students of health professions using a newly designed Syrian Empathy Scale that is relevant to community during Syrian crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was undertaken. A total of 214 participants (118 males and 96 females) responded to the Syrian Empathy Scale SES from Medical (n = 62), Dental (n = 152). They were 59 undergraduates, 116 postgraduates and 39 general practitioners. The SES was designed as a tool that includes 20 items in a 7-point Likert-type scale with overall score ranges from 20 to 140. Group comparisons of the empathy scores were conducted using t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A factor analysis was performed. Bartlett’s test of the sphericity and the KMO measure of sampling adequacy were also determined. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated. RESULTS: A significant difference was found between males and females in the SES mean score. The ANOVA analysis showed that the SES empathy scores of dentists were higher than the SES empathy scores in medical doctors with no significant difference. The SES empathy score of undergraduates was significantly higher than postgraduates and practitioners. Findings of KMO indicated sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.824 > 0.7) and the value of Bartlett’s test of the sphericity (1255.65, df = 190, P-value< 0.001) proved that the factor analysis is meaningful and acceptable. The results of varimax rotation proved that five main factors were retained. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study support the reliability of the newly designed Syrian Empathy Scale for measuring empathy in the field of health care. The SES can be suggested for assessing empathy in different health educational programs. However, future works are still essential to support the validity of the scale as well as to ascertain the role of empathy in improving health care.","Dashash, Mayssoon; Boubou, Mounzer",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02835-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325698/,272
594275,Association of Overlapped and Un-overlapped Comorbidities with COVID-19 Severity and Treatment Outcomes: A Retrospective Cohort Study from Nine Provinces in China,2020-12-31,"In critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is reported. COVID-19 may lead to impairment of the coagulation cascade, with an imbalance in platelet function and the regulatory mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Clinical manifestations vary from a rise in laboratory markers and subclinical microthrombi to thromboembolic events, bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. After an inflammatory trigger, the mechanism for activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID-19 is the tissue factor pathway, which causes endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated production of interleukins and platelet activation. The consequent massive infiltration of activated platelets may be responsible for inflammatory infiltrates in the endothelial space, as well as thrombocytopenia. The variety of clinical presentations of the coagulopathy confronts the clinician with the difficult questions of whether and how to provide optimal supportive care. In addition to coagulation tests, advanced laboratory tests such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, D-dimers, activated factor Xa, and quantification of specific coagulation factors can be useful, as can thromboelastography or thromboelastometry. Treatment should be tailored, focusing on the estimated risk of bleeding and thrombosis.

Results Non survivors were older, with more comorbidities and a more severe disease. Corticosteroids were used in the majority of patients (54/83, 65%) with no difference between survivors and non survivors. Mean blood glucose values, (during the first 24 and 48 hours, respectively), were comparable between the two subgroups, as well as SD 24 and CV 24.

Internet-based interventions could facilitate access to treatment for PTSD and CPTSD. The current pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with two measurement points (pre-test and post-test) was used to investigate the effects of a structured mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD symptoms as well as anxiety, depression, and positive mental health. In total, 70 university students with high levels of PTSD and CPTSD symptoms based on ICD-11 criteria participated in the study: 31 in the intervention group and 39 in the waiting list control group. RESULTS: We found that the mindfulness-based internet intervention reduced CPTSD disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms (ES = − 0.48 [− 0.96; 0.00]), particularly negative self-concept (ES = − 0.72 [− 1.21; − 0.24]) and disturbances in relationships (ES = − 0.55 [− 1.03; − 0.07]). Moreover, the intervention reduced the symptoms of PTSD sense of threat (ES = − 0.48 [− 0.96; − 0.01]) and promoted positive mental health (ES = 0.51 [0.03; 0.99]).

There is a self-perpetuating vicious cycle between food insecurity and chronic health conditions like diabetes. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of its existence, to be able to recognize it, and to work with their patients to find solutions for it. Simultaneously, the providers should advocate for their patients and make program administrators, policymakers, and legislatures aware of this crisis.

Oncologists were advised to prioritize chemotherapy based on the absolute benefit that the patient may receive, which outbalances the risks of Covid‐19 infection. The results of this study will allow re‐examination of how to approach cancer care during the pandemic and ultimately, help optimize treatment recommendations during this crisis. AIM: This study described the factors contributing to treatment delays during the pandemic and their impact on disease progression. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study was done in St. Luke's Medical Center, a private tertiary healthcare institution based in Metro Manila, Philippines, composed of two facilities in Quezon City and Global City. Patients with solid malignancy with ongoing systemic cancer treatment prior to the peak of the pandemic were identified. Clinical characteristics and treatment data were compared between those with delayed and continued treatments. Multivariate analysis was done to determine factors for treatment delays and association of delays with disease progression and Covid‐19 infection. Of the 111 patients, 33% experienced treatment delays and 67% continued treatment during the pandemic. There was a higher percentage of patients on palliative intent who underwent treatment delay, and 64% of delays were due to logistic difficulties. Treatment delays were significantly associated with disease progression (p < .0001). There was no evidence of association between delay or continuation of treatment and risk of Covid‐19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in Covid‐19 infection between those who delayed and continued treatment during the pandemic; however, treatment delays were associated with a higher incidence of disease progression. Our findings suggest that the risks of cancer progression due to treatment delays exceed the risks of Covid‐19 infection in cancer patients implying that beneficial treatment should not be delayed as much as possible. Logistic hindrances were also identified as the most common cause of treatment delay among Filipino patients, suggesting that efforts should be focused into assistance programs that will mitigate these barriers to ensure continuity of cancer care services during the pandemic.","Pandy, Jessa Gilda; Maaño, Omar; Balolong‐Garcia, Joanmarie C.; Datukan, Jay T.

598987,The need for a streamlined approach to STEMI management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-13,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19, enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depletes ACE2, which is necessary for bradykinin metabolism. The depletion of ACE2 results in the accumulation of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and possible bradykinin, both of which bind to bradykinin receptors and induce vasodilation, lung injury and inflammation. It is well known that an overactivated contact system and excessive production of bradykinin comprise the key mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is reasonable to speculate that COVID-19 may increase disease activity in patients with HAE and vice versa. In this review, we explore the potential interactions between COVID-19 and HAE in terms of the contact system, the complement system, cytokine release, increased T helper 17 cells, and hematologic abnormalities. We conclude with the hypothesis that comorbidity with HAE might favor COVID-19 progression and may worsen its outcomes, while COVID-19 might in turn aggravate pre-existing HAE and prompt the onset of HAE in asymptomatic carriers of HAE-related mutations. Based on the pathophysiologic links, we suggest that long-term prophylaxis should be considered in patients with HAE at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor and lanadelumab and that HAE patients must have medications for acute attacks of angioedema. Additionally, therapeutic strategies employed in HAE should be considered for the treatment of COVID-19, and clinical trials should be performed.","Xu, Yingyang; Liu, Shuang; Zhang, Yan; Zhi, Yuxiang",World Allergy Organ J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939455120303574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834893/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939455120303574?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100454,272

Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers — systemic, microenvironmental and cellular — that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall.","Mitchell, Michael J.; Billingsley, Margaret M.; Haley, Rebecca M.; Wechsler, Marissa E.; Peppas, Nicholas A.; Langer, Robert",Nat Rev Drug Discov,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-020-0090-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277608/,272
599297,COVID-19 infections in day care centres in Germany: Social and organizational determinants of infections in children and staff in the second and third wave of the pandemic,2021-06-09,"Evidence from past economic crises indicates that recessions often affect men’s and women’s employment differently, with a greater impact on male-dominated sectors. The current COVID-19 crisis presents novel characteristics that have affected economic, health and social phenomena over wide swaths of the economy. Social distancing measures to combat the spread of the virus, such as working from home and school closures, have placed an additional tremendous burden on families. Using new survey data collected in April 2020 from a representative sample of Italian women, we analyse the effects of working arrangements due to COVID-19 on housework, childcare and home schooling among couples where both partners work. Our results show that most of the additional housework and childcare associated to COVID-19 falls on women while childcare activities are more equally shared within the couple than housework activities. According to our empirical estimates, changes to the amount of housework done by women during the emergency do not seem to depend on their partners’ working arrangements. With the exception of those continuing to work at their usual place of work, all of the women surveyed spend more time on housework than before. In contrast, the amount of time men devote to housework does depend on their partners’ working arrangements: men whose partners continue to work at their usual workplace spend more time on housework than before. The link between time devoted to childcare and working arrangements is more symmetric, with higher percentages of both women and men spending less time with their children if they continue to work away from home. For home schooling, too, parents who continue to go to their usual workplace after the lockdown are less likely to spend greater amounts of time with their children than before. Similar results emerge for the partners of women not working before the emergency.

Several case reports and small case series described myoclonus in five patients suffering from the disease. The purpose of this article is to report on five critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated myoclonus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical courses and test results of patients treated in the study center ICU and those of partner hospitals are described. Imaging, laboratory tests and electrophysiological test results are reviewed and discussed. RESULTS: In severe cases of COVID-19 myoclonus can manifest about 3 weeks after initial onset of symptoms. Sedation is sometimes effective for symptom control but impedes respiratory weaning. No viral particles or structural lesions explaining this phenomenon were found in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Myoclonus in patients with severe COVID-19 may be due to an inflammatory process, hypoxia or GABAergic impairment. Most patients received treatment with antiepileptic or anti-inflammatory agents and improved clinically.","Grieb, Alexander; Seitz, Tamara; Kitzberger, Reinhard; Schmidbauer, Manfred; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Traugott, Marianna T.; Pawelka, Erich; Karolyi, Mario; Strasser, Georg; Knibbe, Karolina; Laferl, Hermann; Zoufaly, Alexander; Wenisch, Christoph; Neuhold, Stephanie",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-021-01890-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129096/,272

The respiratory system is the most affected by the novel virus. Clinical manifestations are diverse in severity, with the most common symptoms including fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The contributing factor to the morbidity and mortality associated with this virus is the rapid clinical deterioration as a result of a heightened inflammatory response, requiring supplemental oxygen. Pneumothorax is an unusual complication that may further worsen the hypoxia and require immediate intervention. We present a case series of two patients with no risk factors for pneumothorax besides recent COVID-19 infection, who were found to have spontaneous pneumothoraxes.","Elkattawy, Sherif; Ayad, Sarah; Younes, Islam; Singh, Zamir; Alyacoub, Ramez; Brescia, Michael L",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026383/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14567,272

Hepatic steatosis may increase risk of COVID-19 severity. Current studies evaluating steatosis lack reliable definitions. We aimed to evaluate the association of radiographic hepatic steatosis and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 severity in a diverse cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two US academic hospitals. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit use, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. We used Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous measures and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical measures. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 319 patients, 14% had hepatic steatosis. There were no differences in length of stay (6 (4 - 16) vs. 9 (4 - 18) days, P = 0.6), intensive care unit (24% vs. 32%, P = 0.3), mechanical ventilation (28% vs. 38%, P = 0.32), or in-hospital mortality (7% vs. 17%, P = 0.12). After adjustment, there was no difference in length of stay (β: -14.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): -30.5 - 1.77, P = 0.08), intensive care unit (odds ratio (OR): 0.31, 95% CI: 0.03 - 1.09, P = 0.06), mechanical ventilation (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02 - 1.09, P = 0.06), or in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06 - 1.16, P = 0.08) among patients with hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: Radiographic hepatic steatosis was not associated with worse outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Trivedi, Hirsh D.; Wilechansky, Robert; Goyes, Daniela; Vieira Barbosa, Joana; Canakis, Andrew; Lai, Michelle; Long, Michelle T.; Fricker, Zachary",Gastroenterology Res,https://doi.org/10.14740/gr1389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267833/,272

Severely ill subjects have shown higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine storm is the term that can be used for a systemic inflammation leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and activation of immune cells. In coronavirus disease-2019 infection, a cytokine storm contributes to the mortality rate of the disease and can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome through auto-destructive responses of systemic inflammation. Direct effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with infection as well as hyperinflammatory reactions are in association with disease complications. Besides acute respiratory distress syndrome, functional impairments of the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and several others can be mentioned as the possible consequences. In addition to the current therapeutic approaches for coronavirus disease-2019, which are mostly supportive, stem cell-based therapies have shown the capacity for controlling the inflammation and attenuating the cytokine storm. Therefore, after a brief review of novel coronavirus characteristics, this review aims to explain the effects of coronavirus disease-2019 cytokine storm on different organs of the human body. The roles of stem cell-based therapies on attenuating cytokine release syndrome are also stated.","Arjmand, Babak; Alavi-Moghadam, Sepideh; Parhizkar Roudsari, Peyvand; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa; Rahim, Fakher; Gilany, Kambiz; Mohamadi-Jahani, Fereshteh; Adibi, Hossein; Larijani, Bagher",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.675310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195193/,272

Nevertheless, like street‐level implementation in general, SLPE is studied during ordinary times but rarely during crises. Focusing on community‐health workers in Brazil during the Covid‐19 crisis uncovered a defensive motivation for SLPE, which aimed to legitimize community healthcare as an integral part of pandemic treatment, reforming the government's hitherto neglectful approach to community health services. Moreover, the continuing crisis created an unusually prolonged window of opportunity for securing community healthcare provision. By utilizing collective efforts and drawing on powerful politicians' mobilization, SLPE during crisis shares similarities with, yet differs from, SLPE during ordinary times, while further closing the interstices between local, professional, and political perspectives in the formulation of policy decisions.","Gofen, Anat; Lotta, Gabriela; Marchesini da Costa, Marcelo",Public Adm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226766/; https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12745,272

While initial studies have focused on the recognition of CD8 (+) tissue-resident memory T (CD8 T (RM)) cells, it is now clear that numerous cell types such as CD4 (+) T cells, gd T cells, innate lymphoid cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells form stable populations in tissues. They are enriched at the barrier surfaces and within non-lymphoid compartments. They provide an extensive immune network capable of sensing local perturbations of the body’s homeostasis. This positioning enables immune cells to positively influence immune protection against infection and cancer but paradoxically also augment autoimmunity, allergy and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we highlight the recent studies across multiple lymphoid immune cell types that have emerged on this research topic and extend our understanding of this important cellular network. In addition, we highlight the areas that remain gaps in our knowledge of the regulation of these cells and how a deeper understanding may result in new ways to ‘target’ these cells to influence disease outcome and treatments.","Belz, Gabrielle T.; Denman, Renae; Seillet, Cyril; Jacquelot, Nicolas",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695313/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25234.1,272

To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.","Pavlovich, Stephanie S.; Lovett, Sean P.; Koroleva, Galina; Guito, Jonathan C.; Arnold, Catherine E.; Nagle, Elyse R.; Kulcsar, Kirsten; Lee, Albert; Thibaud-Nissen, Françoise; Hume, Adam J.; Mühlberger, Elke; Uebelhoer, Luke S.; Towner, Jonathan S.; Rabadan, Raul; Sanchez-Lockhart, Mariano; Kepler, Thomas B.; Palacios, Gustavo",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867418304021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418304021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29706541/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.070,272

RNA interference (RNAi) is a crucial antiviral defense mechanism in eukaryotes, and numerous viruses have been found to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to evade antiviral RNAi response. However, there is little knowledge about whether and how RuV antagonizes RNAi. In this study, we identified that the RuV capsid protein is a potent VSR that can efficiently suppress shRNA- and siRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian cells. Moreover, the VSR activity of the RuV capsid is dependent on its dimerization and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding activity. In addition, ectopic expression of the RuV capsid can effectively rescue the replication defect of a VSR-deficient virus or replicon, implying that the RuV capsid can act as a VSR in the context of viral infection. Together, our findings uncover that RuV encodes a VSR to evade antiviral RNAi response, which expands our understanding of RuV–host interaction and sheds light on the potential therapeutic target against RuV.","Xu, Jiuyue; Kong, Jing; Lyu, Bao; Wang, Xiaotong; Qian, Qi; Zhou, Xi; Qiu, Yang",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494454/,272

With widespread uptake, case series of vaccine-related myocarditis/pericarditis have been reported, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Males tend to be affected with greater frequency, and symptom onset is usually within one week following vaccination. Clinical course appears to be mild in the overwhelming majority of cases. Based on the available evidence, we highlight a clinical framework to guide providers on how to assess, investigate, diagnose and report suspected and confirmed cases. In any patient with highly suggestive symptoms temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, standardized work-up includes serum troponin measurement and PCR testing for COVID-19 infection, routine additional labwork, and a 12-lead ECG. Echocardiography is recommended as the imaging modality of choice for patients with unexplained troponin elevation and/or pathologic ECG changes. Cardiovascular specialist consultation and hospitalization should be considered based on the results of standard investigations. Treatment is largely supportive, and myocarditis/pericarditis that is diagnosed by defined clinical criteria should be reported to Public Health authorities in every jurisdiction. Finally, we recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all individuals in accordance with the Health Canada and NACI guidelines.

METHODS: REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study using an online survey developed by an international multidisciplinary patient-led collaboration across seven European countries targeting unselected patients with RMDs. Healthcare access, daily activities, disease activity and function, well-being (WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), health status, anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and access to information were evaluated. Data were collected in April–July 2020 (first phase). RESULTS: Data from the first phase included 1800 patients with 15 different RMDs (37.2% axial spondyloarthritis, 29.2% rheumatoid arthritis, 17.2% osteoarthritis and others). Mean age was 53, 80% female and 49% had undertaken university studies. During the beginning of the pandemic, 58.4% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled and 45.6% reported not having received any information relating to the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their RMDs, with the main source being patient organisations (27.6%). Regarding habits, 24.6% increased smoking, 18.2% raised their alcohol consumption, and 45.6% were unable to continue exercising. Self-reported disease activity was high (5.3±2.7) and 75.6% reported elevated pain. Half the patients (49.0%) reported poor well-being (WHO-5) and 46.6% that their health had changed for the worse during lockdown. According to HADS, 57.3% were at risk of anxiety and 45.9% of depression.

The ability to evaluate functional status of COVID-19 survivors early on at ICU and hospital discharge may enable identification of patients who may need medical and rehabilitation interventions. METHODS: The modified “Mental Status”, ICU Mobility, and Barthel Index scores at ICU and hospital discharge were tabulated for 118 COVID-19 survivors treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). These functional scores were compared with pre-admission functional status, discharge durable medical equipment, discharge medical follow-up recommendation, duration on IMV, duration post-IMV, demographics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, and vital signs at ICU and hospital discharge. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 IMV patients were not functionally independent at hospital discharge (22% discharged with cane or rolling walker, 49% discharged with durable medical equipment, and 14% admitted to a rehabilitation facility), although 94% of these patients were functionally independent prior to COVID-19 illness. Half of the patients were discharged with supplemental oxygen equipment. The most prevalent medical follow-up recommendations were cardiology, vascular medicine, pulmonology, endocrinology, and neurology with many patients receiving multiple medical follow-up recommendations. Functional status improved from ICU discharge to hospital discharge (p < 0.001). Worse functional status at hospital discharge was associated with longer IMV duration, older age, male sex, higher number of comorbidities, and the presence of pre-existing comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunosuppression (p < 0.05, ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IMV COVID-19 survivors were not functionally independent at discharge and required significant follow-up medical care.

605291,Musculoskeletal Physical Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Telerehabilitation the Answer?,2020-05-08,"IFITMs are broad antiviral factors that block incoming virions in endosomal vesicles, protecting target cells from infection. In the case of HIV-1, we and others reported the existence of an additional antiviral mechanism through which IFITMs lead to the production of virions of reduced infectivity. However, whether this second mechanism of inhibition is unique to HIV or extends to other viruses is currently unknown. To address this question, we have analyzed the susceptibility of a broad spectrum of viruses to the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity by IFITMs. The results we have gathered indicate that this second antiviral property of IFITMs extends well beyond HIV and we were able to identify viruses susceptible to the three IFITMs altogether (HIV-1, SIV, MLV, MPMV, VSV, MeV, EBOV, WNV), as well as viruses that displayed a member-specific susceptibility (EBV, DUGV), or were resistant to all IFITMs (HCV, RVFV, MOPV, AAV). The swapping of genetic elements between resistant and susceptible viruses allowed us to point to specificities in the viral mode of assembly, rather than glycoproteins as dominant factors of susceptibility. However, we also show that, contrarily to X4-, R5-tropic HIV-1 envelopes confer resistance against IFITM3, suggesting that viral receptors add an additional layer of complexity in the IFITMs-HIV interplay. Lastly, we show that the overall antiviral effects ascribed to IFITMs during spreading infections, are the result of a bimodal inhibition in which IFITMs act both by protecting target cells from incoming viruses and in driving the production of virions of reduced infectivity. Overall, our study reports for the first time that the negative imprinting of the virion particles infectivity is a conserved antiviral property of IFITMs and establishes IFITMs as a paradigm of restriction factor capable of interfering with two distinct phases of a virus life cycle.","Tartour, Kevin; Nguyen, Xuan-Nhi; Appourchaux, Romain; Assil, Sonia; Barateau, Véronique; Bloyet, Louis-Marie; Burlaud Gaillard, Julien; Confort, Marie-Pierre; Escudero-Perez, Beatriz; Gruffat, Henri; Hong, Saw See; Moroso, Marie; Reynard, Olivier; Reynard, Stéphanie; Decembre, Elodie; Ftaich, Najate; Rossi, Axel; Wu, Nannan; Arnaud, Frédérick; Baize, Sylvain; Dreux, Marlène; Gerlier, Denis; Paranhos-Baccala, Glaucia; Volchkov, Viktor; Roingeard, Philippe; Cimarelli, Andrea",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28957419/,272
605534,Roadmap for Restarting Elective Surgery During/After COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-11,"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome–coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is primarily a respiratory infection but has been recently associated with a variety of neurological symptoms. We present herewith a COVID-19 case manifesting as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), a rare neurological disorder. Case Presentation: A 63-year-old male diagnosed with COVID-19 infection developed behavioral changes, confusion, and insomnia followed by reduced mobility and abnormal eye movements within 48 h of recovery from respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19. On examination, he had rapid, chaotic, involuntary saccadic, multidirectional eye movements (opsoclonus), and limb myoclonus together with truncal ataxia. CSF analysis, MRI of the brain, and screening for anti-neuronal and encephalitis related antibodies were negative. Extensive testing revealed no underlying malignancy. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with complete resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks of treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection can be associated with the manifestation of opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can be treated with IVIG if not responsive to corticosteroids.","Ishaq, Hira; Durrani, Talha; Umar, Zainab; Khan, Nemat; McCombe, Pamela; Ul Haq, Mian Ayaz",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163427/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.672524,272
605690,Healthcare distrust among hospitalised black patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-28,"The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified decades of vulnerabilities, disparities, and injustices within the U.S. correctional system. The spread of the coronavirus poses a particularly serious threat to those that comprise the system, including personnel, attorneys, prisoners, their families and extends into the communities in which facilities are located. These correctional facilities and communities were especially underprepared for the sudden onset of a highly contagious virus, which has resulted in an exceedingly high number of infections among those who work and are held in the facilities. Rampant overcrowding in the U.S. correctional system, an aging population, and a population exhibiting high rates of underlying health conditions are highly likely to exacerbate the spread of this highly contagious virus. This potentially dire set of interrelated circumstances necessitates rapid decarceration measures that effectively balance public safety and public health. Unfortunately, there has been unclear guidance as well as changing and even contradictory information coming from the federal government concerning rapid measures to mitigate the spread of infection to justice system personnel and federal prisoners. In this paper we summarize the federal response and how it has impacted those responsible for implementation. Furthermore, we discuss how systemic deleterious conditions of the U.S. correctional system serve as both accelerants to as well as effects of the pandemic. We end highlighting critical issues relating to early release due to COVID-19 that will necessitate future research.","Abraham, Leola A.; Brown, Timothy C.; Thomas, Shaun A.",Am J Crim Justice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837163/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09537-1,272

We retrospectively reviewed the data of AMI patients admitted to the Nihon University Itabashi Hospital after a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the same period from 2017 to 2019 (control period). The patients’ characteristics, time course of admission, diagnosis, and treatment of AMI, and 30-day mortality were compared between the two period-groups for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), respectively. The AMI inpatients decreased by 5.7% after the COVID-19 outbreak. There were no differences among most patient backgrounds between the two-period groups. For NSTEMI, the time from the symptom onset to admission was significantly longer, and that from the AMI diagnosis to the catheter examination tended to be longer during the COVID-19 period than the control period, but not for STEMI. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period for NSTEMI (23.1% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.004), but not for STEMI (9.4% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.77). In conclusion, hospitalizations for AMI decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Acute cardiac care for STEMI and the associated outcome did not change, but NSTEMI outcome worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak, which may have been associated with delayed medical treatment due to the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Arai, Riku; Fukamachi, Daisuke; Ebuchi, Yasunari; Migita, Suguru; Morikawa, Tomoyuki; Monden, Masaki; Takei, Norio; Tamaki, Takehiro; Kojima, Keisuke; Akutsu, Naotaka; Murata, Nobuhiro; Kitano, Daisuke; Okumura, Yasuo",Heart Vessels,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743048/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-021-01835-w,272

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine ways in which COVID-19 has affected the bereavement experiences of parents whose children died from cancer prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Parents who participated in a survey-based study examining the early grief experience were invited to complete a semi-structured interview. During the interview, which focused on examining the current support for parents and other family members within the first several years following the child’s death, participants were asked how COVID-19 has impacted their life and bereavement. RESULTS: Fifteen of thirty-three eligible parents completed the interview; 14 were White and non-Hispanic, 5 were male. Parents participated an average of 19 (range 12-34) months after their child’s death. COVID-19 was addressed in 13 interviews. Eleven codes were used to describe interview segments; the most commonly used codes were ‘change in support,’ ‘no effect, ’familiarity with uncertainty/ability to cope’ and ‘change in contact with care/research team.’ CONCLUSION: Parents identified multiple and variable ways – both positive, negative and neutral – how COVID-19 has affected their bereavement. While many parents commented on feeling more isolated because of the inability to connect with family or attend in-person support groups, others acknowledged their experience has made them uniquely positioned to cope with the uncertainty of the current situation. Clinicians must find innovative ways to connect with and support bereaved parents during this unique time.","Helton, Gabrielle; Wolfe, Joanne; Snaman, Jennifer M.",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420307223?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420307223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889042/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.035,272

With the unfolding situation, there is a definite need for an exit strategy to reinstate elective services. Therefore, more literature evidence supporting exit plans for elective surgical services is imperative to adopt a safe working principle. This study aims to provide evidence for safe elective surgical practice during the pandemic. Methodology This single centre, prospective, observational study included adult patients who were admitted and underwent elective surgical procedures in the trust’s COVID-free environment at the Birmingham Treatment Centre between May 19 and July 14, 2020. Data were collected on demographic parameters, peri-operative variables, surgical specialities, COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing results, post-operative complications and mortality. The study also highlighted the protocols it followed for the elective services during the pandemic. Results A total of 303 patients were included with mean age of 49.9 years (SD 16.5) comprising of 59% (178) female and 41% (125) male. They were classified according to the American Society of Anaesthesiologist Grade, different surgical specialities and types of anaesthesia used. Ninety-six percent (96%) of patients were discharged on the same day. Hundred percent (100%) compliance with pre-operative COVID-19 RT-PCR testing was maintained. There was no 30-day mortality or major respiratory complications. Conclusion Careful patient selection, simultaneous involvement of the pre-assessment and anaesthetic team, strict adherence to peri-operative protocols and delivering vigilant post-operative care for COVID-19 infection can help provide safe elective surgical services if the community transmission is under reasonable control. However, it is particularly important to maintain COVID-free safe environment for such procedures.","De, Chiranjit; Shah, Saumil; Suleiman, Kusy; Chen, Zehong; Paringe, Vishal; Prakash, Divya",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540389/,272

This study is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of composting using meal from dead pigs through physicochemical analyses and phytotoxic assays. Five treatments were tested, all including 50% sawdust: T1, with 50% slaughterhouse sludge (control); T2, with 20% slaughterhouse sludge and 30% meal from dead pigs; T3, with 10% slaughterhouse sludge and 40% meal from dead pigs; T4, with 20% organic stabilizing compost and 30% meal from dead pigs and T5, with 30% organic stabilizing compost and 20% meal from dead pigs. The phytotoxicity assays used lettuce, cucumber, celia, soybean, rice and wheat as bioindicators. Inclusion of meal from dead pigs was related to reduction in pH, C/N ratio, humidity and temperatures inside the pile, although thermophilic peaks lasted longer than 50 days and the final composts showed high content of nitrogen and phosphorous. The germination of bioindicators was reduced in all tested treatments, compared to the control. The composts from treatments that included meal from dead pigs presented acceptable nutrient content, which may indicate their use as organic fertilizers. However, after 4 months, all bioindicators in contact with such composts presented impaired germination.

Among these, the past use of mercury dichloride (HgCl(2)) on herbaria artifacts currently produces high levels of indoor atmospheric gaseous mercury (Hg(0)) and possibly of particulate bound Hg (PBM), i.e., the particulate matter containing Hg. This study evaluates the PBM pollution in the Central Italian Herbarium (Natural History Museum of the University of Florence, Italy), characterizing the size range and chemical speciation with SEM-EDS microanalysis. The analysis of the total Hg concentration in the samples allowed to calculate the workers exposure risk to this pollutant. PBM is almost totally classifiable as fine particulate with a significant dimensional increase in a period of scarce attendance of the Herbarium rooms. The microanalysis indicates that Hg is essentially bound to S, highlighting the change of Hg speciation from the original association with Cl. The average Hg concentration reveals a potential health risk for workers as result of multiple Hg exposure pathways, mainly by ingestion. The study provides information for characterizing PBM pollution that could affect a workplace atmosphere and a useful basis to evaluate and correctly design solution strategies to reduce the contamination levels and protect workers’ health.","Ciani, Francesco; Chiarantini, Laura; Costagliola, Pilario; Rimondi, Valentina",Toxics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203704/; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics9060141,272

612727,The importance of feedback for surgical teams during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The COVID-19 disease, which was declared epidemic by the WHO, is a global emergency public health problem. Patients with extrapulmonary symptoms are the group of patients who should be considered for person-to-person transmission in the community. In our study, it was aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients with COVID-19-related diarrhea symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted retrospectively in CO­VID-19 rtRT-PCR-positive patients in 5 medical centers. Three or more loose/liquid stools per day or increased number of defecations compared to normal defecation were defined as diarrhea. The patients were analyzed in 2 groups as those with and without diarrhea. RESULTS: One thousand eighty-six patients were included in the study. Seventy-eight (7.2%) of the patients had diarrhea. Diarrhea was watery in 54 (69.2%) patients while with blood and mucus in 18 (23.1%) patients. Diarrhea continued for an average of 5.2 ± 1.6 (2–11) days. The clinical and laboratory findings of patients with diarrhea were more serious than those without diarrhea. Diarrhea is more common in the elderly and people with comorbid disease, and patients with diarrhea had higher CMI score and CRP and higher complaints of fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diarrhea should indicate a suspected COVID-19 infection and suggest testing for early diagnosis of the disease. It should be kept in mind that the course of the disease may be more severe in these patients, and precautions should also be taken in terms of fecal transmission during discharge.","Comoglu, Şenol; Öztürk, Sinan; Kant, Aydın; Arslan, Mustafa; Karakoc, Hanife Nur; Yılmaz, Gürdal",Dig Dis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647911/,272
612964,Correction: Strategies to reduce COVID-19 risk perception among grocery shoppers in the US: A survey study,2021-08-10,"In low prevalence settings the development of sensitive and specific quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction tests to detect SARS-CoV − 2 (the virus causing COVID-19) in sewage presents the possibility of using sewage sampling as a diagnostic test for the presence of infected people in the catchment of the sampled sewer. However, the usefulness of such surveillance has not been quantified. In this study in the Australian state of Victoria between August and October 2020 the location of each known SARS-CoV − 2-infected person was determined on each day from two days before onset to 55 days after, in 46 metropolitan and rural sewer catchments sampled weekly – a total of 71 positive and 275 negative samples, and 354,155 person-days of location data. These were categorised by time since onset and distance from the sampling site. The odds of detection in sewage were between 5 and 20 times higher where known cases were present, with less effect of distance than time since onset. Using positive qRT-PCR in a sewage sample as a diagnostic test not just for viral RNA in the sample, but for the presence of known infected people in the catchment on the same day, the sensitivity was moderate (31% to 76%) and the specificity high (87% to 94%). The odds of detection were increased with increased numbers of known infected people but decreased with increased distance and time since onset. The probability of detection of the viral subgenome in sewage samples was about 10% when one known infected person was present, and this increased with higher numbers of known infected people and greater proximity to the sampling site. Sewage surveillance can be used to detect people infected with SARS-CoV − 2 in the catchment, directing a search for infectious clinical cases and other public health actions. However, detection at least eight weeks after onset may be due to existing cases rather than new ones, and, although not zero, the probability of detecting a single case is low.","Black, Jim; Aung, Phyo; Nolan, Monica; Roney, Emma; Poon, Rachael; Hennessy, Daneeta; Crosbie, Nicholas D.; Deere, Dan; Jex, Aaron R.; John, Nijoy; Baker, Louise; Scales, Peter J.; Usher, Shane P.; McCarthy, David T.; Schang, Christelle; Schmidt, Jonathan; Myers, Steven; Begue, Natacha; Kaucner, Christine; Thorley, Bruce; Druce, Julian; Monis, Paul; Lau, Melody; Sarkis, Suzie",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721025407?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721025407,272

Furthermore, treatment with oral chemotherapy is of special value during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multidisciplinary healthcare involvement is crucial in the management of polypharmacy, adverse events and dose adjustment due to comorbidities and natural loss of renal function with age. Oral drugs simplify intake, reduce hospital visits, and improve autonomy and quality of life. However, although oral drugs have advantages, they also transfer control and responsibility from the healthcare professional to the patient, who must be able to understand and follow the directions given.

In some patients, the virus remains in the respiratory tract, causing pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis, leading to death. Natural flavonoids (aglycone and glycosides) possess broad biological activities encompassing antiinflammatory, antiviral, antitumoral, antiallergic, antiplatelet, and antioxidant effects. While many studies have focused on the effects of natural flavonoids in experimental models, reports based on clinical trials are still insufficient. In this review, we highlight the effects of flavonoids in controlling pulmonary diseases, particularly the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a consequence of COVID‐19, and their potential use in coronavirus‐related diseases. Furthermore, we also focus on establishing a relationship between biological potential and chemical aspects of related flavonoids and discuss several possible mechanisms of action, pointing out some possible effects on COVID‐19.","Santana, Fernanda Paula R.; Thevenard, Fernanda; Gomes, Kaio S.; Taguchi, Laura; Câmara, Niels Olsen S.; Stilhano, Roberta S.; Ureshino, Rodrigo P.; Prado, Carla Maximo; Lago, João Henrique Ghilardi",Phytother Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928690/,272

In addition, the inactivation of SARS-CoV in wastewater with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also studied. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the virus could only persist for 2 days in hospital wastewater, domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water, while 3 days in feces, 14 days in PBS and 17 days in urine at 20 °C. However, at 4 °C, the SARS-CoV could persist for 14 days in wastewater and at least 17 days in feces or urine. SARS-CoV is more susceptible to disinfectants than Escherichia coli and f(2) phage. Free chlorine was found to inactivate SARS-CoV better than chlorine dioxide. Free residue chlorine over 0.5 mg/L for chlorine or 2.19 mg/L for chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensures complete inactivation of SARS-CoV while it does not inactivate completely E. coli and f(2) phage.","Wang, Xin-Wei; Li, Jin-Song; Jin, Min; Zhen, Bei; Kong, Qing-Xin; Song, Nong; Xiao, Wen-Jun; Yin, Jing; Wei, Wei; Wang, Gui-Jie; Si, Bing-yin; Guo, Bao-Zhong; Liu, Chao; Ou, Guo-Rong; Wang, Min-Nian; Fang, Tong-Yu; Chao, Fu-Huan; Li, Jun-Wen",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847934/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405000649; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405000649,272
614060,COVID‐19 pandemic: perspectives on an unfolding crisis,2020-03-23,"Rapid and widespread testing of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for an effective public health response aimed at containing and mitigating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing. However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.","Ceci, A.; Muñoz-Ballester, C.; Tegge, A.

Oxidative damage has been demonstrated as a pathogenic mechanism in several retinal diseases, and reactive oxygen species are certainly important by-products of ethanol (EtOH) metabolism. Autophagy has been shown to exert a protective effect in different cellular and animal models. Thus, in our model, EtOH treatment increases autophagy flux, in a concentration-dependent manner. Mitochondrial morphology seems to be clearly altered under EtOH exposure, leading to an apparent increase in mitochondrial fission. An increase in 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE), among others were confirmed. The characterization of these structures confirmed their nature as aggresomes. Hence, autophagy seems to have a cytoprotective role in ARPE-19 cells under EtOH damage, by degrading fragmented mitochondria and 4-HNE aggresomes. Herein, we describe the central implication of autophagy in human retinal pigment epithelial cells upon oxidative stress induced by EtOH, with possible implications for other conditions and diseases.","Flores-Bellver, M; Bonet-Ponce, L; Barcia, J M; Garcia-Verdugo, J M; Martinez-Gil, N; Saez-Atienzar, S; Sancho-Pelluz, J; Jordan, J; Galindo, M F; Romero, F J",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032851/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2014.288,272

Identifying and breaking all viable transmission routes are critical to stop future outbreaks, and the potential of transmission by water has been highlighted. By modifying established approaches, we provide a method for the rapid assessment of the risk of transmission posed by fecally contaminated river water and give example results for 39 countries. The country relative risk of transmission posed by fecally contaminated river water is related to the environment and the populations’ infection rate and water usage. On the basis of in vitro data and using temperature as the primary controller of survival, we then demonstrate how viral loads likely decrease after a spill. These methods using readily available data suggest that sewage spills into rivers within countries with high infection rates could provide infectious doses of >40 copies per 100 mL of water. The approach, implemented in the supplementary spreadsheet, can provide a fast estimate of the upper and lower viral load ranges following a riverine spill. The results enable evidence-based research recommendations for wastewater epidemiology and could be used to evaluate the significance of fecal–oral transmission within freshwater systems.","Shutler, Jamie D.; Zaraska, Krzysztof; Holding, Thomas; Machnik, Monika; Uppuluri, Kiranmai; Ashton, Ian G.

Aim of this survey was to assess in depth the impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers (HCW). A 40-item online survey was disseminated via social media inviting Italian HCW, with questions exploring demographics, health status and work environment of respondents. A total of 527 were invited to take part in March 2020, of whom 74% (n = 388) responded to the survey. Of these, 235 (61%) were women. HCW were mostly physicians (74%), from high-prevalence regions (52%). 25% experienced typical symptoms during the last 14 days prior to survey completion, with only 45% of them being tested for COVID-19. Among the tested population, 18 (18%) resulted positive for COVID-19, with 33% being asymptomatic. Only 22% of HCW considered personal protective equipment adequate for quality and quantity.

New Zealand (NZ) faced similar potential challenges despite being geographically isolated. Given the rapid change in the COVID‐19 pandemic, hospitals in NZ were tasked with formulating their own COVID‐19 responses based on the Ministry of Health's (MoH) recommendations. METHODS: This paper evaluates how six metropolitan general surgical departments in NZ had responded to COVID‐19 in terms of changes made to rosters, theatres, clinics, acute admissions as well as additional measures taken to reduce the risk of staff exposure. It also explores how NZ fared in comparison with international guidelines and recommendations. Data from each centre were provided by an appointed clinician. RESULTS: All centres had adapted new rosters and a restructuring of teams. Handovers, multidisciplinary team meetings and educational sessions were held virtually. Different strategies were implemented to ration hospital resources and reduce the risk of staff exposure. Non‐urgent operations, endoscopies and clinics were deferred with allocation of dedicated COVID‐19 operating theatres. Potential COVID‐19 suspects were screened prior to admission and treated separately. Various admission and imaging pathways were utilised to increase efficiency. CONCLUSION: General surgical departments in NZ had implemented a comprehensive COVID‐19 response but there is room to work towards a more unified national response. Our analysis shows that these centres across NZ had taken a similar approach which was aligned with international practices.","Toh, Karen Hui Qi; Barazanchi, Ahmed; Rajaretnam, Nigel S.; Tan, Jeffrey; Linton, Tara; Murray, Mark; Fagan, Paul; Koea, Jonathan",ANZ J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.17044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224196/,272

We present a case of COVID-19 associated aortic thrombus in an otherwise healthy patient. Case Report A 53-year-old woman with no past medical history presented with a 10-day history of dyspnea, fever and cough. Her pulse oximetry on room air was 84%. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and chest radiography revealed moderate patchy bilateral airspace opacities. Serology markers for cytokine storm were significantly elevated with a serum D-dimer level of 8180 ng/mL (normal <230 ng/mL). Computer tomography (CT) of the chest with IV contrast was positive for bilateral ground glass opacities, scattered filling defects within the bilateral segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries, and a large thrombus was present at the aortic arch. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and successfully treated with unfractionated heparin, alteplase 50 mg, and argatroban 2 mcg/kg/min. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Mural aortic thrombus is a rare but serious cause of distal embolism and typically discovered during an evaluation of cryptogenic arterial embolization to the viscera or extremities. Patients with suspected hypercoagulable states such as that encountered with COVID-19, should be screened for thromboembolism, and when identified, aggressively anticoagulated.","P, Gandotra; A, Supariwala; S, Selim; G, Garra; L, Gruberg",J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0736467920308519; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736467920308519?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917441/,272

There is a high demand for rapid diagnostic tests to expedite identification of cases and to facilitate early isolation and control spread. Hence this study evaluates seven different rapid nucleic acid detection assays that are commercially available for SARS- CoV- 2 virus detection. Methods Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 4859 participants and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus by the gold standard RT-PCR method along with one of these seven rapid methods of detection. Evaluation of the rapid nucleic acid detection assays was done by comparing the results of these rapid methods with the gold standard RT-qPCR results for SARS-COV-2 detection. Results AQ-TOP had the highest sensitivity (98%) and strong kappa value of 0.943 followed by Genechecker and Abbot ID NOW. The POCKIT (ii RT-PCR) assay had the highest test accuracy of 99.29% followed by Genechecker and Cobas Liat. Atila iAMP showed the highest percentage of invalid reports (35.5%) followed by AQ-TOP with 6% and POCKIT with 3.7% of invalid reports. Conclusion Genechecker system, Abbott ID NOW and Cobas Liat, were found to have best performance and agreement when compared to the standard RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection.

Additionally, to examine whether data availability statements are sufficient to capture code availability declarations. DESIGN: Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across nine categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. RESULTS: 3938 medRxiv preprints with an applicable data availability statement were included in our sample, of which 911 (23.1%) were categorized as describing open data. 379 (9.6%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 155 contained an applicable data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, a minority (59 (38.1%)) of these published data availability statements described open data. Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing. Data availability statements more frequently described open data on publication when the journal mandated data sharing (open at preprint: 33.3%, open at publication: 61.4%) compared to when the journal did not mandate data sharing (open at preprint: 20.2%, open at publication: 22.3%). CONCLUSION: Requiring that authors submit a data availability statement is a good first step, but is insufficient to ensure data availability. Strict editorial policies that mandate data sharing (where appropriate) as a condition of publication appear to be effective in making research data available. We would strongly encourage all journal editors to examine whether their data availability policies are sufficiently stringent and consistently enforced.","McGuinness, Luke A.; Sheppard, Athena L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983972/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250887,272

However, clinicians are often reluctant to trust deep models due to their black-box characteristics. To automatically differentiate COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia from healthy lungs in radiographic imaging, we propose an explainable attention-transfer classification model based on the knowledge distillation network structure. The attention transfer direction always goes from the teacher network to the student network. Firstly, the teacher network extracts global features and concentrates on the infection regions to generate attention maps. It uses a deformable attention module to strengthen the response of infection regions and to suppress noise in irrelevant regions with an expanded reception field. Secondly, an image fusion module combines attention knowledge transferred from teacher network to student network with the essential information in original input. While the teacher network focuses on global features, the student branch focuses on irregularly shaped lesion regions to learn discriminative features. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments on public chest X-ray and CT datasets to demonstrate the explainability of the proposed architecture in diagnosing COVID-19.","Shi, Wenqi; Tong, Li; Zhu, Yuanda; Wang, May D",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882010/; https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3074893,272
620897,CD07: A survey of the incidence of skin problems in a cohort of hospital staff during the COVID‐19 pandemic: can this help plan future services?,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: American Indian elders, aged 55 years and older, represent a neglected segment of the United States (U.S.) health care system. This group is more likely to be uninsured and to suffer from greater morbidities, poorer health outcomes and quality of life, and lower life expectancies compared to all other aging populations in the country. Despite the U.S. government’s federal trust responsibility to meet American Indians’ health-related needs through the Indian Health Service (IHS), elders are negatively affected by provider shortages, limited availability of health care services, and gaps in insurance. This qualitative study examines the perspectives of professional stakeholders involved in planning, delivery of, and advocating for services for this population to identify and analyze macro- and meso-level factors affecting access to and use of health care and insurance among American Indian elders at the micro level. METHODS: Between June 2016 and March 2017, we undertook in-depth qualitative interviews with 47 professional stakeholders in two states in the Southwest U.S., including health care providers, outreach workers, public-sector administrators, and tribal leaders. The interviews focused on perceptions of both policy- and practice-related factors that bear upon health care inequities impacting elders. We analyzed iteratively the interview transcripts, using both open and focused coding techniques, followed by a critical review of the findings by a Community Action Board comprising American Indian elders. RESULTS: Findings illuminated complex and multilevel contextual influences on health care inequities for elders, centering on (1) gaps in elder-oriented services; (2) benefits and limits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA); (2) invisibility of elders in national, state, and tribal policymaking; and (4) perceived threats to the IHS system and the federal trust responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: Findings point to recommendations to improve the prevention and treatment of illness among American Indian elders by meeting their unique health care and insurance needs. Policies and practices must target meso and macro levels of contextual influence. Although Medicaid expansion under the ACA enables providers of essential services to elders, including the IHS, to enhance care through increased reimbursements, future policy efforts must improve upon this funding situation and fulfill the federal trust responsibility.

621431,Unpredictable Fall of Severe Emergent Cardiovascular Diseases Hospital Admissions During the COVID‐19 Pandemic: Experience of a Single Large Center in Northern Italy,2020-06-13,"Objectives To investigate public use of lateral flow test [LFT] or polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test when experiencing key COVID-19 symptoms. Study design Two waves of a cross-sectional nationally representative online survey (data collected 1-2 June and 14-15 June 2021; n=3665 adults aged 18 years or over living in England or Scotland). Methods We report data investigating which type of test, if any, the public think Government guidance asks people to use if they have COVID-19 symptoms. In people with key COVID-19 symptoms (high temperature, cough, loss of sense of taste or smell), we also describe uptake of testing, if any. Results 10% of respondents thought Government guidance stated that they should take an LFT if symptomatic, while 18% of people thought that should take a PCR test; 60% thought they should take both types of test (12% did not select either option). In people who were symptomatic, 32% reported taking a test to confirm whether they had COVID-19. Of these, 53% reported taking a PCR test and 44% reported taking an LFT. Conclusions Despite Government guidance stating that anyone with key COVID-19 symptoms should complete a PCR test, a significant percentage of the population use LFT tests when symptomatic. Communications should emphasise the superiority of, and need for, PCR tests in people with symptoms.","Smith, Louise E.; Potts, Henry WW.; Amlȏt, Richard; Fear, Nicola T.; Michie, Susan; Rubin, G James",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621002936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487869/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621002936?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.07.023,272
621848,Acetylsalicylic Acid Compared with Enoxaparin for the Prevention of Thrombosis and Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: While recent reviews highlight high burnout prevalence among physicians in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), there has been a limited exploration into the role of gender and related factors in this problem. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of physician burnout and its relationship to gender, physician specialties, and age in the WHO’s EMR based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Al Manhal databases and synthesized the findings from the included studies. RESULTS: Among the 78 studies included, data was available from 16/22 (72.7%) countries and territories in the EMR covering a total of 16 016 physicians. The pooled prevalence of overall burnout among physicians in the region was estimated to be 24.5%. Among the sub-components of burnout, we estimated a high pooled prevalence of 44.26% for emotional exhaustion followed by 37.83% for depersonalization and 36.57% for low personal achievement. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence across the countries in the EMR and among the sub-categories of specialist medical practitioners. There was no statistically significant difference across the two genders at a regionally aggregated level. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of physician burnout including the three sub-components in EMR are high by any standards. Based on our review of available studies, it is difficult to ascertain gender differences with certainty in burnout levels among physicians in the EMR nations. There is a need for better quality studies in this area.","Doraiswamy, Sathyanarayanan; Chaabna, Karima; Jithesh, Anupama; Mamtani, Ravinder; Cheema, Sohaila",Journal of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326993/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04043,272
621973,Redesigning a Department of Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-28,"The Covid-19 pandemic provides a stark reminder of the political tensions associated with the field of immigration and health, highlighting the central role that nationalism, racism and xenophobia play in determining responses to communicable diseases. The blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas has long been recognised. However, an improved understanding of the politics influencing these entanglements, specifically within the context of the Covid-19 response in low- and middle-income country contexts, is urgently needed. This includes – but is not limited to – the immediate concerns surrounding inclusive social, political and medical responses to Covid-19; vaccine nationalism – at both global and national levels; and calls for ‘vaccine passports’. To this end, we draw on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) context – one associated with high levels of diverse population movements and a large burden of communicable diseases – to explore responses to Covid-19. We unpack tensions surrounding the management of migration and the ways in which sovereignty impacts attempts at building regional, coordinated responses to migration and health, and consider how this affects progress towards global health targets. With an initial focus on South Africa, we build on previous work exploring the blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas in SADC, and draw from ongoing research on the governance of migration and health within the region. This includes current and evolving research exploring migration and Covid-19, initiated in March 2020 when the first cases of Covid-19 were identified in Southern Africa. The aim is for these findings to catalyse a new and evolving researh agenda to inform the development and implementation of appropriate pandemic responses in a region associated with some of the highest levels of inequality globally. To this end, an evolving research agenda should be responsive to current needs. We suggest that, in SADC, priority research should focus on improving our understanding of (1) the political factors influencing the (dis)connections between migration and health governance structures in the context of Covid-19, and how to overcome these in the context of a pandemic; and (2) the motivations for and implications of a ‘vaccine passport’ system on movement within and beyond the SADC region. This requires a reactive, cross-disciplinary, regional research network. In a context where funding for research is increasingly inaccessible, this requires innovative, informal, collaborative engagement.","Vearey, Jo; de Gruchy, Thea; Maple, Nicholas",J Migr Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405188/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2021.100040,272

Methods: In the first phase, nasopharyngeal swab samples from the inbound population were numbered and grouped. The samples in the group were mixed together, and a NAT test was performed. When the test result is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the screening of the group is complete. When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT. Results: The advantages and considerations of the method are discussed. Prevalence in the incoming population was a determinant of the sample size within the group. The lower the incidence, the larger the sample size within the group, the higher the savings in NAT and testing costs. Conclusion: This method has significant efficiency and cost advantages in COVID-19 screening. It can also be used to screen other populations, such as community populations and people at high risk of infection, etc. Key words: COVID-19; NAT; nucleic acid testing; screening; nasopharyngeal swab","Yuan yuan, Cheng",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050914,272

623924,Management of surgery in the era of COVID‐19: preliminary data from 11 medical centres in Beijing,2020-07-03,"COVID-19 can be divided into three clinical stages, and one can speculate that these stages correlate with where the infection resides. For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose, where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin 5 basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and possible loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.","Mason, Robert J.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00126.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493030/,272

Research into the provision of autism assessments via telehealth is limited and few studies have explored clinician perspectives of conducting diagnostic assessments for autism in this way. The objective of this study was to examine the acceptability of a new telehealth model from the perspective of key stakeholder groups in an Australian community-based sample i.e. clients undergoing assessment, parent/carers and expert clinicians. METHODS: Sixteen adult clients (M(age) = 39.00, SD(age) = 14.39) and fifty-six parent/carers of children and adults (M(age) = 44.09, SD(age) = 9.87) undergoing autism assessments completed an online survey about their experiences of assessments via telehealth. Of these, six clients and twelve parent/carers agreed to participate in follow up interviews. Seven clinicians were also interviewed. RESULTS: In this study, the majority of adults and parent/carers reported that they, or the person they cared for, felt comfortable interacting with the clinician, would be willing to undergo future assessments via telehealth and were not concerned that important information had been missed during the assessment. Although the clinicians were slightly less satisfied with tele-assessment process compared to face-to-face and relied on external sources of information more than they would during a face-to-face assessment, their overall confidence in their diagnostic decision making remained high. CONCLUSION: Autism assessment via telehealth may be an acceptable alternative in some circumstances. However, a telehealth service should consider screening clients for suitability and adequately preparing clients for tele-assessments.","Gibbs, Vicki; Cai, Ru Ying; Aldridge, Fiona; Wong, Michelle",Res Autism Spectr Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512797/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101859; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946721001343; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1750946721001343,272

Vero cells are susceptible to various types of microbes and toxins and have widely contributed to not only microbiology, but also the production of vaccines for human use. We here showed the genome landscape of a Vero cell line, in which 25,877 putative protein-coding genes were identified in the 2.97-Gb genome sequence. A homozygous ∼9-Mb deletion on chromosome 12 caused the loss of the type I interferon gene cluster and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes in Vero cells. In addition, an ∼59-Mb loss of heterozygosity around this deleted region suggested that the homozygosity of the deletion was established by a large-scale conversion. Moreover, a genomic analysis of Vero cells revealed a female Chlorocebus sabaeus origin and proviral variations of the endogenous simian type D retrovirus. These results revealed the genomic basis for the non-tumourigenic permanent Vero cell lineage susceptible to various pathogens and will be useful for generating new sub-lines and developing new tools in the quality control of Vero cells.","Osada, Naoki; Kohara, Arihiro; Yamaji, Toshiyuki; Hirayama, Noriko; Kasai, Fumio; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Kuroda, Makoto; Hanada, Kentaro",DNA Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsu029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25267831/,272

Thus, many scholars have conducted research to develop new tools and applications. Processing information, usually in the form of binary code, is the main task in DTs, which is happening through many devices, including computers, smartphones, robots, and applications. Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in people’s life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, a comprehensive survey using literature and in-depth interviews have been carried out to identify the challenges under the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. Moreover, the SWARA procedure is applied to analyze and assess the challenges to DTs intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the WASPAS approach is utilized to rank the DTs under hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the developed framework, an illustrative case study has been analyzed. The results of this study found that Health Information Systems (HIS) was ranked as the first factor among other factors followed by a lack of digital knowledge, digital stratification, economic interventions, lack of reliable data, and cost inefficiency In conclusion, to confirm the steadiness and strength of the proposed framework, the obtained outputs are compared with other methods.","Mardani, Abbas; Saraji, Mahyar Kamali; Mishra, Arunodaya Raj; Rani, Pratibha",Appl Soft Comput,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494620305512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834799/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106613; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620305512?v=s5,272

Early in the pandemic many locations had limited testing and reporting, so that standard methods for determining IFR and CFR required large adjustments for missed cases. We present an alternate approach, based on results from the countries at the time that had a high test to positive case ratio to estimate symptomatic CFR. METHODS: We calculated age specific (0–69, 70–79, 80+ years old) time corrected crude symptomatic CFR values from 7 countries using two independent time to fatality correction methods. Data was obtained through May 7, 2020. We applied linear regression to determine whether the mean of these coefficients had converged to the true symptomatic CFR values. We then tested these coefficients against values derived in later studies as well as a large random serological study in NYC at that time. RESULTS: The age dependent symptomatic CFR values accurately predicted the percentage of the population infected as reported by two random testing studies in NYC. They also were in good agreement with later studies that estimated age specific IFR and CFR values from serological studies and more extensive data sets available later in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for regions with extensive testing it is possible to get early accurate symptomatic CFR coefficients. These values, in combination with an estimate of the age dependence of infection, allows symptomatic CFR values and percentage of the population that is infected to be determined in similar regions with limited testing.","Rothman, Jessica E.; Eidelberg, David; Rothman, Samantha L.; Holford, Theodore R.; Rothman, Douglas L.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407073/,272

While Hispanics are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, little is known about ethnic disparities in the hospital settings. This study investigates imaging utilization and clinical outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic COVID-19 patients in the Emergency Department (ED) and during hospitalization. METHODS: Through retrospective chart review, we included 331 symptomatic COVID-19 patients (mean age 53.2 years) at a metropolitan healthcare system from March to June 2020. Poisson regression was used to compare diagnostic imaging utilization and clinical outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, no statistically significant difference was found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients for the number of weekly chest X-rays. Results were categorized into four clinical outcomes: ED management (0.16 ± 0.05 vs. 0.14 ± 0.8, p:0.79); requiring inpatient management (1.31 ± 0.11 vs. 1.46 ± 0.16, p:0.43); ICU admission without invasive ventilation (1.4 ± 0.17 vs. 1.35 ± 0.26, p:0.86); and ICU admission and ventilator support (3.29 ± 0.22 vs. 3.59 ± 0.37, p:0.38).

626196,Real-world impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the assessment of anaesthesiology residents,2020-08-20,"Background Internationally, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in fewer cardiac surgical procedures being performed and an increase in the proportion of non-elective cases. To date there has been no study examining the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of cardiac surgery in Australia. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the provision of cardiac surgery in a single, large major cardiac centre and dedicated COVID-19 hospital. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken utilising prospectively collected data. Methods Prospectively collected patient and operative data was examined to assess whether there was a reduction in the number of cases performed and whether there was a difference in patient demographics, surgical procedures or case urgency. Data was examined from the period of COVID-restrictions in 2020 and compared with data from the same time period in 2019. Results From 3 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, 136 adults underwent cardiac surgery at our institution, representing an overall reduction in operative caseload of 21%. The largest impact was noticed in May and April and coincided with statewide restrictions on elective surgery. Surgical acuity was unchanged with 58% of operations classified as non-elective procedures performed during the index admission. There was a small non-significant increase in the proportion of isolated coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic valve surgeries performed. Conclusion From March to June 2020 our local hospital response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in cardiac surgery service delivery. No change was seen in the urgency or type of surgeries performed.","McNamara, Nicholas; Robinson, Benjamin; Bannon, Paul",Heart Lung Circ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950621010416?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2021.06.446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272184/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950621010416,272

Therefore, this study was conducted to combat major CoVs via a trivalent subunit vaccine, which was engineered by implementing sequences of spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M) protein, non-structural protein (nsp) 3, and nsp8 antigens. The CTL, HTL, MHC I, and IFN-γ epitopes were predicted via CTLPRED, IEDB, and IFN epitope servers, respectively. Also, to stimulate strong helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses, Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) was used. Also, for boosting the immune response, β-defensin 2 was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Furthermore, TAT was applied to the vaccine to facilitate the intracellular delivery. Finally, TAT, adjuvant, PADRE, and selected epitopes were appropriately assembled. Based on the predicted epitopes, a trivalent multi-epitope vaccine with a molecular weight of 74.8 kDa was constructed. Further analyses predicted the molecule to be a strong antigen, and a non-allergenic and soluble protein. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted. Additionally, analyses validated the stability of the proposed vaccine. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed binding affinity and stability of the vaccine-TLR3 complex was favorable. The predicted epitopes demonstrated a strong potential to stimulate T and B-cell mediated immune responses. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning guaranteed increased expression. In summary, investigations demonstrated that this next-generation approach might provide a new horizon for the development of a highly immunogenic vaccine against SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

The Allen Institute for AI and collaborators announced the availability of a rapidly growing open dataset of publications, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). As the pace of research accelerates, biomedical scientists struggle to stay current. To expedite their investigations, scientists leverage hypothesis generation systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to discover novel implicit connections. We present an automated general purpose hypothesis generation systems AGATHA-C and AGATHA-GP for COVID-19 research. The systems are based on graph-mining and the transformer model. The systems are massively validated using retrospective information rediscovery and proactive analysis involving human-in-the-loop expert analysis. Both systems achieve high-quality predictions across domains (in some domains up to 0.97% ROC AUC) in fast computational time and are released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research. In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

The controls were 91 otherwise healthy children unvaccinated against influenza. The results show that the clinical and socioeconomic impact of influenza-like illnesses and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in oncohematological children who have completed cancer therapy are related to the length of the off therapy period, and seem to be significantly greater in those who have been off therapy for less than 6 months in comparison with healthy controls. This suggests that the administration of influenza vaccination should be strongly recommended only among oncohematological children who have been off therapy for less than 6 months.","Esposito, Susanna; Cecinati, Valerio; Scicchitano, Barbara; Delvecchio, Giovanni Carlo; Santoro, Nicola; Amato, Doriana; Pelucchi, Claudio; Jankovic, Momcilo; De Mattia, Domenico; Principi, Nicola",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.11.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003924/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09018581; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09018581,272

628670,Impact on surgical wards in COVID-19 pandemic & safe surgery,2021-02-12,"Abstract This study was conducted to delineate potential sites of exit and duration of shedding of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Two experiments of 6 pigs each were conducted. Pigs were farrowed in isolation, weaned at 7 days of age, and housed in individual HEPA filtered isolation chambers. In each experiment, 3 pigs served as controls and 3 were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV (ATCC VR-2402) at 3 weeks of age. In a first experiment, on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post inoculation (PI), pigs were anesthetized and intubated. The following samples were collected: serum, saliva, conjunctival swabs, urine by cystocentesis, and feces. Upon recovery from anesthesia, the endotracheal tube was removed, rinsed, and the rinse retained. In the second experiment, the sampling schedule was expanded and serum, saliva, and oropharyngeal samples were collected from day 55 to day 124 PI at 14 day intervals. Virus was isolated in porcine alveolar macrophages up to day 14 from urine, day 21 from serum, day 35 from endotracheal tube rinse, day 42 from saliva, and day 84 from oropharyngeal samples. No virus was recovered from conjunctival swabs, fecal samples, or negative control samples. This is the first report of isolation of PRRSV from saliva. Virus-contaminated saliva, especially when considered in the context of social dominance behavior among pigs, may play an important role in PRRSV transmission. These results support previous reports of persistent infection with PRRSV prolonged recovery of virus from tonsils of swine.","Wills, Robert W.; Zimmerman, Jeff J.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Swenson, Sabrina L.; Hoffman, Lorraine J.; McGinley, Michael J.; Hill, Howard T.; Platt, Kenneth B.",Veterinary Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113597000795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9231982/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113597000795,272
628747,Delays in managing neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is one of the most frequently used medications worldwide. Yet, the main indications for ASA are the atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite the increasing number of percutaneous procedures to treat CAD, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains the treatment of choice in patients with multivessel CAD and intermediate or high anatomical lesion complexity. Taking into account that CABG is a potent activator of inflammation, ASA is an important part in the postoperative therapy, not only due to ASA antiplatelet action, but also as an anti-inflammatory agent. Additional benefits of ASA after CABG include anticancerogenic, hypotensive, antiproliferative, anti-osteoporotic, and neuroprotective effects, which are especially important in patients after CABG, prone to hypertension, graft occlusion, atherosclerosis progression, and cognitive impairment. Here, we discuss the pleiotropic effects of ASA after CABG and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the benefits of treatment with ASA, beyond platelet inhibition. Since some of ASA pleiotropic effects seem to increase the risk of bleeding, it could be considered a starting point to investigate whether the increase of the intensity of the treatment with ASA after CABG is beneficial for the CABG group of patients.","Siwik, Dominika; Gajewska, Magdalena; Karoń, Katarzyna; Pluta, Kinga; Wondołkowski, Mateusz; Wilimski, Radosław; Szarpak, Łukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J.; Gąsecka, Aleksandra",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073241/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112317,272

We evaluated the effectiveness of the inactivated whole-virus vaccine, CoronaVac, against symptomatic COVID-19 in the elderly population of Sao Paulo State, Brazil during widespread circulation of the P.1 variant. Methods We conducted a test-negative, case-control study of adults >=70 years of age from Sao Paulo State from January 17 to April 29, 2021, during which vaccination with a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac was implemented. We identified RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and controls who had a symptomatic illness with a negative RT-PCR test from national surveillance and state vaccination databases. Controls were pair-matched to cases by age category, sex, race, municipality, prior COVID-19 status, and date of RT-PCR testing. We estimated vaccine effectiveness, adjusted for age and comorbidities, using conditional logistic regression. Findings We selected 7,950 matched pairs with a mean age of 76 years from 26,433 COVID-19 cases and 17,622 test-negative controls. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 18.2% (95% CI, 0.0 to 33.2) and 41.6% (95% CI, 26.9 to 53.3) in the period 0-13 and >=14 days, respectively, after the 2nd dose. Administration of a single vaccine dose was not associated with reduced odds of COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness >=14 days after the 2nd dose declined with increasing age and was 61.8% (95% CI 34.8 to 77.7), 48.9% (95% CI 23.3 to 66.0) and 28.0% (95% CI 0.6 to 47.9) among individuals 70-74, 75-79 and >=80 years of age, respectively (p-interaction = 0.05). Interpretation CoronaVac was 42% effective in the real-world setting of extensive P.1 transmission, but significant protection was not observed until completion of the two-dose regimen. These findings underscore the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions when mass vaccination with CoronaVac is used as part of an epidemic response.

629930,Quality of care was not compromised during the COVID‐19 pandemic at a level‐1 trauma centre,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: Over 2 million people worldwide have been infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and monitor it, despite the fact that little is known about the ultrasound appearance due to the novelty of the illness. The aim of this manuscript is to characterise the lung ultrasonographic appearance of critically ill patients with SARS CoV-2 pneumonia with particular emphasis on its relationship with the time course of the illness and clinical parameters. METHODS: On the Intensive Care Unit of two academic hospitals, adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Images were analysed using internationally recognised techniques which included assessment of the pleural line, number of B-lines, pathology in the PLAPS (Postero Lateral Alveolar and Pleural Syndrome) point, BLUE-profiles (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency), and the lung ultrasound score (LUS). The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short (≤14 days) and long (>14 days) duration of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. RESULTS: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 76 examinations for analysis. 26% of patients had no anterior lung abnormalities, while the most prevalent pathological ultrasound findings present but subtle lung sliding (35%), thickening of the pleura (42%), ≥B-lines per view (38%) and present PLAPS (74%). Patients with “long” duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleura (21% (32) versus 9% (11)), C-profile (47% (18) versus 25% (8)) and pleural effusion (19% (14) versus 5% (3)), compared to patients with short duration of symptoms. Lung ultrasound findings did not correlate with P/F ratio, fluid balance or dynamic compliance. CONCLUSION: SARS CoV-2 results in significant, but not specific, ultrasound changes, with decreased lung sliding, thickening of the pleura and a B-profile being the most observed. With time, a thickened and irregular pleura, C-profile and pleural effusion become more common findings. When screening patients, a comprehensive ultrasound protocol might be necessary.","Haaksma, Mark E.; Heldeweg, Micah L.A.; Lopez Matta, Jorge E.; Smit, Jasper M.; van Trigt, Jessica D.; Nooitgedacht, Jip S.; Elzo Kraemer, Carlos V.; van de Wiel, Mark; Girbes, Armand R.J.; Heunks, Leo; van Westerloo, David J.; Tuinman, Pieter R.",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257915/; https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00238-2020,272

630619,Anxiety symptoms and preventive measures during the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan,2020-07-16,"CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses are necessary for the lysis of virally infected cells and control of infection. CTLs are activated when their TCRs bind a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I/peptide complex on the surface of antigen presenting cells such as macrophages (MΦ). It is now apparent that MΦ display remarkable plasticity in response to environmental signals to polarize into classically activated M(LPS + IFN-γ) or alternatively activated M(IL-4). However, little is known about how MΦ activation status influences their antigen presentation function to CD8(+) T cell in models of virus infection. Consequently, we tested how polarization of spleen-derived (Sp)-MΦ impacts direct presentation of viral antigens to influence effector and proliferative CD8(+) T-cell responses. We show that M(IL-4) Sp-MΦ retain MHC-I surface expression and the ability to stimulate IFN-γ production by CTL following peptide stimulation and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection to levels similar to M0 and M(LPS + IFN-γ) MΦ. However, memory CD8(+) T cells cultured in the presence of M(IL-4) MΦ underwent significantly reduced proliferation and produced similar IFN-γ levels as coculturing with M0 or M(LPS + IFN-γ) cells. Thus, these results show a novel ability of polarized MΦ to regulate CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and effector functions during virus infection.","Mulder, Rylend; Banete, Andra; Seaver, Kyle; Basta, Sameh",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250063/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01629,272

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data collected from the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CatSalut) in Catalonia, a region of Spain. PARTICIPANTS Using data collected between 1 March and 1 June 2020, we conducted the following comparative analyses: people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (328 892) vs Catalonia's entire population (7 699 568); COVID-19 cases who required hospitalisation (37 638) vs cases who did not require hospitalisation (291 254); and COVID-19 cases who died during the study period vs cases who did not die during the study period (12 287). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 (infection, hospitalisation, or death). We analysed sociodemographic and environment variables (such as residing in a nursing home) and the presence of previous comorbidities. RESULTS A total of 328 892 cases were considered to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.27% of total population). The main risk factors for the diagnostic were: female gender (risk ratio [RR] =1.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =1.48-1.50), age (45-64 years old; RR=1.02; 95% CI=1.01-1.03), high comorbidity burden (GMA index) (RR=3.03; 95% CI=2.97-3.09), reside in a nursing home (RR=11.82; 95% CI=11.66-11.99), and smoking (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.05-1.07). During the study period, there were 37 638 (11.4 %) hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and the risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.45; 95% CI=1.43-1.48), age > 65 (RR=2.38; 95% CI=2.28-2.48), very low individual income (RR=1.03; 95% CI=0.97-1.08), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.15; 95% CI=4.89-5.42). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were obesity (RR=1.23; 95% CI=1.20-1.25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.15-1.22), heart failure (RR=1.19; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.07; 95% CI=1.04-1.10), and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities (RR=1.06; 95% CI=1.03-1.10). A total of 12 287 deaths (3.73%) were attributed to COVID-19, and the main risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.73; 95% CI=1.67-1.81), age > 65 (RR=37.45; 95% CI=29.23-47.93), residing in a nursing home (RR=9.22; 95% CI=8.81-9.65), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.25; 95% CI=4.60-6.00). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were: heart failure (RR=1.21; 95% CI=1.16-1.22), chronic kidney disease (RR=1.17; 95% CI=1.13-1.22), and diabetes mellitus (RR=1.10; 95% CI=1.06-1.14). These results did not change significantly when we considered only PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Female gender, age between 45 to 64 years old, high burden of comorbidities, and factors related to environment (nursing home) play a relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. In addition, we found risk factors for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 that had not been described to date, including comorbidity burden, neuro-psychiatric disorders, and very low individual income. This study supports interventions for transmission control beyond stratify-and-shield strategies focused only on protecting those at risk of death.

631833,AGA Institute Rapid Recommendations for Gastrointestinal Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-01,"Background The outbreak of COVID 19in December 2019 spread quickly and overwhelmed the local healthcare system of the epicenter. A total of 346 medical assistance teams with 42,600 reserve medics were mobilized from around the country for emergency assistance. This study aims to examine the incidence of mental health symptoms and predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) symptoms among the reserve medics working in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province. Methods An anonymous survey was conducted from April 4–6, 2020 among the medics upon their returning home. A total of 225 surveys were returned with a response rate of 83%. The survey consisted of questionnaires about the medics' demographic information, social relations, mental health status (e.g. IES-R and DASS-21) and other work-related information. Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test and hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of PTSD symptoms. Results During the stay in Wuhan, the medics experienced high levels of depression (46.7%), anxiety (35.6%) and stress symptoms (16.0%). Upon returning home, the overall prevalence of clinically concerned PTSD symptoms was as high as 31.6%. Further analyses revealed that PTSD symptoms and its subscales were significantly associated with age, collegial relationship and mental health status during their service. Conclusion The reserve medics reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress as well as clinically concerned PTSD symptoms. Comprehensive screening and intervention programs should be in place to help reserve medics cope with mental health challenges and build resilience during the COVID 19 pandemic.","Li, Xueyuan; Li, Shijian; Xiang, Mi; Fang, Yue; Qian, Kun; Xu, Jiawei; Li, Jiahui; Zhang, Zhiruo; Wang, Bing",J Psychosom Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399920308321; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399920308321?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070044/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110270,272

To examine pharmacy student readiness, reception, and performance in a communications course amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. First-year pharmacy students (2020 cohort) enrolled in a professional communications course completed a pre- and post-course questionnaire indicating their readiness and changes in reception toward online learning during the pandemic. Student learning performance (midterm and final examination grades) at the end of the course was compared with that of a class which took the same course face-to-face on campus the previous year (2019 cohort). Results. Student preference for face-to-face instruction decreased (difference in means = -1.59; p <.05), while their comfort level for online learning increased (difference in means = +0.38, p <.05) by the end of the course. No appreciable changes in rapport development with the instructor were perceived by the end of the study compared to the beginning. Student learning performance for the online cohort did not differ significantly (p >.05) compared to that of the 2019 cohort. Conclusion. The study demonstrates that students were partly prepared for online learning with the remainder of their maturation to it occurring while the quarter progressed. Remote online learning did not seem to impact student learning (grades) in this communications course during the COVID-19 crisis. Looking past the pandemic, educators and leadership at pharmacy schools and colleges may reassuringly continue to sustain online instruction, where deemed necessary, in their didactic curricula.","Hussain, Alamdar; Chau, Jasen; Bang, Heejung; Meyer, Lee; Islam, Mohammed",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301566/,272
632281,Understanding COVID-19 in children may provide clues to protect at-risk populations,2020-05-14,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has spread to 210 countries and territories around the world and infected (confirmed) more than two million people. In India, the disease was first detected on 30 January 2020 in Kerala in a student who returned from Wuhan. The total (cumulative) number of confirmed infected people is 17615 till now across India (19 April 2020). Most of the research and newspaper articles focus on the number of infected people in entire India. However, given the size and diversity of India, it may be a good idea to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, along with the entire country. For example, currently, Maharashtra has more than 2500 confirmed cumulative infected cases, whereas West Bengal has less than 300 confirmed infected cases (16 April 2020). The approaches to address the pandemic in the two states must be different due to limited resources. In this article, we will focus the infected people in each state (restricting to only those states with enough data for prediction) and build three growth models to predict infected people for that state in the next 30 days. The impact of preventive measures on daily infected-rate is discussed for each state.","Ghosh, P.; Ghosh, R.; Chakraborty, B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20077792; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20077792v1?rss=1,272

Currently, the choice of one or another of these treatments mainly depends on the results of immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and of the status of EGFR and ALK. This new development has led to the setup of different analyses for clinical and molecular pathology laboratories, which have had to rapidly integrate a number of new challenges into daily practice and to establish new organization for decision making. This review outlines the impact of the management of biological samples in laboratories and discusses perspectives for pathologists within the framework of EGFR TKIs in early stage NSCLC.","Hofman, Paul",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440926/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10082157,272
632662,Patient Perception Regarding the Safety of Elective Joint Arthroplasty Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-06,"Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019, researchers have raced to understand its pathogenesis and begun devising vaccine and treatment strategies. An accurate understanding of the body’s temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31–60 days PSO. By 61–90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check™ to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1–4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5–7 days PSO. Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection.","Higgins, Renee L.; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Case, Jamie; Lee, Florence Y.; Chan, Clarence W.; Barrick, Bethany; Burger, Zoe C.; Yeo, Kiang-Teck J.; Marrinucci, Dena",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661960/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247797,272
632690,Elective Operation Scheduling during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-02-06,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus isolated for the first time in 1946. Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S protein of six PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have S proteins with a size similar to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have in the S protein 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses. Four of the residues changed (aa 219 of NEB72 isolate and as 92, 94, and 218 of TOY56) are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may be involved in the receptor binding site (RBS) conferring enteric tropism to TGEVs. A second RBS used by the virus to infect ST cells might be located in a conserved area between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor virus which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BR170, and the PRCVs, in this order. Least squares estimation of the origin of TGEV-related coronaviruses showed a significant constancy in the fixation of mutations with time, that is, the existence of a well-defined molecular clock. A mutation fixation rate of 7 ± 2 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site and per year was calculated for TGEV-related viruses. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses. Point mutations and probably recombination events have occurred during TGEV evolution.","Sánchez, Carlos M.; Gebauer, Fátima; Suñé, Carlos; Mendez, Ana; Dopazo, Joaquín; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229291195Z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1326823/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229291195Z,272
632717,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic resident education: a nationwide survey study in South Korea,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians to the mainstay of clinical workload and healthcare managements’ focus. There are approximately 900 anesthesiologists in Israel, working in non-private hospitals. This nationwide cross-sectional study evaluated the readiness and involvement of anesthesia departments in Israel in management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on anesthesiologists’ health, workload, and clinical practices were also evaluated. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to all of anesthesia department chairs in Israel on April 14th. Each response was identifiable on the hospital level only. Informed consent was waived since no patient data were collected. RESULTS: Response rate was 100%. A decrease of at least 40% in operating-room activity was reported by two-thirds of the departments. Anesthesiologists are leading the treatment of COVID-19 patients in 19/28 (68%) Israeli hospitals. Israel Society of Anesthesiologists’ recommendations regarding intubation of COVID-19 patients were strictly followed (intubations performed by the most experienced available physician, by rapid-sequence induction utilizing video-laryngoscopy, while minimizing the number of people in the room - about 90% compliance for each). Anesthesiologists in most departments use standard personal protective equipment when caring for COVID-19 patients, including N95 masks, face shields, and water-proof gowns. Only one anesthesiologist across Israel was diagnosed with COVID-19 (unknown source of transmission). All department chairs reported emerging opportunities that advance the anesthesia profession: implementation of new technologies and improvement in caregivers’ clinical capabilities (68% each), purchase of new equipment (96%), and increase in research activity (36%). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cross-sectional study had a complete response rate and therefore well-represents the anesthesia practice in Israel. We found that Israeli anesthesia departments are generally highly involved in the health system efforts to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Anesthesia and airway management are performed in a remarkably comparable manner and with proper protection of caregivers. Ambulatory anesthesia activity has dramatically decreased, but many departments find opportunities for improvement even in these challenging times.","Cohen, Barak; Baar, Yuval; Fein, Shai; Matot, Idit",BMC Anesthesiol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01173-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050885/,272

The identification of risk factors is important to allow more efficient public health and health services strategic interventions with a significant impact on deaths by COVID-19. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in Portugal. Methods: A national dataset with the first 20,293 patients infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 21 April 2020 was analyzed. The primary outcome measure was mortality by COVID-19, measured (registered and confirmed) by Medical Doctors serving as health delegates on the daily death registry. A logistic regression model using a generalized linear model was used for estimating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each potential risk indicator. Results: A total of 502 infected patients died of COVID-19. The risk factors for increased odds of death by COVID-19 were: sex (male: OR = 1.47, ref = female), age ((56–60) years, OR = 6.01; (61–65) years, OR = 10.5; (66–70) years, OR = 20.4; (71–75) years, OR = 34; (76–80) years, OR = 50.9; (81–85) years, OR = 70.7; (86–90) years, OR = 83.2; (91–95) years, OR = 91.8; (96–104) years, OR = 140.2, ref = (0–55)), Cardiac disease (OR = 2.86), Kidney disorder (OR = 2.95), and Neuromuscular disorder (OR = 1.58), while condition (None (absence of precondition); OR = 0.49) was associated with a reduced chance of dying after adjusting for other variables of interest.

Improved diagnosis and treatment of MIS-A might mitigate COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the descriptive epidemiology and clinical characteristics of MIS-A. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review identified patients with MIS-A using 3 strategies: (1) literature review from May 1, 2020, to May 25, 2021, by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CAB Abstracts, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Academic Search Complete, Scopus, World Health Organization Global COVID-19 Literature Database, and Google Scholar; (2) voluntary reports of MIS-A to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and (3) reports among persons aged 18 to 20 years in the CDC surveillance system for MIS in children. FINDINGS: Of 221 patients with MIS-A, the median age was 21 (interquartile range [IQR], 19-34) years, and 154 of 219 (70%) with data available were men. Sixty of 169 patients (36%) were non-Hispanic Black individuals, and 122 of 209 (58%) had no underlying comorbidity. One hundred two of 149 patients (68%) noted a previous symptomatic COVID-19–like illness (median, 28 [IQR, 20-36] days previously). Most patients with MIS-A presented with fever (197 of 205 [96%]), hypotension (133 of 220 [60%]), cardiac dysfunction (114 of 210 [54%]), shortness of breath (102 of 198 [52%]), and/or diarrhea (102 of 197 [52%]).

The agr;SIP molecule consisted of a single chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the α‐CH3 domain from human IgA. To express the full‐length IgA, the individual light and heavy chains from the TGEV‐specific mAb 6A.C3 were inserted into separate PVX constructs and plants were co‐infected with both constructs. Western blot analysis revealed the efficient expression of both the SIP and IgA molecules. Analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that both the plant‐expressed αSIP and IgA molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, indicating that active molecules were produced.

More specifically, the study investigated children’s depression and mothers’ individual distress and parenting stress, in comparison with normative samples. The mediating effect of mothers’ parenting stress on the relationship between mothers’ individual distress and children’s depression was also explored. Finally, the study analyzed whether children’s biological sex and age moderated the structural paths of the proposed model. A sample of 206 Italian mothers and their children completed an online survey. Mothers were administered self-report questionnaires investigating individual distress and parenting stress; children completed a standardized measure of depression. Mothers’ individual distress and parenting stress and children’s depression were higher than those recorded for the normative samples. Mothers’ parenting stress was found to mediate the association between mothers’ individual distress and children’s depression. With respect to children, neither biological sex nor age emerged as significant moderators of this association, highlighting that the proposed model was robust and invariant. During the current and future pandemics, public health services should support parents—and particularly mothers—in reducing individual distress and parenting stress, as these are associated with children’s depression.","Babore, Alessandra; Trumello, Carmen; Lombardi, Lucia; Candelori, Carla; Chirumbolo, Antonio; Cattelino, Elena; Baiocco, Roberto; Bramanti, Sonia Monique; Viceconti, Maria Luisa; Pignataro, Silvia; Morelli, Mara",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01230-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417927/,272

METHODS: We report antibody response to vaccination from 1140 patients without, and 493 patients with pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody. We used commercially available assays (Siemens) to test remainder plasma monthly in association with vaccination date and type, and assess prevalence of absent total receptor binding antibody, and absent or attenuated (index value < 10) semiquantitative receptor binding domain IgG index values. We used Poisson regression to evaluate risk factors for absent or attenuated response to vaccination. RESULTS: Among patients who were seronegative versus seropositive before vaccination, 62% and 56% were ≥65 years old, 20% and 24% were Hispanic, and 22% and 23% were Black. Median IgG index values rose steadily over time, and were higher among the seropositive than in the seronegative patients after completing vaccination (150 [25(th), 75(th) percentile 23.2, 150.0] versus 41.6 [11.3, 150.0]). Among 610 patients who completed vaccination (assessed ≥14 days later, median 29 days later), the prevalence of absent total RBD response, and absent and attenuated semiquantitative IgG response was 4.4% (95% CI 3.1, 6.4%), 3.4% (2.4, 5.2%), and 14.3% (11.7, 17.3%) respectively.

Many viruses exploit the odorant system and enter the CNS via the olfactory bulb (OB). Upon intranasal vesicular stomatitis virus instillation, we show an accumulation of activated microglia and monocytes in the OB. Depletion of microglia during encephalitis results in enhanced virus spread and increased lethality. Activation, proliferation, and accumulation of microglia are regulated by type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons and astrocytes, but not of microglia. Morphological analysis of myeloid cells shows that type I IFN receptor signaling of neurons has a stronger impact on the activation of myeloid cells than of astrocytes. Thus, in the infected CNS, the cross talk among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia is critical for full microglia activation and protection from lethal encephalitis.","Chhatbar, Chintan; Detje, Claudia N.; Grabski, Elena; Borst, Katharina; Spanier, Julia; Ghita, Luca; Elliott, David A.; Jordão, Marta Joana Costa; Mueller, Nora; Sutton, James; Prajeeth, Chittappen K.; Gudi, Viktoria; Klein, Michael A.; Prinz, Marco; Bradke, Frank; Stangel, Martin; Kalinke, Ulrich",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124718314189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282022/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718314189,272

In 2005, the program assumed its present form of providing free influenza vaccination to adults aged ≥65 years. After turning over the influenza vaccination for elderly adults to the private sectors in 2015, the influenza vaccination coverage rate among this population increased to >80%. In addition, after the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic crisis, the vaccine was domestically produced. By reaching a 75% vaccination coverage rate in the target groups, it was possible to put an end to the influenza pandemic and fix the shortcomings of the system that existed at that time. The influenza vaccination program, provided free of cost, was extended to include infants aged <12 months in 2016 and ≤59 months in 2017 in order to reduce the influenza burden in these populations. However, the vaccine effectiveness remains low despite the high vaccination rates in elderly adults. Therefore, several areas, such as the adoption of quadrivalent influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, and high-dose influenza vaccine and the expansion of vaccination target groups, still need to be addressed.","Yun, Jae-Won; Noh, Ji Yun; Song, Joon Young; Chun, Chaemin; Kim, Yunju; Cheong, Hee Jin",Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2017.49.4.247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299891/,272

This study aims to provide a systematic literature review on the health literacy awareness among the general population about SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on COVID-19 prevention. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature search on health literacy among public related to COVID-19. Relevant articles from PubMed and Cochrane databases were extracted and evaluated by applying appropriate key search terms to obtain the information published from January 2020 to April 2021. We included data based on observational and questionnaire-based studies and gathered information on participant's characteristics, health literacy and awareness, fear of COVID-19, and health-related behaviours. RESULTS: The most eligible studies were identified from the available literature (N = 39) searched through using appropriate key terms. The literature analysis showed that social media and interacting personally with a community of friends are the primary sources that spread pandemic information related COVID-19 pandemic and its severity. CONCLUSION: Globally, social media is a major platform for disseminating and promoting health literacy about COVID-19 among the general population. It is suggestable to bring a more robust approach for a larger population who have educational disparity for better prevention of this communicable disease. KEY MESSAGE: A rapid health awareness among the general public unaware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic is imperative and also to encourage COVID appropriate behaviors for better control of COVID-19.","Singh, Akhilesh Vikram; Balachandran, Parvathy",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab168.614,272

A thorough understanding of population-level predictors of such outcomes is crucial for devising better-targeted and more appropriate public health preparedness measures. While demographic, economic, and health-system capacity have featured prominently in recent work, cultural, and behavioral characteristics have largely been overlooked. However, cultural differences shape both the public policy response and individuals' behavioral responses to the crisis in ways that can impact infection dynamics and key health outcomes. To address this gap, we used meta-analytic methods to explore the global variability of three public health outcomes (i.e., crude test positivity, case/infection fatality, and mortality risk) during the first wave of the pandemic. This set of analyses identified several cultural/behavioral attributes (e.g., uncertainty avoidance and long-term vs. short-term normative orientation) as independent predictors of public health outcomes after adjusting for key demographic, political, economic, and health-system-related predictors; which were robust in sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that cultural attributes do in fact account for some of the global disparities in COVID-19-attributed health outcomes. As a consequence, policymakers should more explicitly consider a society's cultural attributes alongside other important parameters such as demographic characteristics and health system constraints in order to develop better tailored and more effective policy responses.","Erman, Aysegul; Medeiros, Mike",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833717/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.627669,272

The findings of their consultations with LGBT+ Canadians produced a report that at once captures the breadth of input received, and provides an opportunity for accountable state response to LGBT+ health needs in the form of research, education, policy, funding and programming, yet questions arise as to the socio-political approach that will ultimately be taken. This focus on the health of LGBT+ Canadians follows decades of grassroots and sometimes state-funded research on this very issue. This study undertook a critical content analysis, premised on the queer liberation theory of The Health of LGBTQIA2 Communities in Canada report issued by the Standing Committee on Health. Although the report, for the most part, covers a breadth of broad LGBT+ health issues (a noted shift from the predominance of HIV/AIDS), the depth to which the Standing Committee took up and absorbed such issues is far less apparent. The heavy emphasis on entry-level recommendations by which to take up important LGBT+ health issues undermines a more progressive, liberationist approach that would more effectively address these concerns.","Mulé, Nick J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036393/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197314,272

These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community.","Hanff, Thomas C; Harhay, Michael O; Brown, Tyler S; Cohen, Jordana B; Mohareb, Amir M",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215613/,272

COSMO enables chemogenetic manipulation of biological processes by caffeine and its metabolites, as well as caffeinated beverages, including coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. This CID tool, evolved from an anti‐caffeine nanobody via cell‐based high‐throughput screening, permits caffeine‐inducible gating of calcium channels, tumor killing via necroptosis, growth factors‐independent activation of tyrosine receptor kinase signaling, and enhancement of nanobody‐mediated antigen recognition for the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) spike protein. Further rationalized engineering of COSMO leads to 34–217‐fold enhancement in caffeine sensitivity (EC(50) = 16.9 nanomolar), which makes it among the most potent CID systems like the FK506 binding protein (FKBP)–FKBP rapamycin binding domain (FRB)–rapamycin complex. Furthermore, bivalent COSMO (biCOMSO) connected with a long linker favors intramolecular dimerization and acts as a versatile precision switch when inserted in host proteins to achieve tailored function. Given the modularity and high transferability of COMSO and biCOSMO, these chemical biology tools are anticipated to greatly accelerate the development of therapeutic cells and biologics that can be switched on and off by caffeinated beverages commonly consumed in the daily life.","Wang, Tianlu; He, Lian; Jing, Ji; Lan, Tien‐Hung; Hong, Tingting; Wang, Fen; Huang, Yun; Ma, Guolin; Zhou, Yubin",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552855/; https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202002148,272

Despite the evolution of global standards to protect health workers and ensure the delivery of health care in times of conflict, attacks against health systems have continued throughout the world—violating humanitarian law, undermining human rights, and threatening public health. The persistence of such violence against health care, especially in humanitarian crises related to armed conflict, has prompted global institutions to develop systematic monitoring mechanisms in an effort to alleviate these harms, seeking to protect health workers from being harmed for their healing efforts. This article examines the development and implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare (SSA) as a systematic mechanism to collect and disseminate data concerning attacks on health care systems. Although the SSA provides a foundation for monitoring attacks in conflict zones, this research considers whether the SSA has collected the necessary data, categorized these data appropriately, and disseminated sufficient information to facilitate human rights accountability, analyzing the political, methodological, and institutional challenges faced by WHO. The article concludes that refinements to this monitoring mechanism are needed to strengthen the political prioritization, research methodology, and institutional implementation necessary to ensure accountability for violations of health and human rights.","Meier, Benjamin Mason; Rice, Hannah; Bandara, Shashika",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194201/,272

Potential pathogens in the nasopharynx of hospitalised children with pneumonia have not been studied previously in DR Congo. Here we compare clinical characteristics, risk factors and nasopharyngeal occurrence of bacteria and viruses between children with severe and non-severe pneumonia. METHODS: Between June 2015 and June 2017, 116 children aged from 2 to 59 months hospitalised due to radiologically confirmed pneumonia at Panzi referral university hospital, Bukavu, Eastern DR Congo were included in the study and sampled from nasopharynx. A multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of 15 different viruses and 5 bacterial species was performed and another multiplex PCR assay was used for pneumococcal serotype/serogroup determination. RESULTS: During the study period 85 (73%) of the children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia met the WHO classification criteria of severe pneumonia and 31 (27%) had non-severe pneumonia. The fatality rate was 9.5%. Almost all (87%) children were treated with antibiotics before they were hospitalised, in most cases with amoxicillin (58%) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (20%). The frequency of potential pathogens in the nasopharynx of the children was high, and any viral or bacterial nucleic acids present at high levels, irrespective of species or type, were significantly associated with severe pneumonia as compared with non-severe cases (52% versus 29%, p = 0.032). White blood cell count > 20,000/μL and C-Reactive Protein > 75 mg/dL were associated with severe pneumonia at admission. Fatal outcome was in the multivariable analysis associated with having a congenital disease as an underlying condition. One or more pneumococcal serotypes/serogroups could be identified in 61 patients, and out of all identified serotypes 31/83 (37%) were non-PCV13 serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of any bacteria or any viruses at high levels was associated with severe pneumonia at admission. Children with congenital disorders might need a higher attention when having symptoms of acute respiratory infection, as developed pneumonia could lead to fatal outcome.","Birindwa, Archippe M.; Kasereka, Jerry K.; Gonzales-Siles, Lucia; Geravandi, Shadi; Mwilo, Mambo; Tudiakwile, Léonard K.; Mwinja, Néné L.; Muhigirwa, Balthazar; Kashosi, Théophile; Manegabe, Jeanière T.; Bugashane, Elie B.; Saili, Stay M.; Mungo, Clement; Nordén, Rickard; Andersson, Rune; Skovbjerg, Susann",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412597/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06570-1,272

The rising trends of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with multidrug-resistant pathogens from the environmental water have similarly gained much attention in recent years. Wastewater-based epidemiology from water samples has shown that a wide range of AMR-related genes is frequently detected. Albeit sewage is treated before release and thus, the abundance of pathogens should be significantly reduced or even pathogen-free, several studies indicated the contrary. Pathogens are still measurable in the released water, ultimately entering freshwaters, such as rivers and lakes. Furthermore, socio-economic and environmental factors, such as chemical industries and animal farming nearby, impact the presence of AMR. Many bacterial species from the environment are intrinsically resistant and also contribute to the resistome of freshwater lakes. This study collected the most extensive standardized freshwater data set from hundreds of European lakes and conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis on antimicrobial resistance from these freshwater lakes. Our research shows that genes encoding for AMR against tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and quinolones were commonly identified, while for some, such as sulfonamides, resistance was less frequently present. We provide an estimation of the characteristic resistance of AMR in European lakes, which can be used as a comprehensive resistome dataset to facilitate and monitor temporal changes in the development of AMR in European freshwater lakes.","Spänig, Sebastian; Eick, Lisa; Nuy, Julia K.; Beisser, Daniela; Ip, Margaret; Heider, Dominik; Boenigk, Jens",Environ Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106821; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021004463; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412021004463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403881/,272

Such a strategy should rely on disparate diagnostic tests to prevent a slowdown in testing due to lack of materials and reagents imposed by supply chain problems, which happened at the beginning of the pandemic. In this study, we have established a single-tube test based on RT-LAMP that enables the visual detection of less than 100 viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 min. We benchmarked the assay against the gold standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-PCR, using 177 nasopharyngeal RNA samples. For viral loads above 100 copies, the RT-LAMP assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96.1%. Additionally, we set up a RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples, albeit with lower sensitivity. The saliva was self-collected and the collection tube remained closed until inactivation, thereby ensuring the protection of the testing personnel. As expected, RNA extraction from saliva samples increased the sensitivity of the test. To lower the costs associated with RNA extraction, we performed this step using an alternative protocol that uses plasmid DNA extraction columns. We also produced the enzymes needed for the assay and established an in-house-made RT-LAMP test independent of specific distribution channels. Finally, we developed a new colorimetric method that allowed the detection of LAMP products by the visualization of an evident color shift, regardless of the reaction pH.","Amaral, Catarina; Antunes, Wilson; Moe, Elin; Duarte, Américo G.; Lima, Luís M.

644785,Trends in utilisation of hypnotics among Scandinavian young people.,2021-08-01,"Early host-pathogen interactions drive the host response and shape the outcome of natural infections caused by intracellular microorganisms. These interactions involve a number of immune and non-immune cells and tissues, along with an assortment of host and pathogen-derived molecules. Our current knowledge has been predominantly derived from research on the relationships between the pathogens and the invaded host cell(s), limiting our understanding of how microbes elicit and modulate immunological responses at the organismal level. In this study, we explored the early host determinants of healing and non-healing responses in human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis. We performed a comparative transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors (PBMCs, n=3) exposed to promastigotes isolated from patients with chronic (CHR, n=3) or self-healing (SH, n=3) CL, and compared these to human macrophage responses. Transcriptomes of L. V. panamensis-infected PBMCs showed enrichment of functional gene categories derived from innate as well as adaptive immune cells signatures, demonstrating that Leishmania modulates adaptive immune cell functions as early as after 24h post interaction with PBMCs from previously unexposed healthy individuals. Among differentially expressed PBMC genes, four broad categories were commonly modulated by SH and CHR strains: cell cycle/proliferation/differentiation, metabolism of macromolecules, immune signaling and vesicle trafficking/transport; the first two were predominantly downregulated, and the latter upregulated in SH and CHR as compared to uninfected samples. Type I IFN signaling genes were uniquely up-regulated in PBMCs infected with CHR strains, while genes involved in the immunological synapse were uniquely downregulated in SH infections. Similarly, pro-inflammatory response genes were upregulated in isolated macrophages infected with CHR strains. Our data demonstrate that early responses during Leishmania infection extend beyond innate cell and/or phagocytic host cell functions, opening new frontiers in our understanding of the triggers and drivers of human CL.","Gomez, Maria Adelaida; Belew, Ashton Trey; Navas, Adriana; Rosales-Chilama, Mariana; Murillo, Julieth; Dillon, Laura A.

However, it is unclear to what extent SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and other causative viruses have been prevailed since the preventative measures were implemented. In this study, we conducted multiples PCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR using nasal swabs from 191 patients with cold-like symptoms in Japan to reveal the causative viruses. As a result, at least one virus were detected in 40 out of 191 (21%) patients. Of these, we frequently identified the human rhinovirus / enterovirus (5.8%, n=11), SARS-CoV-2 (4.2%, n=8) and human metapneumovirus (3.7%, n=7). On the other hand, no influenza virus was detected. These results shows the prevalence of causative viruses after the social preventative measures and implies the difference of infectivity between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.","Hirotsu, Y.; Maejima, M.; Kakizaki, Y.; Miyashita, Y.; Mochizuki, H.; Omata, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.20105106; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.21.20105106v1?rss=1,272

We aimed to describe the changes in liver care before and after COVID‐19 restricted access to health care. We obtained data on the number of liver clinic visits, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging using electronic query or clinic registry at three medical centers in the United States, Japan, and Singapore for the following periods: February 1 to March 14, 2018, 2019, and 2020; and March 15 to May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We performed trend analysis using logistic regression. In total, 14,403 visits were made to the liver clinics at the three centers: 5,900 in 2018, 5,270 in 2019, and 3,233 in 2020. Overall, there were no significant changes in the distribution of males and females between February 1 and May 1 from 2018 to 2020, but there was a lower proportion of seniors ages 65 years and older (P < 0.001). There were significant decreasing trends in the total number of liver clinic visits overall (p‐trend = 0.038) and in the subanalysis for chronic hepatitis B, C, and other liver diseases. HCC/cirrhosis visits also dropped from 883 to 538 (39.07% decrease) overall and 665 to 355 (46.62% decrease) for the US site. In addition, there was a significant decreasing trend in the number of abdominal ultrasounds (P‐trend = 0.004) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (P‐trend = 0.007) performed overall.

646018,The marked body – a qualitative study on survivors embodied experiences of a COVID‐19 illness trajectory,2021-03-18,"Abstract Objective: The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of ""COVID+ units"". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300737?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370982/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300737,272
646077,Retraction: Noninvasive versus invasive ventilation: one modality cannot fit all during COVID-19 outbreak,2020-09-14,"This study explored how Covid-19 lockdown restrictions affected people’s daily smoking routines and behaviours, including adherence and modifications to pre-established smoking restrictions in the home. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with smokers and non-smokers from smoking households 19 to 27 weeks after the first full UK lockdown ended in May 2020. A non-probability purposive sample representing 25 adults aged 21 or over living in households with at least 1 smoker were recruited to the study. A quota sampling strategy was used, according to age, gender, smoking status, family status, household composition, householder access to outdoor space, and change to work-life status. Most participants found lockdown increased the amount of time spent at home, where stresses associated with confinement, curtailment of social routines, removal of barriers and distractions to smoking due to home working, and feelings of boredom all contributed to increased smoking. Fewer factors were identified as reducing smoking during lockdown. Prominent examples included disruption to habitual smoking patterns and distraction from smoking associated with spending more time doing outdoor activities. Pressures placed on physical space and lack of privacy due to the confinement at home were responsible for displacement of smoking within the home, leading to breaking of smoke-free rules and family tensions, and in some cases to greater awareness amongst parents that their children smoked. Changes in daily routines associated with lockdown affected and displaced smoking behaviour both positively and negatively. Health improvement interventions could seek to harness positive changes in smoking associated with any future lockdown approaches. New home-working norms highlight the need for employers to support staff to reduce their smoking and to remain smoke-free.","O’Donnell, Rachel; Eadie, Douglas; Stead, Martine; Dobson, Ruaraidh; Semple, Sean",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071475/,272
646598,Patient and Provider‐Reported Satisfaction of Cancer Rehabilitation Telemedicine Visits During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the leading causes of hospitalization in children. Understanding the local dominant viral etiologies is important to inform infection control practices and clinical management. This study aimed to investigate the viral etiology and epidemiology of respiratory infections among pediatric inpatients in Macao. METHODS: A retrospective study using electronic health records between 2014 and 2017 at Kiang Wu Hospital was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from hospitalized children aged 13 years or younger with respiratory tract diseases. xMAP multiplex assays were employed to detect respiratory agents including 10 respiratory viruses. Data were analyzed to describe the frequency and seasonality. RESULTS: Of the 4880 children enrolled in the study, 3767 (77.1%) were positive for at least one of the 13 viral pathogens tested, of which 2707 (55.5%) being male and 2635 (70.0%) under 2 years old. Among the positive results, there were 3091 (82.0%) single infections and 676 (18.0%) multiple infections. The predominant viruses included human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV 27.4%), adenovirus (ADV, 15.8%), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSVB, 7.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA, 7.8%). The detection of viral infection was the most prevalent in autumn (960/1176, 81.6%), followed by spring (1095/1406, 77.9%), winter (768/992, 77.4%), and summer (944/1306, 72.3%), with HRV/EV and ADV being most commonly detected throughout the 4 years of study period. The detection rate of viral infection was highest among ARI patients presented with croup (123/141, 87.2%), followed by lower respiratory tract infection (1924/2356, 81.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1720/2383, 72.2%). FluA, FluB and ADV were positive factors for upper respiratory tract infections. On the other hand, infection with RSVA, RSVB, PIV3, PIV4, HMPV, and EV/RHV were positively associated with lower respiratory tract infections; and PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3 were positively associated with croup. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in Macao to determine the viral etiology and epidemiology of pediatric patients hospitalized for ARIs. The study findings can contribute to the awareness of pathogen, appropriate preventative measure, accurate diagnosis, and proper clinical management of respiratory viral infections among children in Macao.","Lei, Cheng; Yang, Lisong; Lou, Cheong Tat; Yang, Fan; SiTou, Kin Ian; Hu, Hao; Io, King; Cheok, Kun Tat; Pan, Baoquan; Ung, Carolina Oi Lam",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771128/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05996-x,272

As a threat, it carries a potential for societal disruption—but that potential is not fully understood. An accumulation of these creeping crises can erode public trust in institutions.

We aimed to investigate the perspectives of rheumatology patients on the use of telephone consultations compared with the traditional face-to-face consultation. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective survey of all rheumatology follow-up patients at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust who had received a telephone consultation from a rheumatology consultant during a 4-week period via an online survey tool. RESULTS: Surveys were distributed to 1213 patients, of whom 336 (27.7%) responded, and 306 (91.1%) patients completed all components of the survey. Overall, an equal number of patients would prefer telephone clinics or face-to-face consultations for their next routine appointment. When divided by age group, the majority who preferred the telephone clinics were <50 years old [χ(2) (d.f. = 3) = 10.075, P = 0.018]. Prevalence of a smartphone was higher among younger patients (<50 years old: 46 of 47, 97.9%) than among older patients (≥50 years old: 209 of 259, 80.7%) [χ(2) (d.f. = 3) = 20.919, P < 0.001]. More patients reported that they would prefer a telephone call for urgent advice (168, 54.9%). CONCLUSION: Most patients interviewed were happy with their routine face-to-face appointment being switched to a telephone consultation. Of those interviewed, patients >50 years old were less likely than their younger counterparts to want telephone consultations in place of face-to-face appointments. Most patients in our study would prefer a telephone consultation for urgent advice. We must ensure that older patients and those in vulnerable groups who value in-person contact are not excluded.

647287,Sri Petaling COVID-19 cluster in Malaysia: challenges and the mitigation strategies,2020-11-10,"Understanding the trends in causes of death for different diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic is important to determine whether there are excess deaths beyond what is normally expected. Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year. To determine if trends were similar, suggesting underreporting/underdiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths, we also looked at the trends in % differences for cardiovascular disease deaths. From the first 17 weeks' of data, we found a peak in excess deaths between weeks 14 of 2020, about four weeks after the first case in Scotland was detected on 1 March 2020-- but by week 17 these excesses had diminished around the time lockdown in the UK began. Similar observations were seen for cardiovascular disease-related deaths. These observations suggest that the short-term increase in excess cancer and cardiovascular deaths might be associated with undetected/unconfirmed deaths related to COVID-19. Both of these conditions make patients more susceptible to infection and lack of widespread access to testing for COVID-19 are likely to have resulted in under-estimation of COVID-19 mortality. These data further suggest that the cumulative toll of COVID-19 on mortality is likely undercounted. More detailed analysis is needed to determine if these excesses were directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Disease specific mortality will need constant monitoring for the foreseeable future as changes occur in increasing capacity and access to testing, reporting criteria, changes to health services and different measures are implemented to control the spread of the COVID-19. Multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, national and international collaborations for complementary and population specific data analysis is required to respond and mitigate adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to inform planning for future pandemics.","Figueroa, Jonine; Brennan, Paul; Theodoratou, Evropi; Poon, Michael; Purshouse, Karin; Din, Farhat; Jin, Kai; Mesa-Eguiagaray, Ines; Dunlop, Malcolm G; Hall, Peter S; Cameron, David; Wild, Sarah; Sudlow, Cathie LM",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.20086231v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20086231,272
647485,Why Children are Less Likely to Contract COVID-19 Infection than Adults?,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Use of patient portals has been associated with positive outcomes in patient engagement and satisfaction. Portal studies have also connected portal use, as well as the nature of users’ interactions with portals, and the contents of their generated data to meaningful cost and quality outcomes. Incentive programs in the United States have encouraged uptake of health information technology, including patient portals, by setting standards for meaningful use of such technology. However, despite widespread interest in patient portal use and adoption, studies on patient portals differ in actual metrics used to operationalize and track utilization, leading to unsystematic and incommensurable characterizations of use. No known review has systematically assessed the measurements used to investigate patient portal utilization. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to apply systematic review criteria to identify and compare methods for quantifying and reporting patient portal use. METHODS: Original studies with quantifiable metrics of portal use published in English between 2014 and the search date of October 17, 2018, were obtained from PubMed using the Medical Subject Heading term “Patient Portals” and related keyword searches. The first search round included full text review of all results to confirm a priori data charting elements of interest and suggest additional categories inductively; this round was supplemented by the retrieval of works cited in systematic reviews (based on title screening of all citations). An additional search round included broader keywords identified during the full-text review of the first round. Second round results were screened at abstract level for inclusion and confirmed by at least two raters. Included studies were analyzed for metrics related to basic use/adoption, frequency of use, duration metrics, intensity of use, and stratification of users into “super user” or high utilizers. Additional categories related to provider (including care team/administrative) use of the portal were identified inductively. Additional analyses included metrics aligned with meaningful use stage 2 (MU-2) categories employed by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the association between the number of portal metrics examined and the number of citations and the journal impact factor. RESULTS: Of 315 distinct search results, 87 met the inclusion criteria. Of the a priori metrics, plus provider use, most studies included either three (26 studies, 30%) or four (23 studies, 26%) metrics. Nine studies (10%) only reported the patient use/adoption metric and only one study (1%) reported all six metrics. Of the US-based studies (n=76), 18 (24%) were explicitly motivated by MU-2 compliance; 40 studies (53%) at least mentioned these incentives, but only 6 studies (8%) presented metrics from which compliance rates could be inferred. Finally, the number of metrics examined was not associated with either the number of citations or the publishing journal’s impact factor. CONCLUSIONS: Portal utilization measures in the research literature can fall below established standards for “meaningful” or they can substantively exceed those standards in the type and number of utilization properties measured. Understanding how patient portal use has been defined and operationalized may encourage more consistent, well-defined, and perhaps more meaningful standards for utilization, informing future portal development.","Beal, Lauren L; Kolman, Jacob M; Jones, Stephen L; Khleif, Aroub; Menser, Terri",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/23493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629962/,272

Although there is no report confirming that people can become infected with viruses by cash circulation, relevant research on the survival of viruses on solid surfaces supports this hypothesis.

648474,COVID-19 pandemic and hip fractures: impact and lessons learned,2020-09-04,"OBJECTIVES: The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is now established, occurring at a time of winter pressure on acute care in the NHS. This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March–July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. RESULTS: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 h, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.

We introduce two new disposable box-like head-and-face shields constructed using Japanese origami-style folding. The design comprises a single sheet of thick paper and a shield made of a thin, transparent plastic sheet. The first design, Model 1, is a head-and-face shield designed to cover the wearer’s head and neck. Model 2 was designed to solve the problem of heat and moisture buildup inside the shield. This version can be used as face shields for patients, and it allows clinicians to collect swabs from the nasopharynx for virus detection via polymerase chain reaction through pre-cut incisions near the nasal orifices. These two new box-like face shields are excellent alternatives to traditional face shields because of the low cost, compatibility with mass production, lightweight, and disposability.","Tago, Masaki; Anzai, Keizo; Sakamoto, Yuichiro; Hamada, Yohei; Ishikawa, Shinichiro; Kimura, Shinya; Yamashita, Shu-ichi",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s292091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408504/,272

The aim of this study was to translate the diabetes quality of life (DQOL) scale into Afaan Oromoo and to culturally adapt and evaluate the psychometric properties of the DQOL-Afaan Oromoo (DQOL-AO) among people living with T2D in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling technique was conducted in 2020. The DQOL was translated and adapted to Afaan Oromoo. Item–total correlations and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assessed factor structure; the Cronbach’s alpha assessed internal consistency and relationships with gender, educational status, marital status, age, and employment status; and status of diabetes-related disease assessed the construct validity of the DQOL-AO. Results: 417 participants responded to all items of the DQOL. Item–total correlation analysis and EFA produced a 34-item DQOL-AO with four subscales, which demonstrated that the internal consistency of the overall DQOL-AO was 0.867, and scores were 0.827, 0.846, 0.654, and 0.727 for the impact, satisfaction, social/vocational worry, and diabetes-related worry subscales, respectively. Statistically significant differences between QOL were obtained in educational status (F = 7.164, p < 0.001) and employment status (F = 4.21, p = 0.002). Individuals who attended college and above and government employees had better QOL. Conclusion: The 34-item DQOL-AO provided preliminary evidence as a reliable and valid tool to measure diabetic-related QOL before it can be widely used among adults living with T2D who speak Afaan Oromoo.","Diriba, Dereje Chala; Leung, Doris Y.

Proper knowledge of this disease can influence the positive attitude, good practices and enhance their safety. We aim to study the knowledge of COVID-19 among health care workers of the tertiary care hospital of Nepal. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers of Shahid Gangalal National Heart Centre from May 20 to June 19, 2020. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Board (IRB No: 4-2020). Written informed consent was taken from all respondents. Correct answers were summated to reflect the mean knowledge, expressed as a percentage. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21. RESULTS: The mean general knowledge score was 95.7%. The mean medical knowledge score was 70.5%. Only 42 (56.8%) of physicians and 103 (53.6%) of nurses had a higher level of medical knowledge regarding COVID-19. Likewise, very few lab technicians 7 (21.9%) and none of the pharmacists had a higher level of medical knowledge.

The postnatal period is a critical time for women to develop maternal self-efficacy. Mobile health interventions may offer a way to reach women during this critical period to offer support and information. Essential Coaching for Every Mother is a text message program that seeks to educate and support women during the first 6 weeks postpartum. OBJECTIVE: The primary effectiveness objective is to compare the effectiveness of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program on maternal psychosocial outcomes (self-efficacy, social support, postpartum depression, and postpartum anxiety) immediately after the intervention and 6 months postpartum, collectively as well as stratified by parity. The primary implementation objective is to evaluate the implementation extent and quality of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program. METHODS: This will be a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial. A total of 140 mothers-to-be or new mothers from Nova Scotia will be recruited and randomized to the intervention or control arm, stratified by parity. The intervention arm will receive the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program, which consists of 53 messages sent twice a day for the first 2 weeks and daily for weeks 3 through 6. The control group will receive usual care. Messages are personalized based on the infant’s age and the woman’s self-selected preference for breastfeeding or formula feeding and tailored with the infant’s name and gender. Women can enroll in the program if they are ≥37 weeks pregnant or within 10 days postpartum, with the first message designed to be sent on the second evening after birth. The actual number of messages received will vary based on the timing of enrollment and the infant’s date of birth. Participants will complete questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, social support, and postpartum depression and anxiety at baseline (enrollment after birth) and 6 weeks (postintervention) and 6 months postpartum. Implementation data will be collected throughout the trial, and evaluation feedback will be collected at 6 weeks from women who received the intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment for this study started on January 5, 2021, and is currently ongoing, with an anticipated date of recruitment completion of January 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will assess the effectiveness of a postpartum text message program to improve maternal self-efficacy and social support while decreasing postpartum depression and anxiety. It will also shed light on the implementation effectiveness of the program.

650820,Preventive Practices of Ophthalmologists During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-23,"In the present article we present an update on the role of chemoprevention and other pharmacological activities reported on kurarinone, a natural flavanone (from 1970 to 2021). To the best of our knowledge this is the first and exhaustive review of kurarinone. The literature was obtained from different search engine platforms including PubMed. Kurarinone possesses anticancer potential against cervical, lung (non-small and small), hepatic, esophageal, breast, gastric, cervical, and prostate cancer cells. In vivo anticancer potential of kurarinone has been extensively studied in lungs (non-small and small) using experimental xenograft models. In in vitro anticancer studies, kurarinone showed IC(50) in the range of 2–62 µM while in vivo efficacy was studied in the range of 20–500 mg/kg body weight of the experimental organism. The phytochemical showed higher selectivity toward cancer cells in comparison to respective normal cells. kurarinone inhibits cell cycle progression in G2/M and Sub-G1 phase in a cancer-specific context. It induces apoptosis in cancer cells by modulating molecular players involved in apoptosis/anti-apoptotic processes such as NF-κB, caspase 3/8/9/12, Bcl2, Bcl-XL, etc. The phytochemical inhibits metastasis in cancer cells by modulating the protein expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9. It produces a cytostatic effect by modulating p21, p27, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin A proteins in cancer cells. Kurarinone possesses stress-mediated anticancer activity and modulates STAT3 and Akt pathways. Besides, the literature showed that kurarinone possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-drug resistance, anti-microbial (fungal, yeast, bacteria, and Coronavirus), channel and transporter modulation, neuroprotection, and estrogenic activities as well as tyrosinase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase/glucosidase/aldose reductase/human carboxylesterases 2 inhibitory potential. Kurarinone also showed therapeutic potential in the clinical study. Further, we also discussed the isolation, bioavailability, metabolism, and toxicity of Kurarinone in experimental models.","Kumar, Shashank; Prajapati, Kumari Sunita; Shuaib, Mohd; Kushwaha, Prem Prakash; Tuli, Hardeep Singh; Singh, Atul Kumar",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.737137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646138/,272

In order to improve access to care, augmenting the rheumatology workforce is required. Herein we discuss potential solutions to the anticipated workforce shortage, including 1) expanding the training of rheumatology physicians; 2) increasing nurse practitioner, physician assistant and pharmacist utilization in rheumatology practice; 3) growing the use of telemedicine; and 4) reducing burnout in order to retain practicing rheumatologists.

This measurement is based on the k-means clustering method and identifies proper samples for calculating the mean outbreak size and the outbreak probability. Then we systematically study the impact of different temporal correlations on high risk outbreaks over the original and differently shuffled counterparts of each network. We observe that, on the one hand, in the coinfection process, randomization of the sequence of the events increases the mean outbreak size of high-risk cases. On the other hand, these correlations do not have a consistent effect on the independent infection dynamics, and can either decrease or increase this mean. Randomization of the daily pattern correlations has no strong impact on the size of the outbreak in either the coinfection or the independent spreading cases. We also observe that an increase in the mean outbreak size does not always coincide with an increase in the outbreak probability; therefore, we argue that merely considering the mean outbreak size of all realizations may lead us into falsely estimating the outbreak risks. Our results suggest that some sort of contact randomization in the organizational level in schools, events or hospitals might help to suppress the spreading dynamics while the risk of an outbreak is high.","Sajjadi, Sina; Ejtehadi, Mohammad Reza; Ghanbarnejad, Fakhteh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34283838/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01268v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253563,272

This localized IgA response is more effective at reducing pathogen load on the mucosal surface of a potential host. One prerequisite for a successful nasal vaccination is the need to understand the distribution pattern of the nebulized vaccine, which requires an understanding the volume of the nares as well as the mucosal surface area. The exact mucosal surface area of ruminant nares has not yet been investigated. The aim of this concept study is to provide a detailed breakdown of a new method of volumetric rendering that can be used to calculate the volume and mucosal surface area of ruminant nares from computed tomographic images. The program Seg 3D was used to perform semi-automatic segmentation of a CT scan of a 9-month-old lamb head. Threshold segmentation and manual segmentation were used in combination to select the lamb's nasal cavity. The segmentation process yielded a volumetric rendering that was used to calculate the surface area and volume of the lamb's nasal cavity, with the segmentation process was repeated for each individual side of the lamb's nares. The surface area of the mucosal surface of each nostril is approximately 448 cm(2), and the volume is approximately 45 cm(3). The methodology described in this study successfully calculated the volume and surface area of a lamb's nares using volumetric rendering.","Teeling, K.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia can compromise bacterial clearance processes, due to oxidative stress-mediated impairment of macrophages, contributing to the increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections. This study reports that the activation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) with the delete allosteric agonistic-positive allosteric modulator, GAT107, decreases the bacterial burden in mouse lungs by improving hyperoxia-induced lung redox imbalance. The incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with GAT107 (3.3 µM) rescues hyperoxia-compromised phagocytic functions in cultured macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells, and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly, GAT107 (3.3 µM) also attenuated oxidative stress in hyperoxia-exposed macrophages, which prevents oxidation and hyper-polymerization of phagosome filamentous actin (F-actin) from oxidation. Furthermore, GAT107 (3.3 µM) increases the (1) activity of superoxide dismutase 1; (2) activation of Nrf2 and (3) the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in macrophages exposed to hyperoxia. Overall, these data suggest that the novel α7nAChR compound, GAT107, could be used to improve host defense functions in patients, such as those with COVID-19, who are exposed to prolonged periods of hyperoxia.","Gauthier, Alex G.; Wu, Jiaqi; Lin, Mosi; Sitapara, Ravikumar; Kulkarni, Abhijit; Thakur, Ganesh A.; Schmidt, Edward E.; Perron, Jeanette C.; Ashby, Charles R.; Mantell, Lin L.",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10010135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477969/,272

Data extraction included methods, characteristics of the sample, and the main results. A quality assessment was conducted. Two reviewers performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. In sum, eight studies were included in the final synthesis. Some cross-sectional and longitudinal studies point to an association between multimorbidity and increased levels of loneliness. However, the associations between multimorbidity and social isolation as well as social frailty remain largely underexplored. The quality of the studies included was rather high.

We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with S(G614) infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with S(D614). This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, S(G614) did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than S(D614), and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show S(G614) is more stable than S(D614), consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with S(G614) transmit more efficiently.","Zhang, Lizhou; Jackson, Cody B; Mou, Huihui; Ojha, Amrita; Rangarajan, Erumbi S; Izard, Tina; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587973/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.148726,272

654727,The short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgeons: a cross-sectional global study,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-(COVID-19) is an infectious pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and spike protein are crucial for viral replication and transmission. Spike protein recognizes the human ACE2 receptor and transmits SARS-CoV-2 into the human body. Thus, M(pro), spike protein, and ACE2 receptor act as appropriate targets for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Spices are traditionally known to have anti-viral and immune-boosting activities. Therefore, we investigated the possible use of selected spice bioactives against the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational analysis. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to analyze the binding efficiency of spice bioactives against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins along with the standard drugs. Drug-likeness properties of selected spice bioactives were investigated using Lipinski's rule of five and the SWISSADME database. Pharmacological properties such as ADME/T, biological functions, and toxicity were analyzed using ADMETlab, PASS-prediction, and ProTox-II servers, respectively. RESULTS: Out of forty-six spice bioactives screened, six bioactives have shown relatively better binding energies than the standard drugs and have a higher affinity with at least more than two targets of SARS-CoV-2. The selected bioactives were analyzed for their binding similarities with the standard drug, remdesivir, towards the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Selected spice bioactives have shown potential drug-likeness properties, with higher GI absorption rate, lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological roles. CONCLUSIONS: Spice bioactives have the potential to bind with the specific targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Therefore, spice-based nutraceuticals can be developed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Natesh, Jagadish; Mondal, Priya; Penta, Dhanamjai; Abdul Salam, Abdul Ajees; Meeran, Syed Musthapa",Comput Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190011/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482520304339?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104102; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482520304339,272

A Sankey diagram and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data and illustrate the relationships between the interventions. RESULTS: Of 8198 identified records, 119 papers were eligible. One hundred and four of them (87.4%) were conducted between 2000 and 2020, mainly in the USA (SLE n=24 (21.2%), SSc n=16 (14.2%)), Brazil (SLE n=8 (7.1%), SSc n=5 (4.4%)) and Italy (SLE n=0 (0%), SSc n=12 (10.6%)). Fifty-two studies (SLE n=24 (21.2%), SSc n=28 (24.8%)) used multicomponent interventions. The single interventions were physical exercises (SLE n=16 (14.2%), SSc n=17 (15.0%)), coaching/counselling (SLE n=11 (18.0%), SSc n=0 (0%)) and education (SLE n=2 (1.8%), SSc n=3 (2.7%)). Primary outcomes focused on physical function (SLE n=1 (0.9%), SSc n=15 (13.3%)), mouth opening in SSc (n=4 (5.9%)) and physical capacity (SLE n=2 (1.8%), SSc n=1 (0.9%)). No interventions for mixed connective tissue disease were found. CONCLUSION: There was a great variety in the intervention’s content due to differences in body structure, activity limitations and participation restrictions in SLE and SSc. These results highlight the need for personalised, multicomponent, non-pharmacological interventions, which could be delivered as e-health interventions.","Ritschl, Valentin; Ferreira, Ricardo J O; Santos, Eduardo José Ferreira; Fernandes, Rúben; Juutila, Essi; Mosor, Erika; Santos-Costa, Paulo; Fligelstone, Kim; Schraven, Linda; Stummvoll, Georg; Salvador, Maria; Poole, Janet L; van den Ende, Cornelia; Boström, Carina; Stamm, Tanja A",RMD Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326205/; https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2021-001710,272
654914,A national study of self-reported COVID symptoms during the first viral wave in Canada,2020-10-05,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the rising popularity of standing motorized scooters in major cities in the United States, many hospitals are experiencing a surge of traumatic injuries associated with this new mode of transportation. The impact and characteristics of injuries associated with standing motorized scooters are evolving, and safety regulations for the riders are poorly defined. There is a need for a review for healthcare providers and policy makers on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Since its market introduction of rentable standing motorized scooters in late 2017, there has been an exponential rise in emergency department visits and hospitalization due to scooter-related trauma in urban hospitals. There have been a number of independent hospital-based and national-level studies describing demographics and trends of injury patterns in the last 2 years. SUMMARY: Patients presenting to the hospital with injuries tend to be young male between 20 and 40 years of age, presenting at night. Head and extremity injuries are common, and patients often do not comply with helmets and other protective gears. Intoxication is a major risk factor for injuries requiring hospital admission and surgical interventions. These findings increase awareness for (1) healthcare providers to recognize and triage high-energy injuries, and (2) policy makers to advocate universal helmet use, increase public safety education, and enforce road safety regulations to minimize the impact of these injuries.","Kim, Woon Cho; Campbell, Andre R.",Curr Surg Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717660/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40137-021-00283-9,272
655646,Identification of bronchiolitis profiles in Italian children through the application of latent class analysis,2020-10-07,"Manual diagnosis of skin cancer is time-consuming and expensive; therefore, it is essential to develop automated diagnostics methods with the ability to classify multiclass skin lesions with greater accuracy. We propose a fully automated approach for multiclass skin lesion segmentation and classification by using the most discriminant deep features. First, the input images are initially enhanced using local color-controlled histogram intensity values (LCcHIV). Next, saliency is estimated using a novel Deep Saliency Segmentation method, which uses a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) of ten layers. The generated heat map is converted into a binary image using a thresholding function. Next, the segmented color lesion images are used for feature extraction by a deep pre-trained CNN model. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we implement an improved moth flame optimization (IMFO) algorithm to select the most discriminant features. The resultant features are fused using a multiset maximum correlation analysis (MMCA) and classified using the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) classifier. The segmentation performance of the proposed methodology is analyzed on ISBI 2016, ISBI 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets, achieving an accuracy of 95.38%, 95.79%, 92.69%, and 98.70%, respectively. The classification performance is evaluated on the HAM10000 dataset and achieved an accuracy of 90.67%. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we present a comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques.","Khan, Muhammad Attique; Sharif, Muhammad; Akram, Tallha; Damaševičius, Robertas; Maskeliūnas, Rytis",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947117/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11050811,272
655864,Characterizing all-cause excess mortality patterns during COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND: During the current pandemic situation, the public health care system must ensure the ongoing provision of regular medical care as well as the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. Resident oncologists and their practices are equally affected. OBJECTIVES: The study examines resident oncologists’ challenges, experiences and approaches in the delivery of care for oncological patients receiving palliative treatment and their relatives during the pandemic. Findings will support future pandemic preparedness for cancer treatment in outpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Content analyses of 13 guideline-based telephone interviews with resident oncologists. RESULTS: Solid local networks, staff and structural rearrangements and infection control within offices helped oncologists maintaining quality of care. Required treatments have been continued. The interrupted information flow towards patients’ relatives and catching up on previously postponed primary, control or follow-up consultations have been reported as a challenge. Other issues have been linked to suspected SARS-CoV‑2 infection in patients and staff. The lack of information, temporal inaccessibility of health care authorities and physicians’ associations, and additional costs for infection control material caused further problems. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the firmly implemented infection control and the re-organisation of facilities and staff, oncologists have been able to maintain treatment and care for cancer patients and their relatives. Hygiene procedures proved to work well and might be re-activated. An increased use of digital applications for treatment monitoring might be considered. Furthermore, solutions to meet additional financial and personnel demands caused by infection control must be identified. The design of suitable concepts for the prevention of health-related hazards due to visiting bans for relatives and therapeutic staff such as physio- and occupational therapists is inevitable.","Weber, Jan P.; Tielker, Jannik M.; Kamandi, Nilab; Simon, Steffen T.; Bausewein, Claudia; Stiel, Stephanie; Schneider, Nils",Onkologe (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00761-021-00974-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031624/,272
655881,Dementia care during COVID-19,2020-03-30,"Abstract In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers. In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2 months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/ immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.","Solé, G; Salort-Campana, E; Pereon, Y; Stojkovic, T; Wahbi, K; Cintas, P; Adams, D; Laforet, P; Tiffreau, V; Desguerre, I; Pisella, LI; Molon, A; Attarian, S",Rev Neurol (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354651/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0035378720305233; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378720305233?v=s5,272

This retrospective cohort study included 172 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Wuhan. A total of 404 serum samples were obtained over six months from hospitalization to convalescence. Antibodies in the specimens were quantitatively analyzed by the capture chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA). All patients were positive for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the IgG antibody persisted in all the patients during the convalescence. However, only approximately 25% of patients can detect the IgM antibodies, IgM against N protein (N-IgM) and receptor binding domain of S protein (RBD-IgM) at the 27th week. The titers of IgM, N-IgM and RBD-IgM reduced to 16.7%, 17.6% and 15.2% of their peak values respectively. In contrast, the titers of IgG, N-IgG and RBD-IgG peaked at 4–5th week and reduced to 85.9%, 62.6% and 87.2% of their peak values respectively at the end of observation. Dynamic behavior of antibodies and their correlation in age, gender and severity groups were investigated. In general, the COVID-19 antibody was sustained at high levels for over six months in most of the convalescent patients. Only a few patients with antibody reducing to an undetectable level which needs further attention.

660956,PIN47 COVID-19 Patient Severities in Japanese EMR,2021-06-30,"We report on using the synthetic aminoadamantane-CH2-aryl derivatives 1-6 as sensitive probes for blocking M2 S31N and influenza A virus (IAV) M2 wild-type (WT) channels as well as virus replication in cell culture. The binding kinetics measured using electrophysiology (EP) for M2 S31N channel are very dependent on the length between the adamantane moiety and the first ring of the aryl headgroup realized in 2 and 3 and the girth and length of the adamantane adduct realized in 4 and 5. Study of 1-6 shows that, according to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, all bind in the M2 S31N channel with the adamantyl group positioned between V27 and G34 and the aryl group projecting out of the channel with the phenyl (or isoxazole in 6) embedded in the V27 cluster. In this outward binding configuration, an elongation of the ligand by only one methylene in rimantadine 2 or using diamantane or triamantane instead of adamantane in 4 and 5, respectively, causes incomplete entry and facilitates exit, abolishing effective block compared to the amantadine derivatives 1 and 6. In the active M2 S31N blockers 1 and 6, the phenyl and isoxazolyl head groups achieve a deeper binding position and high kon/low koff and high kon/high koff rate constants, compared to inactive 2-5, which have much lower kon and higher koff. Compounds 1-5 block the M2 WT channel by binding in the longer area from V27-H37, in the inward orientation, with high kon and low koff rate constants. Infection of cell cultures by influenza virus containing M2 WT or M2 S31N is inhibited by 1-5 or 1-4 and 6, respectively. While 1 and 6 block infection through the M2 block mechanism in the S31N variant, 2-4 may block M2 S31N virus replication in cell culture through the lysosomotropic effect, just as chloroquine is thought to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tzitzoglaki, Christina; McGuire, Kelly; Lagarias, Panagiotis; Konstantinidi, Athina; Hoffmann, Anja; Fokina, Natalie A; Ma, Chulong; Papanastasiou, Ioannis P; Schreiner, Peter R; Vázquez, Santiago; Schmidtke, Michaela; Wang, Jun; Busath, David D; Kolocouris, Antonios",ACS Chem Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786258/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.0c00553,272

HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans. METHODS: Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests. RESULTS: Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of ≥1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein.

The RFLP analysis identified a change in the cleavage sites of AclI at passages 155 and 165. This RFLP pattern of the N gene differentiated the Chinese vaccine strain from its parental strain, the 11 TGEVs studied and the other reported TGEVs in the GenBank. Using phylogenetic analysis, the Chinese TGEVs were divided into three groups (G1, G2, and G3). The G3 Chinese TGEVs possessed several specific nucleotides and amino acids that were not found in the G1 and G2 Chinese TGEVs or the other reference TGEVs. Analysis of the phylogenetic trees revealed that the G3 TGEVs represent a separate group that is distinct from the non-Chinese TGEVs and from Chinese TGEVs isolated previously. These findings suggest that Chinese strains of TGEV are evolving continuously.","Wang, Chengbao; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Qiu, Hua-Ji; Xue, Fei; Liu, Shengwang; Liu, Changming; Zhu, Yuanmao; Almazán, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis; Feng, Li",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20414714/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-010-0481-8,272

Behind the daily tally of deaths and cases of infection are individuals and families who are experiencing the ultimate consequence of this disease. Every aspect of our lives has been affected and these affects are amplified for those who have to cocoon and have conditions such as dementia. There is little opportunity to directly hear the experience of those ‘vulnerable adults’ who have been self-isolating for many weeks now. This letter takes the form of a reflective conversation with a person living with dementia. Honouring the principles of public and patient involvement (PPI), it is an attempt to give voice to the experience of one of the many thousands of vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as describing the effect on her daily life, Helen describes what supports would help at this time. While the focus of attention at the moment is rightly on dealing with the effects of the virus in nursing homes, the many thousands of people living with dementia in the community should not be forgotten.","Rochford-Brennan, Helen; Keogh, Fiona",HRB Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13063.1,272
663381,Reduction in paediatric emergency visits during the COVID‐19 pandemic in a region with open preschools and schools,2021-06-22,"PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged from Wuhan, China, causing a pandemic. Access to outpatient psychiatric care was limited. We conducted a pilot study of telepsychiatry during a national shutdown. Adult patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) participated via Zoom. Patient preference comparing televisits to face-to-face visits was assessed. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine has emerged as new technological tool in the evolution of the patient-physician relationship, changing the way we interact. Physicians and patients now have access to the electronic medical record, remote point-of-care testing, and each other. The present epidemic allows us to test the limits of technology in combating limited access to care for patients with psychiatric illness. SUMMARY: Twenty (90% male) patients with PTSD participated. Most (90 %) were moderately to severely depressed, and 50% used medical cannabis and increased their dosage during the study period. Patients preferred face-to-face meetings for its ease of use (p < .01) and general satisfaction from therapy (p < .01). However, given continued outbreak-limiting access to care, most patients stated they would continue with telepsychiatry. While most patients preferred face-to-face visits, telepsychiatry can be used during times of outbreak-limiting access to care. Future research and development should be directed at improving technological ease of use.","Malka, Moria; Gropp, Cornelius; Jaworowski, Sol; Oberbaum, Menachem; Katz, David E.",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377626/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40501-021-00245-z,272

Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Emily A.; Kohn, Jordan N.; Hong, Suzi",Brain Behav Immun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030489X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030489X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298803/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,272

664085,Children’s Health Habits and COVID-19 Lockdown in Catalonia: Implications for Obesity and Non-Communicable Diseases,2021-05-13,"In the Sichuan Basin, seismic activity has been low historically, but in the past few decades, a series of moderate to strong earthquakes have occurred. Especially since 2015, earthquake activity has seen an unprecedented continuous growth trend, and the magnitude of events is increasing. Following the M5.7 Xingwen earthquake on 18 Dec. 2018, which was suggested to be induced by shale gas hydraulic fracturing, a swarm of earthquakes with a maximum magnitude up to M6.0 struck Changning and the surrounding counties. Questions arose about the possible involvement of industrial actions in these destructive events. In fact, underground fluid injection in salt mine fields has been occurring in the Sichuan Basin for more than 70 years. Disposal of wastewater in natural gas fields has also continued for about 40 years. Since 2008, injection for shale gas development in the southern Sichuan Basin has increased rapidly. The possible link between the increasing seismicity and increasing injection activity is an important issue. Although surrounded by seismically active zones to the southwest and northwest, the Sichuan Basin is a rather stable region with a wide range of geological settings. First, we present a brief review of earthquakes of magnitude 5 or higher since 1600 to obtain the long-term event rate and explore the possible link between the rapidly increasing trend of seismic activity and industrial injection activities in recent decades. Second, based on a review of previous research results, combined with the latest data, we describe a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and occurrence conditions of natural and injection-induced major seismic clusters in the Sichuan Basin since 1700. Finally, we list some conclusions and insights, which provide a better understanding of why damaging events occur so that they can either be avoided or mitigated, point out scientific questions that need urgent research, and propose a general framework based on geomechanics for assessment and management of earthquake-related risks.

664485,Ambulatory Patients with Cardiometabolic Disease and Without Evidence of COVID-19 During the Pandemic. The CorCOVID LATAM Study,2021-02-17,"BackgroundWe recently delineated the functional biology of pathogenic and inflammation resolving synovial tissue macrophage clusters in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whilst RA is not a viral respiratory syndrome, it represents a pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven chronic articular condition often accompanied by cardiovascular and lung pathologies. We hypothesised that functionally equivalent macrophage clusters in the lung might govern inflammation and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis. MethodsTo provide insight into the targetable functions of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) macrophage clusters, a comparative analysis of BALF macrophage single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) with synovial tissue (ST) macrophage scRNA-seq and functional biology was performed. The function of shared BALF and ST MerTK inflammation-resolving pathway was confirmed with inhibitor in primary macrophage-synovial fibroblast co-cultures. Results. Distinct BALF FCNpos and FCNposSPP1pos macrophage clusters emerging in severe COVID-19 patients were closely related to ST CD48highS100A12pos and CD48posSPP1pos clusters driving synovitis in active RA. They shared transcriptomic profile and pathogenic mechanisms. Healthy lung resident alveolar FABP4pos macrophages shared a regulatory transcriptomic profile, including TAM (Tyro, Axl, MerTK) receptors pathway with synovial tissue TREM2pos macrophages that govern RA remission. This pathway was substantially altered in BALF macrophages of severe COVID-19. In vitro dexamethasone inhibited tissue inflammation via macrophages MerTK function. ConclusionPathogenesis and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis and RA synovitis might be driven by similar macrophage clusters and pathways. The MerTK-dependent anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dexamethasone, and the homeostatic function of TAM pathways that maintain RA in remission advocate the therapeutic MerTK agonism to ameliorate the cytokine storm and pneumonitis of severe COVID-19.","MacDonald, Lucy; Otto, Thomas Dan; Elmesmari, Aziza; Tolusso, Barbara; Somma, Domenico; McSharry, Charles; Gremese, Elisa; McInnes, Iain B; Alivernini, Stefano; Kurowska-Stolarska, Mariola",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.221572,272

The adaptation of preventive measures to limit the spread of infection among the people is the best solution to this health issue. The identification of infected cases and their isolation from healthy people is one of the most important preventive measures. In this regard, screening of the samples from a large number of people is needed which requires a lot of reagent kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of smart pooled sample testing with the help of algorithms may be a quite useful strategy in the current prevailing scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of this strategy, the optimum number of samples to be pooled for a single test may be determined based on the total positivity rate of the particular community.","Bukhari, S. U.

664650,Delayed Diagnosis of a Testicular Mass During COVID-19 Pandemic in Lombardy: A Case Report,2021-01-25,"INTRODUCTION: In late 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in Wuhan, China. A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2°C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45–64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases. Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.","Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tian; Zhao, Dan; Haapasalo, Markus; Shen, Ya",J Endod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099239920302387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360053/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099239920302387?v=s5,272
664844,‘Reducing anxiety and maintaining care’ during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-10-28,"With the recent COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests, the USA (US) has become extensively polarized across social and political divides. The COVID-19 pandemic has left tens of thousands dead and several million American citizens without work. Furthermore, the months of quarantine and uncertainty with the COVID-19 virus impacted the economic stability and health of Americans. In recent weeks, the divides have only deepened with the death of George Floyd from police brutality, which ushered in worldwide protests addressing racial, social, and law enforcement issues for minority groups. Both developments have ushered in unprecedented challenges for addressing social disparities while controlling the spread and devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic. With social media and mass communication, polarization between opposing groups has only deepened the divide. An inclusive dialogue that recognizes the intellectual and interpersonal boundaries of opposing groups would provide an avenue towards mutual understanding and further collaboration towards a common goal and solution.

665284,Control of COVID-19 transmission on an urban university campus during a second wave of the pandemic,2021-02-26,"OBJECTIVE: Neddylation is a druggable and reversible ubiquitin-like post-translational modification upregulated in many diseases, including liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and more recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Herein, we propose to address the effects of neddylation inhibition and the underlying mechanisms in pre-clinical models of NAFLD. METHODS: Hepatic neddylation measured by immunohistochemical analysis and NEDD8 serum levels measured by ELISA assay were evaluated in NAFLD clinical and pre-clinical samples. The effects of neddylation inhibition by using a pharmacological small inhibitor, MLN4924, or molecular approaches were assessed in isolated mouse hepatocytes and pre-clinical mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD, male adult C57BL/6 mice, and the AlfpCre transgenic mice infected with AAV-DIO-shNedd8. RESULTS: Neddylation inhibition reduced lipid accumulation in oleic acid-stimulated mouse primary hepatocytes and ameliorated liver steatosis, preventing lipid peroxidation and inflammation in the mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD. Under these conditions, increased Deptor levels and the concomitant repression of mTOR signaling were associated with augmented fatty acid oxidation and reduced lipid content. Moreover, Deptor silencing in isolated mouse hepatocytes abolished the anti-steatotic effects mediated by neddylation inhibition. Finally, serum NEDD8 levels correlated with hepatic neddylation during the disease progression in the clinical and pre-clinical models CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the upregulation of Deptor, driven by neddylation inhibition, is proposed as a novel effective target and therapeutic approach to tackle NAFLD.","Serrano-Maciá, Marina; Simón, Jorge; González-Rellan, Maria J.; Azkargorta, Mikel; Goikoetxea-Usandizaga, Naroa; Lopitz-Otsoa, Fernando; De Urturi, Diego Saenz; Rodríguez-Agudo, Rubén; Lachiondo-Ortega, Sofia; Mercado-Gomez, Maria; Gutiérrez de Juan, Virginia; Bizkarguenaga, Maider; Fernández-Ramos, David; Buque, Xabier; Baselli, Guido A.; Valenti, Luca V.C.; Iruzubieta, Paula; Crespo, Javier; Villa, Erica; Banales, Jesus M.; Avila, Matias A.; Marin, Jose J.G.; Aspichueta, Patricia; Sutherland, James; Barrio, Rosa; Mayor, Ugo; Elortza, Félix; Xirodimas, Dimitris P.; Nogueiras, Rubén; Delgado, Teresa C.; Martínez-Chantar, María Luz",Mol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153521/,272

In this study, the association of health literacy with mental health, compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures and health prospects was assessed in a Belgian context. METHODS: Data were extracted from the third of a series of cross-sectional online COVID-related surveys (n = 32,794). Data collection took place for 1 week starting the 28th of May 2020. People residing in Belgium and aged 18 years or older could participate. Data were collected on sociodemographic background, health literacy, multimorbidity, mental health (depression, anxiety, sleeping disorder, vitality), knowledge about COVID-19, compliance with COVID-19 measures (hygiene, physical distance, covering mouth and nose on public transport and in places where physical distance cannot be respected), and health prospects (risk for health when returning to normal life and possibility of infection). Prevalence Ratio (PR) of poor mental health, non-compliance with the measures and health prospects in relation to health literacy were calculated using Poisson regressions. RESULTS: People showing sufficient health literacy were less likely to suffer from anxiety disorders (PR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.42–0.53]), depression (PR = 0.46, 95% CI = [0.40–0.52]) and sleeping disorders (PR = 0.85, 95% CI = [0.82–0.87]), and more likely to have optimal vitality (PR = 2.41, 95% CI = [2.05–2.84]) than people with low health literacy. They were less at risk of not complying with the COVID-19 measures (PR between 0.60 and 0.83) except one (covering mouth and nose in places where physical distance cannot be respected). Finally, they were less likely to perceive returning to normal life as threatening (PR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.65–0.77]) and to consider themselves at risk of an infection with COVID-19 (PR = 0.75, 95% CI = [0.67–0.84]). The associations remained significant after controlling for COVID-19 knowledge and multimorbidity.

665904,Making US poison centers a part of the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought massive changes in the provision of psychotherapy. To avoid or reduce the risk of infection, many therapists switched from face-to-face sessions in personal contact to remote psychotherapy, i.e., psychotherapy delivered by telephone or videoconferencing. This study examined the attitudes toward and practice of remote psychotherapy among Austrian therapists with a psychodynamic orientation at the onset of the pandemic as well as changes in the therapeutic process that were experienced by the therapists due to switching to a remote setting. A total of 161 therapists with psychodynamic orientation took part in an online survey. The results show that attitudes toward remote psychotherapy changed positively in psychodynamically orientated therapists and most are willing to switch to remote settings, if necessary. However, many therapists reported negative effects of remote psychotherapy and prefer seeing their patients in-person. The strongest changes were experienced with regard to transference/countertransference, the therapeutic process and the intensity of session. The analysis further revealed an overall decrease in the number of patients treated, indicating an undersupply of psychotherapy, at least during the first wave of COVID-19 infection in Austria. In summary, the experience during the first COVID-19 lockdown has led to an increase in remote psychotherapy and more openness toward these treatment modalities among psychodynamically oriented therapists. However, in-person therapy will remain the first choice for most therapists.","Jesser, Andrea; Muckenhuber, Johanna; Lunglmayr, Bernd; Dale, Rachel; Humer, Elke",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501635/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179046,272

Leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor outpatient clinical encounters may lead to the identification of emerging outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether excess visits where the word “cough” was present in the EHR reason for visit, and hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure were more frequent from December 2019 to February 2020 compared with the preceding 5 years. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort was identified from a large US health system with 3 hospitals, over 180 clinics, and 2.5 million patient encounters annually. Data from patient encounters from July 1, 2014, to February 29, 2020, were included. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series models were used to evaluate if the observed winter 2019/2020 rates were higher than the forecast 95% prediction intervals. The estimated excess number of visits and hospitalizations in winter 2019/2020 were calculated compared to previous seasons. RESULTS: The percentage of patients presenting with an EHR reason for visit containing the word “cough” to clinics exceeded the 95% prediction interval the week of December 22, 2019, and was consistently above the 95% prediction interval all 10 weeks through the end of February 2020. Similar trends were noted for emergency department visits and hospitalizations starting December 22, 2019, where observed data exceeded the 95% prediction interval in 6 and 7 of the 10 weeks, respectively. The estimated excess over the 3-month 2019/2020 winter season, obtained by either subtracting the maximum or subtracting the average of the five previous seasons from the current season, was 1.6 or 2.0 excess visits for cough per 1000 outpatient visits, 11.0 or 19.2 excess visits for cough per 1000 emergency department visits, and 21.4 or 39.1 excess visits per 1000 hospitalizations with acute respiratory failure, respectively. The total numbers of excess cases above the 95% predicted forecast interval were 168 cases in the outpatient clinics, 56 cases for the emergency department, and 18 hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher number of patients with respiratory complaints and diseases starting in late December 2019 and continuing through February 2020 suggests community spread of SARS-CoV-2 prior to established clinical awareness and testing capabilities. This provides a case example of how health system analytics combined with EHR data can provide powerful and agile tools for identifying when future trends in patient populations are outside of the expected ranges.","Elmore, Joann G; Wang, Pin-Chieh; Kerr, Kathleen F; Schriger, David L; Morrison, Douglas E; Brookmeyer, Ron; Pfeffer, Michael A; Payne, Thomas H; Currier, Judith S",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791492/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21562,272

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of listening to negative and positive news about COVID-19 pandemic and a relaxation pause audio. For that, we measured the emotional state through Likert items in a scale developed to assess how anxious, stressed, hopeful, conscious about emotions, irritated, despondent, joyful, optimistic, and preoccupied, he or she was feeling in the moment of evaluation. In an online experiment, an HCPs sample of 245 participants were randomly assigned to either listen to negative or positive news contents about COVID-19. After that, both groups were guided by a relaxation pause activity in which they paid attention to the body and breath. They were assessed before and after listening to each audio. After listening to negative news, participants entered in a more negative emotional state than at baseline (p < 0.001) and compared with participants who listened to positive news (p < 0.001). Both groups improved their emotional state after performing the proposed brief relaxation (p < 0.001). These results show the importance of HCPs being aware and controlling the content of consumed news. A brief relaxation practice can mitigate the negative effects of consuming information with negative content.","Bazán, Paulo Rodrigo; de Azevedo Neto, Raymundo Machado; Lacerda, Shirley Silva; Ribeiro, Maurício Watanabe; Balardin, Joana Bisol; Amaro, Edson; Kozasa, Elisa Harumi",Internet Interv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782921000816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100441; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214782921000816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458106/,272

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 49–83 year olds (in 2020) from a general population study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. RESULTS: Among 235 928 participants, 397 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index and higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (RR 1.28 and RR 1.14 per SD increase, respectively), smoking (RR 1.39), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.53), and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.33). Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were both associated with lower risk (RR 0.84 and RR 0.83 per SD increase, respectively). Non-modifiable risk factors included male sex (RR 1.72), black ethnicity (RR 2.00), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.17 per SD increase in Townsend Index), and high cystatin C (RR 1.13 per SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat, less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.","Ho, Frederick K; Celis-Morales, Carlos A; Gray, Stuart R; Katikireddi, S Vittal; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Hastie, Claire; Ferguson, Lyn D; Berry, Colin; Mackay, Daniel F; Gill, Jason MR; Pell, Jill P; Sattar, Naveed; Welsh, Paul",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444201/,272

However, at the early stage of outbreak, investigations revealed a variety of patterns resulting in the transmission of COVID-19. Thus, it is essential to understand the transmission types and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Moreover, the information regarding the characteristics of transmission helps in coordinating the current screening programme, and controlling and containing measures, and also, helps in deciding the appropriate quarantine duration. Thus, this investigation reports an outbreak of COVID-19 in a family residing in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China during the month of January−February 2020.","Zhou, Zu-Mu; Zhou, Hai-Zhen; Lin, Xian-Dan; SU, Zhi-Cheng; Zhao, Lu-Shuang; Chen, Xi",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820001089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430084/,272
668492,"Neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: update from Lombardy, northern Italy",2020-03-28,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 outbreak has posed considerable challenges to the health care system worldwide, especially for cancer treatment. We described the activity and the care organisation of the Hospitalisation At Home (HAH) structure during the pandemic for treating patients with anti‐cancer injections. METHODS: We report the established organisation, the eligibility criteria, the patient characteristics, the treatment schemes and the stakeholders’ role during two 5‐week periods in 2020, before and during the French population's lockdown. RESULTS: The increase of activity during the lockdown (+32% of treated patients, +156% of new patients and +28% of delivered preparations) concerned solid tumour, mainly breast cancer, even if haematological malignancies remained the most frequent. Thirty different drugs were delivered, including three new drugs administered in HAH versus 19 during the routine period (p < 0.01). For those clinical departments accustomed to using HAH, the usual organisation was kept, but with adjustments. Five clinical departments increased the number of patients treated at home and widened the panel of drugs prescribed. Three oncology departments and one radiotherapy department for the first time solicited HAH for anti‐cancer injections, mainly for immunotherapy. We adjusted the HAH organisation with additional human resources and allowed to prescribe drugs with an infusion time of <30 min only for the new prescribers. CONCLUSION: HAH allowed for the continuation of anti‐cancer injections without postponement during the pandemic, and for a decrease in unnecessary patient travel to hospital with its concomitant COVID‐19 transmission risk. Often left out of guidelines, the place of HAH in treating cancer patients should be reappraised, even more so during a pandemic.","Mittaine‐Marzac, Bénédicte; Zogo, Arsene; Crusson, Jean‐Christophe; Cheneau, Valerie; Pinel, Marie‐Claire; Brandely‐Piat, Marie‐Laure; Amrani, Fatma; Havard, Laurent; Balladur, Elisabeth; Louissaint, Taina; Nivet, Laurence; Ankri, Joel; Aegerter, Philippe; De Stampa, Matthieu",Cancer Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665971/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3682,272
668699,The psychological impact of COVID-19 among newly diagnosed patients: COVID Impact study,2021-07-26,"BACKGROUND: In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cancer centres in the United Kingdom and Europe re-organised their services at an unprecedented pace, and many patients with cancer have had their treatments severely disrupted. Patients with cancer were considered at high risk on sparse evidence, and despite a small number of emerging observational studies, the true incidence and impact of COVID-19 in the ‘at-risk’ population of patients with cancer is yet to be defined. METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical data were collected prospectively for patients attending the Royal Marsden Hospital and three network hospitals between March 1st and April 30th 2020 that were confirmed to have SARS-CoV2 infection. Significance of clinical and pathological characteristics was assessed using the Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, whilst univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to further assess risk. The number of patients attending in March/April 2020 for face-to-face attendances was also extracted. FINDINGS: During the 2-month study period, 867 of 13,489 (6.4%) patients met the criteria leading to swab testing. Of the total at-risk population, only 113 of 13,489 (0.84%) were swab positive, 101 of 13,489 (0.75%) required hospital admission and 29 of 13,489 (0.21%) died of COVID-19. Of the patients that attended the hospital to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy alone or in combination with other therapy, 59 of 2001 (2.9%) were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19–related issues and 20 of 2001 (1%) died. Of the patients that collected targeted treatments, 16 of 1126 (1.4%) were admitted and 1 of 1126 (0.1%) died. Of the 11 patients that had received radiotherapy, 6 of 1042 (0.6%) required inpatient admission and 2 of 1042 (0.2%) died. INTERPRETATIONS: Administration of systemic anticancer therapy appears to be associated with a modest risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Based on this snapshot taken as the first wave of COVID-19 hit our practice, we conclude that continuation of active cancer treatment, even in the palliative setting, is appropriate.","Angelis, Vasileios; Tippu, Zayd; Joshi, Kroopa; Reis, Sara; Gronthoud, Firza; Fribbens, Charlotte; Okines, Alicia; Stanway, Susannah; Cottier, Emma; McGrath, Sophie; Watkins, David; Noble, Jillian; Bhosle, Jaishree; Gerlinger, Marco; Hamid, Intan; Soliman, Heba; Nenclares, Pablo; Jones, Robin; Harrington, Kevin; Gennatas, Spyridon",Eur J Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920303622; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.06.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659475/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920303622,272
668805,Comment on Gross and MacDougall “Roles of the clinical pharmacist during the COVID‐19 pandemic”,2020-05-15,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the hypothesis that an adjunctive therapy with methylprednisolone and unfractionated heparin (UFH) or with methylprednisolone and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are more effective in reducing any-cause mortality in critically-ill ventilated patients with pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to LMWH alone. TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multi-centre, interventional, parallel group, superiority, randomized, investigator sponsored, three arms study. Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups in a ratio 1:1:1. PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients will be recruited from 8 Italian Academic and non-Academic Intensive Care Units INCLUSION CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED): 1. Positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic (on pharyngeal swab of deep airways material) 2. Positive pressure ventilation (either non-invasive or invasive) from > 24 hours 3. Invasive mechanical ventilation from < 96 hours 4. PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio lower than 150 mmHg 5. D-dimer level > 6 times the upper limit of normal reference range 6. C-reactive Protein > 6-fold upper the limit of normal reference range EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age < 18 years 2. On-going treatment with anticoagulant drugs 3. Platelet count < 100.000/mm(3) 4. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 5. Allergy to sodium enoxaparin or other LMWH, UFH or methylprednisolone 6. Active bleeding or on-going clinical condition deemed at high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment 7. Recent (in the last 1 month prior to randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery 8. Chronic assumption or oral corticosteroids 9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding or positive pregnancy test. In childbearing age women, before inclusion, a pregnancy test will be performed if not available 10. Clinical decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment or “too sick to benefit” 11. Presence of other severe diseases impairing life expectancy (e.g. patients are not expected to survive 28 days given their pre-existing medical condition) 12. Lack or withdrawal of informed consent INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: • LMWH group: patients in this group will be administered enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage. • LMWH + steroid group: patients in this group will receive enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage and methylprednisolone. • UFH + steroid group: patients in this group will receive UFH at therapeutic dosages and methylprednisolone. UFH will be administered intravenously in UFH + steroid group at therapeutic doses. The infusion will be started at an infusion rate of 18 UI/kg/hour and then modified to obtain aPTT Ratio in between the range of 1.5-2.0. aPTT will be periodically checked at intervals no longer than 12 hours. The treatment with UFH will be administered up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge anticoagulant therapy may be interrupted or switched to prophylaxis with LMWH in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Enoxaparin will be administered in both LMWH group and LMWH + steroid group at standard prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI once day, increased to 6000 UI once day for patients weighting more than 90 kg). The treatment will be administered subcutaneously once a day up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge it may be continued or interrupted in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Methylprednisolone will be administered in both LMWH + steroid group and UHF + steroid group intravenously with an initial bolus of 0,5 mg/kg followed by administration of 0,5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7 days, 0,5 mg/kg 3 times daily from day 8 to day 10, 0,5 mg/kg 2 times daily at days 11 and 12 and 0,5 mg/kg once daily at days 13 and 14. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm(2), intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography, haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures; haemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention or any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug. RANDOMIZATION: A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes (block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/≥30) and Age (<75/≥75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants to the study will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be completed in approximately 10 months. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.1 of April 26(th), 2020.

Using inductive coding, we found nine final codes for difficulties and 12 for positives and grouped them into socioecological levels: personal, interpersonal, and societal. RESULTS: Difficulties were reported by 94% of the sample, while 63% described positives. Difficulties and positive responses were made at all socioecological levels and illustrated a dialectic between personal level constraints and opportunities, interpersonal level social isolation and integration, and societal level outrage, sorrow, and social optimism. DISCUSSION: Respondents described sources of vulnerabilities and resilience that supported a socioecological approach to understanding resilience during this pandemic. A notable example was resilience derived from witnessing and contributing to community and social solidarity, highlighting the potential of older adults as resources to their communities during the global pandemic.","Igarashi, Heidi; Kurth, Maria L; Lee, Hye Soo; Choun, Soyoung; Lee, Dylan; Aldwin, Carolyn M",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881504/,272
669897,Bird flu outbreak amidst COVID‐19 pandemic in South Africa: Efforts and challenges at hand,2021-06-14,"COVID-19 is a viral disease characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Since then, researchers from all over the world have been looking for ways to fight this disease. Many cases of complications arise from insufficient immune responses due to low immunity, with intense release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage the structure of organs such as the lung. Thus, the hypothesis arises that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) with the use of a low-level laser (LLLT) may be an ally approach to patients with COVID-19 since it is effective for increasing immunity, helping tissue repair, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This systematic review was performed with the use of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases with the following keywords: “low-level laser therapy OR photobiomodulation therapy AND COVID-19”. The inclusion criteria were complete articles published from January 2020 to January 2021 in English. The exclusion criteria were other languages, editorials, reviews, brief communications, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and articles that did not provide the full text. The bibliographic search found 18 articles in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database, 118 articles on the Web of Science, 23 articles on Scopus, and 853 articles on Google Scholar. Ten articles were included for qualitative synthesis, of which four commentary articles discussed the pathogenesis and the effect of PBMT in COVID-19. Two in vitro and lab experiments showed the effect of PBMT on prevention of thrombosis and positive results in wound healing during viral infection, using the intravascular irradiation (ILIB) associated with Phthalomethyl D. Two case reports showed PBMT improved the respiratory indexes, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients. One case series reported the clinical improvement after PBMT on 14 acute COVID-19 patients, rehabilitation on 24 patients, and as a preventive treatment on 70 people. One clinical trial of 30 patients with severe COVID-19 who require invasive mechanical ventilation, showed PBMT-static magnetic field was not statistically different from placebo for the length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit, but improved diaphragm muscle function and ventilation and decreased the inflammatory markers. This review suggests that PBMT may have a positive role in treatment of COVID-19. Still, the necessity for more clinical trials remains in this field and there is not sufficient research evidence regarding the effects of PBMT and COVID-19 disease, and there is a large gap.","de Matos, Brenda Thaynne Lima; Buchaim, Daniela Vieira; Pomini, Karina Torres; Barbalho, Sandra Maria; Guiguer, Elen Landgraf; Reis, Carlos Henrique Bertoni; Bueno, Cleuber Rodrigo de Souza; da Cunha, Marcelo Rodrigues; Pereira, Eliana de Souza Bastos Mazuqueli; Buchaim, Rogerio Leone",Life (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/life11060580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207199/,272

Despite of that, few published studies have been cited concerning depression among hospital healthcare workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and identify the determinants of depression among health care workers working at North West Armed Forces hospital in Tabuk city, KSA. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study design that was adopted to include a representative sample of physicians and nurses working at North West Armed Forces hospital throughout the study period, provided that they worked at this hospital for at least 6 months. A self-administered questionnaire was applied including three parts; the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, factors that could be associated with depression and the patient health-9 questionnaire to diagnose depression. RESULTS: The study included 255 healthcare workers. Females represent 58.8 % of the participants. Their age ranged between 22 and 50 years (30.6 ± 5.3 years). About two-thirds of them were nurses (64.3 %) and the remaining 35.7 % were physicians; mainly registrars (22.8 %). The prevalence of depression was 43.9 %. being severe among 0.8 % of them. Results of multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HCWs who lost beloved person in the last 6 months were at 3.67 higher risk for developing depression compared to those who didn't report such history (adjusted odds ratio = 3.67; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.84–7.30, p < 0.001). Compared to HCWs of less than 5 years of experience, those with higher experience (5–10 and > 10 years) were at lower significant risk to develop depression (AOR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.07–0.037, p < 0.001 and AOR = 0.05; 95 % CI = 0.01–0.029, p = 0.001), respectively.

GI preparations from porcine gastric mucosa, mouse intestine, and in neuramide (a pharmaceutical product), were examined for broad antiviral activity, molecular size and mechanism of action for comparison with the previously characterized, innate inhibitors in the serum and nervous system. The GI inhibitors were found to be active in high titers against RNA and DNA viruses, resistant to proteolysis, glycolysis, lipid extraction and possessed differing mechanisms of action. The mouse intestinal inhibitor prevented virus attachment to cells, and neuramide acted at an early post-attachment stage of virus multiplication. The porcine mucosal inhibitor acted as late as 6 h after initiation of the multiplication cycle. These broadly active GI inhibitors differed from the previously described serum inhibitor (UTIβ) high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the nervous system (NS) inhibitor by being smaller (600±400 kDa) and resistant to proteinase K, glycosidases and organic solvents. The mouse intestinal inhibitor acts similarly to UTIβ and NS inhibitor by preventing attachment of virus to the cells. In comparison, the neuramide and the porcine mucosal inhibitor, like HDL, acted after attachment to the target cells. The innate nonspecific, broadly-active virus inhibitors, based on high titers and location, are considered important initial immune defense mechanisms against viral infections and thus potentially useful in medical applications.","Singh, Indra P; Coppenhaver, Dorian H; Chopra, Ashok K; Baron, Samuel",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354200001406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354200001406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11428242/,272

The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and trembling economies warrant the urgent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of Newcastle disease virus, proto-type virus of AOaV-1, was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies.","Rohaim, Mohammed A; Munir, Muhammad",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.126524,272

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old and a 70-year-old men with fever, cough, and respiratory fatigue were admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated for respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS: The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 and the chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of peripheral and bilateral ground-glass opacities. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients developed pneumothoraces after intubation and was managed with chest tube. Due to persistent air leak, thoracoscopies with blebs resection and pleurectomies were performed on 23rd and 16th days from symptoms onset. OUTCOMES: The procedures were successful with no evidence of postoperative air-leak, with respiratory improvement. Pathological specimens were analyzed with evidence of diffuse alveolar septum disruption, interstitium thickness, and infiltration of inflammatory cells with diffuse endothelial dysfunction and hemorrhagic thrombosis. LESSONS: Despite well-known pulmonary damages induced by the COVID-19, the late-phase histological changes include diffused peripheral vessels endothelial hyperplasia, in toto muscular wall thickening, and intravascular hemorrhagic thrombosis.","Aiolfi, Alberto; Bruni, Barbara; Biraghi, Tullio; Montisci, Andrea; Miceli, Antonio; Baronio, Barbara; Khor, Desmond; Cirri, Silvia; Donatelli, Francesco; Clemente, Claudio; Bona, Davide",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32664116/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021046,272
671356,Letter: Neurosurgery at war with the COVID-19 pandemic: patient’s management from an African neurosurgical center,2020-05-30,"Due to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), large amounts of antivirals were consumed and released into wastewater, posing risks to the ecosystem and human health. Ozonation is commonly utilized as pre-oxidation process to enhance the disinfection of hospital wastewater during COVID-19 spread. In this study, the transformation of ribavirin, antiviral for COVID-19, during ozone/PMS-chlorine intensified disinfection process was investigated. •OH followed by O3 accounted for the dominant ribavirin degradation in most conditions due to higher reaction rate constant between ribavirin and •OH vs. SO4•− (1.9 × 109 vs. 7.9 × 107 M−1 s−1, respectively). During the O3/PMS process, ribavirin was dehydrogenated at the hydroxyl groups first, then lost the amide or the methanol group. Chloride at low concentrations (e.g., 0.5~2 mg/L) slightly accelerated ribavirin degradation, while bromide, iodide, bicarbonate, and dissolved organic matter all reduced the degradation efficiency. In the presence of bromide, O3/PMS process resulted in the formation of organic brominated oxidation by-products (OBPs), the concentration of which increased with increasing bromide dosage. However, the formation of halogenated OBPs was negligible when chloride or iodide existed. Compared to the O3/H2O2 process, the concentration of brominated OBPs was significantly higher after ozonation or the O3/PMS process. This study suggests that the potential risks of the organic brominated OBPs should be taken into consideration when ozonation and ozone-based processes are used to enhance disinfection in the presence of bromide amid COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Xiaoyu; Hong, Yuntao; Ding, Shunke; Jin, Wei; Dong, Shengkun; Xiao, Rong; Chu, Wenhai",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721031016?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721031016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091342/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148030,272

A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics® software was used in this research. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality. Of the 987 frontline nurses who participated, 58.8% (n = 580) reported poor sleep quality. In an examination of PSQI components the mean sleep duration was 7.04 (SD = 1.59) hours per night, and the sleep latency mean was 38.18 min (SD = 31.81). Poor sleep (p < .05) was significantly associated with age, marital status, years of experience, comorbidity, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with having COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that poor quality of sleep was significantly associated with stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. Sleep disturbance is a significant problem for frontline nurses working in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to maintain the health conditions and reduce sleep disturbance among frontline nurses are needed in order to help support nurses’ work during contagious disease outbreaks. These can be implemented through online workshops and training to enhance nurses’ responses to the pandemic or to any further disease outbreaks.","Al Maqbali, Mohammed",Sleep Biol Rhythms,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-021-00337-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230810/,272
672157,Oxygen use in low-resource settings: An intervention still triggered by intuition,2020-12-07,"The in vivo phenotypic profile of T cells reactive to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 antigens remains poorly understood. Conventional methods to detect antigen-reactive T cells require in vitro antigenic re-stimulation or highly individualized peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) multimers. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and profile SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To do so, we induce transcriptional shifts by antigenic stimulation in vitro and take advantage of natural T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of clonally expanded T cells as barcodes for ‘reverse phenotyping’. This allows identification of SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs and reveals phenotypic effects introduced by antigen-specific stimulation. We characterize transcriptional signatures of currently and previously activated SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, and show correspondence with phenotypes of T cells from the respiratory tract of patients with severe disease in the presence or absence of virus in independent cohorts. Reverse phenotyping is a powerful tool to provide an integrated insight into cellular states of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells across tissues and activation states.","Fischer, David S.; Ansari, Meshal; Wagner, Karolin I.; Jarosch, Sebastian; Huang, Yiqi; Mayr, Christoph H.; Strunz, Maximilian; Lang, Niklas J.; D’Ippolito, Elvira; Hammel, Monika; Mateyka, Laura; Weber, Simone; Wolff, Lisa S.; Witter, Klaus; Fernandez, Isis E.; Leuschner, Gabriela; Milger, Katrin; Frankenberger, Marion; Nowak, Lorenz; Heinig-Menhard, Katharina; Koch, Ina; Stoleriu, Mircea G.; Hilgendorff, Anne; Behr, Jürgen; Pichlmair, Andreas; Schubert, Benjamin; Theis, Fabian J.; Busch, Dirk H.; Schiller, Herbert B.; Schober, Kilian",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24730-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312385/,272

It is shown that in the absence of infective immigrants, the model has a locally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the basic reproduction number is below unity. In the absence of immigration of infective persons, the disease can be eradicated whenever ℛ(0) < 1. Specifically, if the controls u(i), i=1,2,3,4, are implemented to 100% efficiency, the disease dies away easily. It is shown that border closure (or at least screening) is indispensable in the fight against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

672614,Observed reduction in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: The recent widespread availability of augmented reality via smartphone offers an opportunity to translate cue exposure therapy for smoking cessation from the laboratory to the real world. Despite significant reductions in the smoking rates in the last decade, approximately 13.7% of the adults in the United States continue to smoke. Smoking-related cue exposure has demonstrated promise as an adjuvant therapy in the laboratory, but practical limitations have prevented its success in the real world. Augmented reality technology presents an innovative approach to overcome these limitations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a smartphone app that presents smoking-related augmented reality images for cue exposure. Smokers provided feedback on the images and reported on the perceived urge to smoke, qualities of reality/coexistence, and general feedback about quality and functioning. The feedback was used to refine the augmented reality images within the app. METHODS: In collaboration with an augmented reality design company, we developed 6 smoking-related images (cigarette, lighter, ashtray, lit cigarette in ashtray, etc) and 6 neutral images similar in size or complexity for comparison (pen, eraser, notebook, soda bottle with droplets, etc). Ten smokers completed a survey of demographic characteristics, smoking history and behavior, dependence on nicotine, motivation to quit smoking, and familiarity with augmented reality technology. Then, participants viewed each augmented reality image and provided ratings on 10-point Likert scales for urge to smoke and reality/coexistence of the image into the scene. Participants were also queried with open-ended questions regarding the features of the images. RESULTS: Of the 10 participants, 5 (50%) had experienced augmented reality prior to the laboratory visit, but only 4 of those 5 participants used augmented reality at least weekly. Although the sample was small (N=10), smokers reported significantly higher urge to smoke after viewing the smoking-related augmented reality images (median 4.58, SD 3.49) versus the neutral images (median 1.42, SD 3.01) (Z=–2.14, P=.03; d=0.70). The average reality and coexistence ratings of the images did not differ between smoking-related and neutral images (all P>.29). Augmented reality images were found on average to be realistic (mean [SD] score 6.49 [3.11]) and have good environmental coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.93 [3.04]) and user coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.38 [3.27]) on the 10-point scale. Participant interviews revealed some areas of excellence (eg, details of the lit cigarette) and areas for improvement (eg, stability of images, lighting). CONCLUSIONS: All images were generally perceived as being realistic and well-integrated into the environment. However, the smoking augmented reality images produced higher urge to smoke than the neutral augmented reality images. In total, our findings support the potential utility of augmented reality for cue exposure therapy. Future directions and next steps are discussed.","Vinci, Christine; Brandon, Karen O; Kleinjan, Marloes; Hernandez, Laura M; Sawyer, Leslie E; Haneke, Jody; Sutton, Steven K; Brandon, Thomas H",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382377/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21643,272

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of thermoplastic mask immobilization with a surgical mask using an ExacTrac system. Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x‐ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient’s position at a couch angle of 0°. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non‐coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non‐coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79°), roll (1.24 vs 0.68°), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90°) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0°. Most of patient positioning errors were less than 1.0 mm or 1.0° after the couch was rotated to the planned angle for non‐coplanar beams. The overall absolute values of the translational and rotational XV position errors with and without the surgical mask were less than 0.5 mm and 0.5°, respectively. This study showed that a thermoplastic mask with a surgical mask is a feasible immobilization technique for brain SRS/SRT patients using the ExacTrac system.","Miura, Hideharu; Hioki, kazunari; Ozawa, Shuichi; kanemoto, Kenji; Nakao, Minoru; Doi, Yoshiko; Kenjo, Masahiko; Nagata, Yasushi",J Appl Clin Med Phys,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.13279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028970/,272

METHODS: Main outcomes were cesarean and preterm delivery, rooming-in, and breastfeeding. We examined changes over time overall and according to race/ethnicity, language status, and social vulnerability from 03/20-07/20 at 11 hospitals. RESULTS: Of 255 mothers with SARS-CoV-2, 67% were black or Hispanic and 47% were non-English speaking. Cesarean decreased (49% to 35%), while rooming-in (55% to 86%) and breastfeeding (53% to 72%) increased. These changes did not differ by race/ethnicity, language, or social vulnerability.

This study focused on the impact of HTH conditions on mice and the potential protective effect of Herb Yinchen. Five male Balb/c mouse groups included two normal control groups, two HTH-exposed groups, and one Yinchen-treated group. For either three or ten days, normal and HTH-exposed mice were housed under normal or HTH (33 ± 2 °C,85% relative humidity) conditions, respectively. Yinchen-treated mice, housed under HTH conditions, received the Herb Yinchen decoction for three days. Metabolite profiles of plasma and liver samples from each group were analyzed using LC–MS/MS. Fecal DNA was extracted for 16S rDNA analysis to evaluate the intestinal microbiome. Spearman correlation analysis was performed on metabolites, bacteria, and bile acids that differed between the groups. We found that HTH altered the host metabolite profiles and reduced microbial diversity, causing intestinal microbiome imbalance. Interestingly, Herb Yinchen treatment improved HTH-mediated changes of the metabolite profiles and the intestinal microbiome, restoring them to values observed in normal controls. In conclusion, our study reveals that HTH causes intestinal bacterial disturbances and metabolic disorders in normal mice, while Herb Yinchen could afford protection against such changes.","Wang, Yao; Chen, Jiayi; Tang, Jianbang; Xiao, Jiedong; Zheng, Yuhua; Tang, Liting; Luo, Huanhuan",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84694-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658635/,272

METHODS: Volunteer human, animal and environmental health professionals from around the world were recruited to EpiCore and trained to provide early verification of health threat alerts in their geographical region via a secure, easy-to-use, online platform. Experts in the area of emerging infectious diseases sent requests for information on unverified health threats to these volunteers, who used local knowledge and expertise to respond to requests. Experts reviewed and summarized the responses and rapidly disseminated important information to the global health community through the existing event-based disease surveillance network, ProMED. FINDINGS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 2068 EpiCore volunteers from 142 countries were trained in methods of informal disease surveillance and use of the EpiCore online platform. These volunteers provided 790 individual responses to 759 requests for information addressing unverified health threats in 112 countries; 361 (45%) responses were considered to be useful. Most responses were received within hours of the requests. The responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED and sent to over 87 000 subscribers. CONCLUSION: There is widespread willingness among health professionals around the world to voluntarily assist efforts to verify and provide supporting information on unconfirmed health threats in their region.

A multi-omic approach was adopted, and in the discovery phase, global proteome/metaproteome/metabolome were analysed in the respiratory specimens of SARS-CoV-2 positive [n=20], negative [n=20], and H1N1 positive [n=5] cases. We identified MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1) and WARS (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase) as clues to viral diagnosis and validated in 200 SARS-CoV-2 suspects. MX1 >30pg/ml and WARS >25ng/ml segregated virus positives patients [(AUC=94%CI(0.91-0.97)]. Distinct increase in SARS-CoV-2 induced immune activation, metabolic reprograming and a decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing, fluid regulation, vitamin and steroid metabolism was seen (p<0.05). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viraemia and segregated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the multiomics approach identified increased respiratory pathogens [Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia] and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05, p<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens.

The lack of a readily available COVID-19 vaccine has reinforced the importance of influenza vaccine programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is an important tool in protecting against influenza, particularly in children. However, it is unknown whether LAIV administration might influence the outcomes of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease. To investigate this, quadrivalent LAIV (QLAIV) was administered to ferrets 3 days pre- or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. LAIV administration did not exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 disease course or lung pathology with either regimen. Additionally, LAIV administered prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT).

In this review, we discuss the upstream activators of STAT3 in skeletal muscles, with a focus on interleukin 6 (IL6) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1). We will also discuss the double-edged effect of STAT3 activation in the muscles, including the role of STAT3 signaling in muscle hypertrophy induced by exercise training or muscle wasting in cachectic diseases and muscular dystrophies. STAT3 is a critical regulator of satellite cell self-renewal after muscle injury. STAT3 knock out affects satellite cell myogenic progression by impairing proliferation and inducing premature differentiation. Recent studies in STAT3 signaling demonstrated its direct role in controlling myogenic capacity of myoblasts and satellite cells, as well as the potential benefit in using STAT3 inhibitors to treat muscle diseases. However, prolonged STAT3 activation in muscles has been shown to be responsible for muscle wasting by activating protein degradation pathways. It is important to balance the extent of STAT3 activation and the duration and location (cell types) of the STAT3 signaling when developing therapeutic interventions.

People are often ignorant about proper handwashing in different situations and do not know if they wash hands properly. Smartwatches are found to be effective for assessing the quality of handwashing. However, the existing smartwatch based systems are not comprehensive enough in terms of achieving accuracy as well as reminding people to handwash and providing feedback to the user about the quality of handwashing. On-device processing is often required to provide real-time feedback to the user, and so it is important to develop a system that runs efficiently on low-resource devices like smartwatches. However, none of the existing systems for handwashing quality assessment are optimized for on-device processing. We present iWash, a comprehensive system for quality assessment and context-aware reminders for handwashing with real-time feedback using smartwatches. iWash is a hybrid deep neural network based system that is optimized for on-device processing to ensure high accuracy with minimal processing time and battery usage. Additionally, it is a context-aware system that detects when the user is entering home using a Bluetooth beacon and provides reminders to wash hands. iWash also offers touch-free interaction between the user and the smartwatch that minimizes the risk of germ transmission. We collected a real-life dataset and conducted extensive evaluations to demonstrate the performance of iWash.

All the results revised in this review indicated that the use of E. crassipes (and its carbon derived) as adsorbent is promising and is an excellent material to be applied in the water treatment. It could be used in the actual technologies for the treatment of contaminated water by heavy metals and textile dyes; however, more studies need to be made on scale-up, economy projects, and related issues, to be finally implemented in wastewater treatment plants.","Lima, Herbert de P.; Asencios, Yvan J.

To overcome this, unsupervised network analyses are used to identify clusters of genes that can be associated with distinct molecular mechanisms and outcomes for a disease. In this study, we developed an integrated network analysis framework that integrates transcriptional signatures from multiple model systems with protein-protein interaction data to find gene modules. Through a meta-analysis of different enriched features from these gene modules, we extract communities of highly interconnected features. These clusters of higher-order features, working as a multifeatured machine, enable collective assessment of their contribution for disease or phenotype characterization. We show the utility of this workflow using transcriptomics data from three different models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","Ghandikota, Sudhir; Sharma, Mihika; Jegga, Anil G.",Patterns (N Y),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666389921000672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842903/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000672?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100247,272

As real-time research, this paper consists of two parts written during two different research periods. The first part, which was originally reported in February 2021, studies the Japan’s second soft lockdown policy (state of emergency declaration) from January to March 2021. After the model is calibrated using 2020 data, the results show that a long enough lockdown can avoid future lockdowns, improving both the infection and the economy. In addition, I propose the ICU targeting policy, which keeps the number of severe patients at a constant level, mimicking the monetary policy’s inflation targeting. The model’s prediction is evaluated from an ex-post perspective in the second part, written in July 2021. I find that the model broadly captures the realized consequences of the second soft lockdown and the subsequent paths. Furthermore, the simulation is projected to the end of the pandemic under a revised scenario, incorporating the proliferation of COVID-19 variants. Finally, I discuss the effectiveness of the inverse lockdown (economic stimulus) policy in the fall of 2021 under the dynamic infection externality.","Kubota, So",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1007/s42973-021-00091-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456604/,272

METHODS: A single site uncontrolled before‐after survey study examining change in facial hairstyles, and wider implications on doctor's cultural, religious, and personal wellbeing. Outcome measures included change in facial hair between January and April 2020 and whether these changes adhered to guidance set by Public Health England. Participants were also asked about the wider impact of these changes which were thematically analyzed using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Of those who completed the survey, 257 participants met the inclusion criteria. 68% (n = 67) of doctors who could grow facial hair changed their facial hairstyle during the COVID‐19 pandemic and 96% (n = 64) reported that the change was in response to PPE guidance. The odds of having a facial hairstyle that complied with PPE guidance before the pandemic was 0.32, which rose to 2.77 after guidance was released, giving an odds ratio of 8.54 (95% CI 4.49‐16.23, P < .001). When compared to those who sported a shaven face prepandemic, the odds ratio of a change in style for those with prepandemic full beards was 37.92 (95% CI 7.45‐192.8, P < .001), for goatees was 7.22 (95% CI 1.076‐48.47, P = .04), for moustaches was 4.33 (95% CI 0.207‐90.85, P = .345), and for stubble was 9.06 (95% CI 2.133‐38.49, P = .003). Qualitative analysis revealed multiple themes, including skin irritation, loss of identity, and a significant impact on participants required to maintain a beard due to religious or cultural reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Facial hairstyles have changed significantly at our hospital during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Facial hair can impact upon doctors' cultural, religious, and personal wellbeing and these factors need to be considered with policy and provision of PPE.","Sahota, Sanjeev; Gill, Simon; Ridenton, Jennifer; Hegarty, Helen; Pope, Katherine; Gentile, Giorgio",Health Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977160/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.278,272

Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.","Sheahan, Timothy P.; Sims, Amy C.; Zhou, Shuntai; Graham, Rachel L.; Hill, Collin S.; Leist, Sarah R.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Agostini, Maria L.; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Chapell, James D.; Brown, Ariane J.; Bluemling, Gregory R.; Natchus, Michael G.; Saindane, Manohar; Kolykhalov, Alexander A.; Painter, George; Harcourt, Jennifer; Tamin, Azaibi; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Swanstrom, Ronald; Denison, Mark R.; Baric, Ralph S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.997890,272
679477,Cardiac arrest occurrence during successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: direct and indirect consequences,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: GATA-2 transcription factor deficiency has recently been described in patients with a propensity towards myeloid malignancy associated with other highly variable phenotypic features: chronic leukocytopenias (dendritic cell-, monocyto-, granulocyto-, lymphocytopenia), increased susceptibility to infections, lymphatic vasculature abnormalities, and sensorineural deafness. Patients often suffer from opportunistic respiratory infections; chronic pulmonary changes have been found in advanced disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 17-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who was admitted to the hospital with fever, malaise, headache, cough and dyspnea. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates and pneumonia was diagnosed. Despite prompt clinical improvement under antibiotic therapy, interstitial changes remained stable. A high resolution computer tomography showed severe diffuse parenchymal lung disease, while the patient’s pulmonary function tests were normal and he was asymptomatic. Lung tissue biopsy revealed chronic reparative and resorptive reaction with organizing vasculitis. At the time of the initial presentation to the hospital, serological signs of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were present; EBV viremia with atypical serological response persisted during two-year follow up. No other infectious agents were found. Marked monocytopenia combined with B-cell lymphopenia led to a suspicion of GATA-2 deficiency. Diagnosis was confirmed by detection of the previously published heterozygous mutation in GATA2 (c.1081 C > T, p.R361C). The patient’s brother and father were both carriers of the same genetic defect. The brother had no clinically relevant ailments despite leukocyte changes similar to the index patient. The father suffered from spondylarthritis, and apart from B-cell lymphopenia, no other changes within the leukocyte pool were seen. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a diagnosis of GATA-2 deficiency should be considered in all patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease presenting together with leukocytopenia, namely monocyto-, dendritic cell- and B-lymphopenia, irrespective of severity of the clinical phenotype. Genetic counseling and screening for GATA2 mutations within the patient’s family should be provided as the phenotype is highly variable and carriers without apparent immunodeficiency are still in danger of developing myeloid malignancy. A prompt recognition of this rare condition helps to direct clinical treatment strategies and follow-up procedures.","Svobodova, Tamara; Mejstrikova, Ester; Salzer, Ulrich; Sukova, Martina; Hubacek, Petr; Matej, Radoslav; Vasakova, Martina; Hornofova, Ludmila; Dvorakova, Marcela; Fronkova, Eva; Votava, Felix; Freiberger, Tomas; Pohunek, Petr; Stary, Jan; Janda, Ales",BMC Pulm Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-015-0006-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25879889/,272

Nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14), which features exonuclease (ExoN) and guanine N7 methyltransferase activity, is a critical player in SARS-CoV-2 replication and fidelity and represents an attractive antiviral target. Initiating drug discovery efforts for nucleases such as NSP14 remains a challenge due to a lack of suitable high-throughput assay methodologies. This report describes the combination of self-assembled monolayers and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry to enable the first label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity. The assay was used to measure NSP14 activity and gain insight into substrate specificity and the reaction mechanism. Next, the assay was optimized for kinetically balanced conditions and miniaturized, while achieving a robust assay (Z factor > 0.8) and a significant assay window (signal-to-background ratio > 200). Screening 10,240 small molecules from a diverse library revealed candidate inhibitors, which were counterscreened for NSP14 selectivity and RNA intercalation. The assay methodology described here will enable, for the first time, a label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity to accelerate drug discovery efforts and, due to the assay flexibility, can be more broadly applicable for measuring other enzyme activities from other viruses or implicated in various pathologies.","Scholle, Michael D.; Liu, Cheng; Deval, Jerome; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A.",SLAS Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870746/; https://doi.org/10.1177/24725552211008854,272
681214,Increased incidence of rhino‐orbital mucormycosis in an educational therapeutic hospital during the COVID‐19 pandemic in western Iran: An observational study,2021-07-31,"BACKGROUND: Natural and vaccine-induced immunity will play a key role in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: 13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7. CONCLUSION: Natural infection resulting in detectable anti-spike antibodies and two vaccine doses both provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including against the B.1.1.7 variant.","Lumley, Sheila F; Rodger, Gillian; Constantinides, Bede; Sanderson, Nicholas; Chau, Kevin K; Street, Teresa L; O039,; Donnell, Denise; Howarth, Alison; Hatch, Stephanie B; Marsden, Brian D; Cox, Stuart; James, Tim; Warren, Fiona; Peck, Liam J; Ritter, Thomas G; de Toledo, Zoe; Warren, Laura; Axten, David; Cornall, Richard J; Jones, E Yvonne; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin; Ebner, Daniel; Hoosdally, Sarah; Chand, Meera; Crook, Derrick W; Donnell, Anne-Marie; Conlon, Christopher P; Pouwels, Koen B; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Tim E A; Hopkins, Susan; Walker, Timothy M; Stoesser, Nicole E; Matthews, Philippa C; Jeffery, Katie; Eyre, David W",Clin. infect. dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216472/,272

In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper (TFH) cells and cytotoxic T helper cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2, and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response was observed early in the illness which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional T helper (TH)1 and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells.

Objective: To analyze SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics across COVID-19 severity, the respiratory tract, sex and age cohorts (aged 0 to 17 years, 18 to 59 years, and 60 years or older). Design: Systematic review and pooled analyses. Setting: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched up to 20 November 2020. Participants: The systematic dataset included 1,266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19. Measurements: Case characteristics (COVID-19 severity, age and sex) and quantitative respiratory viral loads (rVLs). Results: In the URT, adults with severe COVID-19 had higher rVLs at 1 DFSO than adults (P = 0.005) or children (P = 0.017) with nonsevere illness. Between 1-10 DFSO, severe adults had comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the URT as nonsevere adults (P = 0.479) and nonsevere children (P = 0.863). In the LRT, severe adults showed higher post-symptom-onset rVLs than nonsevere adults (P = 0.006). In the analyzed period (4-10 DFSO), severely affected adults had no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2 clearance from LRT (P = 0.105), whereas nonsevere adults showed a clear trend (P < 0.001). After stratifying for disease severity, sex and age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of the duration of respiratory shedding. Limitation: Limited data on case comorbidities and few samples in some cohorts. Conclusion: High, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in adults. After symptom onset, severe cases tended to have higher URT shedding than their nonsevere counterparts. Disease severity, rather than age or sex, predicted SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. LRT specimens should more accurately prognosticate COVID-19 severity than URT specimens. Primary Funding Source: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council.","Chen, P.

The current study sought to measure the perceived impact of COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York on smokers enrolled in four smoking cessation trials between March 2020 and July 2020. The survey collected quantitative data regarding life changes due to COVID-19, health/exposure status, and the impact on their cessation attempt (e.g., motivation to quit, change in triggers). The questionnaire collected qualitative data to better understand how such changes could explain changes in smoking behavior. Of the 42 participants surveyed, approximately half indicated that COVID-19 changed their motivation and ability to quit or remain quit. Among those who reported that it was easier to quit following the stay-at-home orders (n = 24), most attributed this to concerns regarding the severity of COVID-19 among smokers. Among those who reported more difficulty quitting (n = 15), most attributed this to their increased stress due to the pandemic and the inability to access activities, places, or people that could help them manage triggers. Given public health warnings of continued surges in COVID-19, these data provide insight into who may benefit from further smoking cessation support should existing restrictions or new stay-at-home orders be enacted.","Rosoff-Verbit, Zoe; Logue-Chamberlain, Erin; Fishman, Jessica; Audrain-McGovern, Janet; Hawk, Larry; Mahoney, Martin; Mazur, Alexa; Ashare, Rebecca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435462/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020505,272
682151,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation status of newly diagnosed melanoma: A single institution experience,2020-12-25,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a viral respiratory disease first reported in December 2019, quickly became a threat to global public health. Further understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk perception of the community may better inform targeted interventions to reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on people’s self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19–infected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes. It also brings forth a greater understanding of the community’s risk perceptions of serious COVID-19 disease. Hence, this study may aid health authorities to better adapt measures to the real needs of the population and to identify vulnerable individuals requiring further education and awareness of preventive measures.","Laires, Pedro Almeida; Dias, Sónia; Gama, Ana; Moniz, Marta; Pedro, Ana R; Soares, Patricia; Aguiar, Pedro; Nunes, Carla",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/22794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433397/,272

We describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine pediatric vaccination in Brazil. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of all vaccine doses provided to children aged 0-6 years from January 2019 to December 2020. We obtained data stratified by age group (0 to 2 years and >2 to 6 years) and Brazilian region. Difference-in-difference (DiD) analyses were performed to compare vaccine uptake in the pre-pandemic (January-February), stay-at-home (March-June), and reopening (July-December) periods. RESULTS The number of vaccine doses administered declined in the stay-at-home period. For children aged 0 to 2 years, the highest reductions were recorded in the North (-25.3%), Northeast (-16.8%) and Central-West (-10.2%) regions. For children aged >2 to 6 years, the highest decline was observed in the North (DiD = -27.2%) and South (DiD = -14.0%) regions.

In 2010, a new genotype of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus emerged and replaced the former circulating Lagovirus europaeus/GI.1 strains. Several recombination events have been reported for the new genotype Lagovirus europaeus/GI.2, with pathogenic (variants GI.1a and GI.1b) and benign (genotype GI.4) strains that served as donors for the non-structural part while GI.2 composed the structural part; another recombination event has also been described at the p16/p23 junction involving GI.4 strains. In this study, we analysed new complete coding sequences of four benign GI.3 strains and four GI.2 strains. Phylogenetic and recombination detection analyses revealed that the first GI.2 strains, considered as non-recombinant, resulted from a recombination event between GI.3 and GI.2, with GI.3 as the major donor for the non-structural part and GI.2 for the structural part. Our results indicate that recombination contributed to the emergence, persistence and dissemination of GI.2 as a pathogenic form and that all described GI.2 strains so far are the product of recombination. This highlights the need to study full-genomic sequences of lagoviruses to understand their emergence and evolution.","Abrantes, Joana; Droillard, Clément; Lopes, Ana M.; Lemaitre, Evelyne; Lucas, Pierrick; Blanchard, Yannick; Marchandeau, Stéphane; Esteves, Pedro J.; Le Gall-Reculé, Ghislaine",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879332/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71303-4,272

Two hundred thirty-two students who registered as second-year students in the 2015 academic year, and third-year students in the 2016 academic year, and fifty patients in six catchment areas of the Faculty of Medicine Hospital, MSU, participated in the study. Six steps of IPE implementation were involved. They were conducted by twenty-four teachers from three faculties, twelve health volunteers in six communities, and five municipality officers. After the IPE activities, students showed significant improvement in their attitudes towards collaborative teamwork. Their performance with regard to IPE home-based care for medical patients improved substantially from year 2 to year 3 (73.4% and 80.9%, p = 0.001). Patients and community representatives were satisfied with students’ home visits, and scored them at > 80%. The after-action review among all of the teachers provided information about their views on IPE projects and their recommendations with respect to inter-professional education. IPE schemes can produce beneficial effects for students, teachers, and patients in the community. As a study result of MSU experience, we recommended IPE for higher education institutions.","Ploylearmsang, Chanuttha; Tongsiri, Sirinart; Pirikannont, Mathee; Srisaknok, Tharinee",Med Sci Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-021-01244-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643683/,272

684307,Optimal utilization of MSK imaging during COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-17,"The Covid-19 pandemic produced more significant immediate intergovernmental conflict in the U.S. than in Australia and Canada. This article considers three variables for this cross-national divergence: presidentialism versus parliamentarism; vertical party integration; and strength of intergovernmental arrangements. We find that the U.S. presidential system, contrary to parliamentarism in Canada and Australia, provided an opportunity for a populist outsider skeptical of experts to win the presidency and pursue a personalized style that favored intergovernmental conflict in times of crisis. Then, the intergovernmental conflict-inducing effect of the Trump presidency during the pandemic was compounded by the vertical integration of political parties, which provided incentives for the President to criticize Democratic governors and vice-versa. Third, the virtual absence of any structure for intergovernmental relations in the United States meant that, unlike Australian states and Canadian provinces, American states struggled to get the federal government’s attention and publicly deplored its lack of leadership.","Lecours, André; Béland, Daniel; Fenna, Alan; Fenwick, Tracy Beck; Paquet, Mireille; Rocco, Philip; Waddan, Alex",Publius,https://doi.org/10.1093/publius/pjab010,272

In this paper, we show that ebselen and silver ion in combination exert strong bactericidal activity against multidrug‐resistant (MDR) uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) BC1, a model MDR GSH‐positive bacterium. The mechanisms were found to involve consumption of total intracellular GSH and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase activity, which was highly related to reactive oxygen species up‐regulation. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of ebselen and silver ion against UPEC‐induced cystitis was assessed in a mouse model. Treatment with ebselen and silver ion significantly reduced bacterial loads, down‐regulated the expression levels of tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) and interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) on‐site and decreased white/red blood cell counts in mild cystitis model mice, which demonstrated the anti‐inflammatory property of these agents. In addition, ebselen and silver ion also exhibited significantly high protective ability (100%) against acute cystitis infections. These results together may lay the foundation for further analysis and development of ebselen and silver ion as antibacterial agents for treatment of MDR UPEC infections.","Wang, Peng; Wang, Jun; Xie, Zonglan; Zhou, Jingxuan; Lu, Qianqian; Zhao, Ying; Dong, Chuanjiang; Zou, Lili",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975381/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.15920,272
686369,Identifying Factors Important to Patients for Resuming Elective Imaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-02,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. The common methods to monitor and quantitate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cell culture are so far time-consuming and labor-intensive. Using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system, we generated a robust and versatile reporter cell system that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments compatible for high-throughput and live cell imaging. The reporter cell is based on lung derived A549 cells, which show a profound interferon response and convenient cell culture characteristics. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were introduced for constitutive expression in A549 cells. Subclones with varying levels of ACE2/TMPRSS2 were screened for optimal SARS-CoV2 susceptibility. Furthermore, extensive evaluation demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected reporter cells were distinguishable from mock-infected cells and already showed approximately 12 h post infection a clear signal to noise ratio in terms of cell roughness, fluorescence and a profound visible cytopathic effect. Moreover, due to the high transfection efficiency and proliferation capacity, Sleeping Beauty transposase-based overexpression cell lines with a second inducible fluorescence reporter cassette (eGFP) can be generated in a very short time, enabling the investigation of host and restriction factors in a doxycycline-inducible manner. Thus, the novel reporter cell line allows rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the screening for host factors essential for viral replication. Highlights - Sleeping Beauty transposon-based cellular system was used to generate a highly susceptible cell line for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection - The versatile reporter cell line A549-AT is suitable for rapid and sensitive high-throughput assays - Additional gene specific expression cassettes allow the identification of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and restriction factors","Widera, Marek; Wilhelm, Alexander; Toptan, Tuna; Raffel, Johanna M.; Kowarz, Eric; Roesmann, Fabian; Siemund, Anna Lena; Luciano, Vanessa; Külp, Marius; Reis, Jennifer; Bracharz, Silvia; Pallas, Christiane; Ciesek, Sandra; Marschalek, Rolf",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.441606,272

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR, admitted to ICU between March and April 2020 were enrolled. At ICU admission, BALF were analyzed by flow cytometry. Univariate, multivariate and Spearman correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled, median age of 64 years (IQR 58–69). The majority cells in the BALF were neutrophils (70%, IQR 37.5–90.5) and macrophages (27%, IQR 7–49) while a minority were lymphocytes, 1%, TCD3+ 92% (IQR 82–95). The ICU mortality was 32.8%. Non-survivors had a significantly older age (p = 0.033) and peripheral lymphocytes (p = 0.012) were lower compared to the survivors. At multivariate analysis the percentage of macrophages in the BALF correlated with poor outcome (OR 1.336, CI95% 1.014–1.759, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients, BALF cellularity is mainly composed of neutrophils and macrophages. The macrophages percentage in the BALF at ICU admittance correlated with higher ICU mortality. The lack of lymphocytes in BALF could partly explain a reduced anti-viral response.","Dentone, Chiara; Vena, Antonio; Loconte, Maurizio; Grillo, Federica; Brunetti, Iole; Barisione, Emanuela; Tedone, Elisabetta; Mora, Sara; Di Biagio, Antonio; Orsi, Andrea; De Maria, Andrea; Nicolini, Laura; Ball, Lorenzo; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Magnasco, Laura; Delfino, Emanuele; Mastracci, Luca; Mangerini, Rosa; Taramasso, Lucia; Sepulcri, Chiara; Pincino, Rachele; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Bruzzone, Bianca; Icardi, Giancarlo; Frisoni, Paolo; Gratarola, Angelo; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06015-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858331/,272

The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting. We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges. METHODS: Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers’ instructions. RESULTS: The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours. Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company. Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours. Serological testing revealed positive for both patients. All others showed negative IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers. This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.","Baettig, Sascha J; Parini, A; Cardona, I; Morand, G B",BMJ Mil Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303575/,272

However, jurisdictional governments -- such as cities, counties, states, and countries -- act with minimal coordination across borders. We show that a regional quarantine policy's effectiveness depends upon whether (i) the network of interactions satisfies a balanced-growth condition, (ii) infections have a short delay in detection, and (iii) the government has control over and knowledge of the necessary parts of the network (no leakage of behaviors). As these conditions generally fail to be satisfied, especially when interactions cross borders, we show that substantial improvements are possible if governments are outward-looking and proactive: triggering quarantines in reaction to neighbors' infection rates, in some cases even before infections are detected internally. We also show that even a few lax governments -- those that wait for nontrivial internal infection rates before quarantining -- impose substantial costs on the whole system. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding contagion across policy borders and offer a starting point in designing proactive policies for decentralized jurisdictions.","Chandrasekhar, Arun G.; Goldsmith-Pinkham, Paul; Jackson, Matthew O.; Thau, Samuel",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10745v5.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021520118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906950/,272

To determine the effects of Stxbp6 loss on nervous-system-associated phenotypes and underlying mechanisms, we constructed a global Stxbp6-knockout mouse. We found that Stxbp6-null mice survive normally, with normal behavior, but gained less weight relative to age- and sex-matched wildtype mice. RNA-seq analysis of the cerebral cortex of Stxbp6-null mice relative to wildtype controls identified 126 differentially expressed genes. Of these, 57 were upregulated and 69 were downregulated. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the most significant enriched KEGG term was “complement and coagulation cascades”. Our results suggest some potential regulatory pathways of Stxbp6 in the central nervous system, providing a remarkable new resource for understanding Stxbp6 function at the organism level.","Liu, Cong; Hu, Qian; Chen, Yan; Wu, Lingqian; Liu, Xionghao; Liang, Desheng",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805317/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11040436,272

Therefore, based on the effectiveness and economy of TCM, we aimed to determine the situation of health economic studies about antivirals, especially the difference between TCM and non-TCM. METHODS: A literature search of three databases was conducted with a time range of January 2000–December 2020, and terms related to health economics and TCM were used as key terms. QHES and CHEERS were used as quality assessment tools. RESULTS: 203 papers were included in our research. After evaluation using QHES and CHEERS, antiviral TCM obtained an overall score of 41.37 ± 4.46/99 in QHES, compared with 48.89 ± 7.25/99 (18.18% higher than TCM) of antiviral non-TCM. CONCLUSION: With a statistically significant difference, the overall quality of pharmacoeconomic research about antiviral non-Chinese medicine is better than that about antiviral Chinese medicine, which may have resulted from researchers' capacities or the absence of a more suitable standard for pharmacoeconomic research. It tells that the quality of pharmacoeconomic studies about TCM still warrants improvement.","Zhang, Junliang; Bai, Qian; Bian, Ying",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5537435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335816/,272

Older individuals are at higher risk compared with younger adults and children due to the presence of weaker immune functions. Healthcare workers are also at higher risk due to close proximity with the infected cases. Proper precautions and hand hygiene techniques can prevent the transmission of the disease. There is a dearth of evidence on how to manage the disease; therefore, protective measures might help to reduce the spread of infection. This article aimed to evaluate the preventive measure and use of protective equipment among healthcare workers and community settings. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Various recent literature searched in the following databases—Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus—recommendations from centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) reports on preventive measures of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: After reviewing the previous literature, we summarized proper precautions and hygiene techniques, use of PPE and applicability of surgical and N95 (can block 95% small particles but not resistant to oil) masks to prevent the transmission of disease. CONCLUSION: This viewpoint can be considered as a unique example of information on infection control and protective measures.

Metabolic alterations of HSV-1-infected neurons: studies using the PC12 cell as a model system,1985-12-31,"Background: Recent evidence showed substantial negative mental health outcomes associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, including trauma-related symptoms although the effects on the Italian population who were subjected to unprecedented nationwide lockdown measure remains unknown. The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed at examining the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and at evaluating trauma-related symptoms in the Italian population in the context of specific COVID-19 related risk factors associated with the implementation of lockdown measures and social distancing. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based observational study, as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. 18147 participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analyses. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported both a two-factor and a three-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a one-factor solution that was used as a baseline comparison showed acceptable fit indices, the two-factor solution showed good fit indices, but the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (avoidance, re-experiencing, hyperarousal and insomnia) and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors as well as specific COVID-19 related stressful events, were associated with GPS total as well as the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice.","Rossi, R.; Socci, V.; Talevi, D.; Niolu, C.; Pacitti, F.; Di Marco, A.; Rossi, A.; Siracusano, A.; Di Lorenzo, G.; Olff, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.20118935v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.20118935,272

COVID-19 can cause multiple organ dysfunction, such as respiratory and circulatory failure, liver and kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolism, and even death. The World Health Organization reports that the mortality rate of severe-type COVID-19 is over 50%. Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited. Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19. To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19.

We present a comprehensive synthesis of evidence regarding the value and impact of nudges to address VH. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to determine if nudging can mitigate VH and improve vaccine uptake. Our search strategy used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH terms to identify articles related to nudging and vaccination in nine research databases. 15 177 titles were extracted and assessed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The final list of included articles was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. FINDINGS: Identified interventions are presented according to a framework for behaviour change, MINDSPACE. Articles (n=48) from 10 primarily high-income countries were included in the review. Nudging-based interventions identified include using reminders and recall, changing the way information is framed and delivered to an intended audience, changing the messenger delivering information, invoking social norms and emotional affect (eg, through storytelling, dramatic narratives and graphical presentations), and offering incentives or changing defaults. The most promising evidence exists for nudges that offer incentives to parents and healthcare workers, that make information more salient or that use trusted messengers to deliver information. The effectiveness of nudging interventions and the direction of the effect varies substantially by context. Evidence for some approaches is mixed, highlighting a need for further research, including how successful interventions can be adapted across settings. CONCLUSION: Nudging-based interventions show potential to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, but further evidence is needed for the development of clear recommendations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increases the urgency of undertaking nudging-focused research.

690242,Angiotensin-(1-7)—A Potential Remedy for AKI: Insights Derived from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-13,"BACKGROUND: In face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the question that children are also drivers of this pandemic and that groups, classes, or the entire facility should be closed when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs in schools or daycare centers is always implied. These questions were investigated using the mandatory reporting data in Frankfurt am Main and the extensive testing of contact persons (CP) in schools and daycare centers after the occurrence of an index case. METHOD: The reporting data were taken from SurvStat. The index cases from daycare centers and schools were isolated and the CPs were offered PCR testing for SARS-CoV‑2 on a voluntary basis, regardless of whether symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV‑2 had occurred or not. Deep nasal/pharyngeal swabs were collected by paramedics on behalf of the public health department of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and tested according to established standards at two accredited institutes. RESULTS: From March to 31 December 2020, 22,715 COVID-19 cases were reported in Frankfurt, including 1588 (7.6%) SARS-CoV‑2 detections in children 14 years and younger. Thus, approximately half as many SARS-CoV‑2 detections were reported in children up to 14 years of age than would have corresponded to their proportion in the population. In autumn 2020, the increase in incidence in children over the weeks followed the increase in incidence in the general population, the age-related incidence of children remained below the incidence in the general population. From week 35 to week 52, index cases were reported from 143 daycare centers and 75 schools. As a result, 7915 CPs were tested. In daycare centers, SARS-CoV‑2 was detected in 4.5% of adult CPs and 2.5% of child CPs and in schools SARS-CoV‑2 was detected in 0.9% of adult CPs and 2.5% of student CPs tested. On average, less than 1 CP tested positive per index case. The rate of positive findings increased with increasing incidence in the overall population. No major outbreak occurred. DISCUSSION: Regarding the level and timing of age-related incidences among children in Frankfurt am Main, there was no evidence that children were the drivers of the pandemic. Only a small percentage of the examined CPs in schools and daycare centers tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2. In the absence of evidence of intense transmission in the facilities, CP attendance can/should continue under hygiene conditions and there is no need to close entire groups, classes, or even facilities.","Heudorf, Ursel; Steul, Katrin; Walczok, Antoni; Gottschalk, Rene",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00112-021-01134-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678906/,272
690464,COVID‐19 and sports medicine research,2020-06-25,"The goal of this study is to investigate the probable intermediate hosts and the allergenicity of the notorious virus SARS-CoV-2 to understand how this virus emerged. The phylogenetic analysis of the virus spike proteins indicates that SARS-CoV-2 falls into various small subclades that include a bat coronavirus RaTG13, suggesting bats as a likely natural origin. Refined alignment of the spike protein in NCBI found several fragments that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and/or SARS-CoV are specific to Rattus norvegicus and/or Mus musculus, suggesting that rodents are the intermediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To evaluate the allergenicity values, the binding affinities of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I or II molecules with the spike proteins were calculated, and the results showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are predicted to bind to fourteen HLA class I and II molecules with super-high HLA allele-peptide affinities. The infection rate of individuals who have HLA alleles with very high binding affinities who might become infected and develop into refractory patients if there were no medical or non-medical interventions is about 7.36% and 4.78% of Chinese and Americans, respectively. Extremely high temperature and exceptionally low precipitation, the common climate factors between the outbreak sites of COVID-19 in Wuhan in 2019 and SARS in Guangdong in 2002, might have promoted coronavirus evolution into more virulent forms. Our hypothesis suggests that early immunization with an allergenically-engineered virus, in combination with continued surveillance of meteorological factors and viral mutations, may be one of the most powerful prophylactic modalities to fight this virus.","Huang, Yuyi; Xie, Junmou; Guo, Yuhe; Sun, Weimin; He, Ying; Liu, Kequn; Yan, Jie; Tao, Ailin; Zhong, Nanshan",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574906/,272
690769,FACING DEMENTIA DURING THE COVID‐19 OUTBREAK,2020-06-09,"As a first-line treatment for diabetes, the insulin-sensitizing biguanide, metformin, regulates glucose levels and positively affects cardiovascular function in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular complications. Endothelial dysfunction (ED) represents the primary pathological change of multiple vascular diseases, because it causes decreased arterial plasticity, increased vascular resistance, reduced tissue perfusion and atherosclerosis. Caused by “biochemical injury”, ED is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Accumulating evidence shows that metformin improves ED through liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/5'-adenosine monophosphat-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-independent targets, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). Evaluating the effects of metformin on endothelial cell functions would facilitate our understanding of the therapeutic potential of metformin in cardiovascular diabetology (including diabetes and its cardiovascular complications). This article reviews the physiological and pathological functions of endothelial cells and the intact endothelium, reviews the latest research of metformin in the treatment of diabetes and related cardiovascular complications, and focuses on the mechanism of action of metformin in regulating endothelial cell functions.","Ding, Yu; Zhou, Yongwen; Ling, Ping; Feng, Xiaojun; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying; Little, Peter J.; Xu, Suowen; Weng, Jianping",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.64706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646376/,272
