5390,Interaction between the learners’ initial grasp of the object of learning and the learning resource afforded,2013-01-23,"Weapons of both defense and offense have grown steadily in their effectiveness—especially since the industrial revolution. The mass destruction of humanity, by parts or in whole, became reality with the advent of toxic agents founded on chemistry and biology or nuclear weapons derived from physics. The military’s new non-combat roles, combined with a quest for non-lethal weapons, may change the picture in regard to conventional defense establishments but are unlikely to deter bellicose tyrants or the new terrorists from using the unlimited potential of today’s and tomorrow’s arsenals. The author addresses the issues that are raised by this developing situation with the intent of seeking those ethics that will enable us to survive in a future and uncertain world.","Richardson, Jacques G.",Sci Eng Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089138/,482

In this prospective study, 71 patients with azoospermia were subjected to an extensive andrological workup including comprehensive microbiological diagnostics (2‐glass test, semen, testicular swab and testicular tissue analysis) and testicular biopsy/testicular sperm extraction (TESE). Medical history suggested urogenital tract infection/inflammation in 7% of patients, 11% harboured STIs, 14% showed significant bacteriospermia, 15% had seminal inflammation, 17% fulfilled the MAGI definition, and 27% had relevant pathogens. At the testicular level, 1 patient had a swab positive for bacteria, no viruses were detected, tissue specimens never indicated pathogens, whereas histopathology revealed focal immune cell infiltrates in 23% of samples. Testicular sperm retrieval rate was 100% in obstructive and 46% in nonobstructive azoospermia. None of the infection/inflammation‐related variables was associated with the success of sperm retrieval or inflammatory lesions in the testis. The high prevalence of urogenital infection/inflammation among azoospermic men underpins their role as significant aetiologic factors in male infertility. However, this observation does not refer to the chances of sperm retrieval at the time of surgery/TESE.","Pilatz, Adrian; Kilb, Jill; Kaplan, Huelya; Fietz, Daniela; Hossain, Hamid; Schüttler, Christian G.; Diemer, Thorsten; Bergmann, Martin; Domann, Eugen; Weidner, Wolfgang; Wagenlehner, Florian; Schuppe, Hans-Christian",Andrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147116/,482

Die entzündlichen Veränderungen der Nasenschleimhäute bei chronischer Rhinosinusitis mit Nasenpolypen (CRSwNP) sind in den meisten Fällen vom Entzündungsendotyp 2 (T2). Methoden Der aktuelle Wissensstand sowohl zu COVID-19 als auch zu den Behandlungsmöglichkeiten von CRSwNP wurde durch eine Literaturrecherche in Medline, Pubmed, internationalen Leitlinien, der Cochrane Library und im Internet analysiert. Ergebnisse Auf Grundlage der internationalen Literatur, der aktuellen Empfehlungen der WHO und anderer internationaler Organisationen sowie der bisherigen Erfahrungen gab ein Expertengremium von EAACI und ARIA Empfehlungen für die Behandlung von CRSwNP während der COVID-19-Pandemien. Schlussfolgerung Intranasale Kortikosteroide stellen die Standardbehandlung für CRS bei Patienten mit einer SARS-CoV-2-Infektion dar. Chirurgische Behandlungen sollten auf ein Minimum reduziert werden und nur bei Patienten mit lokalen Komplikationen und solchen, für die keine anderen Behandlungsmöglichkeiten bestehen, durchgeführt werden. Systemische Kortikosteroide sollten bei COVID-19-Patienten vermieden werden.

15203,Article 4: Impact assessment of supervision performance assessment and recognition strategy (SPARS) to improve supply chain management in health facilities in Uganda: a national pre and post study,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Using telemedicine for diabetic retinal screening is becoming popular especially amongst at-risk urban communities with poor access to care. The goal of the diabetic telemedicine project at Temple University Hospital is to improve cost-effective access to appropriate retinal care to those in need of close monitoring and/or treatment. METHODS: This will be a retrospective review of 15 months of data from March 2016 to May 2017. We will investigate how many patients were screened, how interpretable the photographs were, how often the photographs generated a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on the screening photo, and how many patients followed-up for an exam in the office, if indicated. RESULTS: Six-hundred eighty-nine (689) digital retinal screening exams on 1377 eyes of diabetic patients were conducted in Temple’s primary care clinic. The majority of the photographs were read to have no retinopathy (755, 54.8%). Among all of the screening exams, 357 (51.8%) triggered a request for a referral to ophthalmology. Four-hundred forty-nine (449, 32.6%) of the photos were felt to be uninterpretable by the clinician. Referrals were meant to be requested for DR found in one or both eyes, inability to assess presence of retinopathy in one or both eyes, or for suspicion of a different ophthalmic diagnosis. Sixty-seven patients (9.7%) were suspected to have another ophthalmic condition based on other findings in the retinal photographs. Among the 34 patients that were successfully completed a referral visit to Temple ophthalmology, there was good concordance between the level of DR detected by their screening fundus photographs and visit diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although a little more than half of the patients did not have diabetic eye disease, about half needed a referral to ophthalmology. However, only 9.5% of the referral-warranted exams actually received an eye exam. Mere identification of referral-warranted diabetic retinopathy and other ophthalmic conditions is not enough. A successful telemedicine screening program must close the communication gap between screening and diagnosis by reviewer to provide timely follow-up by eye care specialists.","Benjamin, James E.; Sun, Justin; Cohen, Devin; Matz, Joseph; Barbera, Angela; Henderer, Jeffrey; Cheng, Lorrie; Grachevskaya, Julia; Shah, Rajnikant; Zhang, Yi",BMC Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7859899/,482
15354,The intertwining of world news with Sustainable Development Goals: An effective monitoring tool,2021-02-05,"Recent advances in computational methods have enabled the predictive design of self-assembling protein nanomaterials with atomic-level accuracy. These design strategies focus exclusively on a single target structure, without consideration of the mechanism or dynamics of assembly. However, understanding the assembly process, and in particular its robustness to perturbation, will be critical for translating this class of materials into useful technologies. Here we investigate the assembly of two computationally designed, 120-subunit icosahedral complexes in detail using several complementary biochemical methods. We found that assembly of each material from its two constituent protein building blocks was highly cooperative and yielded exclusively complete, 120-subunit complexes except in one non-stoichiometric regime for one of the materials. Our results suggest that in vitro assembly provides a robust and controllable route for the manufacture of designed protein nanomaterials and confirm that cooperative assembly can be an intrinsic, rather than evolved, feature of hierarchically structured protein complexes.","Wargacki, Adam J.; Wörner, Tobias P.; van de Waterbeemd, Michiel; Ellis, Daniel; Heck, Albert J.

The term apoptosis was first coined in 1972 by Kerr et al.1 to describe the morphologic features of a type of cell death that is distinct from necrosis and is today considered to represent programmed cell death. In fact, the evidence that a genetic program existed for physiologic cell death came from the developmental studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.2 As time has progressed, however, apoptotic cell death has been shown to occur in many cell types under a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions. Cells dying by apoptosis exhibit several characteristic morphologic features that include cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, nuclear and cellular fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, and eventual phagocytosis of the fragmented cell (Figure 4.1).","Saikumar, Pothana; Kar, Rekha",Molecular Pathology of Lung Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147438/,482

Objective: To discuss the implementation of international and local recommendations, and any additional actions undertaken at our Neonatal Unit in order to prepare for COVID-19. Discussion: Standard precautions in order to prepare a facility and its personnel to safely care for COVID-19 patients as outlined by the World Health Organization procedures have been implemented. Further actions undertaken in our Neonatal Unit included the creation of standard operating procedures, increased communication between neonatal and obstetric teams, limiting staff exposure, the creation of disposable resuscitation boxes to attend deliveries, reallocation of a triage area in the high care ward to an isolation area for sick newborns of suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19 cases, staff training on personal protective equipment procedures and initiation of an online resources portal for neonatal staff. Conclusion: A rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines as well as ongoing education should diminish anxiety amongst health-care professionals and provide the best possible care to patients. South Africa is a low-to-middle income country, and the lack of resources available means we cannot increase our capacity, staffing numbers or available equipment.

Additionally, a fault injection tool was also developed to facilitate the study of said modules alongside a fault categorization system to help the treatment module select the best course of action. The results obtained show the potential of the developed work, with it being able to detect all the injected faults during the tests in a small enough time frame to be able to adequately treat these faults.","Garrido, Daniel; Ferreira, Leonardo; Jacob, João; Silva, Daniel Castro",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302236/,482
36869,Online Gamified Learning Platforms (OGLPs) for Participatory Learning,2020-06-05,"As described in the previous chapter, most kinase inhibitors that have been developed for use in the clinic act by blocking ATP binding; however, there is growing interest in identifying compounds that target kinase activities and functions without interfering with the conserved features of the ATP-binding site. This chapter will highlight alternative approaches that exploit unique kinase structural features that are being targeted to identify more selective and potent inhibitors. The figure below, adapted from (Sammons et al., Molecular Carcinogenesis 58:1551–1570, 2019), provides a graphical description of the various approaches to manipulate kinase activity. In addition to the type I and II inhibitors, type III kinase inhibitors have been identified to target sites adjacent to the ATP-binding site in the catalytic domain. New information on kinase structure and substrate-binding sites has enabled the identification of type IV kinase inhibitor compounds that target regions outside the catalytic domain. The combination of targeting unique allosteric sites outside the catalytic domain with ATP-targeted compounds has yielded a number of novel bivalent type V kinase inhibitors. Finally, emerging interest in the development of irreversible compounds that form selective covalent interactions with key amino acids involved in kinase functions comprise the class of type VI kinase inhibitors.","Martinez, Ramon; Defnet, Amy; Shapiro, Paul",Next Generation Kinase Inhibitors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7359047/,482

One of these was to identify which was the best terminal disinfection strategy for hospital rooms of a COVID-19. Description of the problem. Our University Hospital adopted ozone disinfection two years ago, recognized internationally as a 'safe gas' and is an excellent disinfectant for its characteristics of attacking and oxidizing each type of organic and inorganic compound and specifically also works against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 23 ozone generators were purchased, 20 ozonizers were assigned to departments with high environmental sanitation needs, 3 ozonizers supplied to the ozonator team. For the correct use of the equipment, 200 operators were trained in a certified way. The rooms are ozonated with pre-established frequency and whenever a COVID-19 patient is cared for. The ozonation team sanitizes rooms in wards that are not equipped but that may have hosted patients with carriers. Indications have been given in all the wards to create the ozonation room, that can be used as an ozone disinfection chamber, where it is possible to place garrisons and furnishings, even large-sized, that cannot be disinfected in other ways (in addition to sanitization with hypochlorite). The team also provides for the ozonation of ambulances with a predetermined periodicity or in the case of transport of patient carrying SARS-CoV-2. All activities are monitored with a special traceability card. LESSONS: Terminal disinfection of environments that have hosted patients with COVID-19. Terminal disinfection of the devices used on patients with COVID-19. Increased safety for operators carrying out environmental sanitation. KEY MESSAGES: Fight SARS-COV-2 with ozone. Disinfecting with ozone is safety for everyone.","De Caro, F; Moccia, G; Borrelli, A; Annecchiarico, A; Cioffi, G; Campanella, A; Motta, O; Caputo, V; Boccia, G; Capunzo, M",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543395/,482

It is important to develop a deeper understanding of the carcinogenesis of ampullary cancer. We attempted to explore the characteristics of ampullary cancer in our dataset and a public database, followed by a search for potential drugs. We used a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze complementary (c)DNA microarray data of ampullary cancer and surrounding normal duodenal tissues from five patients. A public database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) was applied for external validation. Bioinformatics tools used included the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), MetaCore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Hallmark, BioCarta, Reactome, and Connectivity Map (CMap). In total, 9097 genes were upregulated in the five ampullary cancer samples compared to normal duodenal tissues. From the MetaCore analysis, genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-regulated lipid metabolism were overexpressed in ampullary cancer tissues. Further a GSEA of the KEGG, Hallmark, Reactome, and Gene Ontology databases revealed that PPARA and lipid metabolism-related genes were enriched in our specimens of ampullary cancer and in the NCBI GSE39409 database. Expressions of PPARA messenger (m)RNA and the PPAR-α protein were higher in clinical samples and cell lines of ampullary cancer. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, including alvespimycin, trichostatin A (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), and cytochalasin B, may have novel therapeutic effects in ampullary cancer patients as predicted by the CMap analysis. Trichostatin A was the most potent agent for ampullary cancer with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of < 0.3 μM. According to our results, upregulation of PPARA and lipid metabolism-related genes are potential pathways in the carcinogenesis and development of ampullary cancer.

Evaluation of serology assays with well-characterized serum and/or plasma samples is critical to determine assay performance.

METHODS: Positive (n=30) serum samples with a range of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (Table) and negative (n=80) serum and/or plasma samples were selected to establish performance evaluation panels (PEVs). Three PEVs with similar overall antibody titer distribution have been created. Negative samples were collected prior to 2020, before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Positive samples were from patients previously confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 using a nucleic acid amplification test. Each sample was characterized at CDC and NCI-FNLCR for presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies using a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NCI-FNLCR also performed a SARS-CoV-2 spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG ELISA. Positive samples were assessed at multiple dilutions. Manufacturers submitted their serology assays for evaluation by this program. The sensitivity of each test was assessed for each antibody class (IgG and IgM) and in a combined manner, where a positive result for either antibody was considered as a positive result. For combined specificity, a negative result meant a sample was negative for both antibodies (IgG and IgM). Number of positive samples with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies for each panel (n=30) [Image: see text] RESULTS: To date, 53 serology assays have been evaluated. Sensitivity ranged from 30.0% to 100% for IgG, from 10.0% to 100% for IgM, and the combined specificity ranged from 57.5% to 100%. For 2 assays that measure total Ig, sensitivity was 96.7% and 100%. CONCLUSION: This program completed over 50 performance evaluations with well-characterized PEVs. Results have been used to inform FDA regulatory decisions and are publicly available on FDA’s website.

In this paper, we consider vector addition systems with states over a parameterized initial configuration. For these systems, we are interested in the standard notion of computational time complexity, i.e., we want to understand the length of the longest trace for a fixed vector addition system with states depending on the size of the initial configuration. We show that the asymptotic complexity of a given vector addition system with states is either [Formula: see text] for some computable integer k, where N is the size of the initial configuration, or at least exponential. We further show that k can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the considered vector addition system.

It has been known for decades that microbes and viruses are rapidly inactivated when exposed to copper and its alloys. Consequently, the use of thermal spray technologies to coat surfaces in healthcare and public settings has been receiving a considerable amount of interest during recent viral pandemics and particularly now with COVID-19. This review is focused on recent successes using thermal spray technology to uniformly coat metal and organic surfaces, providing a rapid and economical means of inhibiting fomite transmission of pathogens on diverse surfaces with complex topographies. Emphasis is placed on the influence of lamella structure, porosity, and roughness of the coatings as it pertains to biocidal activity and the implications of using this knowledge to optimize the ability of copper coatings to irreversibly inactivate viral pathogens, regardless of their genomic mutation rates. Results of the long-term performance of the copper alloy coatings in real hospital settings in Canada and Peru are also presented.","Mostaghimi, J.; Pershin, L.; Salimijazi, H.; Nejad, M.; Ringuette, M.",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914122/,482

The spatial dimension of local content policies is the main aspect dictating local content policy implementation. The national content policy advocates for the whole nation, while the community content advocates for the host community and the regional content advocates for a regional integration mechanism of neighbouring states in local content implementation. The spatial dimension of local content policies provides a trajectory on issues such as the resource curse and how countries spiral to this uncertainty. It should be noted that justice has developed the spatial dimension to advocate for a collective effort in local population integration into the oil and gas industry. The chapter also shows some authors' debates that local content policies deter further investments because they increase costs for the multinational corporations, while governments are not ready to leave the foreign investors to design what should be regarded as content in local content due to the fears of re-visiting the failures of corporate social responsibility mechanisms in developing resource-rich countries.

In this work, we present a new tool created to simulate the operation of a full-fledged service system and failure of its specific elements. The main feature of the solution we created is in the provision of abstraction for the developer, which does not require a deep understanding of the work of network infrastructures. It allows us to compare the work of several distributed applications under the same conditions, check the stability of the programme regarding the unstable operation of network elements, study the influence of the network structure on the of services behaviour and detect their vulnerabilities associated with interservice interaction.","Iakushkin, Oleg; Malevanniy, Daniil; Pavlova, Ekaterina; Fatkina, Anna",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974919/,482
48417,Remote consultations,2021-03-19,"The main objective of this project, carried out in an industrial context, was to apply a multivariate analysis to variables related to the specifications required for the production of an agricultural tire and the dimensional test results. With the exploratory data analysis, it was possible to identify strong correlations between predictor variables and with the response variables of each test. In this project, the principal component analysis (PCA) serves to eliminate the effects of multicollinearity. The use of regression analysis was intended to predict the behavior of the agricultural tire considering the selected variables of each test. In the case of Test 1, when applying the Stepwise methods to select the variables, the model with the lowest value of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was achieved with the technique “Both”. However, the lowest value of AIC for Test 2 was achieved with “Backward”. Regarding the validation of assumptions, both Test 1 and Test 2 were validated. Therefore, all the quantitative variables are important, both in Test 1 and Test 2, because they are a linear combination that determines the principal components. In order to make it easier to compute predictions for future agricultural tires, an application that was developed in Shiny allows the company to know the behavior of the tire before it was produced. Using the application, it is possible to reduce the industrialization time, materials and resources, thus increasing efficiency and profits.","Antunes, Ana Rita; Braga, Ana Cristina",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974942/,482

48593,Embeddedness of Economic Reforms in Regional Political Climate: A Case of Delayed Reforms in Bihar’s Electricity Sector,2021-01-16,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-2019 pandemic continues to restrict access to endoscopy, resulting in delays or cancellation of non-urgent endoscopic procedures. A delay in the removal or exchange of plastic biliary stents may lead to stent occlusion with consensus recommendation of stent removal or exchange at three-month intervals [1–4]. We postulated that delayed plastic biliary stent removal (DPBSR) would increase complication rates. AIMS: We aim to report our single-centre experience with complications arising from DPBSR. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study. All subjects who had ERCP-guided plastic biliary stent placement in Halifax, Nova Scotia between Dec 2019 and June 2020 were included in the study. DPBSR was defined as stent removal >=90 days from insertion. Four endpoints were assigned to patients: 1. Stent removed endoscopically, 2. Died with stent in-situ (measured from stent placement to documented date of death/last clinical encounter before death), 3. Pending removal (subjects clinically well, no liver enzyme elevation, not expired, endpoint 1 Nov 2020), and 4. Complication requiring urgent reintervention. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to represent duration of stent patency (Fig.1). RESULTS: 102 (47.2%) had plastic biliary stents placed between 2/12/2019 and 29/6/2020. 49 (48%) were female, and the median age was 68 (R 16–91). Median follow-up was 167.5 days, 60 (58.8%) subjects had stent removal, 12 (11.8%) died before replacement, 21 (20.6%) were awaiting stent removal with no complications (median 230d, R 30–332), 9 (8.8%) had complications requiring urgent ERCP. Based on death reports, no deaths were related to stent-related complications. 72(70.6%) of patients had stents in-situ for >= 90 days. In this population, median time to removal was 211.5d (R 91-441d). 3 (4.2%) subjects had stent-related complications requiring urgent ERCP, mean time to complication was 218.3d (R 94–441). Stent removal >=90 days was not associated with complications such as occlusion, cholangitis, and migration (p=1.0). Days of stent in-situ was not associated with occlusion, cholangitis, and migration (p=0.57). Sex (p=0.275), cholecystectomy (p=1.0), cholangiocarcinoma (p=1.0), cholangitis (p=0.68) or pancreatitis (p=1.0) six weeks prior to ERCP, benign vs. malignant etiology (p=1.0) were not significantly associated with stent-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic biliary stent longevity may have been previously underestimated. The findings of this study agree with CAG framework recommendations [5] that stent removal be prioritized as elective (P3). Limitations include small sample size that could affect Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Despite prolonged indwelling stent time as a result of COVID-19, we did not observe an increased incidence of stent occlusion or other complications.

In this chapter, I propose transferring this logic to the measurement of tourism income, as part of national GDP. Many countries boast high percentages of tourism GDP, with subsequent direct, indirect and induced effects. However, there is a question of how much of that income is sustainable and genuine and how much cost that income incurs during the process of its generation and consumption.

The restrained state, in an effort to avoid taking responsibility for inherent vulnerability, obscures its existence by instead promoting a temporally artificial concept of autonomous and self-sufficient personhood.

It furthers our understanding of resilience processes underlying the outcomes of wellness, recovery, and growth/development among older persons facing multimorbidity. In addition, a multimorbidity resilience index comprising functional, social, and psychological domains capturing both adversity and adaptation is described. The results of criterion validation of the index based on health care utilization and health status outcomes is presented, and offers support for this measure. Further confirmatory research is needed for both the LMMR and the multimorbidity resilience index using other known population health data sets. This relevance of multimorbidity resilience has been increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Research is also warranted using different populations and sub-populations as well as clinical settings.","Wister, Andrew V.",Resilience and Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979977/,482

They host self-employed professionals, freelancers, entrepreneurs, and employees of large enterprises in the same office environment with shared facilities. Recently coworking spaces have become the primary location for many entrepreneurs as they offer a resourceful environment. However, how coworking spaces enable their participants to access various resources is an open question. In this chapter, we study two prominent and distinctly different coworking spaces in Istanbul. In analyzing our empirical data, we employ the forms of capital framework of Bourdieu (The forms of capital. In J. G. Richardson (Ed.), Handbook of theory and research for the sociology of education (pp. 241–258). Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1986) to understand the underlying mechanisms of resource acquisition enabled by coworking spaces. Based on our results, we develop a theoretical framework explaining what mechanisms cultivate tangible and intangible resources for the participants of coworking spaces. We outline our contributions and potential lines for further research.","Güneştepe, Kutay; Topal, Zehra; Tunçalp, Deniz",New Ways of Working,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979979/,482

Alas! This was not to be! Officially, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December 2019. The impact has been catastrophic, with the entire world affected. Through event study, document and critical discourse analysis methods, the chapter looks at the preparedness, response and recovery measures put in place to deal with COVID-19. It emerged that countries responded differently, some late and some in panic. The main goal was to “flatten” the curve as infections skyrocketed, leading to deaths. The COVID-19 pandemic also placed severe economic burdens to countries across the world. The global epicentre of the pandemic kept shifting, starting in China, moving to Italy, and then to the USA. As the chapter was being completed, Russia had become the second in terms of infections after the USA. The COVID-19 early intervention measures mainly focused on handwashing, promotion of sneezing and coughing etiquette, mask-wearing and social distancing. However, as it became clearer that the pandemic continued spreading, additional measures, including full national lockdowns, were instituted. Since the world was still experiencing lockdowns, amidst other countries moving into the recovery phases, the chapter recommends the sharing of COVID-19 preparedness, response, and recovery strategies and plans. The world is encouraged to consider the COVID-19 within the broader realm of the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and also work with the WHO as the custodian of global health matters. Lastly, international protocols on certain disease outbreaks with potential to balloon into global pandemics such as coronaviruses must be refined to force countries and territories to notify the WHO earlier after a certain threshold of such diseases’ outbreak has been reached.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980020/,482

This is true for species in ecosystems as it is for molecules in cells, tissues, and organisms. Yet, the same way different species are linked by common ancestors and may be grouped in taxonomic classes according to common characteristics they share, molecules may be grouped in classes and classified according to common chemical and physical characteristics. One of such characteristics is solubility in water (in other words: how polar atoms are distributed in the 3D structure of molecules). One class of biological molecules, the lipids, includes only low water solubility (“hydrophobic”) molecules, this being the characteristic that defines this class. Other classes include molecules that are mostly moderately or highly soluble in water and can be recognized for the dominant presence of specific chemical groups: OH in saccharides (also referred to as “carbohydrates”) and a combination of amino and carboxyl groups in amino acids. Lipids, saccharides, and amino acids may combine with molecules of its own class to form either polymers (molecules formed by successively covalently attaching smaller molecules), such as polysaccharides and proteins, or supramolecular assemblies (organized arrangements of molecules that are in contact but are not covalently attached), such as the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. It is common to find molecules and supramolecular assemblies that combine elements from different classes, such as nucleotides, which contain saccharides. Proteins are extremely versatile in this regard because proteins’ interactions with saccharides, lipids, and nucleic acids (nucleotide polymers) are ubiquitous in virtually all cells. Figure 3.1 depicts the basic principles that support the organization of biological molecules in different classes.","Da Poian, Andrea T.; Castanho, Miguel A. R.

Our earth is inhabited by numerous varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms besides humans. But human beings are considered as one of the most intelligent living organisms who has been exploiting the nature for his own benefit and disturbing the ecological balance of our ecosystem. Industrialization and globalization although are considered the primers in development of human civilizations but have gradually increased the carbon footprints and have generated many environmental problems like change in climate, extinction of many varieties of flora and fauna, pollution, etc. The development of science and technology has become a part and parcel of our lives today and we cannot sustain without them. The onset of corona pandemic in the world has clearly depicted the harm done by man to the environment. Clear sky, fresh air, calm surroundings, cleaner rivers, reduced waste, repairing of ozone hole, early monsoons, increase in wildlife sightings, undisturbed habitat for marine life, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter, etc., were some of the most visible changes noticed during the lockdown due to coronavirus which acted as an opportunity for repairing our Mother Nature. But COVID-19 pandemic has also brought many problems like unemployment, psychological problems, economic crisis, massive cuts in agriculture and fishery exports levels, generation of unrecyclable waste, rise in clinical waste, etc. The estimation of deaths due to coronavirus is difficult but according to world health organization (WHO) due to ailments caused by air pollution about 3 million people die each year which is more than the coronavirus toll to date. No doubt that the effects of the lockdown will be short-lived and economic activities resumption will again increase emission levels and it will wipe out all gains. Industries will make up their lost time by increasing production and pollution level will return to its pre-pandemic stage. Governments will face a shortage of resources to invest in clean energy which will increase the use of fossil fuels. So, need of the hour is to maintain improvements achieved due to lockdowns permanently and develop technologies that are eco friendly which can help in environmental sustainability. Some of the methods for environmental sustainability are electrification of transport, partial lockdowns in emergency situations, work from home wherever possible, use of clean energies, forests conservation, waste management, etc. No doubt, coronavirus is life threatening disaster but it has given us an opportunity to understand and differentiate between our needs and luxuries at individual levels leading to environmental sustainability at various levels such as community, state and global levels.

50179,Webinars,2021-02-23,"Sustainability has endured as a global topic in terms of quality of life and energy-saving for an equalized system. Households represent one of the most energy-consuming sectors globally and are expected to increase tremendously in the future. Women have higher responsibility in the household energy use in most societies. However, their participation and impacts have been less prioritized in the sustainability concept regarding energy perspective. In contrast, most development studies reveal that women's participation in managing resources can positively impact women and policy management. However, women's active participation and influences on social, economic, and environmental contexts are mostly ignored in energy-related decisions, disregarding women's productive activities. Thus, this study evaluates the gender role in urban household energy in three contexts of economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability pillars. This study is exploratory research based on questionnaire survey, interviews, observation, and air quality tests to apprehend appropriate data. The study revealed that the lower-income group uses a larger share of their monthly income for household energy with unclean cooking fuel. It has an impact on low-willingness to participate in new energy technology purchases. The use of electrical appliances and income has a moderate correlation (r = .48). However, Kathmandu urban households are eager to use electric cooking, but urban women have insufficient knowledge, information, and less affordability for new technology. The city's sustainability level is still low (47 scores) from a gender perspective, and it suggests the city needs a long way on the sustainability route. The study concluded that innovative technical interventions and women's financial power are essential, including the subsidy policy to reduce inequality between low and high energy household share variation and elevate gender participation. The gender mainstreaming approach in energy policy can increase women's participation in energy technology to get a clean environment and reduce the nation's financial burden of importing fuel.

Although many fear that these responses, and the large‐scale increase in bank reserves especially, must eventually cause unwanted inflation, the concurrent sharp decline in money's velocity has thus far more than offset any inflationary effects of money growth, while forward bond prices reflect a general belief that inflation will remain below 2 per cent for at least another decade. Notwithstanding the growth of the Fed's balance sheet, Fed authorities can always check inflation by sufficiently raising the interest return on bank reserves.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic-assisted pyeloplasty. METHODS: Patients’ demographics, clinical presentations and treatment outcomes are recorded. The cohort is classified into 3 groups based on type of surgical treatment offered including open, laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted pyeloplasty. All patients admitted with grade 3-4 hydronephrosis due to UPJO are included. Patients with UPJO as part of a complex multisystemic syndrome are excluded. Literature review was conducted from 2000/1/1 to 2020/1/1 to include all original research papers on surgical management of UPJO. The age group was limited to neonates (under 1 year-old). RESULTS: 32 articles were included in the review. 20 papers (62.5%) recommended open pyeloplasty, 10 papers (31.3%) recommended laparoscopic pyeloplasty and 2 papers (6.25%) recommended laparoscopic-assisted pyeloplasty. The cohort study is currently recruiting patients treated by the 3 surgical approaches. CONCLUSION: The majority of studies are focusing on open pyeloplasty. However, as more surgeons are going through the learning curve of laparoscopic pyeloplasty, the trend is towards more laparoscopic management in the future. It is important to discover the advantages of laparoscopic-assisted approach as a new technique to improve the outcome and shorten the hospital stay amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sherafat, Alireza; Ashraf, Mohammad Ali; Ahmadian, Sarina; Sarian, Arni; Ramezannezhad, Elham; Foroutan, Hamid Reza; Hiradfar, Mehran; Sherafat, Alireza",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030214/,482

This study assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students and interim foundation year doctors across the United Kingdom (UK), and the support that they received and sought. METHOD: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted. All medical students and interim foundation year doctors were eligible to participate. RESULTS: A total of 2075 individuals participated. There was a decrease in participants’ mood when comparing their mood before the pandemic to during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Social distancing negatively impacted the mood of the greatest number of participants. All areas of life included in the study were found to have been significantly more negatively impacted than positively impacted (p < 0.0001). 931 participants wanted more support from their university.

In this study, we investigated whether the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) contributes to the development of myocardial MIRI by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis. Our in vitro data demonstrate that cardiomyocyte viability was reduced and apoptosis was increased in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. However, suppression of LATS2 by shRNA sustained cardiomyocyte viability by maintaining mitochondrial function. Compared to H/R-treated control cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes transfected with LATS2 shRNA exhibited increased mitochondrial respiration, improved mitochondrial ATP generation, and more stable mitochondrial membrane potential. LATS2 suppression increased cardiomyocyte viability and mitochondrial biogenesis in a manner dependent on PGC1α, a key regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. These results identify LATS2 as a new inducer of mitochondrial damage and myocardial MIRI and suggest that approaches targeting LATS2 or mitochondrial biogenesis may be beneficial in the clinical management of cardiac MIRI.","Chen, Yi; Liu, Chen; Li, Jiannan; Zhou, Peng; Zhao, Xiaoxiao; Chen, Runzhen; Song, Li; Zhao, Hanjun; Yan, Hongbing",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390173/,482

In the same way, it can be a potential threat to body image. The aim of the study was to explore associations between depressive symptoms, dietary intake, and body image during coronavirus disease 2019 quarantine. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 589 Peruvian adults, 297 men (50.4%) and 292 women (49.6%). The mean age was 30.2 ± 9.4 years (range: 18–59 years). Participants completed three questionnaires, including a food frequency questionnaire, the Body Shape Questionnaire, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moreover, sociodemographic data were collected. The data were analyzed using the statistical software IBM SPSS version 24, and the chi-square test was used. A significance level of 5% was considered. RESULTS: A total of 37.7% and 43.6% of the women reported depressive symptoms and dissatisfaction with body image, respectively. Depressive symptoms were associated with dietary intake and dissatisfaction with body image (p < 0.05). Dissatisfaction with body image was associated with dietary intake (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology plays an important role in the dietary intake and body image of the study population. It is suggested to address these factors through the implementation of health campaign programs and personalized therapeutic interventions.","León-Paucar, Sheyla D; Calderón-Olivos, Bella C; Calizaya-Milla, Yaquelin E; Saintila, Jacksaint",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511913/,482
60790,David Oliver: Detoxifying DNACPR decisions.,2020-10-28,"Background To retrospectively evaluate several clinical indicators related to the improvement of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT. Methods A total of 62 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. The CT scores based on lesion patterns and distributions in serial CT were investigated. The improvement and deterioration of pneumonia was assessed based on the changes of CT scores. Grouped by using the temperature, serum lymphocytes and high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) on admission respectively, the CT scores on admission, at peak time and at discharge were evaluated. Correlation analysis was carried out between the time to onset of pneumonia resolution on CT images and the recovery time of temperature, negative conversion of viral nucleic acid, serum lymphocytes and hs-CRP. Results The CT scores of the fever group and lymphopenia group were significantly higher than those of normal group on admission, at peak time and at discharge; and the CT scores of normal hs-CRP group were significantly lower than those of the elevated hs-CRP group at peak time and at discharge (P all<0.05). The time to onset of pneumonia resolution on CT image was moderately correlated with negative conversion duration of viral nucleic acid (r =0.501, P<0.05) and the recovery time of hs-CPR (r =0.496, P<0.05). Conclusions COVID-19 pneumonia patients with no fever, normal lymphocytes and hs-CRP had mild lesions on admission, and presented with more absorption and fewer pulmonary lesions on discharge. The negative conversion duration of viral nucleic acid and the recovery time of hs-CPR may be the indicator of the pneumonia resolution.","Shi, Nannan; Song, Fengxiang; Liu, Fengjun; Song, Pengrui; Lu, Yang; Hou, Qinguo; Hua, Xinyan; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Jiulong; Huang, Chao; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shan, Fei; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Yuxin",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209422/,482

Objectives The present study aimed to determine factors associated with non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and no continued breastfeeding in Haryana. Methods National Family Health Survey-4 data for the state of Haryana was used for analysis. The outcomes were non-initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth, no EBF, and no continued breastfeeding. Independent variables were categorized as sociodemographic, maternal, and child level factors. Each category of factors was added step-by-step to the logistic regression model for multivariable analysis. Results Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was higher among poorer wealth quintiles. Home deliveries (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.27-2.84), cesarean section (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI-1.46-3.40), body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI-1.13-2.33), and not receiving postnatal check-up (AOR 1.36, 95% CI-1.40-1.78) increases likelihood of delayed initiation of breastfeeding beyond 1 h of birth. Increased risk of non-EBF was associated with no postnatal check-ups and BMI >25 kg/m2. Risk of discontinuation of breastfeeding was significantly high with birth interval of <2 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI-1.08-2.14) and if babies did not receive postnatal check-up (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI-1.04-2.27). Conclusion The study highlighted need for focused approach to counsel overweight/obese mothers, cesarean section, and home delivered mothers. Community awareness, adequate birth spacing, and postnatal visits are vital for improving exclusive and continued breastfeeding practices. Communities and health-care providers should provide adequate support to mothers for breastfeeding during the antenatal and postnatal periods.","Sharma, Jyoti; Pandey, Shivam; Negandhi, Preeti",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_406_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985431/,482

Quantitative mass-spectrometry identified how inflammatory murine neutrophils regulated expression of cell surface receptors, signal transduction networks and metabolic machinery to shape neutrophil phenotypes in response to hypoxia. Through the tracing of labelled amino acids into metabolic enzymes, pro-inflammatory mediators and granule proteins we demonstrated that ongoing protein synthesis shapes the neutrophil proteome. To maintain energy supplies in the tissues, neutrophils consumed extracellular proteins to fuel central carbon metabolism. The physiological stresses of hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, characteristic of inflamed tissues, promoted this extra-cellular protein scavenging with activation of the lysosomal compartment further driving exploitation of the protein rich inflammatory milieu. This study provides a comprehensive map of neutrophil proteomes, analysis of which has led to the identification of active catabolic and anabolic pathways which enable neutrophils to sustain synthetic and effector functions in the tissues.","Watts, Emily R; Howden, Andrew Jm; Morrison, Tyler; Sadiku, Pranvera; Hukelmann, Jens L; von Kriegsheim, Alex; Ghesquière, Bart; Murphy, Fiona; Mirchandani, Ananda S; Humphries, Duncan C; Grecian, Robert; Ryan, Eilise M; Coelho, Patricia; Rodriguez-Blanco, Giovanny; Plant, Tracie M; Dickinson, Rebecca S; Finch, Andrew J; Vermaelen, Wesley; Cantrell, Doreen A; Whyte, Moira Kb; Walmsley, Sarah R",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci134073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822765/,482

73475,Conceptual Issues in COVID-19 Pandemic: An Example of Global Catastrophic Risk.,2021-01-01,"Összefoglaló. A COVID-19 mortalitását a súlyos társbetegségek, közöttük bizonyos daganatos betegségek is növelik. Immunszuppresszív hatásuk miatt felmerülhet a citotoxikus kezelések rizikónövelő hatása is. Ugyanakkor az onkológiai terápia megszakítása vagy halasztása, különösen az agresszívebb, kiterjedtebb és fiatalkorban jelentkező daganatok esetében ronthatja a kórjóslatot. Egy 39 éves nőbeteg esetét ismertetjük. A járvány során késlekedve felismert, lokoregionálisan kiterjedt emlődaganat miatt primer szisztémás kemoterápiában részesült. A kezelés 5. ciklusa során enyhe légúti tünetek kapcsán, az onkológiai ambulancián SARS-CoV-2-fertőzése igazolódott. Kemoterápiás kezelését felfüggesztettük. A diagnózistól számított 3. napon tünetmentessé vált, ám SARS-CoV-2-PCR-pozitivitása még a 43. napon is fennállt. A 19. napon hormongátló kezelést indítottunk. Az 51. napon mastectomia és axillaris block dissectio történt. A 82. napon a megszakított kemoterápiát a hormongátló kezelés leállítását követően G-CSF-profilaxis mellett újraindítottuk. A kezelés során fertőzéses szövődményt nem észleltünk. Kemoterápia és műtét SARS-CoV-2-fertőzött, tünetmentes daganatos betegnél szövődménymentesen végezhető elhúzódó virológiai pozitivitás esetén, felszabadító vizsgálat nélkül is. A daganatos betegek koronavírus-fertőzése esetén az onkológiai protokolltól történő eltérés egyénre szabott optimalizálásával és a multidiszciplináris team szorosabb együttműködésével az infektológiai és az onkológiai kockázat együttes alacsonyan tartása is megvalósítható. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(16): 611-614. Summary. Mortality of COVID-19 is increased when certain co-morbidities, among others advanced malignancies are present. Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51. Chemotherapy was reset postoperatively on day 82 with prophylactic G-CSF protection. No adverse event was observed throughout the treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery can be successfully delivered in breast cancer patients with prolonged asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, even without negative swab result. Individual optimisation of the therapy may require deviations from standard protocols. Closer multidisciplinary cooperation may contribute to the minimisation of both oncologic and infectious risks.

73567,Three millimeter needlescopic splenectomy using three-port technique: report of three cases.,2021-08-01,"Bacterial biofilms are communities of bacteria entangled in a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM). Escherichia coli direct the assembly of two insoluble biopolymers, curli amyloid fibers, and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose, to build remarkable biofilm architectures. Intense curiosity surrounds how bacteria harness these amyloid-polysaccharide composites to build biofilms, and how these biopolymers function to benefit bacterial communities. Defining ECM composition involving insoluble polymeric assemblies poses unique challenges to analysis and, thus, to comparing strains with quantitative ECM molecular correlates. In this work, we present results from a sum-of-the-parts 13 C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis to define the curli-to-pEtN cellulose ratio in the isolated ECM of the E. coli laboratory K12 strain, AR3110. We compare and contrast the compositional analysis and comprehensive biofilm phenotypes for AR3110 and a well-studied clinical isolate, UTI89. The ECM isolated from AR3110 contains approximately twice the amount of pEtN cellulose relative to curli content as UTI89, revealing plasticity in matrix assembly principles among strains. The two parent strains and a panel of relevant gene mutants were investigated in three biofilm models, examining: (a) macrocolonies on agar, (b) pellicles at the liquid-air interface, and (c) biomass accumulation on plastic. We describe the influence of curli, cellulose, and the pEtN modification on biofilm phenotypes with power in the direct comparison of these strains. The results suggest that curli more strongly influence adhesion, while pEtN cellulose drives cohesion. Their individual and combined influence depends on both the biofilm modality (agar, pellicle, or plastic-associated) and the strain itself.","Jeffries, Jamie; Thongsomboon, Wiriya; Visser, Joshua Alan; Enriquez, Kyle; Yager, Deborah; Cegelski, Lynette",Biopolymers,https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.23395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894594/,482

Previous research has demonstrated that the opportunity for cross-species transmission and parasite adaptation can play an important role in determining if and when a host shift occurs. Another possibility is that the genetic basis of infection and resistance, when coupled with the process of coevolution (i.e., coevolutionary genetics), plays a pivotal role in determining when, if ever, a host shift occurs. Here we explore this possibility by developing and analyzing a genetically explicit epidemiological model that allows for coevolution and alternative forms of infection genetics. Approximate analytical solutions to this model demonstrate that infection genetics can influence the likelihood of a host shift. Stochastic simulations confirm the important role of infection genetics but in some cases reveal that coevolutionary dynamics modulate the likelihood of host shifts. Our results demonstrate that predicting host shifts requires a detailed understanding of the underlying genetics of infection and resistance. Thus, identifying the genetic architecture of infection and resistance in real systems is of central importance.","Poullain, Virginie; Nuismer, Scott L",The American naturalist,https://doi.org/10.1086/667889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23070322/,482

The two genotypes most frequently found in the lesions are HPV-16 and HPV-18 with a prevalence of 50-60% and 15-18%, respectively. The E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins are involved in the transformation process and represent foreign antigens for the host. We previously reported that anti-HPV-18 E6 CD4(+) T cells are present in patients with high-grade HPV-18-expressing cervical lesions but also in 50% of the total consecutive patients tested, independently of the HPV type carried. These results indicated that HPV-18 E6 is immunogenic and suggested that all responsive patients, irrespective of the HPV expressed, had encountered HPV-18 and cleared the infection. Here, we investigated anti-HPV-18 E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in a cohort of 23 HPV-18 E6-responsive patients. We found that, although E7-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in all women, a robust T helper type (Th1)/Th2 type response against E7 was associated with HPV-18-negative status, suggesting that indeed these patients might have cleared the virus. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found strong anti-E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in 20% of 24 healthy donors without evidence of disease. In contrast, a robust Th1/Th2 type response against E6 but not E7 correlated with a lack of disease relapse and/or infection recurrence but did not discriminate between HPV-18-positive and HPV-18-negative patients. Collectively, our data suggest different roles for anti-HPV-18 E6 and E7 CD4(+) T cells in anti-viral and anti-tumour immunity.","Seresini, Samantha; Origoni, Massimo; Caputo, Luigi; Lillo, Flavia; Longhi, Renato; Vantini, Simone; Paganoni, Anna Maria; Protti, Maria Pia",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2010.03277.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20545782/,482
80243,After COVID-19: The Way We Die from Now On.,2021-01-01,"Cu, Zn, and amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their interaction indeed modifies the self-assembly propensity of the peptide that is at the origin of the deposition of insoluble peptide aggregates in the amyloid plaque, a hallmark found in AD brains. Another even more important fallout of the Cu binding to Aβ peptide is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to the overall oxidative stress detected in the disease and is due to the redox ability of the Cu ions. Many therapeutic approaches are currently developed to aid fighting against AD, one of them targeting the redox-active Cu ions. Along this research line, we report in the present article the use of a phenanthroline-based peptide-like ligand (L), which is able to withdraw Cu from Aβ and redox-silence it in a very stable 4N Cu(II) binding site even in the presence of Zn(II). In addition and in contrast to what is usually observed, the presence of excess of L lessens the searched effect of ROS production prevention, but it is counterbalanced by the co-presence of Zn(II). To explain such unprecedented trends, we proposed a mechanism that involves the redox reaction between Cu(II)L and Cu(I)L2. We thus illustrated (i) how speciation and redox chemistry can weaken the effect of a ligand that would have appeared perfectly suitable if only tested in a 1:1 ratio and on CuAβ and (ii) how Zn overcomes the undesired lessening of ROS arrest due to excess of ligand. In brief, we have shown how working in biologically relevant conditions is important for the understanding of all of the reactions at play and this must be taken into consideration for the further rational design of ligands aiming to become drug candidates.","Esmieu, Charlène; Balderrama-Martínez-Sotomayor, Raúl; Conte-Daban, Amandine; Iranzo, Olga; Hureau, Christelle",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400522/,482

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are very important. OBJECTIVE To provide an update on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children. METHODS A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key term ""communityacquired pneumonia"". The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. Patents were searched using the key term ""community-acquired pneumonia"" from www.google.com/patents, http://espacenet.com, and www. freepatentsonline.com. RESULTS Generally, viruses, notably respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common cause of community- acquired pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause across all age groups. Other important bacterial causes in children younger than 5 years include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In children 5 years or older, in addition to S. pneumoniae, other important bacterial causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. In the majority of cases, bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably distinguished from each other on clinical grounds. In practice, most children with pneumonia are treated empirically with antibiotics; the choice of which depends on the patient's age and most likely pathogen. Recent patents related to the management of community-acquired pneumonia are discussed. CONCLUSION In previously healthy children under the age of 5 years, high dose amoxicillin is the treatment of choice. For those with type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives. For children with a non-type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin, cephalosporins such as cefixime, cefprozil, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime should be considered. In previously healthy children over the age of 5 years, macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are the drugs of choice.","Leung, Alexander K C; Wong, Alex H C; Hon, Kam L",Recent patents on inflammation & allergy drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.2174/1872213x12666180621163821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29932038/,482

90804,David Oliver: Should we allow filming in covid filled hospitals?,2021-01-20,"CASE DESCRIPTION 3 unrelated, densely populated, dynamic ferret populations with severe outbreaks of enteric coccidiosis were evaluated. CLINICAL FINDINGS In each outbreak, morbidity rate was high, there were an appreciable number of deaths, and ferrets of all ages were affected. Affected individuals had acute onset of diarrhea, and feces often contained frank or digested blood. Other clinical signs included dehydration, weakness, lethargy, and weight loss. Fecal examinations of affected ferrets revealed sporadic and inconsistent shedding of coccidial oocysts. Necropsy findings included moderate to marked atrophic enteritis associated with numerous intraepithelial and fewer extracellular coccidial life stages. Sporulated oocysts isolated from feces were consistent with Eimeria furonis. A PCR assay was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of intestine for the gene encoding the small subunit of rRNA yielded products with sequences identical to those described for E furonis. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Supportive care and treatment with sulfadimethoxine over the course of these outbreaks was palliative, but long-term treatment was required and failed to completely eradicate infection as identified by the subsequent finding of oocysts in fecal samples. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Enteric coccidiosis due to infection with E furonis has typically been reported to be subclinical rather than to cause severe gastrointestinal disease in ferrets. This report indicated that infection with E furonis may have contributed to severe enteric disease with high morbidity and mortality rates in 3 densely populated, dynamic groups of ferrets. Furthermore, long-term treatment with anti-coccidials may be required in outbreak situations, but may be ineffectual in completely eradicating infection.","Sledge, Dodd G; Bolin, Steven R; Lim, Ailam; Kaloustian, Lisa L; Heller, Ruth L; Carmona, Franklin M; Kiupel, Matti",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.12.1584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22129123/,482
91898,How do your patients use their medicines at home and why is it important to know?,2020-11-01,"INTRODUCTION Radiation dose to the rectum in prostate brachytherapy (PBT) can be reduced by the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel spacers. This reduces the rate of rectal toxicity and allows dose escalation to the prostate. Our objectives were to provide an overview of technique for injection of a PEG hydrogel spacer, reduction in rectal dosimetry, gastrointestinal toxicity and potential complications. METHODS We systematically reviewed the role of PEG hydrogel spacers in PBT using the Cochrane and PRISMA methodology for all English-language articles from January 2013 to December 2019. Data was extracted for type of radiotherapy, number of patients, type of PEG-hydrogel used, mean prostate-rectum separation, rectal dosimetry, acute and late GI toxicity, procedure-related complications and the technique used for hydrogel insertion. RESULTS Nine studies (671 patients and 537 controls) met our inclusion criteria. Of these 4 used DuraSeal® and 5 used SpaceOAR®. The rectal spacing achieved varied between 7.7-16 mm. Failure of hydrogel insertion was seen only in 12 patients, mostly related to failure of hydrodissection in patients undergoing salvage PBT. Where reported, the rectal D2 cc was reduced by between 21.6 and 52.6% and the median rectal V75% cc was reduced by between 91.8-100%. Acute GI complications were mostly limited to grade 1 or 2 toxicity (n = 153, 33.7%) with low levels of grade 3 or 4 toxicity (n = 1, 0.22%). Procedure-related complications were limited to tenesmus (0.14%), rectal discomfort (1.19%), and bacterial prostatitis (0.44%). CONCLUSIONS PEG hydrogel spacers are safe to insert. Gel insertion is easy, fast and has a low rate of failure. These studies convincingly demonstrate a significant reduction in rectal dosimetry. Although the results of spacers in reducing rectal toxicity is promising, these need to be confirmed in prospective randomised trial.","Vaggers, S; Rai, B P; Chedgy, E C P; de la Taille, A; Somani, B K",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-020-03414-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840655/,482

96918,David Oliver: Why polarise healthcare opinions?,2020-09-23,"Greywater reuse can allow substantial improvements in the efficiency of potable water systems. However, widespread uptake of greywater reuse depends on its acceptability by the population. Previous studies have assessed the implementation costs of greywater reuse technology, and considered its acceptability in principle. Although cost is clearly very important in terms of adopting/installing the technology, the actual perception of greywater reuse is crucial in driving the acceptability of use and the long-term success of the technology. This study uses discrete choice models to quantify, for the first time, the preferences of different socio-economic groups for greywater of different quality (colour, odour) and for different uses inside homes. A stated choice survey that removed the influence of installation costs was developed, and implemented in Santiago, Chile. Although legislation allows greywater use in Santiago, it does not take place at any meaningful scale. Results show that, in decreasing order of preference, there is an overall acceptance for using high quality treated greywater for toilet flushing, laundry, garden irrigation, hand washing and, shower/bathtub use, but not for drinking. When the quality of appearance in terms of colour and odour gets worse, monetary incentives could be needed even for those uses that do not involve human contact. Gender, age, educational level, water expenditure level, and in particular previous knowledge about greywater reuse, are important determinants of acceptability and thus willingness to pay for greywater use; however, their importance varies according to the type of use. Our results provide important insights for understanding the conditions that would precipitate rapid and wide uptake of greywater reuse in cities, and thereby make better use of limited water resources.","Amaris, Gloria; Dawson, Richard; Gironás, Jorge; Hess, Stephane; Ortúzar, Juan de Dios",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818743/,482

The relationship between self-reported and performance-based measures of cognitive empathic processes is unclear. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of the association between medical students' empathy scale scores and their empathic performance in a visuospatial perspective-taking (VPT) task. PARTICIPANTS Undergraduate medical students across two European medical schools (n=194). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Two self-report empathy and one performance-based perspective-taking outcome: Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE); Empathy Quotient (EQ); Samson's level-1 VPT task. RESULTS Higher scores on the 'standing in patient's shoes' subscale of the JSPE were associated with a lower congruency effect (as well as lower egocentric and altercentric biases) in the VPT (B=-0.007, 95% CI=-0.013 to 0.002, p<0.05), which reflects an association with better capacity to manage conflicting self-other perspectives, also known as self-other distinction. Lower egocentric bias was also associated with higher scores on the 'social skills' EQ subscale (B=-10.17, 95% CI=-17.98 to 2.36, p<0.05). Additionally, selection of a 'technique-oriented' clinical specialty preference was associated with a higher self-perspective advantage in the VPT, reflecting greater attentional priority given to the self-perspective. CONCLUSIONS We show that self-assessment scores are associated with selected performance-based indices of perspective taking, providing a more fine-grained analysis of the cognitive domain of empathy assessed in medical student empathy scales. This analysis allows us to generate new critical hypotheses about the reasons why only certain self-report empathy measures (or their subscales) are associated with physicians' observed empathic ability.","Bukowski, Henryk; Ahmad Kamal, Nor Faizaah; Bennett, Deirdre; Rizzo, Gabriella; O'Tuathaigh, Colm",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521665/,482

Our study objective was to examine disease patterns and outcome differences between Japanese and non-Japanese patients in a rapidly globalizing nation. METHODS A secondary data analysis of 325 non-Japanese and 13,370 Japanese patients requiring tertiary care or ICU or HCU admission to the ED at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University medical hospital between 2010 to 2019 was conducted. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions models were applied to examine differences in percentage of diagnosis, mortality rates, and length of stay, stratified by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores to consider the impact of language barriers. Sex and age were adjusted. RESULTS Non-Japanese patients had more anaphylaxis, burns, and infectious disease, but less cardiovascular diagnoses prior to adjustment. After adjustment, there were significantly more anaphylaxis (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 4.4) and infectious disease diagnoses (aOR 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.7)), and marginally more burn diagnoses (aOR 2.3 (95% CI: 0.96, 5.3)) over Japanese patients. Regardless of GCS scores, there were no significant differences between non-Japanese and Japanese patient length of stay for anaphylaxis, burn, and infectious disease after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSION There were more non-Japanese patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis, burns, and infectious disease, but no notable patient care differences for length of stay. Further prevention efforts are needed against anaphylaxis, burns, and infectious disease for non-Japanese tourists or residents.","Ishii, Euma; Nawa, Nobutoshi; Matsui, Hiroki; Otomo, Yasuhiro; Fujiwara, Takeo",Journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281150/,482

There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year and adults have two to four. OBJECTIVES To determine whether garlic (allium sativum) is effective for either the prevention or treatment of the common cold, when compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 4), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to December 2011) and AMED (1985 to December 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials of common cold prevention and treatment comparing garlic with placebo, no treatment or standard treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS Of the six trials identified as potentially relevant from our searches, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic intervention group compared with 65 in the placebo group (P < 0.001), resulting in fewer days of illness in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery from an occurrence of the common cold was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, therefore limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self reported episodes of the common cold but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but more studies are needed to validate this finding. Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor-quality evidence.","Lissiman, Elizabeth; Bhasale, Alice L; Cohen, Marc",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006206.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419312/,482

The aim of the study was to test the feasibility and reliability of minilaparoscopic extraperitoneal SLN excision after indocyanine green (ICG) cervical injection using a high-definition near infrared (NIR) imaging system in an in vivo porcine model. The same procedure was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments and both outcomes were compared. Methods Twenty-four animals were equally and randomly divided into a minilaparoscopic group (group A) and a 5-mm conventional laparoscopic group (group B). A high-definition NIR imaging system and a 30° ICG endoscope were used. First, ICG (0.5 mL) was injected in the paracervical region. The SLN coloring time was recorded. An extraperitoneal approach to the SLN was executed with the same CO2 retropneumoperitoneum pressures (10 mm Hg). In both groups, the times for SLN localization and excision, as well as complications, were registered. Finally, a laparotomy was then done to evaluate whether any stained SLN still remained. The same surgical team performed all experiments. Results SLNs were identified and extraperitoneally excised in all animals without major complications. The SLN localization varied between animals from external iliac to preaortic regions. The surgical times were shorter with minilaparoscopy (39.3 ± 13 minutes) than with conventional 5-mm instruments (51.3 ± 14.17 minutes; P = .042). In group B, one stained SLN remained and was only detected by laparotomy. Conclusions We confirmed the feasibility and reliability of extraperitoneal minilaparoscopic approach for identification, dissection, and excision of SLN using an NIR imaging system and ICG.","Ferreira, Hélder; Nogueira-Silva, Cristina; Miranda, Alice; Correia-Pinto, Jorge",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350615620302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26637497/,482

Treatment discontinuation rates in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients are high but may be lower with non-VKA oral anticoagulant agents. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to describe and explore predictors of dabigatran etexilate persistence in patients with newly diagnosed AF over 2 years of follow-up. METHODS Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with AF and ≥1 stroke risk factor were followed up for 2 years. Dabigatran nonpersistence was defined as discontinuation of dabigatran for >30 days. A multivariable Cox regression model included region as well as patient clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to explore predictors of nonpersistence. RESULTS Eligible patients (N = 2,932) took ≥1 dabigatran dose; their mean age was 70.3 ± 10.2 years, and 55.3% were male. The 2-year probability of dabigatran persistence was 69.2%. Approximately 7% switched to a factor Xa inhibitor and 6% to a VKA. Approximately one-third of dabigatran discontinuations were primarily due to serious or nonserious adverse events. Patients from North America had the highest discontinuation risk, and Latin America had the lowest. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic AF and permanent AF were associated with a lower risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. Previous proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk for dabigatran nonpersistence. CONCLUSIONS Probability of treatment persistence with dabigatran after 2 years was approximately 70%. Nearly one-half of the patients who stopped dabigatran switched to another oral anticoagulant agent. Patients from North America, and those with paroxysmal, persistent, or symptomatic AF, may be at a higher risk for discontinuing dabigatran.","Paquette, Miney; Riou França, Lionel; Teutsch, Christine; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Lu, Shihai; Dubner, Sergio J; Ma, Chang Sheng; Rothman, Kenneth J; Zint, Kristina; Halperin, Jonathan L; Huisman, Menno V; Lip, Gregory Y H; Nieuwlaat, Robby",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2017.07.793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935034/,482

The amount of objective data available on durability of suture materials with regard to specific equine physiological conditions is limited. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of various equine physiological and pathological fluids on the rate of degradation of a number of commonly used suture materials. STUDY DESIGN In vitro material testing. METHODS Suture materials were exposed in vitro to physiological fluid, followed by biomechanical analysis. Three absorbable suture materials, glycolide/lactide copolymer, polyglactin 910 and polydioxanone were incubated at 37°C for 7, 14 or 28 days in phosphate-buffered saline, equine serum, equine urine and equine peritoneal fluid from an animal with peritonitis. Five strands of each suture material type were tested to failure in a materials testing machine for each time point and each incubation medium. Yield strength, strain and Young's modulus were calculated, analysed and reported. RESULTS For all suture types, the incubation time had a significant effect on yield strength, percentage elongation and Young's modulus in all culture media (P<0.0001). Suture type was also shown significantly to influence changes in each of yield strength, percentage elongation and Young's modulus in all culture media (P<0.0001). While the glycolide/lactide copolymer demonstrated the highest Day 0 yield strength, it showed the most rapid degradation in all culture media. For each of the 3 material characteristics tested, polydioxanone showed the least variation across the incubation period in each culture medium.

The study examines the selection preferences by considering pair-wise non-bonded interaction energies of adjacent and interacting amino acids present at the interacting site, along with their evolutionary history. MATERIALS AND METHODS For the study, variations in the interacting residues of spike protein (S-Protein) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different coronaviruses were examined. The MD simulation trajectory analysis revealed that, though all the variants studied were structurally stable at their native and bound confirmations, the RBD of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more flexible and more dynamic. Furthermore, a noticeable change observed in the non-bonded interaction energies of the amino acids interacting with the receptor corroborated their selection at respective positions. KEY FINDINGS The conformational changes exerted by the altered amino acids could be the reason for a broader range of interacting receptors among the selected proteins. SIGNIFICANCE The results envisage a strong indication that the residue selection at certain positions is governed by a well-orchestrated feedback mechanism, which follows increased stability and flexibility in the folded structure compared to its evolutionary predecessor.","Aditya Rao, S J; Shetty, Nandini P",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197884/,482

We undertook surveillance throughout 2016 in coastal Kenya, recruiting individuals presenting with acute respiratory illness at nine outpatient health facilities (any age) or admitted to the Kilifi County Hospital (<5 years old). Whole genomes were sequenced for a selected 111 positives; 94 (84.7%) of B/Victoria lineage and 17 (15.3%) of B/Yamagata lineage. Inter-lineage reassortment was detected in ten viruses; nine with B/Yamagata backbone but B/Victoria NA and NP segments and one with a B/Victoria backbone but B/Yamagata PB2, PB1, PA, and MP segments. Five phylogenomic clusters were identified among the sequenced viruses; (i), pure B/Victoria clade 1A (n = 93, 83.8%), (ii), reassortant B/Victoria clade 1A (n = 1, 0.9%), (iii), pure B/Yamagata clade 2 (n = 2, 1.8%), (iv), pure B/Yamagata clade 3 (n = 6, 5.4%), and (v), reassortant B/Yamagata clade 3 (n = 9, 8.1%). Using divergence dates and clustering patterns in the presence of global background sequences, we counted up to twenty-nine independent IBV strain introductions into the study area (∼900 km2) in 2016. Local viruses, including the reassortant B/Yamagata strains, clustered closely with viruses from neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda. Our study demonstrated that genomic analysis provides a clearer picture of locally circulating IBV diversity. The high number of IBV introductions highlights the challenge in controlling local influenza epidemics by targeted approaches, for example, sub-population vaccination or patient quarantine. The finding of divergent IBV strains co-circulating within a single season emphasises why broad immunity vaccines are the most ideal for influenza control in Kenya.","Nyasimi, Festus M; Owuor, David Collins; Ngoi, Joyce M; Mwihuri, Alexander G; Otieno, Grieven P; Otieno, James R; Githinji, George; Nyiro, Joyce U; Nokes, David James; Agoti, Charles N",Virus evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747542/,482

Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.","Linka, Kevin; Peirlinck, Mathias; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Kuhl, Ellen",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2020.1759560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367739/,482

We aimed to quantify the importance of predictors of poor functional outcome despite successful reperfusion. METHODS We analyzed patients from the MR CLEAN Registry between March 2014 and November 2017 with successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction ≥2B). First, predictors were selected based on expert opinion and were clustered according to acquisition over time (ie, baseline patient factors, imaging factors, treatment factors, and postprocedural factors). Second, several models were constructed to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS)). The relative importance of individual predictors in the most extensive model was expressed by the proportion of unique added χ2 to the model of that individual predictor. RESULTS Of 3180 patients, 1913 (60%) had successful reperfusion. Of these 1913 patients, 1046 (55%) were functionally dependent at 90 days (mRS >2). The most important predictors for mRS were baseline patient factors (ie, pre-stroke mRS, added χ2 0.16; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, added χ2 0.12; age, added χ2 0.10), and postprocedural factors (ie, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), added χ2 0.12; pneumonia, added χ2 0.09). The probability of functional independence for a typical stroke patient with sICH was 54% (95% CI 36% to 72%) lower compared with no sICH, and 21% (95% CI 4% to 38%) for pneumonia compared with no pneumonia. CONCLUSION Baseline patient factors and postprocedural adverse events are important predictors of poor functional outcome in successfully reperfused patients with ischemic stroke. This implies that prevention of postprocedural adverse events has the greatest potential to further improve outcomes in these patients.","van de Graaf, Rob A; Samuels, Noor; Chalos, Vicky; Lycklama A Nijeholt, Geert J; van Beusekom, Heleen; Yoo, Albert J; van Zwam, Wim H; Majoie, Charles B L M; Roos, Yvo B W E M; van Doormaal, Pieter Jan; Ben Hassen, Wagih; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik W J; Lingsma, Hester F; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Roozenbeek, Bob",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266905/,482

We developed a group-based, video-call, cognitive well-being intervention; and investigated its acceptability and feasibility; exploring through participants' accounts how the intervention was experienced and used in the pandemic context. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD We recruited adults aged 60+ years with memory concerns (without dementia). Participants completed baseline assessments and qualitative interviews/focus groups before and after the 10-week intervention. Qualitative interview data and facilitator notes were integrated in a thematic analysis. RESULTS 12/17 participants approached completed baseline assessments, attended 100/120 (83.3%) intervention sessions and met 140/170 (82.4%) of goals set. Most had not used video calling before. In the thematic analysis, our overarching theme was social connectedness. Three sub-themes were as follows: Retaining independence and social connectedness: social connectedness could not be at the expense of independence; Adapting social connectedness in the pandemic: participants strived to compensate for previous social connectedness as the pandemic reduced support networks; Managing social connections within and through the intervention: although there were tensions, for example, between sharing of achievements feeling supportive and competitive, participants engaged with various lifestyle changes; social connections supported group attendance and implementation of lifestyle changes. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver by group video-call. We argue that dementia prevention is both an individual and societal concern. For more vulnerable populations, messages that lifestyle change can help memory should be communicated alongside supportive, relational approaches to enabling lifestyle changes.","Cooper, Claudia; Mansour, Hassan; Carter, Christine; Rapaport, Penny; Morgan-Trimmer, Sarah; Marchant, Natalie L; Poppe, Michaela; Higgs, Paul; Brierley, Janine; Solomon, Noa; Budgett, Jessica; Bird, Megan; Walters, Kate; Barber, Julie; Wenborn, Jennifer; Lang, Iain A; Huntley, Jonathan; Ritchie, Karen; Kales, Helen C; Brodaty, Henry; Aguirre, Elisa; Betz, Anna; Palomo, Marina",Dementia,https://doi.org/10.1177/14713012211014382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913362/,482

150023,Another Look at Compassion Fatigue.,2021,"BACKGROUND Pulse pressure variation (PPV) can be used to assess fluid status in the operating room. This measurement, however, is time consuming when done manually and unreliable through visual assessment. Moreover, its continuous monitoring requires the use of expensive devices. Capstesia™ is a novel Android™/iOS™ application, which calculates PPV from a digital picture of the arterial pressure waveform obtained from any monitor. The application identifies the peaks and troughs of the arterial curve, determines maximum and minimum pulse pressures, and computes PPV. In this study, we compared the accuracy of PPV generated with the smartphone application Capstesia (PPVapp) against the reference method that is the manual determination of PPV (PPVman). METHODS The Capstesia application was loaded onto a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. A physiologic simulator including PPV was used to display arterial waveforms on a computer screen. Data were obtained with different sweep speeds (6 and 12 mm/s) and randomly generated PPV values (from 2% to 24%), pulse pressure (30, 45, and 60 mm Hg), heart rates (60-80 bpm), and respiratory rates (10-15 breaths/min) on the simulator. Each metric was recorded 5 times at an arterial height scale X1 (PPV5appX1) and 5 times at an arterial height scale X3 (PPV5appX3). Reproducibility of PPVapp and PPVman was determined from the 5 pictures of the same hemodynamic profile. The effect of sweep speed, arterial waveform scale (X1 or X3), and number of images captured was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. The measurement error (ME) was calculated for each pair of data. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the ability of PPVapp to discriminate a PPVman > 13%. RESULTS Four hundred eight pairs of PPVapp and PPVman were analyzed. The reproducibility of PPVapp and PPVman was 10% (interquartile range, 7%-14%) and 6% (interquartile range, 3%-10%), respectively, allowing a threshold ME of 12%. The overall mean bias for PPVappX1 was 1.1% within limits of -1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.7 to -1.1) to +3.5% (95% CI, +3.2 to +3.8). Averaging 5 values of PPVappX1 with a sweep speed of 12 mm/s resulted in the smallest bias (+0.6%) and the best limits of agreement (±1.3%). ME of PPVapp was <12% whenever 3, 4, or 5 pictures were taken to average PPVapp. The best predictive value for PPVapp to detect a PPVman > 13% was obtained for PPVappX1 by averaging 5 pictures showing a PPVapp threshold of 13.5% (95% CI, 12.9-15.2) and a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.989 (95% CI, 0.963-0.998) with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 94%. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that the Capstesia PPV calculation is a dependable substitute for standard manual PPV determination in a highly controlled environment (simulator study). Further studies are warranted to validate this mobile feature extraction technology to predict fluid responsiveness in real conditions.","Desebbe, Olivier; Joosten, Alexandre; Suehiro, Koichi; Lahham, Sari; Essiet, Mfonobong; Rinehart, Joseph; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000001282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144541/,482

We evaluated a novel technique for routine asleep (i.e. post-induction) nasotracheal intubation using a bougie ('bougie technique'), which uses a nasopharyngeal airway to guide a paediatric bougie nasotracheally for use as a Seldinger tracheal intubation guide. Two hundred and fifty-seven older children (> 8 years) and adults were randomly assigned to videolaryngoscopy-assisted nasotracheal intubation using either the conventional or the bougie technique. The hypothesis was that the bougie technique would result in less nasopharyngeal trauma. The bougie technique was associated with significantly less nasopharyngeal bleeding than the conventional technique at both 60-90 s (55% vs. 68%; p = 0.033) and 5 min (51% vs. 70%; p = 0.002). The severity of bleeding was also significantly less with the bougie technique, with an OR for active bleeding of 0.42 (95%CI 0.20-0.87; p = 0.020) at 60-90 s and 0.15 (95%CI 0.06-0.37; p < 0.0001) at 5 min. Magill forceps were needed significantly less often with the bougie technique (9% vs. 28%, p = 0.0001) and there was no difference in first attempt and overall success rates between the two techniques (p = 0.133 and p = 0.750, respectively). Not only is nasal intubation over a bougie as successful as the conventional technique, it also significantly decreases both the incidence and severity of nasopharyngeal trauma, as well as the need for the use of Magill forceps.","Abrons, R O; Zimmerman, M B; El-Hattab, Y M S",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28921537/,482

While the therapeutic doses of raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhalational anthrax, have been based on pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects, its disposition in children has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Here we evaluate the effect of demographic covariates on the pharmacokinetic disposition of raxibacumab and explore opportunities for the optimization of the paediatric doses. METHODS A population pharmacokinetic model was used as basis for the extrapolation of raxibacumab disposition from adults to children. Different extrapolation scenarios, including weight-banded dosing regimens, were considered to assess the effect of growth and maturation processes on the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest. AUC, Cmax , and the time of serum raxibacumab concentrations greater than or equimolar to the highest serum protective antigen concentrations observed for at least 28 days in any monkey challenged with Bacillus anthracis that died were derived and compared with the currently approved US doses. RESULTS Based on practical considerations, a weight-banded dosing regimen consisting of four dose levels (75 mg/kg for individuals ≤ 1.5 kg, 55 mg/kg for individuals < 10 kg, 45 mg/kg for individuals < 50 kg, 40 mg/kg for all individuals > 50 kg) was necessary to optimize target exposure across the paediatric population. CONCLUSION Age-related maturation processes may affect raxibacumab clearance in young patients. The proposed dosing regimens take into account effects of body weight and maturation processes on the elimination of raxibacumab.","Oosterholt, Sean P; Della Pasqua, Oscar",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974281/,482

Infectious disease of the canine respiratory tract frequently occurs among dogs in groups, in which it is called "" infectious tracheobronchitis"" (ITB). Mortality from ITB is generally negligible, and the clinical importance of CHV as an ITB pathogen is considered to be low. The present report describes a novel ITB outbreak accompanied by death among aged dogs in an animal medical center. Most inpatient dogs had received medications that could induce immunosuppression. CHV was the only pathogen identified, and several CHV isolates were recovered in cell culture. No other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were found. Molecular and serological analyses revealed that the causative CHV isolates were from a single source but that none was a peculiar strain when the strains were compared with previous CHV strains. The virus had presumably spread among the dogs predisposed to infection in the center. The present results serve as a warning to canine clinics that, under the specific set of circumstances described, such serious CHV outbreaks may be expected wherever canine ITB occurs.","Kawakami, Kazuo; Ogawa, Hiroyuki; Maeda, Ken; Imai, Ayako; Ohashi, Emi; Matsunaga, Satoru; Tohya, Yukinobu; Ohshima, Takahisa; Mochizuki, Masami",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02128-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20107103/,482

However, continuous baculovirus production is susceptible to DNA mutation and the subsequent production of defective interfering particles (DIPs). The amount of DIPs produced and their genome length distribution are of great interest not only for Baculoviruses but for many other DNA and RNA viruses. In this work, we elucidate this aspect of virus replication using Baculovirus as an example system and both experimental and modeling studies. The existing mathematical models for the virus replication process consider DIPs as a lumped quantity and do not consider the genome length distribution of the DIPs. In this study, a detailed population balance model for the cell-virus culture is presented, which predicts the genome length distribution of the DIP population along with their relative proportion. The model is simulated using the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, and the results agree well with the experimental results. Using this model, a practical strategy to maintain the DIP fraction to near to its maximum and minimum limits has been demonstrated. This article is protected by copyright.

159089,Nursing in the Church.,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the approach to management of systemic immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic indications in children. Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection while on these agents in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians. METHODS A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring. RESULTS Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for acute infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering. CONCLUSIONS The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.","Reynolds, Sean D; Mathur, Anubhav N; Chiu, Yvonne E; Brandling-Bennett, Heather A; Pope, Elena; Siegel, Michael P; Holland, Kristen E; Paller, Amy S; Siegfried, Elaine C; Tom, Wynnis L; Lara-Corrales, Irene; Tollefson, Megha M; Maguiness, Sheilagh; Eichenfield, Lawrence F; Sugarman, Jeffrey; Frieden, Ilona J; Oza, Vikash S; Cipriano, Sarah D; Huang, Jennifer T; Shah, Sonal D; Lauren, Christine T; Castelo-Soccio, Leslie; McMahon, Patrick; Cordoro, Kelly M",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320494/,482
162395,Service blueprint 4.0: a service design for hotels beyond COVID-19,2021,"A randomized trial allows estimation of the causal effect of an intervention compared to a control in the overall population and in subpopulations defined by baseline characteristics. Often, however, clinical questions also arise regarding the treatment effect in subpopulations of patients, which would experience clinical or disease related events post-randomization. Events that occur after treatment initiation and potentially affect the interpretation or the existence of the measurements are called intercurrent events in the ICH E9(R1) guideline. If the intercurrent event is a consequence of treatment, randomization alone is no longer sufficient to meaningfully estimate the treatment effect. Analyses comparing the subgroups of patients without the intercurrent events for intervention and control will not estimate a causal effect. This is well known, but post-hoc analyses of this kind are commonly performed in drug development. An alternative approach is the principal stratum strategy, which classifies subjects according to their potential occurrence of an intercurrent event on both study arms. We illustrate with examples that questions formulated through principal strata occur naturally in drug development and argue that approaching these questions with the ICH E9(R1) estimand framework has the potential to lead to more transparent assumptions as well as more adequate analyses and conclusions. In addition, we provide an overview of assumptions required for estimation of effects in principal strata. Most of these assumptions are unverifiable and should hence be based on solid scientific understanding. Sensitivity analyses are needed to assess robustness of conclusions.","Bornkamp, Björn; Rufibach, Kaspar; Lin, Jianchang; Liu, Yi; Mehrotra, Devan V; Roychoudhury, Satrajit; Schmidli, Heinz; Shentu, Yue; Wolbers, Marcel",Pharmaceutical statistics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624407/,482

We argue that low government legitimacy hampers coordinated responses to national crises, particularly where political polarization is severe and the crisis response becomes politicized. Low legitimacy can intensify the challenges of poverty and poor infrastructure. An original dataset of daily observations on subnational coronavirus policy and cell phone mobility data, paired with administrative data on cases and deaths, suggests that political divisions influenced governors' policy implementation and citizens' compliance. In departments that opposed the president, policies were more likely to deviate from the stricter national policy while mobility and protest activity were high. In departments aligned with the president, local policy followed national policy and citizens complied with policy and quarantine restrictions for a longer period of time. © The Author(s), 2021.

The difficulties in containing this epidemic are considered to be closely related to the dominance of the neoliberal economic paradigm and to individualist market fundamentalism. In the study, it has been attempt to present that neoliberal policy, which eroded the social security opportunities, provided by the social state, far to respond to the problems of today's world in many ways. Considering the findings of the study, it was concluded that a new economic order should be established with a completely new and impartial perspective. Any economic policy that is implemented without securing the basic needs of the people seems doomed to fail. In order not to experience the difficulties we are in again, the new economic approach that can be created should be in a structure that can be interpreted and stretched in accordance with the realities and dynamics of each state.","Taşkin, Ercan Akinci Özden Sevgi",Kafkas University.

This study aimed to assess fiscal vulnerability to crisis by investigating the Australian economy’s gross public debt, net public debt, and net financial liabilities. We used a threshold regression model and compared results with the baseline deficit–debt framework of analysis. The results of the base model suggested that the economy is fiscally sustainable, and that the primary surplus remains unaffected by increasing levels of public debt. In contrast, the threshold regression model indicated that the increasing level of debt has eroded primary surplus below the threshold level of 30.89% of public debt to GDP. These results need further investigation. Therefore, we modified our basic threshold model to capture budget deficit and surplus as a threshold in response to changes in public debt. The results from the sequential threshold regression model using the debt to GDP ratio and primary budget surplus identifying the periods of 1991, 1992, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2019 as times of likely vulnerability to fiscal crisis. The overall results confirmed that the primary surplus remained sustainable over the estimated threshold level of public debt in all other sample periods and these findings persisted across alternative measures of public debt.","Rajaguru, Gulasekaran Khan Safdar Ullah Habib-Ur Rahman",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070297,482

164457,Intelligent Clinical Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The Introduction highlights broad developments within age studies reflected in this issue of 19. Detecting a shift in emphasis away from concern with representations of the old, it explores heuristic forms of attention to the processes of ageing, its meanings, and its biopolitics across the life course. Queer temporalities are a distinct area of critical interest: the non-normative experiences of time generated through narrative attention to non-aligned age perspectives;subjective immersion in the tempos of later life;and — for more radically experimental writers — deliberate departure from age-related ‘realism’ about time. Fruitful connections are opened up here with queer theory, disability studies, and ‘crip time’ theory, admitting allied investments in diversifying expectations for the temporal horizon and subjective experience of living across time. A second area of concentration activates older perspectives and portrays older subjects as representatives of history in ways that lend critical purchase on the present moment. Contributions to the issue show these deployments of old age as ‘anachronism’ serving a wide variety of political agendas. Considering the articles in their historical context of publication, the Covid-19 pandemic, and testing their political claims against the greater visibility it has given to the precariousness of late life, the Introduction predicts an intensification of interest in the activist credentials of age studies, with stronger emphasis to be expected on frameworks of care.","Small, Helen",19: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Long Nineteenth Century,https://doi.org/10.16995/ntn.4371,482

It affected the economic and social structure worldwide and caused a huge loss of human life. Due to the scarcity of medical infrastructure, it has become nearly impossible to cure every case of COVID-19 and hence the loss of lives is exceedingly increasing. So, if the cases can be forecasted beforehand, proper precautions can be taken on time and thousands of human lives can be saved. In this paper, predictions of the number of coronavirus confirmed cases for the five topmost affected countries across the world have been made. Along with it, a comparative study of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) based LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Model has been carried out. The countries taken into consideration for this paper are USA, India, Brazil, Russia, and France. The models have been used to train the dataset and validate the prediction results against the original data based on the predefined metric of MSE or Mean Squared Error. The prediction results have been visualized graphically and it was inferred that the LSTM model outperformed the ANN model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Sinha, T.; Chowdhury, T.; Shaw, R.

Methods: Individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were selected from the US HealthVerity database (12/10/2020-7/8/2021). COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections were examined in fully vaccinated ([≥]14 days after 2nd dose) IC individuals (IC cohort), 12 mutually exclusive IC condition groups, and a non-IC cohort. IC conditions were identified using an algorithm based on diagnosis codes and immunosuppressive (IS) medication usage. Results: Of 1,277,747 individuals [≥]16 years of age who received 2 BNT162b2 doses, 225,796 (17.7%) were identified as IC (median age: 58 years; 56.3% female). The most prevalent IC conditions were solid malignancy (32.0%), kidney disease (19.5%), and rheumatologic/inflammatory conditions (16.7%). Among the fully vaccinated IC and non-IC cohorts, a total of 978 breakthrough infections were observed during the study period; 124 (12.7%) resulted in hospitalization and 2 (0.2%) were inpatient deaths. IC individuals accounted for 38.2% (N=374) of all breakthrough infections, 59.7% (N=74) of all hospitalizations, and 100% (N=2) of inpatient deaths. The proportion with breakthrough infections was 3 times higher in the IC cohort compared to the non-IC cohort (N=374 [0.18%] vs. N=604 [0.06%]; unadjusted incidence rates were 0.89 and 0.34 per 100 person-years, respectively. Organ transplant recipients had the highest incidence rate; those with >1 IC condition, antimetabolite usage, primary immunodeficiencies, and hematologic malignancies also had higher incidence rates compared to the overall IC cohort. Incidence rates in older ([≥]65 years old) IC individuals were generally higher versus younger IC individuals (<65). Limitations: This retrospective analysis relied on coding accuracy and had limited capture of COVID-19 vaccine receipt. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections are rare but are more common and severe in IC individuals. The findings from this large study support FDA authorization and CDC recommendations to offer a 3rd vaccine dose to increase protection among IC individuals.","Di Fusco, M.; Moran, M.

In the COVID-19 era, the emphasis on same-day discharge has led our institution to approach complex and challenging transfemoral cases through a transradial approach with favorable results. Methods: This is a retrospective review of cases deemed as complex femoral access due to the presence of complete total occlusion (CTOs), limited by patient body habitus or patients with prior endovascular aortic repairs (EVARs), and, thus, necessitated a TRA approach. Details of the patient characteristics and procedure were collected and evaluated. Results: Fifty-four patients underwent ultrasound-guided radial access. The average age was 67 ± 10 years, with 43 patients presenting with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford class 4). The mean height was 173 ± 9 cm and the mean body mass index was 30 ± 4.9 kg/m2. All patients underwent angiography through a transradial approach: 37% of patients had undergone intervention, with the majority of target vessels being iliac and/or femoral arteries;19% of patients were known EVARs with occluded graft limbs, and 22% had occluded surgical grafts. All patients received balloon angioplasty, 55% received mechanical aspiration thrombectomy or atherectomy, and 15% received stenting. The average procedure time was 88 ± 43 minutes with average contrast used of 179 ± 80 ml. The majority of patients were discharged the same day with an outpatient follow-up at one week. Conclusion: Our experience has emphasized the utility, efficacy, and safety in approaching peripheral interventions through distal radial access in obese patients with difficult, unfavorable transfemoral access, allowing same-day discharge and an economically feasible result.","Elmassry, M.; Iskandir, M.; Srivastava, A.; Faragallah, M.; Orellana-Barrios, M.; Carbajal, L.; Khan, S.; Garcia, D.; Shurmur, S.; Ansari, M.",Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2021.06.060,482

It is proven that the leading greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone,influence genetic activity and affect humans. It is also known that because of this effect, water vapor in the Finnish sauna and Russian bath also has a positive impact on a person. In this paper, a comparative analysis of this phenomenon is carried out based on the obtained experimental data. In the first case, the total radiation power (absorption) was calculated in the dipole approximation, taking into account the dipole moment and the resonant frequency of the DNA molecule-the number of all DNA in the cell and all human cells. The emission power of greenhouse gases was determined, taking into account the radiation power in its model spectrum and the coefficient corresponding to the ratio of the integral intensities of the observed spectrum and the spectrum according to the model representations. In the second case, a calculated model of the greenhouse effect was used to estimate the impact on humans of the optical power of radiation in the I.R. region in the band of deformation vibrations of water vapor in the Finnish sauna and Russian bath. This power was calculated using the classical formula for dipole radiation in quantum mechanical analysis. Consequently, the power was determined by the energy of the considered oscillation and the probability of spontaneous transition to the main oscillatory level of water vapor, taking into account humidity and temperature in the Russian bath Finnish sauna. It turned out that the two powers at these given parameters coincide, and they are much larger than the corresponding optical powers for greenhouse (atmospheric) gases falling on a person.","Aleynikov, Y.

Data assessing effectiveness in clinical practice and its stability over time since vaccination and against Delta variants are needed. Methods Using U.S. insurance claims data through July 2021, we identified individuals newly vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S and up to 10 unvaccinated individuals matched exactly by age, sex, date, location, comorbidity index plus 17 COVID-19 risk factors via propensity score (PS) matching. We estimated Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for observed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related hospitalization, nationwide and stratified by age, immunocompromised status, calendar time, and states with high incidence of the Delta variant. We corrected VE estimates for under-recording of vaccinations in insurance data. Results Among 390,517 vaccinated and 1,524,153 matched unvaccinated individuals, VE was 79% (95% CI, 77% to 80%) for COVID-19 and 81% (79% to 84%) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. VE was stable over calendar time. Among states with high Delta variant incidence, VE during June/July 2021 was 78% (73% to 82%) for infections and 85% (73% to 91%) for hospitalizations. VE for COVID-19 was higher in individuals <50 years (83%; 81% to 85%) and lower in immunocompromised patients (64%; 57% to 70%).

These three narratives offer three different recipes to address economic, social and ecological goals, thus promoting different pathways for sustainability transformations. We employ the well-known Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (The Natural Step Framework) to comparatively identify the relative and integrated contribution of the three narratives for global net sustainability. We conclude that none of the three narratives, individually, offer a comprehensive ‘package’ of solutions. However, when considered jointly as collaborative narratives, they point towards a society and economy based on renewable/reproductive and biodiversity-based/benign processes, delivering material and immaterial benefits that fulfil the economic and social requirements of all people now and in the future. While the complementary understanding of the circular economy, bioeconomy and green economy provides important guidelines for sustainability transformations post-Covid-19, there is a need for more holistic, systems-wide and integrative research work on potentially competing or supplementary sustainability narratives.

Most endoscopy units restrict their activity based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis. (Objective) To determine the consequences of endoscopic restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on digestive cancer diagnosis. (Design) A comparison of upper digestive endoscopies and colonoscopies with gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed between three endoscopic centers, two of which restricted their procedures and one that did not but performed the procedures under a strict protocol. (Setting) A retrospective analysis was performed collecting data between 15 March 2019 and 15 August 2020. Two-factor ANOVA and a Tukey’s a posteriori test were used as statistical tests. (Main outcome measures) There was variation in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis between 2019 and 2020, considering the endoscopic procedures performed each year. (Result) There was a significant decrease in the total endoscopic procedures performed between 2019 and 2020 (p <0.001), the result of reduced testing at the two centers (p <0.001) with pre-endoscopic restrictions, which was not compensated for by a slight increase in procedures at the center without restrictions (p = 0.139). Regarding the total cancers diagnosed, while a significant decrease was observed for the two centers with pre-endoscopic restrictions (p = 0.007), a significant increase was registered in the center that maintained its endoscopic productivity (p <0.001). After 851 procedures (537 upper digestive endoscopies and 314 colonoscopies) there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in the endoscopic staff. (Conclusion) Endoscopic restrictions based on pre-endoscopic diagnosis should be reassessed in consideration of local pandemic situations, and a balance should be sought between COVID-19 infection risk and the detrimental delay of potential cancer diagnosis.","Bresky, Emilio Bresky Gustavo Lancellotti Domingo Madariaga Juan Licuime Sebastian Palma Paulette Saez Fabian Rojas Maria Jose Seijas Luis",Gastroenterology Insights,https://doi.org/10.3390/gastroent12030034,482

El creciente número de personas en estas condiciones, así como sus dificultades en la vida y en el trabajo, son cuestiones sociales centrales en el mundo actual. Los estudios publicados en esta edición exploran cómo los refugiados y las personas desplazadas -una población aún poco estudiada, pero que crece en todo el planeta - pueden ser plenamente integrados, socializados, involucrados, acogidos y afianzados en el lugar de trabajo y en la sociedad, considerando el contexto brasileño. Poco se sabe sobre las experiencias profesionales de esta población y sobre cómo organizaciones, líderes y formuladores de políticas públicas pueden contribuir a que esta encuentre trabajo, mantenga su empleo y logre buenos resultados en la vida. Aquí se presentan 12 artículos reunidos en tres áreas relacionadas con el tema de los refugiados y su lugar de trabajo. La primera área explora los prejuicios en las percepciones con respecto a los refugiados en función de factores como el tono de piel, el país de origen y la raza. La segunda presenta investigaciones que abordan el desplazamiento de refugiados y las barreras a la integración, inclusión, reconocimiento social y pertenencia. Finalmente, la tercera área examina cómo los refugiados han sido integrados y aculturados en la sociedad brasileña, a menudo a través de la asistencia de organizaciones de la sociedad civil o mediante los esfuerzos de gestores en el lugar de trabajo. Esperamos que las investigaciones presentadas en esta edición especial contribuyan a incrementar el interés en este importante tema e inspiren futuros estudios que puedan conducir a la reducción de las barreras que enfrentan los refugiados y desplazados en sus procesos de integración y aculturación.Alternate abstract:This special issue focuses on refugees' experiences and displaced people across a diverse set of ethnicities and circumstances. The growing number of refugees and displaced people and the work and life difficulties they face are central social issues in the world today. This special issue will explore how refugees and displaced people in Brazil can b fully integrated, socialized, engaged, embraced, and affirmed into the workplace and society. Research is presented on the experiences of refugees and displaced people, a growing but under-researched segment of the world's population. Little is known about refugees' career experiences and displaced people and how organizations, leaders, and policymakers can assist them in tinding work, maintaining employment, and creating positive life outcomes. There are 12 articles included in this special issue. They focus on three areas of refugees in the workplace. The first area explores biases in the perceptions of refugees based on factors such as skin complexion, countries of origin, and race. The second area presents research that elaborates on the theme of displacement of refugees and barriers to integration, inclusion, social recognition, and belonging. The third area examines ways in which refugees have been integrated and acculturated into Brazilian society, often through the assistance of NGOs or through the efforts of managers in the workplace. It is our hope that the research presented in this special issue will increase interest in this important topic and lead to additional future research related to reducing barriers to integration and acculturation that refugees and displaced people face.","Segrest, Sharon L.; Hurley-Hanson, Amy E.; Giannantonio, Cristina M.",Cadernos EBAPE.BR,https://doi.org/10.1590/1679-395120210071,482

Medical testing consists of Lab studies, PCR tests, CT, PET, which are time-consuming, some countries lack these resources. One medical tool for diagnosis is X-Ray imaging, which is one of the fastest and low-cost resources for physicians to detect and to distinguish among these different diseases. We propose an X-Ray CAD system based on DCNN, using well-known architectures such as DenseNet-201, ResNet-50 and EfficientNet. These architectures are pre-trained on data from Imagenet classification challenge, moreover, using Transfer Learning methods to Fine-Tune the classification stage. The system is capable to visualize the learned recognition patterns applying the GRAD-CAM algorithm aiming to help physicians in seeking hidden features from perceptual vision. The proposed CAD can differentiate between COVID-19, Pneumonia, Nodules and Normal lung X-Ray images. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Face mask detection has seen an overwhelming growth in the realm of Computer vision and deep learning, since the unprecedented COVID-19 global pandemic that has mandated wearing masks in public places. To tackle the situation, machine learning engineers have come up with several algorithms and techniques to identify unmasked individuals using various mask detection models. The proposed approach in this paper adopts frameworks of deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV libraries to detect face masks in real time. The trained MobileNet model, presented in this paper, yielded an accuracy score of 0.99 and an F1 score of 0.99 in the training data. This user-friendly model can be incorporated with several existing technologies such as face detection, biometric authentication and facial expression detection for further advancements in the future. © 2021 IEEE.","Harriat Christa, G.; Jesica, J.; Anisha, K.; Sagayam, K.

In this study, the anxiety status of HD healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated factors were investigated. Materials and Methods: The data were collected through a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts: (1) demographic features, (2) questions about the causes and consequences of anxiety, and (3) general anxiety disorder-7 survey. Results: One hundred eighty-three HCPs completed the survey, mostly nurses and dialysis technicians (71.6%). Two-thirds of the participants stated that preventive measures increase workload and cause physical harm (68.3%, 62.3%). One-third of participants reported a lack of communication with the patients and a decrease in desire to work (31.1%, 35.6%). A-moderate-severe anxiety was detected in 24.6%. Physical contact with infected people, being physically harmed by -preventive measures, decreased desire to work, and a lack of communication with the patients were found to be -significantly more in participants with anxiety (P = .036, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001). In multivariate analyzes, being -physically harmed by preventive measures was the only risk factor for anxiety (OR = 7.423, CI: 2.050-26.877, P = .002). Conclusion: During the pandemic period, anxiety was observed in one-fourth of HCPs.

169905,"Effects of students’ home environment, tools, and technology used on online learning experience in a civil engineering program",2021,"Conservation efforts are hampered by limited understanding about how different types of instream infrastructure impact migration patterns and fish survival. We used a rapid, fully online IDEA protocol to elicit expert judgments for the passability of seven different in‐stream infrastructures to elver European eels (Anguilla anguilla) in Great Britain. Nine experts provided judgments via our online survey, followed by a second elicitation via email for reflection and adjustment of initial estimates. We found that on average, bridges were judged the most passable (95% passability), followed by fords, nonperched culverts, weirs, sluices, dams, and perched culverts (7%). Results showed a high degree of agreement about how passable bridges and perched culverts are for elver eels, but less certainty about other infrastructure. Thirty‐four distinct factors were identified that experts believed influence infrastructure passability for elver eels, including: the structure itself, hydraulics, elver characteristics, obstructions (e.g., debris accumulation), and vegetation (e.g., to aid climbing). We discuss how our rapid, online‐only variation on the IDEA protocol compares with the more traditional protocol, and how the expert estimates generated in this study can be used in future scenario building and connectivity modeling, with a view to improving conservation to support species persistence.","Thomas, Merryn J.; Pawar, Sayali K.; Stephanie, R.

169932,Wix web-based dance learning media to support teaching in the pandemic era in high school,2021,"The first round of vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in early December of 2020 in a few countries. There are several vaccines, and each has a different efficacy and mechanism of action. Several countries, for example, the United Kingdom and the USA, have been able to develop consistent vaccination programs where a great percentage of the population has been vaccinated (May 2021). However, in other countries, a low percentage of the population has been vaccinated due to constraints related to vaccine supply and distribution capacity. Countries such as the USA and the UK have implemented different vaccination strategies, and some scholars have been debating the optimal strategy for vaccine campaigns. This problem is complex due to the great number of variables that affect the relevant outcomes. In this article, we study the impact of different vaccination regimens on main health outcomes such as deaths, hospitalizations, and the number of infected. We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission to focus on this important health policy issue. Thus, we are able to identify the optimal strategy regarding vaccination campaigns. We find that for vaccines with high efficacy (&gt;70%) after the first dose, the optimal strategy is to delay inoculation with the second dose. On the other hand, for a low first dose vaccine efficacy, it is better to use the standard vaccination regimen of 4 weeks between doses. Thus, under the delayed second dose option, a campaign focus on generating a certain immunity in as great a number of people as fast as possible is preferable to having an almost perfect immunity in fewer people first. Therefore, based on these results, we suggest that the UK implemented a better vaccination campaign than that in the USA with regard to time between doses. The results presented here provide scientific guidelines for other countries where vaccination campaigns are just starting, or the percentage of vaccinated people is small.","Gonzalez-Parra, Gilberto",Epidemiologia,https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia2030021,482

Based on cognitive approach (Beck, Emery, Greenberg, 2005) one should differentiate unrealistic (dysfunctional) anxiety as well as different types of anxiety (Roy et al., 2020).ObjectivesThe aim was to reveal relationship of different types of anxiety with the search for information about coronavirus and protective behavior.MethodsIn April 2020 (2-3 weeks of self-isolation regimen) 409 respondents not infected by coronavirus (186 men, 223 women) aged 18 to 64 years appraised their anxiety of infection and pandemic consequences (Cronbach’s alphas .77-.82), the degree to which anxiety disturbs their usual activities, the frequency of tracking information about the coronavirus (.75) and various protective actions against the coronavirus (.76).Results17.1% reported that anxiety disturbed their activities. Anxiety of pandemic negative consequences was more prominent than anxiety of infection and was unrelated to age and gender. Anxiety of infection was higher in females (t=-5.48, p<.01, η=.26) and elder people (r=.20, p<.01). Both anxiety of infection and of pandemic consequences was equally related to information tracking and protective behavior (r=.25-.36, p<.01). Dysfunctional anxiety was unrelated to adherence to self-isolation (r=.08) but was related to information tracking (r=.21, p<.01).ConclusionsDysfunctional anxiety is unrelated to self-isolation and should be differentiated from realistic anxiety in studies of pandemic.

170071,Corona and art in mersin,2021,"Since the end of 2020, the mass vaccination has been actively promoted and seemed to be effective to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control. However, the fact of immunity waning and the possible existence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) make the situation uncertain. We developed a dynamic model of COVID-19 incorporating vaccination and immunity waning, which was calibrated by using the data of accumulative vaccine doses administered and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 in mainland China. We explored how long the current vaccination program can prevent China in a low risk of resurgence, and how ADE affects the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 epidemics. The prediction suggests that the vaccination coverage with at least one dose reach 95.87%, and with two-doses reach 77.92% on August 31, 2021. However, even with the mass vaccination, randomly introducing infected cases in the post-vaccination period can result in large outbreaks quickly in the presence of immunity waning, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmission ability. The results showed that with the current vaccination program and a proportion of 50% population wearing masks, mainland China can be protected in a low risk of resurgence till 2023/01/18. However, ADE effect and higher transmission ability for variants would significantly shorten the protective period for more than 1 year. Furthermore, intermittent outbreaks can occur while the peak values of the subsequential outbreaks are decreasing, meaning that subsequential outbreaks boosted the immunity in the population level, which further indicating that catching-up vaccination program can help to mitigate the possible outbreaks, even avoid the outbreaks. The findings reveal that integrated effects of multiple factors, including immunity waning, ADE, relaxed interventions, and higher transmission ability of variants, make the control of COVID-19 much more difficult. We should get ready for a long struggle with COVID-19, and should not totally rely on COVID-19 vaccine.","Zhou, W.; Tang, B.; Bai, Y.; Shao, Y.; Xiao, Y.; Tang, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262601v1?rss=1,482

This article explores the perceptions and interpretations of COVID-19-related regulations and implications of the disease to human life in different contexts. The article adopted a qualitative research methodology, where twenty participants were selected purposively and interviewed, then data analyzed inductively. The analysis of interviews revealed varied conceptualizations and interpretations about the disease and social distancing. Notably, COVID-19 regulations such social distancing and face masking were perceived as imported policy, a misconception that would be attributed to non-adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Further, the study underscore that the disease and policies related to it disrupted ways of social life;infringed on people's social-cultural rights;and had adverse health consequences. The study recommends a strategic and deliberate reconstruction of the society to restore its sociological functions post COVID-19 pandemic.","Kajiita, R. M.; Kangethe, S.

Methods: In this prospective study, disease activity and clinical assessments were recorded from the first dose of vaccine, until day 15 after the second dose in 126 SLE patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were measured against wild-type spike antigen while serum-neutralizing activity was assessed against the SARS-CoV-2 historical strain and variants of concerns (VOCs). Vaccine-specific T-cell responses were quantified by Interferon (IFN)-gamma; release assay after the second dose. Results: BNT162b2 was well tolerated and no statistically significant variations of BILAG and SLEDAI scores were observed throughout the study in SLE patients with active and inactive disease at baseline. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and Methotrexate (MTX) treatments were associated with drastically reduced BNT162b2 antibody-response (beta=-78; p=0.007, beta=-122; p<0.001, respectively). Anti-spike antibody response was positively associated with baseline total IgG serum levels, naive B cell frequencies (beta=2; p=0.018, beta=2.5; p=0.003) and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (r=0.462; p=0.003). In responders, serum neutralization activity decreased against VOCs bearing the E484K mutation but remained detectable in a majority of patients. Conclusion: MMF, MTX and poor baseline humoral immune status, particularly: low naive B cell frequencies, are independently associated with impaired BNT162b2 mRNA antibody response, delineating SLE patients who might need adapted vaccine regimens and follow-up.","Moyon, Q.; Sterlin, D.; Miyara, M.; Anna, F.; Mathian, A.; Lhote, R.; Ghillani-Dalbin, P.; Breillat, P.; Mudumba, S.; de Alba, S.; Cohen-Aubart, F.; Haroche, J.; Pha, M.; Boutin, T.

171277,Water governance models for meeting sustainable development Goals:A structured literature review,2021,"During the emergence of a pandemic, we need to estimate the prevalence of a disease using serological assays whose characterization is incomplete, relying on limited validation data. This introduces uncertainty for which we need to account. In our treatment, the data take the form of continuous assay measurements of antibody response to antigens (eg. ELISA), and fall into two groups. The training data includes the confirmed positive or negative infection status for each sample. The population data includes only the assay measurements, and is assumed to be a random sample from the population from which we estimate the seroprevalence. We use the training data to model the relationship between assay values and infection status, capturing both individual-level uncertainty in infection status, as well as uncertainty due to limited training data. We then estimate the posterior distribution over population prevalence, additionally capturing uncertainty due to finite samples. Finally, we introduce a means to pool information over successive time points, using a Gaussian process, which dramatically reduces the variance of our estimates.

171502,Instructor Presence in a Virtual Classroom,2021,"Glycans that are abundantly displayed on vertebrate cell surface and secreted molecules are often capped with terminal sialic acids (Sias). These diverse 9-carbon-backbone monosaccharides are involved in numerous intrinsic biological processes. They also interact with commensals and pathogens, while undergoing dynamic changes in time and space, often influenced by environmental conditions. However, most of this sialoglycan complexity and variation remains poorly characterized by conventional techniques, which often tend to destroy or overlook crucial aspects of Sia diversity and/or fail to elucidate native structures in biological systems i.e., in the intact sialome. To date, in situ detection and analysis of sialoglycans has largely relied on the use of plant lectins, sialidases or antibodies, whose preferences (with certain exceptions) are limited and/or uncertain. We took advantage of naturally-evolved microbial molecules (bacterial adhesins, toxin subunits and viral hemagglutinin-esterases) that recognize sialoglycans with defined specificity to delineate 9 classes of Sialoglycan Recognizing Probes (SGRPs: SGRP1–SGRP9) that can be used to explore mammalian sialome changes in a simple and systematic manner, using techniques common in most laboratories. SGRP candidates with specificity defined by sialoglycan microarray studies were engineered as tagged probes, each with a corresponding non-binding mutant probe as a simple and reliable negative control. The optimized panel of SGRPs can be used in methods commonly available in most bioscience labs, such as ELISA, Western Blot, flow cytometry and histochemistry. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide examples of sialoglycome differences in tissues from C57BL/6 wild type mice and human-like Cmah−/− mice.","Srivastava, Saurabh; Verhagen, Andrea; Sasmal, Aniruddha; Wasik, Brian R.; Diaz, Sandra; Yu, Hai; Bensing, Barbara A.; Khan, Naazneen; Khedri, Zahra; Secrest, Patrick; Sullam, Paul; Varki, Nissi; Chen, Xi; Parrish, Colin R.; Varki, Ajit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446202,482

172435,Disease and disaster: Navigating food insecurity in a community affected by crises during COVID-19,2021,"The ecological and economic context determine the management goals of a modern enterprise, which are in line with the growing concern about the well-being of society caused by the effects of enterprises' activities that are particularly harmful to the environment. This increases the need to search for new tools that will have the capacity to generate information supporting the decision-making process in the area of enterprise management in terms of ecological, economic, and social goals. For these reasons, synthetic measures of development were constructed on the basis of the set of diagnostic variables describing various aspects of sustainable development in the case. Based on the environmental synthetic indicators, it has been possible to point out the Polish voivodeships, in which enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment were able to reduce the emissions of dust and gaseous pollutants in the 2005-2019 period. These changes were often accompanied by an increase in the production of energy from renewable sources and increasing the supply of plants with devices to contain gaseous and dust pollutants. Moreover, the comparison of positioning the voivodeships in the rankings according to social, economic, and environmental synthetic measures shows that the reduction of the negative impact of energy-intensive enterprises on the environment has been associated with higher the position of the voivodeship in the ranking connected with the health of its inhabitants. It has been also seen that the largest pool of funds was allocated to the voivodeships that need them the most, as these voivodeships were low in the ranking with respect to the degree of the reduction of dust and gaseous emissions by enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment. The results for regression analysis indicated at the existence of the inter-temporal relationships between the well-being of society and the environmental-economic effects of enterprises' activities. It was noticed that increasing the possibilities of financing investments in low-emission development of the region, including the modernization of enterprises in terms of decreasing dust and gaseous pollutant emissions and reducing their energy consumption, has a significant impact on the improvement of well-being of society with a one-year lag. In contrast to other studies that mainly refer to the environmental and economic effects of managing enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment, this paper focuses on the social aspect of the change in the health of the population connected with the emissions of pollutants. A novel approach based on the set of three multi-criteria synthetic measures is proposed to assess the environmental, economic, and social activities of enterprises in individual voivodeships in Poland in the long 2005-2019 period.","Wlodarczyk, A.; Mesjasz-Lech, A.",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14102884,482

Two different cryogenic cooling configurations were adopted, whereas the conventional flood cooling was used as reference for sake of comparison, leading to machining conditions under very different temperature ranges. The polyamide 6 machinability was evaluated in terms of surface integrity (surface roughness, surface defects, crystallinity percentage and hardness) and chip morphology. Results show that the polyamide 6 has to be cut in a specific temperature range, namely between -20°C to 20°C, in order to get the best surface finish, namely achieving the lowest surface roughness and density of defects. In addition, the cryogenic cooling is proved to produce harder surfaces than the flood condition, but leaving unaltered the polymer crystallinity degree.","Bertolini, R.; Ghiotti, A.; Bruschi, S.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235197892031516X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235197892031516X,482
173454,Leveraging interorganizational governance for bridging responses to supply chain disruptions: a polynomial regression analysis,2021,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the readiness of Ugandans to accept electronic voting under the restrictive conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A semi-structured questionnaire, built on a five-point-Likert scale with responses ranging from 1 - strongly disagree to 5 - strongly agree was used to get quantifiable data from four main electoral stakeholders i.e. the policymakers, urban and semi-urban youth, rural voters and government officials. These stakeholders were purposively and conveniently selected because of the influential roles they play in promoting electoral democracy in Uganda. Using a cross-sectional survey design, the authors adopted correlational and quantitative research designs to collect and analyse data. Data was collected from a maximum sample size of 384 as recommended by Krejcie and Morgan (1970) from which 252 useful responses (65.6% response rate) were obtained. Using a statistical package for social scientists version 21.0, the authors performed a Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the relationships between study variables and linear regression analysis to predict the readiness of the stakeholders to accept e-voting more especially under the constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings There was a positive significant relationship between perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude towards adoption, perceived ease of use and attitude towards adoption, attitude and readiness and finally trust propensity and readiness. The regression results show that 65% of the variations in readiness to adopt e-voting can be explained by perceived ease of use, PU, trust propensity and attitude towards adoption. Attitude towards adopting e-voting accounts for the highest variations in the model followed by trust propensity and finally PU. However, perceived ease of use was found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications The study was limited to only PU, perceived ease of use, trust propensity, attitudes towards using/adoption and readiness to accept e-voting amidst the COVID-19 strict conditions. In Africa, electoral democracy can be influenced by a number of factors such as finances, education levels, sectarianism, voter rigging, perceived risk, political and economic environment. These were not taken into consideration yet they would affect the stakeholders' attitudes and perceptions which would directly or indirectly affect the adoption of electronic voting. Practical implications Given the low levels of technology infrastructure in the country, there is a general low uptake of technology-oriented systems. The internet reach is low and quality is poor whilst the radio and televisions network is limited to a few urban settings, poor quality technology systems such as the recently acquired voter biometric systems and the constant government actions to switch off the internet and social media whenever there are contentious political issues. These inadequacies together with the restrictive COVID-19 conditions have compromised the participation of stakeholders which dents the stakeholders' readiness to accept e-voting which consequently compromises electoral democracy in the country. Therefore, government, electoral observers, the international community and civil society organizations need to accelerate the technology infrastructure development in the country, training and development of technical skills and competences, as well as mass mobilization on the use of technology-oriented platforms aimed at promoting electoral democracy. The country should come up with ICT policies and regulations that encourage the use of ICT in areas that promote democracy. These may include;the use of an easy e-voting system such as emails and voting via the post office. Also, Lawmakers, civil society organizations and the international community should make it punitive for anyone who disenfranchises people through internet disconnection, denial of access to broadcast, print and online media. These interventions will restore peoples' attitudes and perceptions towards electronic voting, consequently increasing their levels of participation in the electioneering process. Originality/value The Ministry of Health, the Uganda Police Force and other security agencies have come out strongly to enforce the COVID-19 standard operating procedures which among others include the banning of political gatherings, processions and meetings of any kind. As a remedy, the Electoral Commission is encouraging political parties, electoral candidates, voters and other stakeholders to use technology-oriented systems such as mobile phones, broadcast and print media, the internet and others to reach out to the electorate. With the government in full control of all these electronic, print and broadcast media, having previously switched them off during the 2011 and 2016 polls consequently disenfranchising many people from their democratic rights, it remains unknown the extent to which the electorate is ready to accept and appreciate scientific voting more so during this time when restrictions against COVID-19 are not making it any better for the voters and other key participants to carry out their political and civil activities.","Ntale, P.

Nevertheless, the Slovak Republic is in the last place in the innovation application within the EU, while the biggest problem seems to be the insufficient connection between R & D on the one hand and companies that could apply new ideas in practice on the other hand. Another big problem is the system of innovation funding, which is a big problem in Slovakia, especially at this time (consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic). Eco-innovation is now an integral part of business strategy in all developed countries. The Slovak Republic is on the last places in EU in this indicator, as the funding of eco-innovations is even more complicated due to the financing of “classic” innovations. Nevertheless, there are several successful eco-innovation projects in Slovakia, which we can consider as a contribution to sustainable development. The eco-innovation index of Slovakia shows that the Slovak Republic belongs to the group of catching-up countries and there is a huge space for improvement, which will probably be used largely in the near future. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

173876,Towards an Open Global Air Quality Monitoring Platform to Assess Children's Exposure to Air Pollutants in the Light of COVID-19 Lockdowns,2021-03-17,"Visual transients can interrupt overt orienting by abolishing the execution of a planned eye movement due about 90 ms later, a phenomenon known as saccadic inhibition (SI). It is not known if the same inhibitory process might influence covert orienting in the absence of saccades, and consequently alter visual perception. In Experiment 1 (n=14), we measured orientation discrimination during a covert orienting task in which an uninformative exogenous visual cue preceded the onset of an oriented probe by 140 to 290 ms. In half of the trials the onset of the probe was accompanied by a brief irrelevant flash, a visual transient that would normally induce SI. We report a time-dependent inhibition of covert orienting in which the irrelevant flash impaired orientation discrimination accuracy when the probe followed the cue by 190 and 240 ms. The interference was more pronounced when the cue was incongruent with the probe location, suggesting an impact on the reorienting component of the attentional shift. In Experiment 2 (n=12), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the flash could occur within an earlier time range, or only within the later, reorienting range. We presented probes at congruent cue locations in a time window between 50 to 200 ms. Similarly to Experiment 1, discrimination performance was altered at 200 ms after the cue. We suggest that covert attention may be susceptible to similar inhibitory mechanisms that generate SI, especially in later stages of attentional shifting (> 200ms after a cue), typically associated with reorienting.","Buonocore, Antimo; Dietze, Niklas; McIntosh, Robert D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.207928,482

For that, and following the procedures of the Grounded Theory, the discourses of 37 Spanish migrants obtained through in depth interviews were analyzed: 22 of them are living in Chile and the other 15 returned to Spain after spending a long period in Chilean society and have been living in Spain for at least one year since then. All of them have university degrees, are between 25 and 35 years old, and arrived in Chile between 2013 and 2018. This qualitative study shows the way in which these migrants experience their sociocultural integration in Chilean society, which could be typified as “nostalgic” since it is characterized by the idealization of and the longing for their society of origin. Another key characteristic is the eventual return to the country of origin, in which the desynchronization they experience is especially remarkable: after a long period abroad, they feel disconnected from the transformations that have taken place in their original environment, which leads them to experience a difficult process of readjustment to Spanish society that sometimes is even more complex than that experienced abroad.","Rubén Rodríguez, Puertas",Social Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10080293,482

The contribution of big data in the medical field is used to effectively address certain unsolved issues. Effectively integrating and analyzing this big data can reveal many useful hidden medical information. The COVID-19 virus, which first appeared in China at the end of 2019, is suffocating the rest of the world. Traditional methods of preventing this unforeseen pandemic are the lengthy process that can take several years. Now, the second wave of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc throughout the world. The survival rate can be significantly increased by predicting the risk of COVID-19 infection based on the patient's early symptoms and health status. Various disease forecasting approaches based on machine learning, and deep learning has been developed to forecast the severity rate of COVID-19. However, these approaches are becoming useless as the virus mutates. In this proposed research, the prediction model is trained by the proposed Correlated Feature Extraction (CFE) method according to the virus behaviors. Furthermore, two prediction models were established in this study. The first model uses initial symptoms to forecast positive cases. Second, based on the health status of the positive cases, the risk rate is estimated. In this study, the disease is forecast by Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks (FFANN). Finally, a comparative study has been conducted with the recently developed COVID-19 disease prediction methods to demonstrate the training efficacy and accuracy of the proposed COVID-19 forecasting system. © 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group®","Jayaraj, T.; Samath, J.

We performed a cell culture-based neutralization assay focusing on authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), all harboring the spike substitution L452R. We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1, Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 5.71 and 3.64, respectively, which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera, whereas convalescent sera were 1.6-fold less effective against Delta, respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa (+E484Q) and Delta (+T478K) were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion, in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant, the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab, which however, might be circumvented by a combination therapy with casirivimab together.","Wilhelm, A.; Toptan, T.; Pallas, C.; Wolf, T.; Goetsch, U.; Gottschalk, R.; Vehreschild, M.

Main outcome measures Time from Lyme disease diagnosis to consultation for any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis and for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Results Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 py between 2000 and 2018, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018.

Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season with highest adjusted HRs in autumn [3.14 (95%CI: 1.92 to 5.13)] and winter [2.23 (1.21 to 4.11)]. Incidence rates of ME/CFS were 11.16 per 10,000 py in Lyme patients (12 events) and 1.20 in comparators (5 events), corresponding to an adjusted HR of 16.95 (5.17 to 55.60). Effect on any types of fatigue and ME/CFS was attenuated 6 months after diagnosis but still clearly visible. Conclusions UK primary care records provided strong evidence that Lyme disease was associated with acute and chronic fatigue.

In this study, the risk of the epidemic in Guangzhou was first assessed through logistic regression (LR) on the basis of Tencent-migration data and urban point of interest (POI) data, and then the regional distribution of high- and low-risk epidemic outbreaks in Guangzhou in February 2021 was predicted. The main factors affecting the distribution of the epidemic were also analyzed by using geographical detectors. The results show that the number of cases mainly exhibited a declining and then increasing trend in 2020, and the high-risk areas were concentrated in areas with resident populations and floating populations. In addition, in February 2021, the “Spring Festival travel rush” in China was predicted to be the peak period of population movement. The epidemic risk value was also predicted to reach its highest level at external transportation stations, such as Baiyun Airport and Guangzhou South Railway Station. The accuracy verification showed that the prediction accuracy exceeded 99%. Finally, the interaction between the resident population and floating population could explain the risk of COVID-19 to the highest degree, which indicates that the effective control of population agglomeration and interaction is conducive to the prevention and control of COVID-19.

Currently, there is no widely accepted pharmacologic treatment for COVID-19. Remdesivir has been shown effective against various types of viruses, including coronaviruses. This study aimed at synthesizing the latest evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir as a potential treatment candidate against COVID-19. Methods: This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020183707). A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar through June 5th, 2020. Statistical analysis was done by using the Review Manager 5.4 tool. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and GRADE analysis was performed to determine the certainty of the evidence. Results: Two studies with a total of 1,300 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that remdesivir was associated with faster time to clinical improvement (MD-4.75 days;95% CI-4.84 days to-4.65 days;p &lt; 0.00001), reduction in mortality rate (RR 0.39;95% CI 0.27 – 0.56;p &lt; 0.00001) and fewer incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.77;95% CI 0.63 – 0.94;p = 0.01). GRADE analysis showed a high certainty for serious adverse events and moderate certainty for time to clinical improvement and mortality rate. Conclusion: Remdesivir is more effective and safer compared with standard care of treatment for the treatment of COVID-19 because it was associated with faster time to clinical improvement, reduction in mortality rate, and fewer incidence of serious adverse events.","Hariyanto, T.

Our findings suggest that after every festival celebration the value of. is decreased, leading to the increased number of active cases. In addition, the pre-festival mobility change involving visits to the retail and grocery stores are higher than any other time. Therefore, the festival gatherings and increased pre-festival mobility are catalysts that accelerated the increment of the number of active COVID-19 cases in Sarawak. In light of this, we proposed that any form of festival related gathering ought to be avoided in order to curb any forms of outbreak in Sarawak.","Labadin, J.; Hong, B.

In this paper, we modified the GQLD and suggested a two parameters lifetime distribution called as a weighted generalized Quasi Lindley distribution (WGQLD). The main mathematical properties of the WGQLD including the moments, coefficient of variation, coefficient of skewness, coefficient of kurtosis, stochastic ordering, median deviation, harmonic mean, and reliability functions are derived. The model parameters are estimated by using the ordinary least squares, weighted least squares, maximum likelihood, maximum product of spacing’s, Anderson-Darling and Cramer-von-Mises methods. The performances of the proposed estimators are compared based on numerical calculations for various values of the distribution parameters and sample sizes in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) and estimated values (Es). To demonstrate the applicability of the new model, four applications of various real data sets consist of the infected cases in Covid-19 in Algeria and Saudi Arabia, carbon fibers and rain fall are analyzed for illustration. It turns out that the WGQLD is empirically better than the other competing distributions considered in this study. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","Benchiha, S.; Al-Omari, A.

179904,Online learning during COVID-19: what is the most effective platform for teaching and learning mathematics?,2021,"Viral diseases pose major threats to humans and other animals, including the billions of chickens that are an important food source as well as a public health concern due to zoonotic pathogens. Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek’s disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek’s disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the two class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek’s disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only four viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2, the dominantly-expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2 linked to several MDV peptides, and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to core binding peptide of ten amino acids, compared to the nine amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.","Halabi, Samer; Ghosh, Michael; Stevanović, Stefan; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Bertzbach, Luca D.; Kaufer, Benedikt B.; Moncrieffe, Martin C.; Kaspers, Bernd; Härtle, Sonja; Kaufman, Jim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.400937,482

This growing problem calls for the application of AI-based technologies to support early diagnostics, and for subsequent non-pharmacological cognitive interventions and mental well-being monitoring. We present a practical application of a machine learning (ML) model in the domain known as 'AI for social good'. In particular, we focus on early dementia onset prediction from speech patterns in natural conversation situations. This paper explains our model and study results of conversational speech pattern-based prognostication of mild dementia onset indicated by predictive Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. Experiments with elderly subjects are conducted in natural conversation situations, with four members in each study group. We analyze the resulting four-party conversation speech transcripts within a natural language processing (NLP) deep learning framework to obtain conversation embedding. With a fully connected deep learning model, we use the conversation topic changing distances for subsequent MMSE score prediction. This pilot study is conducted with Japanese elderly subjects within a healthy group. The best median MMSE prediction errors are at the level of 0.167, with a median coefficient of determination equal to 0.330 and a mean absolute error of 0.909. The results presented are easily reproducible for other languages by swapping the language model in the proposed deep-learning conversation embedding approach.","Rutkowski, T. M.; Abe, M.

180681,A fit for purpose pedagogy: online learning designing and teaching,2021,"Abstract Social marketers and health advertisers often use statistical health information to craft customized messages for specific consumer segments. However, the composition of these segments can vary greatly, inherently resulting in different base rate percentages about the same health issue (e.g. '51.9% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Caucasians' vs. '16.6% of all COVID 19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred among Hispanics') that can potentially lead to different responses from consumers. Therefore, this research examines how individuals process, and respond to, manipulated base rates. Study 1 demonstrates that higher (vs. lower) base rates increase individuals' healthy behavioural intentions by elevating their risk perceptions. Study 2 uncovers a more complex serial process underlying the impact of base rates on intentions to follow recommended behaviours in health messages. Importantly, we demonstrate a critical effect reversal such that higher base rates have an unintended negative impact on individuals' compliance intentions when involvement is lower (vs. higher). Overall, our findings show how the use of base rates in health messages can serve as a 'double-edged sword'.

The NHS myHealthE (MHE) web-based monitoring system was developed to address the limitations of paper-based PROM completion. MHE provides a simple and secure way for families accessing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to report clinical information and track their childs progress. This study aimed to assess whether MHE improves the completion of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) compared with paper collection. Secondary objectives were to explore caregiver satisfaction and application acceptability. Methods: A twelve-week single-blinded randomised controlled feasibility pilot trial of MHE was conducted with 196 families accessing neurodevelopmental services in south London to examine whether electronic questionnaires are completed more readily than paper-based questionnaires over a 3-month period. Follow up process evaluation phone calls with a subset (n=8) of caregivers explored system satisfaction and usability. Results: MHE group assignment was significantly associated with an increased probability of completing an SDQ-P in the study period (adjusted hazard ratio, (HR) 12.1, 95% CI 4.7-31.0; p= <0.001). Of those caregivers who received the MHE invitation (n=68) 69.1% completed an SDQ using the platform compared to 8.8% in the control group (n=68). The system was well received by caregivers, who cited numerous benefits of using MHE, for example, real time feedback and ease of completion. Conclusions: MHE holds promise for improving PROM completion rates. Research is needed to refine MHE, evaluate large scale MHE implementation, cost effectiveness and explore factors associated with differences in electronic questionnaire uptake.","Morris, A.

In an A/B test, traffic is randomly allocated between a treatment group, which uses the new algorithm, and a control group, which uses the existing algorithm. However, because networks are congested, both treatment and control traffic compete against each other for resources in a way that biases the outcome of these tests. This bias can have a surprisingly large effect; for example, in lab A/B tests with two widely used congestion control algorithms, the treatment appeared to deliver 150% higher throughput when used by a few flows, and 75% lower throughput when used by most flows-despite the fact that the two algorithms have identical throughput when used by all traffic. Beyond the lab, we show that A/B tests can also be biased at scale. In an experiment run in cooperation with Netflix, estimates from A/B tests mistake the direction of change of some metrics, miss changes in other metrics, and overestimate the size of effects. We propose alternative experiment designs, previously used in online platforms, to more accurately evaluate new algorithms and allow experimenters to better understand the impact of congestion on their tests.","Spang, Bruce; Hannan, Veronica; Kunamalla, Shravya; Huang, Te-Yuan; McKeown, Nick; Johari, Ramesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00118v1.pdf,482

We posit that the negative perception of scientists, a feature of right-wing narratives in the country of study, underlies this effect. Additionally, we argue that ideology has an indirect impact, via levels of trust in scientists, on beliefs and attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine policy. To test these hypotheses, we conducted three studies (N = 1,155): one prepandemic study and two studies during a pandemic. The results confirmed the hypotheses;however, we observed varied effects at the outset of the pandemic versus later stages.

181202,College Students’ Blended Online Examination Acceptance During the COVID-19 Epidemic,2022,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a human-restricted pathogen most often found in the human nasopharynx. Multiple bacterial factors are known to contribute to persistent colonization of this niche, and many are important in mucosal immunity and vaccine development. In this work, mice were infected intranasally with transcriptional regulator mutants of the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing (QS) system—a peptide-based signaling system conserved in sequenced isolates of S. pyogenes. Deletion of the QS system’s transcriptional activator (Δrgg2) dramatically diminished the percentage of colonized mice while deletion of the transcriptional repressor (Δrgg3) increased the percentage of colonized mice compared to wild type. Stimulation of the QS system using synthetic pheromones prior to inoculation did not significantly increase the percentage of animals colonized, indicating that QS-dependent colonization is responsive to the intrinsic conditions within the host upper respiratory tract. Bacterial RNA extracted directly from oropharyngeal swabs and evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR subsequently confirmed QS upregulation within one hour of inoculation. In the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a muted inflammatory response to the Δrgg2 bacteria suggests that their rapid elimination failed to elicit the previously characterized response to intranasal inoculation of GAS. This work identifies a new transcriptional regulatory system governing the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the nasopharynx and provides knowledge that could help lead to decolonization therapeutics. Author Summary Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from common pharyngitis to infrequent invasive infections like necrotizing fasciitis. The ability of this microorganism to persist in the human oropharynx predisposes colonized individuals to a variety of superficial and invasive diseases which lead to significant morbidities and mortality. Identification of the regulatory systems that augment the bacteria’s ability to colonize the oropharynx provides potential targets against which molecular therapeutics can be designed. Here we show that the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing system, an interbacterial communication system, governs the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the murine oropharynx. Disruption of the system’s transcriptional activator reduced colonization dramatically, eliminated the transcription of two sets of genes known to be activated by the Rgg2/3 system, and tempered the innate immune response seen when S. pyogenes is intranasally infected into the mouse.","Gogos, Artemis; Federle, Michael J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.179903,482

Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, have not been fully characterized, because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs. Here, we profiled transcriptional dynamics of primary neuronal cultures undergoing network activity shifts using nascent RNA sequencing. We found pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ~45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. Notably, the majority of these genes respond to increases or decreases of network activity uniquely, rather than reciprocally. We further linked the chromatin regulator Retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis Syndrome gene, to the specific transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Finally, we show that RAI1 is essential for homeostatic synaptic upscaling but not downscaling. These results demonstrate the utility of bona fide transcription profiling to discover mechanisms of activity-dependent chromatin remodeling that underlie normal and pathological synaptic plasticity.","Garay, Patricia M.; Chen, Alex; Tsukahara, Takao; Kohen, Rafi; Christian Althaus, J.; Wallner, Margarete A.; Giger, Roman J.; Sutton, Michael A.; Iwase, Shigeki",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/523456,482

This review aims to encourage the development of more detailed studies on Citrus essential oils as a new multi-objective strategy to treat SARS-CoV2 infection.

196624,Rotavirus and coronavirus associated diarrohoea in calves.,1979,"Wildlife may harbour infectious pathogens that are of zoonotic concern. However, culling such reservoir populations to mitigate or control the transmission of these pathogens to humans has proved disappointingly inefficient. Alternatives are still in an experimental stage of development. They include vaccination, medication, contraception and environmental manipulation, including fencing and biosecurity measures. This review examines the general concepts involved in the control of wildlife diseases and presents relevant case studies. Since wildlife disease control inevitably involves interfering with wildlife ecology, this is a complex goal whose attempts at realisation should be supervised by a scientific organisation. Most approaches within natural ecosystems should first be carefully tested in trials that are progressively extended to a larger scale. Finally, all measures that aim to prevent infection in humans (such as personal hygiene or vaccination) or that encourage us to avoid infectious contacts with wildlife should be recommended.","Artois, M; Blancou, J; Dupeyroux, O; Gilot-Fromont, E",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435186/,482
199633,Towards Understanding Interactions between Sustainable Development Goals: The Role of Climate-Well-Being Linkages. Experiences of EU Countries,2021,"OBJECTIVES Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) are the most common inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). The aim of this study was to elucidate differences in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RA- and SpA-patients. METHODS Data from the German COVID-19 registry for IRD patients from 30th March to 16th November 2020 were analysed. 208 RA and SpA patients were included in the study, matched for gender and age. RESULTS 104 SpA patients (40% patients with ankylosing spondylitis, 54% with psoriatic arthritis and 6% with enteropathic arthritis) were compared to 104 RA patients. For both groups, median age was 56 years. TNF-i treatment was reported in 45% of the SpA and in 19% of RA patients (p=0.001). Glucocorticoids were used in 13% of the SpA and in 40% of the RA patients (p=0.001). In both groups, the majority of the patients (97% SpA, 95% RA) recovered from COVID-19. Hospitalisation was needed in 16% of the SpA and in 30% of the RA patients (p=0.05), and oxygen treatment in 10% and 18% respectively (p=ns). Three versus six (p=ns) fatal courses were reported in the SpA versus the RA group. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed that the hospitalisation rate during COVID-19 infection, but not the mortality, was significantly higher in RA as compared to SpA patients. This could be explained either by different treatment strategies or by different susceptibilities of the two diseases.","Hasseli, Rebecca; Pfeil, Alexander; Hoyer, Bimba F; Krause, Andreas; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; Richter, Jutta G; Schmeiser, Tim; Voll, Reinhard E; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Specker, Christof; Müller-Ladner, Ulf",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822706/,482
199670,Analysis of Air Quality during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Naples (Italy),2021,"BACKGROUND Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common disease that usually progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high morbidity and mortality. We aim to analyze the trends in ALI/ARDS, and to compare the differences in aspects of years, countries, institutions, journals, etc. Methods: We screened all relevant literature on ALI/ARDS from Web of Science during 2009-2019, and analyzed the research trends in this field by VOSviewer. RESULTS We had screened 7,890 publications with a total cited frequency of 164,713. The United States contributed the largest number of publications (2,612, 33.11%), cited frequency (81,376, 48.61%), and the highest H-index (107). Journal of Critical Care Medicine published the largest number of literatures on ALI/ARDS, MATTHAY MA published the majority of articles in this field (147), while SLUTSKY AS received the most cited frequency (10015). University of California San Francisco had the largest number of publications (243, 3.08%) among all full-time institutions. In the aspect of clinical research in ALI/ARDS, the keyword ""Berlin definition"" emerged in recent years, with an average year of 2016.3; in the basic research, the key word ""protects"" appeared latest, and the average years were 2016.5. The current research trend indicates that basic research is gradually transforming into clinical research. CONCLUSIONS The United States have made the most significant contribution to the ALI/ARDS field in the last decade. The current research 'hotspot' mainly appeared in clinical research, such as ""Berlin definition"". In regards to basic research, studies tend to explore the protective mechanisms against ALI/ARDS.","Wang, Chen; Wang, Xuren; Long, Xisha; Xia, Demeng; Ben, Daofeng; Wang, Yin",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194036/,482
201592,Solidarity Check in times of Covid-19. Analysis of the Eu Approach towards Its Closest Neighbours with a Special Focus on Montenegro,2021,BACKGROUND Heart rupture resulting in lethal bleeding is a devastating complication associated with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in patients with deep sternal wound infection (DSWI). We have previously reported that the use of a protective HeartShield device in combination with NPWT decreases the risk of damage to the heart. This article presents a retrospective analysis of NPWT duration with and without the HeartShield device. SUBJECTS AND PATIENTS The study included 6 patients treated with the HeartShield device in combination with NPWT and 6 patients treated with conventional NPWT during the same time period. The duration of active treatment time was measured. RESULTS The median duration of NPWT was 8 days (range: 6-14 days) in the HeartShield device NPWT group and 14 days in the conventional group (range: 10-18 days). The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS It appears that the treatment of patients with DSWI with the HeartShield device reduces the duration of NPWT.,"Ingemansson, Richard; Malmsjö, Malin; Lindstedt, Sandra",Eplasty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741387/,482

We report here identification of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANPEP, encoding human aminopeptidase N, in Chinese. All ANPEP exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified from unrelated normal individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Nine SNPs were revealed after direct sequencing of PCR amplified fragments which showed changes of DHPLC chromatogram. Four of these polymorphisms, T321M(962C > T), S651L(1952C > T), S752N(2255G > A) and G764R(2290G > A), were non-synonymous; the remaining exonic synonymous and intronic ones were T795T(2385C > T), IVS7 + 17G > A, IVS14-16A > G, IVS17 + 12C > G and IVS17 + 44C > T.

202534,Lecturer readiness analysis of online learning at Mulawarman University in the Covid-19 Era,2020,"BACKGROUND: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affecting 52 people from a large school community in Santiago, Chile was identified (March 12), nine days after the first country case. We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey. METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission. RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool. Self-administered antibody testing, supervised remotely, proved to be a suitable and rapid tool. Our study provides useful information for school re-openings.","Torres, Juan Pablo; Piñera, Cecilia; De La Maza, Verónica; Lagomarcino, Anne J; Simian, Daniela; Torres, Bárbara; Urquidi, Cinthya; Valenzuela, María Teresa; O039,; Ryan, Miguel",Clin. infect. dis,,482

Effective antivirals are urgently needed for COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive antiviral target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the viral polypeptide. In this study, we performed an in silico structure-based screening of a large chemical library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. Among 8,820 compounds in the library, our screening identified trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor and an antifungal compound, as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity and replication. The half maximal effective concentration of trichostatin A against SARS-CoV-2 replication was 1.5 to 2.7µM, which was markedly below its 50% effective cytotoxic concentration (75.7µM) and peak serum concentration (132µM). Further drug compound optimization to develop more stable analogues with longer half-lives should be performed. This structure-based drug discovery platform should facilitate the identification of additional enzyme inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Wen, Lei; Tang, Kaiming; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Tsang, Jessica Oi-Ling; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Huang, Yaoqiang; Luo, Cuiting; Cai, Jian-Piao; Ye, Zi-Wei; Yin, Feifei; Chu, Hin; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo",Int J Biol Sci,,482
204561,Transforming Introductory Sociology with Team-Based Learning: Sufficient Value and Surmountable Challenge?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Educational supervisors (ESs) play a critical role in the training of Foundation doctors. Many hospital trusts do not currently offer formal mechanisms to ensure the quality of supervision is at a high standard. Our Trust wanted to empower trainees to offer objective feedback on the quality of the supervisors. METHODS: We introduced a feedback form sent to all Foundation doctors at our Trust. The questionnaire was designed to identify whether ESs were meeting their responsibilities as defined by the Health Education England South West's Severn Deanery. We collected data throughout the academic year 2017-2018 (Year 1) as a pilot, before rolling out the definitive questionnaire with minor modifications from 2018 to 2019 (Year 2). RESULTS: All respondents met with their supervisor within the first month of the placement and 90.7% of the trainees found it easy to meet with their supervisor. The Trust received generally very good feedback for all of its supervisors. Low numbers (4/120 trainees) reported supervisors not engaging with the exception reporting process. CONCLUSION: Our Trust provides ESs of a high standard. The authors believe collecting feedback for ESs will achieve three things: 1) Drive up standards through increasing accountability of ESs receiving objective feedback. This will be of critical importance in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and the changes to our work it has necessitated. 2) Empower trainees to make informed decisions about where they wish to train and under which supervisors. 3) Facilitate revalidation and appraisal for supervisors by collecting data from trainees on the quality of their supervision.","Heining, Christopher James; Wheeler, Marie; Fletcher, Peter",Postgrad. med. j,,482

205591,Consequences of covid-19 on the childhood obesity epidemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Older individuals are at increased risk of a severe and lethal course of COVID-19. They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing ('cocooning'), which has sparked much debate on the consequences for their mental wellbeing. We aimed to provide evidence by conducting a representative survey among the German old population during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (n = 1005; age &#8805; 65 years) during the first lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, overall psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory/BSI-18) and loneliness (UCLA 3-item loneliness scale). Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were M = 75.5 (SD = 7.1) years old; 56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for M = 28.0 (SD = 4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean BSI-18 scores were 1.4 for depression, 1.6 for anxiety and 2.2 for somatization as well as 5.1 for global psychological distress. These figures did not indicate worse mental wellbeing, given normative values established by studies before the pandemic (2.0, 1.6, 2.4, 6.0, respectively). The prevalence of loneliness was 13.1%, which also fell within a range of estimates reported by studies before the pandemic. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental wellbeing. Resilience explained a large amount of variance. CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, the mental wellbeing of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of ""the weak and vulnerable older adults"" that were present during the pandemic. Long-term observations are needed to provide robust evidence.","Röhr, Susanne; Reininghaus, Ulrich; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G",BMC Geriatr,,482
205592,Consequences of covid-19 on the childhood obesity epidemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the isolation of domestic violence survivors, triggering media coverage and innovative efforts to reach out to those who are trapped in their homes, facing greater danger from their partners than from the virus. But another harmful aspect of this difficult time has received far less attention: survivors' intensified loneliness. Although loneliness can be catalyzed by isolation, it is a distinct psychological phenomenon that is internal and subjective in nature. Loneliness is not only acutely painful in its own right; it also inflicts a range of long lasting, health-related harms, and heightens survivors' vulnerability to violence, creating a vicious cycle that may continue long after strict stay-at-home and physical distancing policies end. This may be particularly true for marginalized survivors, for whom larger structural inequalities and institutional failures compound the negative impact of loneliness. This brief report describes what we know about the nature and costs of survivor loneliness and uses the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens through which to review the ways current DV interventions may help alleviate loneliness (as distinct from isolation), and how these might be expanded to enhance survivor wellbeing, immediately and even after a return to ""normal.""","Goodman, Lisa A; Epstein, Deborah",J Fam Violence,,482

The present survey reports data collected by the Italian Association for Neuroendocrine Tumors on the management of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) during the pandemic dissemination. METHODS: A survey with 57 questions was sent to NEN-dedicated Italian centers regarding the management of patients in the period March 9, 2020, to May 9, 2020 RESULTS: The main modification in the centers' activity consisted of decreases in newly diagnosed NEN patients (- 76.8%), decreases in performed surgical procedures (- 58%), delays to starting peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (45.5%), postponed/canceled follow-up examinations (26%), and canceled multidisciplinary teams' activity (20.8%). A low proportion of centers (< 10%) reported having to withdraw systemic anti-tumor medical treatment due to concerns about the pandemic situation, whereas PRRT was withdrawn from no patients. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 outbreak induced the centers to reduce some important activities in the management of NEN patients, the Italian network was able to provide continuity in care without withdrawing anti-tumor treatment for the majority of patients.","Panzuto, F; Maccauro, M; Campana, D; Faggiano, A; Massironi, S; Pusceddu, S; Spada, F; Ferone, D; Modica, R; Grana, C M; Ferolla, P; Rinzivillo, M; Badalamenti, G; Zatelli, M C; Gelsomino, F; De Carlo, E; Bartolomei, M; Brizzi, M P; Cingarlini, S; Versari, A; Fanciulli, G; Arvat, E; Merola, E; Cives, M; Tafuto, S; Baldari, S; Falconi, M",J. endocrinol. invest,,482

209743,Challenges in online teaching amidst covid crisis: Impact on engineering educators of different levels,2021,"Minimizing all aspects of COVID-19 exposure is a high priority as universities prepare to reopen. One of those aspects includes developing protocols for interior spaces such as academic buildings. This paper applies mathematical modeling to investigate different virus exposure levels due to traffic patterns within academic buildings. The assumption used are: 1) Risk of infection is a product of exposure rate and time and 2) the exposure rate decreases with distance. One-way vs. two-way pedestrian traffic scenarios within hallways were modeled and analyzed for various configurations. The underlying assumption that a small exposure to a large number of people is similar to a large exposure to a few people is the driver to minimize exposures levels in all aspects. The analysis indicates that minimizing the time spent in passing between classes is the driving factor in minimizing risk, and one-way traffic may increase the time required to pass between classes. While the case presented is limited, the modeled approaches are intended to provoke future research that can be extended and applied to larger populations to help provide decision makers with more rigorous tools to shape future policies regarding traffic flow within buildings.","Romero, Van; Stone, William D.; Ford, Julie Dyke",Transp.

213058,Port Governance and Cruise Tourism,2021,"Redondoviridae is a recently discovered DNA virus family consisting of two species, vientovirus and brisavirus. Here we used PCR amplification and sequencing to characterize redondoviruses in nasal/throat swabs collected longitudinally from a cohort of 58 individuals working with animals in Vietnam. We additionally analyzed samples from animals to which redondovirus DNA-positive participants were exposed. Redondoviruses were detected in approximately 60% of study participants, including 33% (30/91) of samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory disease and in 50% (29/58) of baseline samples (with no respiratory symptoms). Vientovirus (73%; 24/33) was detected more frequently in samples than brisaviruses (27%; 9/33). In the 23 participants with at least 2 redondovirus-positive samples among their longitudinal samples, 10 (43.5%) had identical redondovirus replication-gene sequences detected (sampling duration: 35-132 days). We found no identical redondovirus replication genes in samples from different participants, and no redondoviruses were detected in 53 pooled nasal/throat swabs collected from domestic animals. Phylogenetic analysis described no large-scale geographical clustering between viruses from Vietnam, the US, Spain, and China, indicating that redondoviruses are highly genetically diverse and have a wide geographical distribution. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the Redondoviridae family in humans, describing a high prevalence, potentially associated with chronic shedding in the respiratory tract with lack of evidence of zoonotic transmission from close animal contacts. The tropism and potential pathogenicity of this viral family remain to be determined.","Tu, Nguyen Thi Kha; Deng, Xutao; Hong, Nguyen Thi Thu; Ny, Nguyen Thi Han; Phuc, Tran My; Tam, Pham Thi Thanh; Han, Duong An; Ha, Luu Thi Thu; Thwaites, Guy; Doorn, H Rogier van; Virtala, Anna-Maija K; Delwart, Eric; Baker, Stephen; Vapalahti, Olli; Tan, Le Van",Viruses,,482

We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: COVID wards in Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 627 subjects admitted to Acute Medical wards with COVID 19 pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p<0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p<0.05). Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of dementia, especially in the most advanced stages, represents an important risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.","Bianchetti, A; Rozzini, R; Guerini, F; Boffelli, S; Ranieri, P; Minelli, G; Bianchetti, L; Trabucchi, M",J Nutr Health Aging,,482

217871,Insight: A Cancelled Future. What’s Next for Universities and Colleges?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To obtain timely and detailed data on COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses 2 data sources: (1) aggregate counts for daily situational awareness and (2) person-level data for each case (case surveillance). The objective of this study was to describe the sensitivity of case ascertainment and the completeness of person-level data received by CDC through national COVID-19 case surveillance. METHODS: We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts. Nationally, completeness in case surveillance records was highest for age (99.9%) and sex (98.8%). Data on race/ethnicity were complete for 56.9% of cases; completeness varied by region. Data completeness for each underlying medical condition assessed was <25% and generally declined during the study period. About half of case records had complete data on hospitalization and death status. CONCLUSIONS: Incompleteness in national COVID-19 case surveillance data might limit their usefulness. Streamlining and automating surveillance processes would decrease reporting burdens on jurisdictions and likely improve completeness of national COVID-19 case surveillance data.","Gold, Jeremy A W; DeCuir, Jennifer; Coyle, Jayme P; Duca, Lindsey M; Adjemian, Jennifer; Anderson, Kayla N; Baack, Brittney N; Bhattarai, Achuyt; Dee, Deborah; Durant, Tonji M; Ewetola, Raimi; Finlayson, Teresa; Roush, Sandra W; Yin, Shaoman; Jackson, Brendan R; Fullerton, Kathleen E",Public Health Rep,,482

Subsequently, the tabular structures are recognized in the second phase in order to extract information from the respective cells. Table detection and structural recognition are pivotal problems in the domain of table understanding. However, table analysis is a perplexing task due to the colossal amount of diversity and asymmetry in tables. Therefore, it is an active area of research in document image analysis. Recent advances in the computing capabilities of graphical processing units have enabled deep neural networks to outperform traditional state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Table understanding has substantially benefited from the recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks. However, there has not been a consolidated description of the deep learning methods for table detection and table structure recognition. This review paper provides a thorough analysis of the modern methodologies that utilize deep neural networks. This work provided a thorough understanding of the current state-of-the-art and related challenges of table understanding in document images. Furthermore, the leading datasets and their intricacies have been elaborated along with the quantitative results.

This study sought to investigate whether blood glucose (BG) levels or comorbid diabetes are associated with inflammatory status and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes were compared. The relationship among severity of COVID-19, inflammatory status, and diabetes or hyperglycemia was analyzed. The severity of COVID-19 in all patients was determined according to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Committee (7th edition). Results: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled in our study, and 71.58% of patients with diabetes and 13.03% of patients without diabetes had hyperglycemia. Compared with patients without diabetes (n = 366), patients with diabetes (n = 95) had a higher leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). There was no association between severity of COVID-19 and known diabetes adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), known hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The leucocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level increased with increasing BG level. Hyperglycemia was an independent predictor of critical (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.72-9.30) or severe (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.47-8.58) COVID-19, and of increased inflammatory levels (high leucocyte count (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.65-10.97), NLR (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.24-6.10), and CRP level (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.19-5.23)), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, severity of illness, and known diabetes. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia was positively correlated with higher inflammation levels and more severe illness, and it is a risk factor for the increased severity of COVID-19. The initial measurement of plasma glucose levels after hospitalization may help identify a subset of patients who are predisposed to a worse clinical course.","Zhang, Wen; Li, Chuanwei; Xu, Yu; He, Binfeng; Hu, Mingdong; Cao, Guoqiang; Li, Li; Wu, Shuang; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Chun; Zhao, Jianping; Xie, Jungang; Xu, Zihui; Li, Qi; Wang, Guansong",Mediators Inflamm,,482

Our experience has shown that some COVID-19 inpatients require transfusion support; understanding this need is critical to blood product inventory management. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hospital-wide and COVID-19 specific inpatient blood product utilization data were collected retrospectively for our network's two tertiary academic medical centers over a 9-week period (March 1, 2020-May 2, 2020), when most inpatients had COVID-19. Utilization data were merged with a COVID-19 patient database to investigate clinical demographic characteristics of transfused COVID-19 inpatients relative to non-transfused ones. RESULTS: Overall, 11 041 COVID-19 patients were admitted and 364 received blood product transfusions for an overall transfusion rate of 3.3%. COVID-19 patients received 1746 blood components in total, the majority of which were red blood cells. COVID-19 patients' weekly transfusion rate increased as the pandemic progressed, possibly reflecting their increased severity of illness. Transfusion was significantly associated with several indicators of severe disease, including mortality, intubation, thrombosis, longer hospital admission, lower hemoglobin and platelet nadirs, and longer prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times. As the pandemic progressed, institutional adherence to transfusion guidelines improved for RBC transfusions compared to prior year trends but did not improve for platelets or plasma. CONCLUSION: There is a need to closely monitor the blood product inventory and demand throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as patients' transfusion needs may increase over time. Daily or weekly trending of patients' clinical status and laboratory values may assist blood banks in inventory management.","DeSimone, Robert A; Costa, Victoria A; Kane, Kathleen; Sepulveda, Jorge L; Ellsworth, Grant B; Gulick, Roy M; Zucker, Jason; Sobieszcyk, Magdalena E; Schwartz, Joseph; Cushing, Melissa M",Transfusion,,482

It is the only mental health care hospital in the country with a residential facility for psychiatric inpatients catering to the whole population of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The Mental Health Care Act 2017 that neccesitated “halfway homes” is yet to be implemented in the state leaving it's inpatients entirely under the institution's care. This study is to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-COVID-19 virus in the 34 residential inpatients in separate male (23 patients) and female (11 patients) wards. This was done as an audit to strategies and measures taken by the institute in protecting it's inpatients.Method3 to 5 ml of peripheral venous blood samples were collected and plasma extracted and analysed using the CE-IVD Roche Cobas Elecsys AntiSARS-CoV-2, Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for the qualitative detection of total Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA;Pan Ig) generated against SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.ResultOut of the 34 inpatients, 2 male inpatients tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (seroprevalence of 5.88%). In comparison, based on a report conducted by the government's Department of Community Medicine and Biochemistry on the 28th of October 2020, out of 2,361 participants in the community, 959 tested positive (seroprevalence of 40.6%).One of the inpatients that tested positive was re-admitted after testing negative via RT-PCR. The second patient was admitted after being found homeless. He was tested negative on day 1 via RAT and on day 5 via RT-PCR. We believe both of them aquired the infection in the community.ConclusionThis audit shows that the strategies implemented by the institute were effective in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. Practical implementations of what works and improvisations are the proven methods of decreasing the mortality and morbidity in vulnerable populations while continuously providing vital mental health services.","Shah, Sheena Hussain Arshad Qadri Sabreena Roub Fazle Rauf Insha Kumar Praveen",BJPsych Open,,482

The diagnosis and management of cancer is time sensitive and is likely to be substantially affected by these disruptions. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in India. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study at 41 cancer centres across India that were members of the National Cancer Grid of India to compare provision of oncology services between March 1 and May 31, 2020, with the same time period in 2019. We collected data on new patient registrations, number of patients visiting outpatient clinics, hospital admissions, day care admissions for chemotherapy, minor and major surgeries, patients accessing radiotherapy, diagnostic tests done (pathology reports, CT scans, MRI scans), and palliative care referrals. We also obtained estimates from participating centres on cancer screening, research, and educational activities (teaching of postgraduate students and trainees). We calculated proportional reductions in the provision of oncology services in 2020, compared with 2019. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, the number of new patients registered decreased from 112 270 to 51 760 (54% reduction), patients who had follow-up visits decreased from 634 745 to 340 984 (46% reduction), hospital admissions decreased from 88 801 to 56 885 (36% reduction), outpatient chemotherapy decreased from 173634 to 109 107 (37% reduction), the number of major surgeries decreased from 17 120 to 8677 (49% reduction), minor surgeries from 18 004 to 8630 (52% reduction), patients accessing radiotherapy from 51 142 to 39 365 (23% reduction), pathological diagnostic tests from 398 373 to 246 616 (38% reduction), number of radiological diagnostic tests from 93 449 to 53 560 (43% reduction), and palliative care referrals from 19 474 to 13 890 (29% reduction). These reductions were even more marked between April and May, 2020. Cancer screening was stopped completely or was functioning at less than 25% of usual capacity at more than 70% of centres during these months. Reductions in the provision of oncology services were higher for centres in tier 1 cities (larger cities) than tier 2 and 3 cities (smaller cities). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on the delivery of oncology services in India. The long-term impact of cessation of cancer screening and delayed hospital visits on cancer stage migration and outcomes are likely to be substantial. FUNDING: None.

224498,There Is No 'Virtual Learning': The Materiality of Digital Education,2021,"BACKGROUND: Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is a translatable event-related potential biomarker, and its reduction in schizophrenia is associated with the severity of clinical symptoms. While MMN recorded at the scalp is generated by a distributed network of temporofrontal neural sources, the primary contributing sources and the dynamic interactions among sources underlying MMN impairments in schizophrenia have not been previously characterized. METHODS: A novel data-driven analytic framework was applied to large cohorts of healthy comparison subjects (n = 449) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 589) to identify the independent contributing sources of MMN, characterize the patterns of effective connectivity underlying reduced MMN in patients, and explore the clinical significance of these abnormal source dynamics in schizophrenia. RESULTS: A network of 11 independent contributing sources underlying MMN distributed across temporofrontal cortices was identified. Orderly shifts in peak source activity were detected in a steplike manner, starting at temporal structures and progressing across frontal brain regions. MMN reduction in patients was predominantly associated with reduced contributions from 3 frontal midline sources: orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and middle cingulate cortices. Patients showed increased connectivity from temporal to prefrontal regions in conjunction with decreased cross-hemispheric connectivity to prefrontal regions. The decreased connectivity strength of precentral to prefrontal regions in patients with schizophrenia was associated with greater severity of negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the dynamic interactions among temporofrontal sources underlie MMN abnormalities in schizophrenia. These results advance our understanding of the neural substrates and temporal dynamics of normal and impaired information processing with novel applications for translatable biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Koshiyama, Daisuke; Miyakoshi, Makoto; Joshi, Yash B; Molina, Juan L; Tanaka-Koshiyama, Kumiko; Sprock, Joyce; Braff, David L; Swerdlow, Neal R; Light, Gregory A",Biol.

224904,An Analysis of Users Engagement on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Topical Trends and Sentiments,2020,"Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.","Milman, Oren; Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Katz, Rachel; Herzel, Esma; Ben-Tov, Amir; Kuint, Jacob; Gazit, Sivan; Chodick, Gabriel; Patalon, Tal; Kishony, Roy",Nat. med,,482

We aim to identify biomarkers of coagulation, endothelial function, and fibrinolysis that are associated with disease severity and may have prognostic potential. METHODS: We performed a single-center prospective study of 14 adult COVID-19(+) intensive care unit patients who were age- and sex-matched to 14 COVID-19(-) intensive care unit patients, and healthy controls. Daily blood draws, clinical data, and patient characteristics were collected. Baseline values for 10 biomarkers of interest were compared between the three groups, and visualized using Fisher's linear discriminant function. Linear repeated-measures mixed models were used to screen biomarkers for associations with mortality. Selected biomarkers were further explored and entered into an unsupervised longitudinal clustering machine learning algorithm to identify trends and targets that may be used for future predictive modelling efforts. RESULTS: Elevated D-dimer was the strongest contributor in distinguishing COVID-19 status; however, D-dimer was not associated with survival. Variable selection identified clot lysis time, and antigen levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen as biomarkers associated with death. Longitudinal multivariate k-means clustering on these biomarkers alone identified two clusters of COVID-19(+) patients: low (30%) and high (100%) mortality groups. Biomarker trajectories that characterized the high mortality cluster were higher clot lysis times (inhibited fibrinolysis), higher sTM and PAI-1 levels, and lower plasminogen levels.

225323,Integration of ecolabelling and ecotourism schemes: Case study of forest honey in Indonesia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have reported that the quarantine imposed in several countries around the world due to Covid-19 affected the sexual function and relationship quality. On the March 23, 2020 the Greek government imposed a national quarantine to contain the spread of the pandemic. The impact of such conditions on sexual function and relationship quality of couples is unknown. AIM: To investigate sexual function and relationship quality of couples during the quarantine. METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted one month post-impose of the quarantine, between the April 21 and the May 3, 2020. Adult respondents in a relationship completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, structured inquiries regarding sexual activity and quality of relationship, anxiety level, and mood during the quarantine, as well as the IIEF and FSFI indices. OUTCOMES: Sexual function was assessed using the Greek versions of the FSFI and IIEF for females and males respectively. Sexual activity using 5 statements regarding frequency of sexual thoughts, masturbation, and intercourse, quality of intercourse and general estimation of the level of sexual function. Participants graded their level of agreement. Relationship quality was assessed using 5 questions regarding communication, company, understanding, tension and general estimation of companionship. Participants graded their level of agreement. Two additional statements were used in order to evaluate mood and the level of anxiety. RESULTS: A sum of 299 adult heterosexual participants in a relationship participated. Little or no negative impact on sexual function was reported. Increased anxiety and deficient mood were reported only for those with no access to their partner. Being in a steady relationship and living with their partner, but only for couples without children, resulted in satisfaction by sexual activity and enhanced emotional security. CONCLUSION: Sexual function and relationship quality appeared as not affected by the quarantine and by the measures of social distancing. Sotiropoulou P, Ferenidou F, Owens D, et al.

226231,Impact of Digital Technologies on Development of Creative Industries,2020,"The host immune response to an implanted biomaterial, particularly the phenotype of infiltrating macrophages, is a key determinant of biocompatibility and downstream remodeling outcome. The present study used a subcutaneous rat model to compare the tissue response, including macrophage phenotype, remodeling potential, and calcification propensity of a biologic scaffold composed of glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (GF-BP), the standard of care for heart valve replacement, with those of an electrospun polycarbonate-based supramolecular polymer scaffold (ePC-UPy), urinary bladder extracellular matrix (UBM-ECM), and a polypropylene mesh (PP). The ePC-UPy and UBM-ECM materials induced infiltration of mononuclear cells throughout the thickness of the scaffold within 2 days and neovascularization at 14 days. GF-BP and PP elicited a balance of pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and anti-inflammatory (M2-like) macrophages, while UBM-ECM and ePC-UPy supported a dominant M2-like macrophage phenotype at all timepoints. Relative to GF-BP, ePC-UPy was markedly less susceptible to calcification for the 180 day duration of the study. UBM-ECM induced an archetypical constructive remodeling response dominated by M2-like macrophages and the PP caused a typical foreign body reaction dominated by M1-like macrophages. The results of this study highlight the divergent macrophage and host remodeling response to biomaterials with distinct physical and chemical properties and suggest that the rat subcutaneous implantation model can be used to predict in vivo biocompatibility and regenerative potential for clinical application of cardiovascular biomaterials.","Cramer, Madeline; Chang, Jordan; Li, Hongshuai; Serrero, Aurelie; El-Kurdi, Mohammed; Cox, Martijn; Schoen, Frederick J; Badylak, Stephen F",J. biomed. mater. res.

227360,Distributing Enterprise Value to Stakeholders in the Range of Sustainable Development on the Basis of the Energy Industry in Poland,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been affecting millions of people worldwide, since the beginning of 2020. COVID-19 can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms, which varies from asymptomatic presentation to severe respiratory insufficiency, exacerbation of immune response, disseminated microthrombosis and multiple organ failure, which may lead to dead. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the development of vaccines to minimize COVID-19 severity in the world population is imperious. One of the employed techniques to produce vaccines against emerging viruses is the synthesis of recombinant proteins, which can be used as immunizing agents. Based on the exposed, the aim of the present study was to verify the systemic and immunological effects of IM administration of recombinant Nucleocapsid protein (NP), derived from SARS-CoV-2 and produced by this research group, in 2 different strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus); Wistar and Lewis. For this purpose, experimental animals received 4 injections of NP, once a week, and were submitted to biochemical and histological analysis. Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection.","Silva, Everidiene K.

230103,Hybrid Flexible Learning with MOOCs: A Proposal to Reconceptualize the COVID19 Emergency beyond the Crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional exercise capacity seemed quickly clinically evident. The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. RESULTS: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6 ± 3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation. After 3-months of follow-up, the number of repetitions during STST significantly increased either in telerehabilitation (n = 14) (p < 0.001) or in control groups (n = 13) (p = 0.002) but only one patient had a result higher than the 50th percentile (in Telerehabilitation group) and 37% of them were still under the 2.5th percentile for this result. The improvement was significantly and clinically greater after the telerehabilitation program (p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported by the patients during the program. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a low functional exercise capacity at discharge and the recovery after three months is poor. The feasibility and the effect of a simple telerehabilitation program were verified, this program being able to substantially improve the functional recovery after three months.","Martin, Ines; Braem, Fred; Baudet, Lia; Poncin, William; Fizaine, Stéphane; Aboubakar, Frank; Froidure, Antoine; Pilette, Charles; Liistro, Giuseppe; De Greef, Julien; Yildiz, Halil; Pothen, Lucie; Yombi, Jean-Cyr; Belkhir, Leïla; Reychler, Gregory",Respir Med,,482

However, the immediate source species of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been confirmed. Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 to humans in South Asia. We identified cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, which are predominant species in the household farming system in South Asia that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. All the bird species studied along with rat and mouse were considered less potential to interact with SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interfaces of SARS-CoV-2S RBD and ACE2 protein complex suggests pangolin as a potential intermediate host in SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide a valuable resource for the identification of potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 in South Asia and henceforth reduce the opportunity for a future outbreak of COVID-19.","Ahmed, Rasel; Hasan, Rajnee; Siddiki, A M A M Zonaed; Islam, Md Shahidul",Infect Genet Evol,,482
231522,Dual-Sampling Attention Network for Diagnosis of COVID-19 From Community Acquired Pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the declaration of the global pandemic on March 11, 2020, many hospitals and institutions developed a tiered framework for the stratification and prioritization of elective surgery. Cleft lip and palate repair was classified as low acuity, and nasoalveolar molding (NAM) clinics were closed. Anticipating the consequences of delayed cleft care and the additional burden this would cause families, we reassessed our risk-stratification and perioperative algorithms. We hypothesized we could safely optimize nasolabial repair without burdening our care systems and without increasing COVID-19-related morbidity/mortality. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary cleft team reevaluated patient selection to maximize surgical impact. Perioperative protocols were adjusted, and COVID-19 preoperative testing was utilized before nasolabial repair and prior to suture removal under anesthesia. RESULTS: Early in the pandemic, unilateral cleft repair was prioritized and successfully completed on 9 patients. There were no complications related to COVID-19. Nasoalveolar molding clinic was reopened after total patient volume was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We offer an approach for surgical management of nasolabial clefts during a global pandemic. Although guidelines have suggested postponing all cleft care, we found that at our dedicated pediatric hospital with low burden of COVID-19 and adequate resources, we could follow a strategy to safely resume cleft care while decreasing burden on our patients' families and care delivery systems.","Santos, Pauline Joy F; Arowojolu, Omotayo A; Vyas, Raj M",Cleft Palate Craniofac J,,482
232625,Students and instructors perspective on blended synchronous learning in a Canadian graduate program,2021,"Exposure to air pollutants has been previously associated with respiratory viral infections, including influenza, measles, mumps, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiological studies have also suggested that air pollution exposure is associated with increased cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-associated mortality, although the molecular mechanisms by which pollutant exposure affects viral infection and pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain unknown. In this review, we suggest potential molecular mechanisms that could account for this association. We have focused on the potential effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), ozone (O3 ), and particulate matter (PM) since there are studies investigating how exposure to these pollutants affects the life cycle of other viruses. We have concluded that pollutant exposure may affect different stages of the viral life cycle, including inhibition of mucociliary clearance, alteration of viral receptors and proteases required for entry, changes to antiviral interferon production and viral replication, changes in viral assembly mediated by autophagy, prevention of uptake by macrophages, and promotion of viral spread by increasing epithelial permeability. We believe that exposure to pollutants skews adaptive immune responses toward bacterial/allergic immune responses, as opposed to antiviral responses. Exposure to air pollutants could also predispose exposed populations toward developing COIVD-19-associated immunopathology, enhancing virus-induced tissue inflammation and damage.","Woodby, Brittany; Arnold, Michelle M; Valacchi, Giuseppe",Ann.

233900,Temporal variations in the air quality index and the impact of the COVID-19 event on air quality in Western China,2020,"Despite the devastating human toll of the second wave of the pandemic, the global economy has continued to grow. The second wave of the virus and the lockdown restrictions that have been imposed have not had as severe an effect on economic activity as those in the first wave. This experience, combined with the rollout of vaccines and the huge fiscal stimulus in the US offers the prospect of global economic growth continuing and strengthening. Our upward forecast revisions to global GDP growth this year and next reflect these factors. Into the medium and long term, an important issue concerns the extent to which the adverse effects may lead to slower global economic growth. ‘Scarring’ effects on human capital from high unemployment, as well as the adverse health effects from ‘long Covid’, and the period of lost investment to boost the capital stock could lead to slower global GDP growth than would have been the case had the pandemic not occurred. The extent of any such scarring will, however, only become clearer once the immediate threat of the pandemic has reduced and the path of global economic growth has returned in a sustainable manner.","Naisbitt, Barry Boshoff Janine Holland Dawn Hurst Ian Liadze Iana Macchiarelli Corrado Mao Xuxin Patricia Sanchez Juanino Thamotheram Craig Whyte Kemar",National Institute Economic Review,,482

Development of practical guidelines for first-hand response and early treatment of psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 in East Java Province, Indonesia, based on the recommendations of 14 articles related to COVID-19 psychosocial handling was carried out. Some evidence strongly supports the need for knowledge about the stages of COVID-19, understanding of psychosocial responses, understanding of psychosocial interventions, and availability of hotline services in psychosocial interventions at each stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to provide practical guidance for the early management of psychosocial aspects of the innovative COVID-19 in providing more comprehensive care.

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%.

Community pharmacists have an important role in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students' awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). RESULTS: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops. CONCLUSION: The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media.

For men and women, increased frequency of drinking was associated with being less likely to believe alcohol drinking would lead to greater chance of catching COVID-19 (men: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98, 1.00; women: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.00) and deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.54; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.51); increased unit consumption was associated with deterioration in financial situation (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.86; OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.64) and physical health (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.67; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.10). Finally, increases in the frequency of HED were associated with deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.25, 2.18; OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.82) and being furloughed (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.80, 5.86; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.19, 3.56). Other gender differences were detected, for example, living with children was associated with an increase in units consumed (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.09, 2.73) and the frequency of HED (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.99) for men, but not women. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this self-selected UK sample, a significant proportion of individuals reported drinking more frequently in lockdown, drinking more units per drinking occasion and more frequent HED. There were consistent predictors of increased consumption across men and women, but other gender differences were detected. This study identifies groups that may require targeted support in future lockdowns.","Oldham, Melissa; Garnett, Claire; Brown, Jamie; Kale, Dimitra; Shahab, Lion; Herbec, Aleksandra",Drug alcohol rev,,482

The integrity of national health care systems has also been challenged, owing to shifts in guidance and misinformation. Although initial reports suggested that pregnant people were not at increased risk of severe COVID-19, current data arising from the ""third wave"" paint a much more concerning picture. In addition, pregnant and lactating people were excluded from vaccine trials, which has hindered the ability of health care professionals to provide evidence-based counselling regarding the safety and efficacy of the available vaccines in these populations. This commentary reviews the current data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. The evidence is clear that the risks of hospitalization and severe maternal and potentially fetal morbidity from COVID-19 in pregnancy far outweigh the very minimal risks of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.","Malinowski, Ann Kinga; Whittle, Wendy; Murphy, Kellie; Kingdom, John",J. obstet. gynaecol.

Although traditional loneliness interventions aim to increase social contact, targeting maladaptive cognition about time alone may be an effective way to reduce loneliness. We investigated whether a brief reappraisal manipulation enables individuals to experience their time alone more positively. We also tested the impact of trait loneliness, compulsive social media use, and trait reappraisal on experiences of time alone. Methods: College students and community members (N = 220) were randomly assigned to read a passage about the benefits of solitude (n = 74), the true prevalence of loneliness (n = 72), or a control topic (n = 74). Participants then sat alone for 10 min. Results: Across conditions, positive and negative mood significantly decreased after sitting alone. Participants who read about the benefits of solitude experienced a smaller reduction in positive mood than those in the control condition. Participants who less frequently used reappraisal in their everyday lives benefited most from the manipulation. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence that reappraising time alone as solitude may boost resilience to the decrements in positive mood associated with time alone. Limitations, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed.","Rodriguez, Micaela; Bellet, Benjamin W; McNally, Richard J",Cognit Ther Res,,482

Empirical results have shown that the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 is mostly positive for Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui, while mostly negative for Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. The remaining five provinces Guangdong, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang are showing the mixed trends. These differences among the provinces can be explained by the differences in the number of COVID-19 cases, temperature, and the province's overall hospital facilitations. The study concludes that maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for patients while COVID-19 is being treated may be rational.","Shahzad, Farrukh; Shahzad, Umer; Fareed, Zeeshan; Iqbal, Najaf; Hashmi, Shujahat Haider; Ahmad, Fayyaz",Sci Total Environ,,482
243229,Expanding from the Small Screen – Arts Practice for Affective Digital Presence,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States led to a variety of mandates intended to decrease population movement and ""flatten the curve."" However, there is evidence some are not able to stay-at-home due to certain disadvantages, thus remaining exposed to both coronavirus disease 2019 and trauma. We therefore sought to identify any unequal effects of the California stay-at-home orders between races and insurance statuses in a multicenter study utilizing trauma volume data. METHODS: A posthoc multicenter retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 centers in Southern California between the dates of January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, was performed. The number of trauma patients of each race/insurance status was tabulated per day. We then calculated the changes in trauma volume related to stay-at-home orders for each race/insurance status and compared the magnitude of these changes using statistical resampling. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there was a 40.1% drop in total trauma volume, which occurred 20 days after stay-at-home orders. During stay-at-home orders, the average daily trauma volume of patients with Medicaid increased by 13.7 ± 5.3%, whereas the volume of those with Medicare, private insurance, and no insurance decreased. The average daily trauma volume decreased for White, Black, Asian, and Latino patients with the volume of Black and Latino patients dropping to a similar degree compared to White patients. CONCLUSION: This retrospective multicenter study demonstrated that patients with Medicaid had a paradoxical increase in trauma volume during stay-at-home orders, suggesting that the most impoverished groups remain disproportionately exposed to trauma during a pandemic, further exacerbating existing health disparities.","Yeates, Eric O; Juillard, Catherine; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Penaloza-Villalobos, Liz; Lin, Ann; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Yeates, Todd O; Nahmias, Jeffry",Surgery (St. Louis),,482

Furthermore, each word in an instruction is time-aligned to the virtual poses of instruction creators and validators. We establish baseline scores for monolingual and multilingual settings and multitask learning when including Room-to-Room annotations. We also provide results for a model that learns from synchronized pose traces by focusing only on portions of the panorama attended to in human demonstrations.

CASE REPORT A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital (Ospedale Degli Infermi, Biella, Italy) presenting with symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab, authorized and validated by the World Health Organization, confirmed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with severe respiratory distress and underwent orotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation. She was extubated after 9 days in the intensive care unit. After extubation, the patient experienced an onset of dysphonia, and was evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The videolaryngoscopy revealed the presence of an ulceration at the level of the left vocal cord. Steroids and proton pump inhibitors were administered as primary therapy for 1 week. Two weeks later, a significant improvement in the patient's voice quality was observed. A second videolaryngoscopy was performed, which displayed healing of the ulcer at the level of the left vocal fold and rapid re-epithelialization. CONCLUSIONS This report has shown that with increasing numbers of cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, clinical guidelines should be followed to ensure that the incidence of complications such as vocal cord ulceration are as low as possible.","Bertone, Fabio; Robiolio, Emanuele; Gervasio, Carmine Fernando",Am J Case Rep,,482
244325,Problems and ways of forming the educational strategy of students in the process of remote learning,2020,"COVID-19 poses an infectious risk to healthcare workers especially during airway management. We compared the impact of early versus late intubation on infection control and performance in a randomised in situ simulation, using fluorescent powder as a surrogate for contamination. Twenty anaesthetists and intensivists intubated a simulated patient with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the degree of contamination. The secondary outcomes included the use of bag-valve-mask ventilation, the incidence of manikin cough, intubation time, first attempt success and heart rate variability as a measure of stress. The contamination score was significantly increased in the late intubation group, mean (standard deviation, SD) 17.20 (6.17), 95% confidence intervals (CI) 12.80 to 21.62 versus the early intubation group, mean (SD) 9.90 (5.13), 95% CI 6.23 to 13.57, P = 0.005. The contamination score was increased after simulated cough occurrence (mean (SD) 18.0 (5.09) versus 5.50 (2.10) in those without cough; P<0.001), and when first attempt laryngoscopy failed (mean (SD) of 17.1 (6.41) versus 11.6 (6.20) P = 0.038). The incidence of bag-mask ventilation was higher in the late intubation group (80% versus 30%; P=0.035). There was no significant difference in intubation time, incidence of failed first attempt laryngoscopy or heart rate variability between the two groups. Late intubation in patients with COVID-19 may be associated with greater laryngoscopist contamination and potential aerosol-generating events compared with early intubation. There was no difference in performance measured by intubation time and incidence of first attempt success. Late intubation, especially when resources are limited, may be a valid approach. However, strict infection control and appropriate personal protective equipment usage is recommended in such cases.","Lee, Christopher P; Yip, Yu-Yeung; Chan, Albert Km; Ko, Chun P; Joynt, Gavin M",Anaesth Intensive Care,,482

245846,Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (Edition 6),2020,"Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency has imposed important challenges in the lives of individuals, particularly since the restriction of free movement. In Spain, this mandatory home confinement started on March 14, 2020. In this scenario, some calls have been made to better understand the exact impact of the quarantine on the emotional status of individuals across time. Materials and Methods: On the first day that the Spanish government imposed the quarantine, our team launched an online longitudinal study to monitor emotional responses to the COVID-19 emergency over time. For 2 weeks, 187 people have responded to a daily diary on emotion functioning. An emotion network analysis was performed to study the network structure of 30 mood states and its changes during the first 2 weeks of the quarantine. Results: The emotional network showed critical changes in the interactions of emotions over time. An analysis of mean emotional levels did not show statistically significant changes in mood over time. Interestingly, two different network patterns were found when the sample was divided between those with favorable responses and those with unfavorable responses. Discussion: This new approach to the study of longitudinal changes of the mood state network of the population reveals different adaptation strategies reflected on the sample's emotional network. This network approach can help identify most fragile individuals (more vulnerable to external stressors) before they develop clear and identifiable psychopathology and also help identify anti-fragile individuals (those who improve their functioning in the face of external stressors). This is one of the first studies to apply an emotional network approach to study the psychological effects of pandemics and might offer some clues to psychologists and health administrators to help people cope with and adjust to this critical situation.","Martín-Brufau, Ramón; Suso-Ribera, Carlos; Corbalán, Javier",Front Psychol,,482

We compared the infection and mortality rates and relation to/of COVID-19 between countries with and without universal respiratory disease vaccine policies. METHODS: In this ecological study, 186 countries with COVID-19 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. RESULTS: The study found that countries with universal BCG (bacillus Calmette Guérin) vaccine had a significantly lower total infection and mortality rates, 0.2979 and 0.0077 vs. 3.7445, and 0.0957/1000 people and confirmed cases (P<0.001). The countries with universal Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV); including PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3 vaccines had significantly higher total mortality, 0.0111 vs. 0.0080, respectively (P=0.032). The higher income was associated with increasing total infection and mortality rates. Whereas, BCG vaccination was associated with a lower total mortality rate only (P=0.030). The high-income countries were more likely to not receive universal BCG and receive second dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV2) and third dose of PCV3 vaccination coverage. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rates increased with increasing years of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (P=0.026) and Pneumococcal conjugate 3rd dose (PCV3). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that BCG vaccination could reduce the infection caused by COVID-19 and MCV2 vaccine years increases the total infection rate. This study identified high economic characteristics and not having universal BCG coverage as the independent risk factors of mortality by the multivariate analysis.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, Alan Bapeer",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,482

256569,Towards nexus-based governance_ defining interactions between economic activities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),2020,"All over the world pharmacists are standing up to the challenge of COVID- 19 and showing their commitment to the communities they serve. As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID­19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","Jordan, Dominique; Guiu-Segura, Josep M; Sousa-Pinto, Gonçalo; Wang, Lin-Nam",Farm Hosp,,482

Telephone interviews were conducted in April/May 2020 (T1) and August 2020 (T2). The psychosocial impact (PSI) of the pandemic and psychopathology were measured. Changes between T1 and T2 were examined. Patients' psychosocial support system six months before the pandemic and at T1/T2 was assessed. We found a significant positive correlation between general PSI and depression as well as severity of illness. General PSI differed significantly depending on social contact. Neither general PSI nor psychopathology changed significantly between T1 and T2. At T1, patients' psychosocial support systems were reduced as compared to six months before. Patients reported an increase in psychosocial support between T1 and T2 and high demand for additional support (sports, arts/occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy). Elderly psychiatric patients show a negative PSI of the pandemic. They are likely to suffer from an impaired psychosocial situation, emphasizing the importance of developing concepts for sufficient psychosocial support during a pandemic.","Seethaler, Magdalena; Just, Sandra; Stötzner, Philip; Bermpohl, Felix; Brandl, Eva Janina",Psychiatr. q,,482
258504,Mobile Learning in Higher Education: Structural Equation Model for Good Teaching Practices,2020,"Waste activated sludge (WAS) and animal manure are two significant reservoirs of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the environment. However, GC degradation during anaerobic digestion (AD) of WAS or animal manure has rarely been investigated. In this study, co-fermentation of WAS and animal manure was conducted to investigate the performance of AD in controlling GC dissemination. Effects of manure type on GC degradation and sludge acidification were investigated. The results showed that co-fermentation of WAS and chicken manure (CM) significantly enhanced the degradation of hydrocortisone (HC) to 99%, betamethasone (BT) to 99%, fluocinolone acetonide (FA) to 98%, and clobetasol propionate (CP) to 82% in 5 days with a mixing ratio of 1:1 (g TS sludge/g dw manure) at 55 °C and initial pH of 7. Simultaneously, sludge reduction was increased by 30% and value-added volatile fatty acid (VFA) production was improved by 40%. Even a high GC content of biomass (3.6 mg/g TS) did not impact both sludge hydrolysis and acidification. The amendment of WAS with CM increased soluble organic carbon, Ca2+, and relative abundance of anaerobes (Eubacterium) associated with organic compound degradation. Furthermore, 44 transformation products of HC, BT, FA, and CP with lower lipophilicity and toxicity were identified, indicating possible degradation pathways including hydroxylation, ketonization, ring cleavage, defluorination, hydrogenation, methylation, and de-esterification. Overall, this study provides a practical way to control GC pollution and simultaneously promote waste reduction and VFA production. Animal manure type as an overlooked factor for influencing co-fermentation performance and pollutant degradation was also highlighted.","Zhang, Ai; He, Jinling; Shen, Yuye; Xu, Xianbao; Liu, Yanan; Li, Yongmei; Wu, Shimin; Xue, Gang; Li, Xiang; Makinia, Jacek",Environ Res,,482

(2) How was online communication from the agencies diversified in terms of targeting specific organizations and social groups? Our findings indicate that public health agencies relied heavily on internal scientific expertise and predominately coordinated their communication efforts with national government agencies Furthermore, our analysis reveals that agencies in each country differed in how they diversify information;however, all agencies provided tailored information to at least some organizations and social groups Across the three countries, information tailored for several vulnerable groups (e g , pregnant women, people with disabilities, immigrants, and homeless populations) was largely absent, which may contribute to negative consequences for these groups","Tagliacozzo, Serena Albrecht Frederike Ganapati N.

262013,"Weekly Assessment of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Risk of Importation - China, April 1, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe COVID-19. We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, IFN-&#955;1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-&#955;1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to activation of fundamentally different innate immune pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection, and emphasize drivers of severe COVID-19 to focus both mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.","Karaba, Andrew H; Zhou, Weiqiang; Hsieh, Leon L; Figueroa, Alexis; Massaccesi, Guido; Rothman, Richard E; Fenstermacher, Katherine Z J; Sauer, Lauren; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Blair, Paul W; Robinson, Matthew L; Leung, Sherry; Wesson, Russell; Alachkar, Nada; El-Diwany, Ramy; Ji, Hongkai; Cox, Andrea L",Clin. infect. dis,,482
262330,Redefining the Use of Sustainable Development Goals at the Organisation and Project Levels—A Survey of Engineers,2020,"There is a desperate need for safe and effective vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for SARS- coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), the development of which will be aided by the discovery of potent and selective antibodies against relevant viral epitopes. Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a naïve human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2.","Parray, Hilal Ahmad; Chiranjivi, Adarsh Kumar; Asthana, Shailendra; Yadav, Naveen; Shrivastava, Tripti; Mani, Shailendra; Sharma, Chandresh; Vishwakarma, Preeti; Das, Supratik; Pindari, Kamal; Sinha, Subrata; Samal, Sweety; Ahmed, Shubbir; Kumar, Rajesh",J Biol Chem,,482

264720,"Healthcare commodities for emergencies in Africa: review of logistics models, suggested model and research agenda",2020,"COVID-19 led to a recent high-profile proposal to reintroduce oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the United States (U.S.), initially in clinical trials, but potentially for widespread and repeated use. We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Risk anal,,482

267825,Effects of wearing masks on human health and comfort during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fast, reliable and easy to handle methods are required to facilitate urgently needed point-of-care testing (POCT) in the current coronavirus pandemic. Life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world, infecting more than 33,500,000 people and killing over 1 million of them as of October 2020. Infected individuals without any symptoms might still transfer the virus to others underlining the extraordinary transmissibility of this new coronavirus. In order to identify early infections effectively, treat patients on time and control disease spreading, rapid, accurate and onsite testing methods are urgently required. RESULTS: Here we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based method to detect SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8 and N directly from pharyngeal swab samples. The established reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay detects SARS-CoV-2 directly from pharyngeal swab samples without previous time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction. The assay is sensitive and highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing no cross reactivity when tested on 20 other respiratory pathogens. The assay is 12 times faster and 10 times cheaper than routine reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction, depending on the assay used. CONCLUSION: The fast and easy to handle RT-LAMP assay amplifying specifically the genomic regions ORF8 and N of SARS-CoV-2 is ideally suited for POCT at e.g. railway stations, airports or hospitals.

To our knowledge, there are no treatments for COVID-19-related olfactory disorder. Here, we report five olfactory disorder cases in COVID-19, treated using the Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine, kakkontokasenkyushin'i. We treated five patients with mild COVID-19 at an isolation facility using Kampo medicine, depending on their symptoms. Patients with the olfactory disorder presented with a blocked nose, nasal discharge or taste impairment. Physical examination using Kampo medicine showed similar findings, such as a red tongue with red spots and sublingual vein congestion, which presented as blood stasis and inflammation; thus, we prescribed the Kampo medicine, kakkontokasenkyushin'i. After administration, the numeric rating scale scores of the smell impairment improved within 3 days from 9 to 3 in case 1, from 10 to 0 in case 2, from 9 to 0 in case 3, from 5 to 0 in case 4, and from 9 to 0 within 5 days in case 5. Following the treatment, other common cold symptoms were also alleviated. Kakkontokasenkyushin'i can be used for treating nasal congestion, rhinitis, and inflammation in the nasal mucosa.

While clinical symptoms present in some COVID-19 patients, others have been incidentally identified. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were symptomatic or had atypical symptoms and to make a contribution to the literature. METHODS: Patients with the likelihood of having COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated with RT-PCR samples, other laboratory tests, and chest computed tomography. RESULTS: There were significant differences between these groups in terms of age, dyspnea, saturation, and comor-bidities including hypertension [HT] in 19 patients, cerebrovascular events [CVE] that were classified as other diseases in two patients (intracranial mass in one patient and Alzheimer's disease in one patient), and CRP and platelet counts (PLT) among the laboratory parameters (for all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical symptoms have increased due to the progression of the outbreak. Infected people with atypical symptoms can act as sources of the infection. Therefore, the epidemiological history of these patients should be sought in detail, and individuals with atypical symptoms in society should be identified as soon as possible in order to control the spreading of the disease.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Unlu, Elif N; Oksuz, Sukru",Clin. lab,,482

Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS: A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. CONCLUSION: Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self-care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.","Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Chua, Hong Choon; Sim, Kang",Singapore Med J,,482
273644,Application of the Salient Practices Framework for Undergraduate Research Mentoring in Virtual Environments,2021,"Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. VDD among African-Americans, diabetics, hypertensive, and aged populations possibly explain the higher death rate, aggravated by cocooning. Vitamin D is pleiotropic, mediating bone metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and immune functions, whereas VDD is associated with inflammatory reactions and immune dysfunction, predisposing individuals to severe infections. Vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immunity via the expression of genes that code antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). And the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)14, the co-receptor for epidermal toll-like receptor (TLR)4. AMPs stimulate TLR2 in macrophages, increasing the conversion of vitamin D into its active form by cytochrome P450 27B1. Antiviral properties of vitamin D-induced AMPs can shift the polarization of the adaptive immune response from helper T cells (Th)1 to the more regulatory Th2 responses that suppress immune over-reactivity by preventing cytokine storm, which is already demonstrated during the Spanish flu episode. Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by both direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, the interplay between major cellular and viral elements, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, variation of genetic and epigenetic factors. The crosstalk between vitamin D and intracellular signaling pathways may operate as a primary regulatory action on viral gene transcription. VDD may increase the likelihood of infection with enveloped viruses, including retrovirus, hepatitis, and dengue. Global data correlates severe VDD with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, disrupted immune response and mortality, reduced platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time, suggesting benefits from supplementation. Key teaching points Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, induction of autophagy, etc. Epidemiology of VDD partly explains geographical differences in COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality.

274823,Job Satisfaction as a Driver for Sustainable Development in the Hospitality Industry? Evidence from the Alpine Region,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 was first seen in December 2019. Due to the insidious and complex nature of the disease, the list of symptoms is rapidly expanding. So far, few studies have reported sudden sensorineural hearing loss as a possible symptom of coronavirus disease 2019. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old woman with a complaint of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and subjective severe tinnitus presented to the ENT clinic. Coronavirus disease 2019 was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction test. At the time of presentation, she was treated with intra-tympanic dexamethasone. Improvements in hearing threshold and speech perception, and a subjective reduction in tinnitus, were observed after treatment. CONCLUSION: This case report supports evidence from other case reports of a possible association between coronavirus disease 2019 and sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss may be a symptom of this disease that behaves as an underlying aggravating factor. Intra-tympanic injection of corticosteroids is recommended for managing these patients during the pandemic.","Rahimi, V; Asiyabar, M K; Rouhbakhsh, N",J Laryngol Otol,,482
275598,Imparting Scientific Literacy through an Online Materials Chemistry General Education Course,2021,"The clinical symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia are similar. Effective predictive markers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from CAP in the current pandemic conditions. Copeptin, a 39-aminoacid glycopeptide, is a C-terminal part of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). The activation of the AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aims to determine serum copeptin levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze the power of copeptin in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia. The study consists of 98 patients with COVID-19 and 44 patients with CAP. The basic demographic and clinical data of all patients were recorded, and blood samples were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to CAP patients (10.2 ± 4.4 ng/ml and 7.1 ± 3.1 ng/ml; p < .001). Serum copeptin levels were positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet count (r = -.21, p = .012; r = -.21, p = .013; r = -.20, p = .018; respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased copeptin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.183, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.354; p = .015) and CK-MB (OR = 1.052, 95% CI, 1.013-1.092; p = .008) levels and decreased leukocyte count (OR = 0.829, 95% CI, 0.730-0.940; p = .004) were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off value of 6.83 ng/ml for copeptin predicted COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 73% (AUC: 0.764% 95 Cl: 0.671-0.856, p < .001). Copeptin could be a promising and useful biomarker to be used to distinguish COVID-19 patients from CAP patients.","Kuluöztürk, Mutlu; In, Erdal; Telo, Selda; Karabulut, Ercan; Geçkil, Aysegül Altintop",J Med Virol,,482

Our study aimed at assessing 1) CXR manifestations, frequency, and distribution; 2) the feasibility and repeatability of a CXR severity score; and 3) the correlation between the CXR severity score and clinical and laboratory parameters. We reviewed baseline CXRs and clinical data of consecutive patients who presented to our emergency department and resulted positive at SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-PCR oropharyngeal swab test from March 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020. Lung abnormalities and their distribution were analyzed. A score of CXR severity was assigned by two radiologists, independently, according to the extent of lung involvement, with a maximum score of 8 for CXR. Correlations between the CXR score and the clinical data were assessed. One hundred fifty-five patients were included; 143/155 (92%) were positive at baseline CXR. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (141/143, 99%). Involvement was mainly bilateral (96/143, 67%), with peripheral distribution (79/143, 55%). The mean CXR severity score was 3.3 (±2); interobserver agreement was excellent, with a Cohen's K correlation coefficient of 0.901. The CXR score showed a significant positive correlation with C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and fever duration, and a negative correlation with oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray findings are in line with those reported by computed tomography studies. The use of a visual CXR score, easy to assess and highly reproducible, can reflect the clinical severity and help the patients' management.","Orsi, Marcello A; Oliva, Giancarlo; Toluian, Tahereh; Valenti Pittino, Carlo; Panzeri, Marta; Cellina, Michaela",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,482

Microbatching is a standard method to alleviate this and is fully supported in the TensorFlow Privacy library (TFDP). However, this technique, while improving training times also reduces the quality of the gradients and degrades the classification accuracy. Recent works that for example use the JAX framework show promise in also alleviating this but still show degradation in throughput from non-private to private SGD on CNNs, and have not yet shown ImageNet implementations. In our work, we argue that low batch sizes using group normalization on ResNet-50 can yield high accuracy and privacy on Graphcore IPUs.

Here, we have highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory bulb. From the olfactory bulb, SARS-CoV-2 may target the deeper parts of the brain including the thalamus and brainstem by trans-synaptic transfer described for many other viral diseases. Following this, the virus might infect the respiratory center of brain, which could be accountable for the respiratory breakdown of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to screen the COVID-19 patients for neurological symptoms as well as possibility of the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem should be investigated in depth.","Gandhi, Sonu; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana; Tripathi, Prem Prakash",ACS Chem Neurosci,,482

Experiential apprentice-style training is traditionally recognised as an important aspect of obtaining competency. In March 2020 they were stood down from their general practice placements in the context of a national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute conversion of their general practice education from experiential clinical exposure to online and offsite learning was required. This paper describes the steps taken and the underlying theoretical foundations for our expediently developed online course. Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum. Within this theory, we propose a five-stage model of learning. Learning from this experience contributes to the body of knowledge around online education, particularly in meeting the needs of a clinical attachment traditionally grounded in experiential learning.

286705,Survey of Smartphone Contact-Tracing Apps Architectures (preprint),2021,"AIMS: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care provision to patients suffering from pelvic floor dysfunctions in Italy. METHODS: A retrospective web-based interdisciplinary survey was mailed by the Italian Society of Urodynamics to members involved in pelvic floor dysfunctions management from June 22, 2020 to July 17, 2020. The 84-item questionnaire investigated the period March-June 2020 (first epidemic wave) and showed high content validity. The primary outcome was the mean rate of cancellation for health-care services. Secondary outcomes included estimation of the accumulated surgeries backload until return to baseline activity and of the recovery pattern, using linear regression and scenario-based forecasting. RESULTS: A total of 85 participants provided complete responses. Respondents were mostly urologists (47%), followed by gynecologists (29.5%) and physiatrists (17.6%). On average, 78.4% of outpatient services and 82.7% of functional surgeries were canceled, without significant differences by geographical distribution. An impact on patients' quality of life was anticipated by most of the respondents (87%) and 48.2% also reported potentially serious health risks for patients. Thirty-three percent of the respondents reported the use of telemedicine. If the nation-wide surgical activity increases by 20% postpandemic, it would take 37 months to clear the backlog of functional surgeries. We acknowledge the inherent limitations of the survey methodology and retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: Access to care for patients suffering from pelvic floor dysfunctions has been dramatically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The indirect effects of this unprecedented disruption on pelvic floor dysfunctions care may last for several months.","Sacco, Emilio; Gandi, Carlo; Li Marzi, Vincenzo; Lamberti, Gianfranco; Serati, Maurizio; Agro039,; Finazzi, Enrico; Soligo, Marco",Neurourol Urodyn,,482

287145,Exploring the Competing Influences of Privacy Concerns and Positive Beliefs on Citizen Acceptance of Contact Tracing Mobile Applications,2021,"Since the late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been spread all around the world. The pandemic is a critical challenge to the health and safety of the general public, the medical staff and the medical systems worldwide. It has been globally proposed to utilise robots during the pandemic, to improve the treatment of patients and leverage the load of the medical system. However, there is still a lack of detailed and systematic review of the robotic research for the pandemic, from the technologies' perspective. Thus a thorough literature survey is conducted in this research and more than 280 publications have been reviewed, with the focus on robotics during the pandemic. The main contribution of this literature survey is to answer two research questions, i.e. 1) what the main research contributions are to combat the pandemic from the robotic technologies' perspective, and 2) what the promising supporting technologies are needed during and after the pandemic to help and guide future robotics research. The current achievements of robotic technologies are reviewed and discussed in different categories, followed by the identification of the representative work's technology readiness level. The future research trends and essential technologies are then highlighted, including artificial intelligence, 5 G, big data, wireless sensor network, and human-robot collaboration.","Wang, Xi Vincent; Wang, Lihui",,,482

Methods: We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time. Conclusion: COVID-19 had affected eastern Denmark, especially the Capital Region, considerably more than western Denmark. The difference may relate to population density and housing conditions.","Holmager, Therese Lf; Lynge, Elsebeth; Kann, Caroline E; St-Martin, Gry",Scand J Public Health,,482

The purpose of the study is to a) describe the importance of a correct management of SARS-CoV-2 infections; b) report the number of positive healthcare workers after the epidemic phase and to describe their socio-characteristics data, the main methods of transmission and the symptoms; c) to report the seroconversion rate of healthcare workers (HCWs). The study was conducted from March 9, 2020 to June 19, 2020 in three phases:1) in a first phase, we implemented the guidelines to be followed for patient care in our hospital; 2) in a second phase, we provided the epidemiological investigation/contact tracing of HCWs; 3) we collected swabs on all healthcare workers and we also performed serological investigation. The number of healthcare workers under surveillance is of 2611 subjects and, of these, only 0.65% contracted COVID-19. In particular, 70.6% of these have been infected in the healthcare setting, 11, 8% in the family and 17.6% returning from high risk areas. Ultimately, only 0.1% of HCWs dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19 patients contracted the infection (one was asymptomatic).

In vitro models include two-dimensional (2D) cultures of immortalized cell lines or primary cells and three-dimensional (3D) cultures derived from lung, alveoli, bronchi, and other organs. Although cell-based systems are economic and allow strict control of experimental variables, they do not always resemble physiological conditions. Thus, several in vivo models are being developed, including different strains of mice, hamsters, ferrets, dogs, cats, and non-human primates. In this review, we summarize the main models of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed so far and discuss their advantages, drawbacks and main uses.","Rosa, Rafael B; Dantas, Willyenne M; do Nascimento, Jessica C F; da Silva, Murilo V; de Oliveira, Ronaldo N; Pena, Lindomar J",Viruses,,482

The attrition stemming from this highly contagious disease particularly affects those rendered vulnerable by age and infirmity, including those with underlying cardiovascular disease. This article critically reviews how best to integrate supportive care into the management of those affected. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have described the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including that specifically arising in those with cardiovascular disease. Potential treatment strategies have emerged but there is limited guidance on the provision of palliative care. A framework for implementation of this service needs to be developed, perhaps involving the training of non-specialists to deliver primary palliative care in the community, bolstered by the use of telemedicine. The appropriate use of limited clinical resources has engendered many challenging discussions and complex ethical decisions. Prospective implementation of future policies requires the incorporation of measures to assuage moral distress, burnout and compassion fatigue in healthcare staff who are psychologically and physically exhausted. SUMMARY: Further research based on patient-centred decision making and advance care planning is required to ensure the supportive needs of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease are adequately met. This research should focus on interventions applicable to daily healthcare practice and include strategies to safeguard staff well-being.","Hill, Loreena; Lambrinou, Ekaterini; Moser, Debra K; Beattie, James M",Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,,482

In a context of limited diagnostic capacity with the reference technique (real-time RT-PCR), many manufacturers have developed rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Although very promising in theory, these tests have raised many questions. This article is a rapid review that synthesizes data regarding different types of available RDTs, their performance, their limits and their potential indications in Tunisia as proposed by a multidisciplinary group of experts. METHODS: A literature review was carried out on the websites of international organizations, governmental bodies and on INAHTA database, completed by a search of relevant scientific articles up to 1 June 2020. The synthesis of the data was submitted to a panel of experts to propose recommendations for the Tunisian context. RESULTS: RDTs based on the detection of antigens and antibodies have sensitivity and specificity related issues. Few validation reports are published in the scientific literature. Pending more evidence on their performance and validity, several international organizations recommend their use only for research purposes. TDRs based on antibody detection are not appropriate for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. However, validated and specific tests could provide complementary diagnostic information to reference tests. CONCLUSION: Pending further evidence, the panel recommends the use of RDTs mainly for research purposes at the community level.","Jameleddine Chtioui, Mouna; Grati, Hela; Harzallah, Nabil; Odabachian Jebali, Marie Christine; Trabelsi, Abdelhalim; Ben Ahmed, Mélika; Thabet, Lamia; Mhalla, Salma; Ben Moussa, Mohamed; Messaoud, Taieb; Ben Romdhane, Habiba; Toumi, Adnene; Hamouda, Chokri",Tunis Med,,482

The understanding of the transmission and the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the timeframe and potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to antibody response. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9-53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10-37 days). Replicating virus was detected in samples from 4 patients at 9-16 days. All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 33 out of 36 patients. Total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated. High levels of both total IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in patients sampled later after symptom onset and in patients where replicating virus could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the presence of SARS-Cov-2 specific antibodies in serum may indicate a lower risk of shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 by hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Glans, Hedvig; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Olausson, Mikaela; Falck-Jones, Sara; Varnaite, Renata; Christ, Wanda; Maleki, Kimia T; Karlberg, Maria Lind; Broddesson, Sandra; Falck-Jones, Ryan; Bell, Max; Johansson, Niclas; Färnert, Anna; Smed-Sörensen, Anna; Klingström, Jonas; Bråve, Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,,482

298355,Alleviating debt distress and advancing the sustainable development goals,2021,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of urinary trace elements in patients with COVID-19 still remains to be investigated. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on a cohort of 138 confirmed COVID-19 patients for their urinary levels of essential and/or toxic metals including chromium, manganese, copper, arsenic, selenium, cadmium, mercury, thallium and lead according to the different disease severity (severe or non-severe) and outcome (recovered or deceased). RESULTS: Urinary concentrations of chromium, manganese, copper, selenium, cadmium, mercury and lead after creatinine adjustment were found to be higher in severe patients than the non-severe cases with COVID-19. And among the severe cases, these elements were also higher in the deceased group than the recovered group. When the weeks of the post-symptom onset were taken in account, the changes of these urinary elements were existed across the clinical course since the disease onset. These urinary elements were found to be mostly positively inter-correlated, and further positively correlated with other laboratory inflammatory parameters including serum cytokines (IL-1B, IL2R, IL6, IL8, IL10, TNF&#945;), ferritin, and neutrophil count and white blood cell count. As a independently predictive factor, urinary creatinine-adjusted copper of &#8805;25.57 µg/g and &#8805;99.32 µg/g were associated with significantly increased risk of severe illness and fatal outcome in COVID-19, respectively.

The frequency of engaging with pandemic-related media coverage was also considered across all symptom subtypes.MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted, with a total of 332 participants recruited. Participants who scored above the optimal cut-off score on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory Revised edition (OCI-R) were included in the analysis (n = 254). Scores on the six subscales of the OCI-R were correlated with responses to a COVID-19 Impact measure.ResultFactor analysis of the COVID-19 Impact measure revealed that items loaded on two components of the measure (handwashing and distress-avoidance). A significant correlation was revealed between the handwashing component and the OCI-R washing subscale (rs = 0.523, p = 0.0001), as well as between distress-avoidance and the OCI-R washing and ordering subscales (s = −0.227, p = 0.0001;rs = −0.159, p = 0.006). Content analysis revealed disruption to treatment delivery and worsening symptom severity in participants with contamination-related OCD.ConclusionThe pandemic has had a significant impact on individuals with contamination-related OCD symptoms, in relation to symptom severity and treatment disruption. Consideration should be given to targeted support tailored to patients with this subtype of OCD.","Hassoulas, Athanasios Umla-Runge Katja Adams Olivia Scurlock-Green Madeline Zahir Abeer Hassoulas Antonia Panayiotou Eliana",BJPsych Open,,482

A double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation with open-ended question technique was implemented based on the responses to a national survey administered during the first week of November 2020. The final sample size was 1285. The results showed that individual WTP values increased with income, whether a household member had any pre-existing condition, and perceived threat of the virus. The vaccine efficacy rate and duration of protection were found to be important factors for the respondents. The mean WTP for a vaccine with a 95 percent efficacy rate and 3-year protection (US$318.76) was approximately 35 percent greater than the vaccine with a 50 percent efficacy rate and 1-year protection (US$236.85). The initial aggregate direct benefit of the current vaccination program was estimated to be between 20 and 35.6 billion US dollars depending on the vaccine protection duration.","Catma, S.; Varol, S.",Vaccines (Basel),,482

Answers to this question are not static;they change as society and its problems change. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its corresponding disease COVID-19 presents such a problem: what is needed to navigate this complex situation that involves, among other things, mathematics? Using the essay genre, we use three narratives from three countries—Italy, the USA (California), and Germany—to reflect on the goals of teaching mathematics during this crisis and examine aspects of each country’s standards for mathematics education. These three stories are framed by the authors’ backgrounds, experiences, interests, their country’s situation, and response to the pandemic. We first present the three narratives and then examine common issues across them that might provide insights beyond this current crisis, for preparing students to become active citizens. In particular, we focus on three issues: (1) developing a positive mindset toward mathematics to engage with and reflect on real-world problems, (2) improving interdisciplinary connections to the sciences to better understand how science professional practices and insights are similar or different from everyday practices, and (3) considering interpersonal and collective matters beyond the individual.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has emerged as a pandemic by end-January 2020. Of the infected patients, 10%-15% may develop severe or critical illness. So far, no definite treatment is available for Covid-19. Cytokine release syndrome may underlie the pathogenesis of severe and critical disease. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 therapies are being tried to improve clinical outcomes. Methods: . We did a systematic review to identify the available literature on anti-IL-6 therapies in the treatment of Covid-19 and used the GRADE method to assess the quality of evidence. Results: . Four case series and 10 case reports were identified. On critical assessment, we found that these studies reported some beneficial effect of anti-IL-6 therapy, but all the studies had a high risk of bias. The pooled estimate showed that 42% of patients improved but with a very wide confidence interval (CI) (95% CI 1%-91%) and substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 95%). The overall quality of evidence was graded as 'very low'. Conclusions: . Although promising, anti-IL-6 therapy for Covid-19 needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials to provide robust evidence.","Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar; Seth, Tulika; Madan, Karan; Nischal, Neeraj; Soneja, Manish; Sharma, Atul; Garg, Pramod; Prasad, Kameshwar",Natl Med J India,,482

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing at a rapid speed. Till May 4, 2020, there have been 3,407,747 confirmed cases and 238,198 deaths globally. The common symptoms in pregnant women are fever, cough, and dyspnea. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has transient overexpression and increased activity during pregnancy, which is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. There is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is no valid medication or vaccination. The immune suppression or modulation during pregnancy increases the risk of severe pneumonia. Remdesivir is an antiviral medication targeting ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis that has clinical improvement in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine is controversial in its effectiveness and safety to treat SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is safe in pregnancy. Chloroquine has not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The management strategy includes monitoring fetal heart rate and uterine contractions; early oxygenation if O2 saturation is less than 95%; empiric antibiotics for prevention of secondary infection; corticosteroid to treat maternal SARS-CoV-2 disease routinely is not suggested, only for fetal lung maturation in selected cases; and consideration of delivery is according to the obstetric indication, gestational age, and severity of the disease. During epidemics, delivery at 32-34 weeks is considered. The indication for the Cesarean section should be flexible to minimize the risk of infection during the delivery. The newborn should be in isolation ward immediately after birth; breastfeeding is not contraindicated but should avoid direct transmission infection.","Lai, Yu-Ju; Chang, Chia-Ming; Lin, Chi-Kung; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Wang, Peng-Hui; Chang, Cheng-Chang",J Chin Med Assoc,,482

However, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease need further exploration. Therefore, this retrospective analysis was conducted on multiple indicators of peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 to determine the role of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of COVID-19. Baseline information and clinical records of 40 patients were collected, including demographic data, disease status, medication, and laboratory routine. The correlation between the inspection indicators and disease classification, as well as prognostic factors, was analyzed. Decreased eosinophils were detected in 33 out of 40 patients with COVID-19 on admission, while lymphocytes and eosinophils were inversely related to the severity of the disease, according to the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Thus, it could be deduced that eosinophils have better sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and play a major role similar to lymphocytes in assessing the prognosis of patients.","Tan, Yingzheng; Zhou, Juan; Zhou, Qing; Hu, Lingli; Long, Yunzhu",J Med Virol,,482

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: 114 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in February 2020 were enrolled by a convenience sampling method. The Chinese version of the Mishel Illness Uncertainty Scale (MUIS) was used to assess patients' degree of illness uncertainty, and multiple regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors. RESULTS: The average total score of MUIS (Chinese version) was 52.22 ± 12.51, indicating a moderate level of illness uncertainty. The dimension unpredictability turned out to have the highest mean score: 2.88 ± 0.90. The multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that female (t = 2.462, p = .015), monthly family income not less than RMB 10,000 (t = -2.095, p = .039), and disease duration of 28 days or more (t = 2.249, p = .027) were independent influencing factors of illness uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 are at a moderate level of illness uncertainty. Medical staffs should pay more attention to female patients, patients with lower monthly family income, patients with the prolonged disease, and take targeted interventions to help them reduce illness uncertainty. IMPACT: Facing the brand new and unknown infectious disease, patients confirmed of COVID-19 suffer from immense physical and psychological stress, where illness uncertainty is a major stressor that troubles patients. The present study surveys illness uncertainty among patients with COVID-19 in the mobile cabin hospital with results revealing a moderate level. Study results will benefit nurses in any setting where care for patients with COVID-19 is provided, public policymakers and future researchers.","Dong, Liang; Chen, Lei; Ding, Shu",,,482

Several groups have recently demonstrated an affinity of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein for heparan sulfates and a reduced binding to cells in the presence of heparin or heparinase treatment. Here, we investigated the inhibitory activity of several sulfated and sulfonated molecules, which prevent interaction with heparan sulfates, against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped-SARS-CoV-2 and the authentic SARS-CoV-2. Sulfonated cyclodextrins and nanoparticles that have recently shown broad-spectrum non-toxic virucidal activity against many heparan sulfates binding viruses showed inhibitory activity in the micromolar and nanomolar ranges, respectively. In stark contrast with the mechanisms that these compounds present for these other viruses, the inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 was found to be simply reversible.","Gasbarri, Matteo; V039,; kovski, Philip; Torriani, Giulia; Thiel, Volker; Stellacci, Francesco; Tapparel, Caroline; Cagno, Valeria",,,482

However, clinical observations frequently identified neurological symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders related to COVID-19 (Neuro-SARS2). Accumulated robust evidence indicates that Neuro-SARS2 may play an important role in aggravating the disease severity and mortality. Understanding the neuropathogenesis and cellular mechanisms underlying Neuro-SARS2 is crucial for both basic research and clinical practice to establish effective strategies for early detection/diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms. In this review, we will comprehensively examine current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various neural cells including neurons, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, pericytes/endothelial cells, ependymocytes/choroid epithelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Although significant progress has been made in studying Neuro-SARS2, much remains to be learned about the neuroinvasive routes (transneuronal and hematogenous) of the virus and the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying the development/progression of this disease.

311966,Agricultural automation: A strategic dilemma of a rich Indian farmer,2021,"BACKGROUND: The onset of COVID-19 required rapid organisational changes in the mental health domain. Most mental health-care departments appear to have set up infection control measures and also organised planning, coordination and measures that enabled them to provide psychiatric care in a restrictive environment. Our objective was to assess the organisation by psychiatric facilities in France of their response to COVID-19, during the first wave. METHODS: In June 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed by an audit with 48 items which was proposed to 331 hospitals in metropolitan France with a capacity for full-time, that is, inpatient psychiatric hospitalisation of adults. RESULTS: Of the 331 establishments contacted, 94 (28.4%) agreed to respond to the survey questionnaire. Full-time inpatient hospitalisation was completely or partially maintained by 94.7% (n = 89) of facilities. Specific measures concerning respect for patients' rights were reported by 58% (n = 55) of establishments. Overall, 74.5% (n = 70) had set up a dedicated channel of care for patients at risk of severe COVID-19, and 52.1% (n = 49) a system for routine screening at admission for these risk factors. Nearly half the establishments (48.9%, n = 46) reported they had set up specific training programmes for patients about barrier measures and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: French psychiatric establishments on the whole were able to provide a necessary reorganisation of their management of patients and their families, regardless of facility status. Patients' rights nonetheless seem to have not received the attention they merited during the early pandemic period. Somatic management of patients with mental illness must absolutely be improved.","Legrand, Guillaume; Boisgard, Catherine; Canac, Bernard; Cardinaud, Zuzana; Gorla, Michela Giugiario; Gregoire, Elisabeth; Jamon, Caroline; Oussal, Tarik; Vaury, Pascal",BMC Psychiatry,,482

Valuable amount of Zn (15.21 ± 0.07 mg/100‐g powder) was present in pumpkin seeds powder.Pumpkin parts (peel, flesh, and seeds) own high nutritional significance due to the presence of total phenolics, flavonoids, total carotenoids, and appreciable amount of macroelements and microelements. Organic waste generated as a result of pumpkin processing could effectively be utilized in different food products for the development of functional and medicinal foods. Notably, pumpkin seeds are high in zinc content, and in this situation of COVID‐19 pandemic, scientific community is well aware of oxidation and mediating role of zinc for activation of enzymes in the body. Phytochemicals present in pumpkin peel, flesh, and seeds can fight against antiaging and enhance immunity. These low‐cost powders from pumpkin parts can be used as a potential source of functional foods and nutraceuticals in food and medicinal industries.

315465,Editorial – Tourism Trends – Part 1,2020,"Brazil currently has one of the fastest-growing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemics in the world. Because of limited available data, assessments of the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on this virus spread remain challenging. Using a mobility-driven transmission model, we show that NPIs reduced the reproduction number from >3 to 1 to 1.6 in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset identified >100 international virus introductions in Brazil. We estimate that most (76%) of the Brazilian strains fell in three clades that were introduced from Europe between 22 February and 11 March 2020. During the early epidemic phase, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spread mostly locally and within state borders. After this period, despite sharp decreases in air travel, we estimated multiple exportations from large urban centers that coincided with a 25% increase in average traveled distances in national flights. This study sheds new light on the epidemic transmission and evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil and provides evidence that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in this country.","Candido, Darlan S; Claro, Ingra M; de Jesus, Jaqueline G; Souza, William M; Moreira, Filipe R R; Dellicour, Simon; Mellan, Thomas A; du Plessis, Louis; Pereira, Rafael H M; Sales, Flavia C S; Manuli, Erika R; Thézé, Julien; Almeida, Luiz; Menezes, Mariane T; Voloch, Carolina M; Fumagalli, Marcilio J; Coletti, Thaís M; da Silva, Camila A M; Ramundo, Mariana S; Amorim, Mariene R; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique H; Mishra, Swapnil; Gill, Mandev S; Carvalho, Luiz M; Buss, Lewis F; Prete, Carlos A; Ashworth, Jordan; Nakaya, Helder I; Peixoto, Pedro S; Brady, Oliver J; Nicholls, Samuel M; Tanuri, Amilcar; Rossi, Átila D; Braga, Carlos K V; Gerber, Alexandra L; de C Guimarães, Ana Paula; Gaburo, Nelson; Alencar, Cecila Salete; Ferreira, Alessandro C S; Lima, Cristiano X; Levi, José Eduardo; Granato, Celso; Ferreira, Giulia M; Francisco, Ronaldo S; Granja, Fabiana; Garcia, Marcia T; Moretti, Maria Luiza; Perroud, Mauricio W; Castiñeiras, Terezinha M P P; Lazari, Carolina S",Science,,482

Early recognition of prognostic markers and appropriate management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remains a major global health concern, particularly when resources are limited. We undertook a study to see if basic tests can inform frontline clinicians of disease trajectory in individual patients with COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively assessed characteristics of the first 50 consecutive patients admitted to district general hospital in the United Kingdom with positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA swabs. Results: Our patient cohort shared broad similarities with previously published data on comorbidities and presenting features. We have found that chest radiographic assessment differed between survivors and non-survivors. Air space shadowing in middle zones were more prevalent in non-survivors (73.3% vs. 35.5% [p = 0.027]). Chest radiograph severity score was also found to be higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (3 vs. 1.5 [p = 0.007]). Conclusions: In this small retrospective study, our results suggest features of chest radiographs at presentation may provide a helpful tool for prognostication. In environments with constrained computed tomography (CT) imaging with serial chest radiographs could be a cost-effective tool in the assessment of Covid-19 patients.","Berrill, Max; Karaj, Jola; Zamfir, Georgiana; Colman, Jordan; Mason, Rachel; Akbar, Saeed; Sharma, Shashank; Sheehan, Frances; Dhamija, Kanchan; Saltissi, Felicity; Baltabaeva, Aigul; Saikia, Sujoy",Expert Rev Respir Med,,482

This study examined associations between PA, stress and stress management strategies during SIP. DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants (N = 990) from a cohort of Northern California adults completed surveys during early SIP (3/23/20-4/2/20) and mid-SIP (4/24/20-5/8/20). Participants self-reported past-month PA (meeting vs. not meeting guidelines), changes in stress (decreased/unchanged vs. increased) and use (yes/no) of 10 stress management strategies. We tested differences in mid-SIP stress and stress management strategies by PA, and differences in mid-SIP stress by stress management strategies. RESULTS: Compared to participants inactive at mid-SIP, active participants reported less stress (AOR = 0.60 [0.45, 0.81]). Active participants were more likely to manage stress using outdoor PA, indoor PA, yoga/meditation/prayer, gardening, and reading (AORs > 1.42), and less likely to sleep (AOR = 0.65 [0.48, 0.89]) or eat ([AOR = 0.48 [0.35, 0.66]) more. Managing stress using outdoor PA, indoor PA or reading was associated with lower stress; managing stress using TV/movies, sleeping or eating was associated with increased stress (ps < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Meeting PA guidelines during SIP was associated with less stress. Inactive participants reported greater sleeping and eating to cope; active participants used active stress management strategies. Engagement in physically active stress management was associated with lower stress.","Vogel, Erin A; Zhang, Janice S; Peng, Katy; Heaney, Catherine A; Lu, Ying; Lounsbury, David; Hsing, Ann W; Prochaska, Judith J",Psychol Health,,482

Methods: Sixty-six patients with dry eye disease (DED) and 62 healthy subjects (group 2) using FM were enrolled. Groups were divided into: groups 1A and 2A: < 3 hours of FM wear; groups 1B and 2B: 3 to 6 hours; and groups 1C and 2C: > 6 hours. Patients underwent DEQS questionnaire, break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test I (STI), fluorescein and lissamine staining (FS and LS), IVCM to determine corneal dendritic cell density (DCD) and goblet cell density (GCD), and IC to measure HLA-DR, at baseline and after 3 months. Results: FM use duration before enrollment was 27 ± 2.3 and 30 ± 4.1 (days ± SD) for groups 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). After 3 months, DEQS worsened in groups 1B and 1C, STI in groups 1A to 1C, FS and LS in group 1C (P < 0.05); in controls, BUT and FS worsened only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DCD significantly increased in groups 1A to 1C and HLA-DR in groups 1B and 1C (P < 0.05), whereas GCD did not significantly change. DCD and HLA-DR increased only in group 2C (P < 0.05). DEQS significantly correlated with DCD (P = 0.05, r = 0.698; P < 0.001, r = 0.832) and HLA-DR (P = 0.043, r = -0.687; P < 0.001, r = 0.861) at baseline and 3 months. Conclusions: Use of FM increases ocular surface inflammation and negatively impacts the quality of life in patients with DED. Translational Relevance: The study of the prolonged use of FM effects may be relevant to managing DED.","Mastropasqua, Leonardo; Lanzini, Manuela; Brescia, Lorenza; D039,; Aloisio, Rossella; Nubile, Mario; Ciancaglini, Marco; Amario, Claudio; Agnifili, Luca; Mastropasqua, Rodolfo",Transl Vis Sci Technol,,482
322494,COVID-19 Fatality: Statistical Evidence to Engender the Need for Focal Shift from Air Pollutants to Multi-dimensional Intervention,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perceptions and behaviors of rheumatologists in the United States (US) regarding the risk of COVID-19 for their autoimmune patients and the subsequent management of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory medications. METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists in the US from 4/8/20-5/4/20 via social media and group emails. Survey respondents provided demographic information such as, age, gender, state of practice, and practice type. We asked questions about COVID-19 risk in rheumatic patients, as well as their medication management during the pandemic. We conducted descriptive analysis and Multivariable regression models. RESULTS: 271 respondents completed the survey nationally. 48% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ""Patients with rheumatic diseases are at a higher risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their immunosuppressive medications"". 50% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement ""The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of biologics"", while 56% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ""The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of steroids"". A third of respondents indicated that at least 10% of their patients had self-discontinued or reduced at least one immunosuppressive medication to mitigate their risk of COVID-19. Responses to these questions as well as to questions regarding NSAID prescription patterns were significantly different in the Northeast region of US compared to other regions. CONCLUSION: In this national sample of rheumatologists, there are variations regarding perceptions of patients' risk of COVID-19, and how to manage medications such as NSAIDs, biologics and steroids during the pandemic. These variations are more pronounced in geographical areas where COVID-19 disease burden was high.","Mehta, Bella; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Mancuso, Carol A; Bass, Anne R; Moezinia, Carine J; Gibofsky, Allan; Goodman, Susan M; Ibrahim, Said",Semin Arthritis Rheum,,482

323163,"Savings of Small Farms: Their Magnitude, Determinants and Role in Sustainable Development. Example of Poland",2020,"BACKGROUND: Social media is one of the most rapid and impactful ways of obtaining and delivering information in the modern era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rapidly obtain information on public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 in order to identify deficiencies in key areas of public education. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. ""Fever or chills"" (n=4973, 87.6%) and ""shortness of breath"" (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (<35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures. However, key knowledge deficiencies exist with regards to vaccination against COVID-19, which future efforts should aim at correcting.","Ali, Khawla F; Whitebridge, Simon; Jamal, Mohammad H; Alsafy, Mohammad; Atkin, Stephen L",J Med Internet Res,,482

333845,Videoconference Hearings after the times of Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Given the context of rapid technological change and COIVD-19 pandemics, E-learning may provide a unique opportunity for addressing the challenges in traditional face-to-face continuing medical education (CME). However, the effectiveness of E-learning in CME interventions remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether E-learning training program can improve TB health personnel's knowledge and behaviour in China. METHODS: This study used a convergent mixed method research design to evaluate the impact of E-learning programs for tuberculosis (TB) health workers in terms of knowledge improvement and behaviour change during the China-Gates TB Project (add the time span). Quantitative data was collected by staff surveys (baseline n = 555; final n = 757) and management information systems to measure the demographic characteristics, training participation, and TB knowledge. Difference-in-difference (DID) and multiple linear regression models were employed to capture the effectiveness of knowledge improvement. Qualitative data was collected by interviews (n = 30) and focus group discussions (n = 44) with managers, teachers, and learners to explore their learning experience. RESULTS: Synchronous E-learning improved the knowledge of TB clinicians (average treatment effect, ATE: 7.3 scores/100, P = 0.026). Asynchronous E-learning has a significant impact on knowledge among primary care workers (ATE: 10.9/100, P < 0.001), but not in clinicians or public health physicians. Traditional face-to-face training has no significant impact on all medical staff. Most of the learners (57.3%) agreed that they could apply what they learned to their practice. Qualitative data revealed that high quality content is the key facilitator of the behaviour change, while of learning content difficulty, relevancy, and hardware constraints are key barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of E-learning in CME varies across different types of training formats, organizational environment, and target audience. Although clinicians and primary care workers improved their knowledge by E-learning activities, public health physicians didn't benefit from the interventions.","Wang, Zi-Yue; Zhang, Li-Jie; Liu, Yu-Hong; Jiang, Wei-Xi; Jia, Jing-Yun; Tang, Sheng-Lan; Liu, Xiao-Yun",Infect Dis Poverty,,482

Likewise, other viruses of the Coronaviridae family were responsible for causing epidemics earlier. To tackle these viruses, there is a lack of approved antiviral drugs. Therefore, we have developed robust computational methods to predict the repurposed drugs using machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Deep Learning. We used the experimentally validated drugs/chemicals with anti-corona activity and their inhibition efficiencies (IC50/EC50) from 'DrugRepV' repository. The unique entries of SARS-CoV-2 (142), SARS (221), MERS (123), and overall Coronaviruses (414) were subdivided into the training/testing and independent validation datasets, followed by the extraction of chemical/structural descriptors and fingerprints (17968). The highly relevant features were filtered using the recursive feature selection algorithm. The selected chemical descriptors were used to develop prediction models with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.60-0.90 on training/testing. The robustness of the predictive models was further ensured using external independent validation datasets, decoy datasets, applicability domain, and chemical analyses. The developed models were used to predict promising repurposed drug candidates against coronaviruses after scanning the DrugBank. Top predicted molecules for SARS-CoV-2 were further validated by molecular docking against the spike protein complex with ACE receptor. We found potential repurposed drugs namely, Verteporfin, Alatrofloxacin, Metergoline, Rescinnamine, Leuprolide, and Telotristat ethyl with high binding affinity. These computational methods would assist in antiviral drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses.","Rajput, Akanksha; Thakur, Anamika; Mukhopadhyay, Adhip; Kamboj, Sakshi; Rastogi, Amber; Gautam, Sakshi; Jassal, Harvinder; Kumar, Manoj",,,482

Seventy-four residents and 53 members of staff were included in the present study. The staff underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2, and both the staff and residents underwent serological tests to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The results of all of the tests were negative. Conversely, 94% of residents and 38% members of the staff were tested positive to the nasopharyngeal swab tests during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave (data collected from November 1 to November 30, 2020). Our experience suggests that, in the presence of a life-threatening pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, the prompt use of restrictive procedures can prevent the spread and progression of disease in assisted living facilities in the short term but may fail in the long term, especially when the prevalence of the COVID-19 greatly increased outside the facility enhancing the risk of import the disease from outside. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of residents and staff members would contribute to control/limit the prevalence and the spread of the virus.","Tagliabue, Mario Lisa Ridolfo Anna Pina Paolo Rizzolo Giuseppe Belbusti Sonia Antinori Spinello Beltrami Martina Cattaneo Dario Gervasoni Cristina",Preventive Medicine Reports,,482
334569,Bullshit in a network structure: the two-sided influence of self-generated signals,2020,"We have previously hypothesized that pentoxifylline could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 given its potential to restore the immune response equilibrium, reduce the impact of the disease on the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, and improve the circulatory function.Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count are accessible biomarkers that correlate with the severity of COVID-19, the need for hospitalization, and mortality, reflecting the host immune response's contribution to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.","Maldonado, Valente; Hernandez-Ramírez, Claudia; Oliva-Pérez, Eniel Alonso; Sánchez-Martínez, César Omar; Pimentel-González, Jorge Fabián; Molina-Sánchez, José Raúl; Jiménez-Villalba, Yeimmy Zuyenn; Chávez-Alderete, Jaime; Loza-Mejía, Marco A",Int Immunopharmacol,,482

To address this need, we developed the SCENTinel 1.0 test, which rapidly evaluates three olfactory functions: detection, intensity, and identification. We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox ® Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N=111, 47±13yo, F=71%) and normosmic individuals (N=154, 47±14yo, F=74%), as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N=42, 55±10yo, F=67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria, compared to only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders. Overall performance on SCENTinel 1.0 predicted belonging to the normosmic group better than identification or detection alone (vs anosmic: AUC=0.95,specificity=0.94). Odor intensity provided the best single-feature predictor to classify normosmic individuals. Among normosmic individuals, 92% met the accuracy criteria at both SCENTinel 1.0 and the NIH Toolbox ® Odor Identification Test. SCENTinel 1.0 is a practical test able to discriminate individuals with smell loss and will likely be useful in many clinical situations, including COVID-19 symptom screening.","Parma, Valentina; Hannum, Mackenzie E; O039,; Leary, Maureen; Pellegrino, Robert; Rawson, Nancy E; Reed, Danielle R; Dalton, Pamela H",Chem. senses,,482

338158,"Investing in the Sustainable Development Goals: Mobilization, channeling, and impact",2021,"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is being increasingly recognized as needing vital emphasis at a national level. To enhance learning in Science and Mathematics, the repertoire of vocabularies plays a significant role. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues its spread across the world, people's vocabulary learning has been limited. Responding to this situation with appropriate awareness, e-learning is being applied to teach the English language. The intent of this study is to utilize Quizizz to enhance the vocabulary achievement among primary English as Second Language (ESL) pupils in rural schools. The study's research employed mixed methods with purposive sampling of 13 participants. The research site was a rural school located 60km from the nearest town. The data were collected both pre and post-test as designed by the researcher and Likert scale questionnaire. The data was analyzed using appropriate quantitative analysis. To shed more light on the implementation, a thematic analysis by use of a semi-structured interview was conducted. The study finds that 10 out of 13 participants have shown an increase in their post-test of filling in the blank scoring test. The data is strengthened by a moderately high mean score of a Likert scale questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants highlighted that the Quizizz's leaderboard matched their favored learning style. In this way, this feature tends to evoke a positive learning atmosphere. Thus, it can be concluded that Quizizz could enhance vocabulary achievement among primary English as Secondary Language (ESL) pupils in rural schools.","Huei, Law Szee Yunus Melor Md Hashim Harwati",Journal of Education and e-Learning Research,,482

OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the gender-specific peak mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation &#8804;90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score &#8804;11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings. RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the well-known independent risk factors (i.e. age, obesity, COPD, and CRP level), low grip strength independently increased (about three times) the severity of COVID-19.","Kara, Özgür; Kara, Murat; Akin, Mustafa Emre; Özçakar, Levent",Heart Lung,,482

There is limited information on the experience of endocrinologists in managing patients with thyroid cancer virtually. We sent a 9-item questionnaire to endocrinologists and endocrine surgeons at our institution to better understand the barriers and benefits of caring for patients with thyroid cancer via telemedicine, as well as how we can incorporate telemedicine into our future care of patients with this malignancy. Among the 9 physicians who responded, the majority listed technological issues with the virtual platform as a challenge in caring for patients with thyroid cancer remotely. Additional barriers included difficulty in expressing empathy, decreased ability to coordinate care with the interdisciplinary team, and lack of the physical examination. Benefits included compliance with social distancing measures and convenience for patients with American Thyroid Association (ATA) low-risk thyroid cancer who presented for follow-up visits. Overall, physicians were satisfied or strongly satisfied with caring for patients with thyroid cancer remotely, especially low-risk patients on long-term follow-up. That said, they recommend that some patients be seen in person after the pandemic, including symptomatic patients and ATA high-risk patients. While the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed endocrinologists to manage patients with thyroid cancer remotely, the providers have faced challenges, some of which can be improved upon. Further studies will help determine how telemedicine affects patient outcomes, including satisfaction, disease progression, and survival, which will inform how we may incorporate this practice into our future care of patients with thyroid cancer.","Chablani, S.

This scenario in a way increased the rubber solid waste disposal problem; therefore, the production of biodegradable gloves may be an option to overcome this problem. However, the need to study the shelf life of biodegradable gloves is crucial before commercialization. There are well-established models to address the failure properties of gloves as stated in the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) D7160. In this study, polysaccharide-based material-filled natural rubber latex (PFNRL) gloves, which are biodegradable gloves, were subjected to an accelerated aging process at different temperatures of 50-80 °C for 1-120 days. Prediction models based on Arrhenius and shift factors were used to estimate the shelf life of the PFNRL gloves. Based on the results obtained, the estimated time for the PFNRL gloves to retain 75% of their tensile strength at shelf temperature (30 °C) based on Arrhenius and shift factor models was 2.8 years. Verification on the activation energy based on the shift factor model indicated that the shelf life of PFNRL gloves is 2.9 years, which is only a 3.6% difference. The value obtained is aligned with the requirement in accordance with ASTM D7160, which states that only up to a maximum of 3 years' shelf life is allowed for the gloves under accelerated aging conditions.","Ab Rahman, Mohd Fikri; Rusli, Arjulizan; Misman, Muhammad Afiq; Rashid, Azura A",ACS Omega,,482

It is unknown whether peripheral immunity is related to cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and the cognitive status in ALS patients. METHODS: Among 81 ALS patients, we compared the demographic, clinical, and peripheral levels of total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, CD8+ T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and NK cell between those with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci) and those without (ALS-nci). The cognitive status was evaluated via the Chinese version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral screen (ECAS). Significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis were further examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 39.5% of all ALS patients had cognitive impairment. The ALS-ci group had shorter education time, older age at both symptom onset and testing, longer disease duration, and lower levels of peripheral total, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte than the ALS-nci group. Frequency of behavioral impairment did not differ between the two groups. While parameters with significant differences identified by group comparison were also significant predictors of cognitive impairment in univariate logistic regression analysis except the level of B lymphocyte, only older age at testing, education time less than 9 years, and lower level of CD4+ T lymphocyte remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive model combining these three parameters had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.842 with a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 67.3%. CONCLUSION: In Chinese ALS patients, blood CD4+ T lymphocyte might help evaluate cognitive impairment along with age and education level.","Yang, Yuan; Pan, Dengji; Gong, Zhenxiang; Tang, Jiahui; Li, Zehui; Ding, Fengfei; Liu, Mao; Zhang, Min",BMC Neurol,,482

The infection may result in severe pneumonia with clusters of illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS: Nineteen COVID-19 and 15 other patients with pneumonia (non-COVID-19) in areas outside of Hubei were involved in this study. Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected using throat swabs and/or sputa with/without COVID-2019 by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed cases of COVID-19 or travel to Hubei before illness. The median (IQR) duration was 8 (6-11) and 5 (4-11) days from exposure to onset in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, respectively. The clinical symptoms were similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) COVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) non-COVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 COVID-19 patients (89.47%) but 1 non-COVID-19 patient (6.67%) had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT images. Compared with non-COVID-19, COVID-19 presents remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests, including AST, ALT, Î³-GT, LDH, and &#945;-HBDH. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection has onsets similar to other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening COVID-19 cases.

Therefore, we evaluated whether P ETCO2 /P aCO2 might be relevant in assessing ARDS not associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated the correspondence between P ETCO2 /P aCO2 and the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom P ETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to 4 ranges of P ETCO2 /P aCO2 representing increasing illness severity (&#8805; 0.80, 0.6-0.79, 0.50-0.59, and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson or Spearman tests, grouped comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact tests. Normally distributed data are presented as mean and standard deviation(SD) and non-normal data are presented as median and inter-quartile range (IQR). Overall mortality risk was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS: P ETCO2 /P aCO2 correlated strongly with VD/VT (r = -0.87 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.85], P < .001). Decreasing P ETCO2 /P aCO2 was associated with increased VD/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis, for every 0.01 decrease in P ETCO2 /P aCO2 , mortality risk increased by â¼1% (odds ratio 0.009, 95% CI 0.003-0.029, P < .001) and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.91, P = .039). P ETCO2 /P aCO2 < 0.50 was characterized by very high mean ± SD value for VD/VT (0.82 ± 0.05, P < .001) and high hospital mortality (70%). CONCLUSIONS: Using P ETCO2 /P aCO2 as a surrogate for VD/VT may be a useful and practical measurement for both management and ongoing research into the nature of ARDS.","Kallet, Richard H; Lipnick, Michael S",Respir. care,,482

Published articles (n = 56) related to search criteria from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020, were included. The primary literature articles included in this study were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Results: Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous manifestations have been found in people of all age groups, including children. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a new and serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment-related skin wounds are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for potential COVID-19 infections. Innovation and Conclusion: As this virus continues to spread silently, mainly through asymptomatic carriers, an accurate and rapid identification of these cutaneous manifestations may be vital to early diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This systematic review and photo atlas provide a detailed analysis of the skin pathologies related to COVID-19. Study of these cutaneous manifestations and their pathogenesis, as well their significance in human health will help define COVID-19 in its entirety, which is a prerequisite to its effective management.","Singh, Harjas; Kaur, Harleen; Singh, Kanhaiya; Sen, Chandan K",Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle),,482

344852,The effect of visual design self-efficacy of language teachers on mobile learning attitudes during the pandemic period,2021,"This tutorial shows how to build, fit, and criticize disease transmission models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and other infectious diseases in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate both data and prior knowledge into the model estimates. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent. Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, then with a more elaborate transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced topics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational techniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.","Grinsztajn, L'eo; Semenova, Elizaveta; Margossian, Charles C.; Riou, Julien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02985v3.pdf,482
345313,Online engagement during COVID-19: Role of agency on collaborative learning orientation and learning expectations,2021,"PURPOSE: In this study we investigated on the personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, recycling, and disposal among spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among spine surgeons in Asia Pacific. The questionnaires were focused on the usage, recycling and disposal of PPE. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-two surgeons from 19 countries participated in the survey. When we sub-analysed the differences between countries, the provision of adequate PPE by hospitals ranged from 37.5% to 100%. The usage of PPE was generally high. The most used PPE were surgical face masks (88.7%), followed by surgical caps (88.3%), gowns (85.6%), sterile gloves (83.3%) and face shields (82.0%). The least used PPE were powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) (23.0%) and shoes/boots (45.0%). The commonly used PPE for surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients were N95 masks (74.8%), sterile gloves (73.0%), gowns (72.1%), surgical caps (71.6%), face shields (64.4%), goggles (64.0%), shoe covers (58.6%), plastic aprons (45.9%), shoes/boots (45.9%), surgical face masks (36.5%) and PAPRs (21.2%). Most PPE were not recycled. Biohazard bins were the preferred method of disposal for all types of PPE items compared to general waste. CONCLUSIONS: The usage of PPE was generally high among most countries especially for surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients except for Myanmar and Nepal. Overall, the most used PPE were surgical face masks. For surgeries involving COVID-19 positive patients, the most used PPE were N95 masks. Most PPE were not recycled. Biohazard bins were the preferred method of disposal for all types of PPE.","Chiu, Chee Kidd; Chan, Chris Yin Wei; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Cheung, Prudence Wing Hang; Gani, Siti Mariam Abd; Kwan, Mun Keong",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),,482
345314,Online engagement during COVID‐19: Role of agency on collaborative learning orientation and learning expectations,2021,"The rapidly spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has limited people's outdoor activities and hence caused substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions around the world. However, the air quality in some megacities has not been improved as expected due to the complex responses of aerosol chemistry to the changes in precursors and meteorology. Here we demonstrate the responses of primary and secondary aerosol species to the changes in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China along with the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday effects on air pollution by using six-year aerosol particle composition measurements. Our results showed large reductions in primary aerosol species associated with traffic, cooking and coal combustion emissions by 30-50% on average during the CNY, while the decreases in secondary aerosol species were much small (5-12%). These results point towards a future challenge in mitigating secondary air pollution because the reduced gaseous precursors may not suppress secondary aerosol formation efficiently under stagnant meteorological conditions. By analyzing the long-term measurements from 2012 to 2020, we found considerable increases in the ratios of nitrate to sulfate, secondary to primary OA, and sulfur and nitrogen oxidation capacity despite the overall decreasing trends in mass concentrations of most aerosol species, suggesting that the decreases in anthropogenic emissions have facilitated secondary formation processes during the last decade. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the chemical responses of secondary aerosol to the changes in anthropogenic emissions under complex meteorological environment is essential for future mitigation of air pollution in China.","Sun, Yele; Lei, Lu; Zhou, Wei; Chen, Chun; He, Yao; Sun, Jiaxing; Li, Zhijie; Xu, Weiqi; Wang, Qingqing; Ji, Dongsheng; Fu, Pingqing; Wang, Zifa; Worsnop, Douglas R",Sci Total Environ,,482

346864,Research on Sentiment Analysis Model Due to COVID-19 Using Social Media,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the use of text messages to communicate information to patients whose surgeries were postponed because of the COVID-19 restriction on elective surgeries. Our hypothesis was that text messaging would be an effective way to convey updates. METHODS: In this observational study, 295 patients received text messaging alerts. Eligibility included patients who had their surgery postponed and had a cell phone that received text messages. Engagement rates were determined using embedded smart links. Patient survey responses were collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,032 texts were delivered. Engagement rates averaged 90%. Survey responses (n = 111) demonstrated that 98.2% of patients liked the text messages and 95.5% said that they felt more connected to their care team; 91.9% of patients agreed that the text updates helped them avoid calling the office. Patients with higher pain levels reported more frustration with their surgery delay (5.3 versus 2.8 on 1 to 10 scale, P value < 0.01). More frustrated patients wished they received more text messages (24.4% versus 4.6%, P value = 0.04) and found the content less helpful (8.2 versus 9.2 on 1 to 10 scale, P value = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Text messaging updates are an efficient way to communicate with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Campbell, Kevin J; Blackburn, Brenna E; Erickson, Jill A; Pelt, Christopher E; Anderson, Lucas A; Peters, Christopher L; Gililland, Jeremy M",,,482

A comparison of this predicted epitope MHC-coverage revealed for the early phase of infection spread (till day 15 after reaching 128 observed infection cases) highly significant negative correlations with the case fatality rate. Specifically, this was observed in different populations for MHC class II presentation of the viral spike protein (p-value: 0.0733 for linear regression), the envelope protein (p-value: 0.023), and the membrane protein (p-value: 0.00053), indicating that the high case fatality rates of COVID-19 observed in some countries seem to be related with poor MHC class II presentation and hence weak adaptive immune response against these viral envelope proteins. Our results highlight the general importance of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in immunological control in early infection spread looking at a global census in various countries and taking case fatality rate into account. Other factors such as health system and control measures become more important after the early spread. Our study should encourage further studies on MHCII alleles as potential risk factors in COVID-19 including assessment of local populations and specific allele distributions.","Liang, Chunguang; Bencurova, Elena; Psota, Eric; Neurgaonkar, Priya; Prelog, Martina; Scheller, Carsten; Dandekar, Thomas",Int. j. mol. sci.

Vitamin D (in its ""parent"" form, cholecalciferol) has been proposed in the pharmacological management of COVID-19 by various sources. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (ORadj 0.13, 95% CI 0.05-0.35, p < 0.001). This finding was replicated in a validation cohort of 541 patients (ORadj 0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.84, p = 0.018). In this observational study, treatment with cholecalciferol booster therapy, regardless of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, appears to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in acute in-patients admitted with COVID-19. Further work with large population studies needs to be carried out to determine adequate serum 25(OH)D levels, as well as multi-dose clinical trials of cholecalciferol therapy to assess maximum efficacy.","Ling, Stephanie F; Broad, Eleanor; Murphy, Rebecca; Pappachan, Joseph M; Pardesi-Newton, Satveer; Kong, Marie-France; Jude, Edward B",Nutrients,,482

353282,People’s Perceptions of AI Utilization in the Context of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Thymomas are the most common type of anterior mediastinal tumors. Calcification is sometimes observed in thymomas using computed tomography (CT), and it is more frequent in invasive thymomas than in noninvasive thymomas. However, the significance of calcification in thymomas remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of calcification in thymomas on invasiveness to surrounding organs and investigate the characteristics of thymoma cases with calcification at our institution. METHODS: We included thymoma patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2016, and evaluated their characteristics, including demographics, calcification on CT, histology, Masaoka stage, and myasthenia gravis status. The patients were categorized into calcification (C) and noncalcification (NC) groups. RESULTS: Among 51 included patients, 11 (21.6%) had calcification. A higher proportion of group C patients had World Health Organization histological type B2 and B3 tumors (high-risk) than type A, AB, and B1 tumors (low-risk; p = 0.0477). The number of patients with Masaoka stages III and IV were significantly higher in the C group than in the NC group (p < 0.0001). The C group patients had significantly higher rates of invasion to the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, lung, phrenic nerve, and chest wall and pleural dissemination than the NC group patients. CONCLUSIONS: Calcification reflects invasiveness of tumors to surrounding organs and tissues, and may thus predict thymoma stage and histologically high-risk thymomas. Calcification in thymomas may also predict the pathological stage and help decide therapeutic methods and surgical approaches to treat thymomas based on the calcification status according to CT findings.","Yoshida, Mitsuteru; Kondo, Kazuya; Miyamoto, Naoki; Kawakami, Yukikiyo; Tangoku, Akira",Thorac cancer (Online),,482

A factor analysis approach,2021,"The increasing life expectancy of humans has led to an increase in the number of patients with chronic diseases and organ failure. However, the imbalance between the supply and the demand for human organs is a serious problem in modern transplantology. One of many solutions to overcome this problem is the use of xenotransplantation. The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica) is currently considered as the most suitable for human organ procurement. However, there are discrepancies between pigs and humans that lead to the creation of immunological barriers preventing the direct xenograft. The introduction of appropriate modifications to the pig genome to prevent xenograft rejection is crucial in xenotransplantation studies. In this study, porcine GGTA1, CMAH, ß4GalNT2, vWF, ASGR1 genes were selected to introduce genetic modifications. The evaluation of three selected gRNAs within each gene was obtained, which enabled the selection of the best site for efficient introduction of changes. Modifications were examined after nucleofection of porcine primary kidney fibroblasts with CRISPR/Cas9 system genetic constructs, followed by the tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis. In addition, off-target analysis was carried out for selected best gRNAs using the TIDE tool, which is new in the research conducted so far and shows the utility of this tool in these studies.","Ryczek, Natalia; Hryhorowicz, Magdalena; Lipinski, Daniel; Zeyland, Joanna; Slomski, Ryszard",,,482

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old healthy Caucasian male anesthetist who had treated COVID-19 patients during the previous 5 weeks and suddenly presented with a temporal relative scotoma in his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the left eye, and no discromatopsy or afferent pupillary defect was present. Visual field test was performed, with no significant findings associated with the focal loss of sensitivity described by the patient. The anterior segment was unremarkable on slit lamp examination in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed no significant findings. A placoid, hyperreflective band at the level of the GCL and IPL was visible in OCT which spared the outer retina, at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later. An oropharyngeal swab test was performed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination.

Public perceptions toward such interventions should be identified to enable public health authorities to effectively address valid concerns. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to characterize user-generated content from social media during previous outbreaks, with the aim of understanding the health behaviors of the public. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning-based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. We intend to test the model with a real-world case study. METHODS: The data set for this study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in response to the COVID-19-related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network models were trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study. RESULTS: The HBM text classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively.

356560,Coronavirus impacts on post-pandemic planned travel behaviours,2021,"There is an urgent need for an accurate antibody test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance along with four commercial ELISAs, EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the probable causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were evaluated using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of false positive results from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, assays lacked reproducibility. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with the same antigen that was used for coating ELISAs prior to performing the assay), suggesting positive reaction could be attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by the spiking, suggesting positive reaction was not attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of ""false positivity"" in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the corresponding antigen, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","Rikhtegaran Tehrani, Zahra; Saadat, Saman; Saleh, Ebtehal; Ouyang, Xin; Constantine, Niel; DeVico, Anthony L; Harris, Anthony D; Lewis, George K; Kottilil, Shyam; Sajadi, Mohammad M",PLoS One,,482
357181,Belgium - concerns about coronavirus contact-tracing apps,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat to human health and economy that requires urgent prevention and monitoring strategies. Several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them, with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters. However, the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries. Nevertheless, a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries, which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions. In this paper, infection rate of COVID-19 is modelled globally at a 0.5 ∘resolution, using a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate. The model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical (surface air temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and human-related characteristics (CO 2and population density). It was trained by facilitating data from Italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from World countries’ reports. Based on this model, a risk index was calculated to identify the potential World countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment. The distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real-world disease outbreaks have occurred, e.g. the Hubei province in China, and reports a high risk of disease increment in most World countries which have reported significant outbreaks (e.g. Western U.S.A.). Overall, the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of COVID-19 among human populations, particularly in Europe. The model and the data were distributed through Open-science Web services to maximise opportunities for re-usability regarding new data and new diseases, and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results.","Coro, Gianpaolo",Ecol.

361216,The future of food after COVID-19 through the lens of anthropology,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders overlap with co-morbidities associated with poor outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other sleep disorders remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of pre-existing sleep disorders and association with outcomes related to severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included. Electronic medical records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes. Data was extracted from polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing at our center. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors, and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge. RESULTS: Among N=572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 113 (19.8%) patients had OSA, 4 patients had central sleep apnea (CSA) (0.7%), 5 had hypoventilation (0.9%), 63 had insomnia (11.0%), and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements disorder (RLS/PLMD) (3.9%). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep disordered breathing severity and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to determine the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders in a well-characterized cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Once hospitalized, a significant contribution of sleep disorders to outcomes was not identified. Therefore, future evaluations should focus on earlier outcomes, such as infection or clinical manifestations after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Goldstein, Cathy A; Rizvydeen, Muneer; Conroy, Deirdre A; O039,; Brien, Louise M; Gupta, Gita; Somers, Emily C; Sharma, Pratima; Golob, Jonathan L; Troost, Jonathan P; Burgess, Helen J",J. clin. sleep med,,482

361244,Encouraging engagement: video-conference augmentation of online distance learning environments,2020,"The music domain is among the most important ones for adopting recommender systems technology. In contrast to most other recommendation domains, which predominantly rely on collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, music recommenders have traditionally embraced content-based (CB) approaches. In the past years, music recommendation models that leverage collaborative and content data -- which we refer to as content-driven models -- have been replacing pure CF or CB models. In this survey, we review 47 articles on content-driven music recommendation. Based on a thorough literature analysis, we first propose an onion model comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of music content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated content, user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion: increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music, improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article addressing one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the content layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation strategies. Finally, we provide our personal selection of the persisting grand challenges, which are still waiting to be solved in future research endeavors.","Deldjoo, Yashar; Schedl, Markus; Knees, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11803v1.pdf,482
361920,The effect of teleconference class on the environmental knowledge in higher education,2021,"The emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is placing an increasing burden on the healthcare systems. Although the majority of infected patients have non-severe symptoms and can be managed at home, some individuals may develop severe disease and are demanding the hospital admission. Therefore, it becomes paramount to efficiently assess the severity of COVID-19 and identify hospitalization priority with precision. In this respect, a 4-variable assessment model, including lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil, is established and validated using the XGBoost algorithm. This model is found effective to identify severe COVID-19 cases on admission, with a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 84.6%, and an accuracy of 100% to predict the disease progression toward rapid deterioration. It also suggests that a computation-derived formula of clinical measures is practically applicable for the healthcare administrators to distribute hospitalization resources to the most needed in epidemics and pandemics.","Zheng, Yichao; Zhu, Yinheng; Ji, Mengqi; Wang, Rongpin; Liu, Xinfeng; Zhang, Mudan; Qin, Choo Hui; Fang, Lu; Ma, Shaohua",Patterns (N Y),,482

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pulmonary function test parameters and laboratory parameters in COVID-19. METHOD: A total of 60 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests and laboratory parameters at admission and on day 7 of treatment were analysed. RESULTS: On day 7 of treatment, white blood cell count, CRP, and fibrinogen level were significantly lower than at admission (P = .002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively), while forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values were significantly higher compared with admitting values (P = .001 for both). Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in CRP from admission to day 7 of treatment correlated with the increase in FEV1 (r = 0.616, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.51, P = .01) during the same period. A decrease in the fibrinogen level was also correlated with an increase in FEV1 (r = 0.345, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.357, P = .01). CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen and CRP levels are easily accessible parameters that may help identify improvement or deterioration in pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients during follow-up and discharge while reducing the risk of transmission.","Kerget, Bugra; Aksakal, Alperen; Kerget, Ferhan",Int J Clin Pract,,482

In line with the ""Virtual First"" approach employed by Geisinger's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, we describe how we transitioned to TBH services while facilitating communication and collaboration among PCBH providers, staff, and trainees, and supported our Geisinger colleagues during the initial months of the pandemic. We report outcomes of our Virtual First approach from March 2020 through June 2020, as well as provider surveys of acceptability and usability of the InTouch platform used for TBH. We found that we were able to attain or surpass comparable patient access and utilization by implementing TBH services compared with in-person services over the last 2 years while maintaining a training program. InTouch was found to be acceptable and usable overall based on provider ratings, although it does not include capabilities that would further enhance access such as group treatments or shared office visits with the BHP and primary care clinician. Our Virtual First approach enabled us to maintain access and utilization of PCBH services during a time of widespread uncertainty and behavioral health vulnerability in rural regions.

The purpose of this study was to determine overlapping pathways between iPD vs. Controls and those associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed on gene expression data from tissues donated by idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients (iPD). These included dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV), substantia nigra (SN), whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (PBMC). Enriched pathways detected by GSEA results were subsequently compared to (a) those retrieved by two independently constructed SARS-CoV-2 - host interactomes, as well as (b) previously published pathway data. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Analysis of iPD data revealed multiple immune response and viral parasitism -related pathways (FDR < 0.05). Head-to-head comparisons as well as confirmatory analyses revealed several pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms overlapping between iPD tissues and SARS-CoV-2 induced transcriptomic changes: ""Parkinson's Disease"" and ""Huntington's Disease"" (overlapping in DMNV, ION, SN, and WB; FDR < 0.05), ""NAFLD"" (overlapping in DMNV, SN, PBMC and WB; FDR < 0.05), mRNA surveillance and proteostasis pathways (All datasets; FDR < 0.5), among others.

365458,Reduction of influenza and enterovirus infection in taiwan during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the process for linking electronic medical record (EMR) and administrative data in Alberta and examine the advantages and limitations of utilising linked data for hypertension surveillance. METHODS: De-identified EMR data from 323 primary care providers contributing to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in Alberta were used. Mapping files from each contributing provider were generated from their EMR to facilitate linkage to administrative data within the provincial health data warehouse. Deterministic linkage was conducted using valid personal healthcare number (PHN) with age and/or sex. Characteristics of patients and providers in the linked cohort were compared with population-level sources. Criteria used to define hypertension in both sources were examined. RESULTS: Data were successfully linked for 6307 hypertensive patients (96.2% of eligible patients) from 49 contributing providers. Non-linkages from invalid PHN (n=246) occurred more for deceased patients and those with fewer primary care encounters, with differences due to type of EMR and patient EMR status. The linked cohort had more patients who were female, >60 years and residing in rural areas compared to the provincial healthcare registry. Family physicians were more often female and medically trained in Canada compared to all physicians in Alberta. Most patients (>97%) had &#8805;1 record in the registry, pharmacy, emergency/ambulatory care and claims databases; 44.3% had &#8805;1 record in the hospital discharge database. CONCLUSION: EMR-administrative data linkage has the potential to enhance hypertension surveillance. The current linkage process in Alberta is limited and subject to selection bias. Processes to address these deficiencies are under way.","Garies, Stephanie; Youngson, Erik; Soos, Boglarka; Forst, Brian; Duerksen, Kimberley; Manca, Donna; McBrien, Kerry; Drummond, Neil; Quan, Hude; Williamson, Tyler",,,482
365527,Designing PISA-like mathematics problem in covid-19 pandemic (PISAComat),2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is having major implications for stroke care with a documented significant fall in hospital acute stroke admissions. We investigated whether COVID-19 has resulted in a decreased number of referrals to the transient ischaemic attack (TIA) clinics across the North West London region. SETTING AND DESIGN: All the TIA clinical leads of the North West London region received an invitation by email to participate in an online survey in May 2020. The survey questionnaire aimed to assess the number of patients with suspected TIA consecutively referred to each of the TIA clinics of the North West London region between 1 March and 30 April 2020, the COVID-19 period, and between 1 March and 30 April 2019. RESULTS: We had a response rate of 100%. During the COVID-19 period, the TIA clinics of the North West London region received 440 referrals compared with 616 referrals received between 1 March and 30 April 2019 with a fall in the number of the referrals by 28.6%. In April 2020 compared with April 2019, the number of the referrals declined by 40.1%. CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre analysis documented a significant reduction in the number of patients referred with suspected TIA to the specialised rapid access outpatient clinics in the North West London region during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings and to better characterise the incidence of cerebrovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","D039,; Anna, Lucio; Sheikh, Ambreen; Bathula, Raj; Elmamoun, Salwa; Oppong, Adelaide; Singh, Ravneeta; Redwood, Rebecca; Janssen, John; Banerjee, Soma; Vasileiadis, Evangelos",BMJ Open,,482

This study examines the relationship between the incidence of the pandemic during the first wave in 16 Eurozone countries with the variation experienced in food prices. We analysed the harmonised index of consumer food prices (included in HICP) and the classification of the degree of pandemic impact by country, the latter established with the index of deaths provided by the Johns Hopkins Center. The procedure used compared actual food prices during the first wave (March to June 2020) with those foreseeable in the absence of the pandemic. Time series analysis was used, dividing the research period into two phases. In both phases, the Holt–Winters model was applied for estimation and subsequent prediction. After a contrast using Kendall’s tau correlation index, it was concluded that in the countries with the highest death rates during the first wave, there was a higher increase in food prices than in the least affected countries of the Eurozone.","Gutiérrez-Villar, Belén Melero-Bolaños Rosa Carbonero-Ruz Mariano",Foods,,482

It is a wishful thinking that such history should not be repeated as long as the sun and moon shall endure. In view of an aforesaid conundrum, here we present a rationale for withering away a plausible Antibiotic-Resistant Bacterial Pathogen (ARBP) elicited pandemic. Herd immunity is defined as when ~70% to 90% of a population is immune to an infectious disease providing indirect protection to those who are immunocompetent (herd protection) and to those who are not immune to that specific pandemic event(disease(s)). R0 is an estimate of contagiousness which is derived from human behavior and biological characteristics of pathogens and time. However, it is not a measure of the severity of an infectious disease or dissemination of a pathogen's spread through a population. R0 value(s) for the same disease from the past endemic or epidemic or pandemic events is not valid for a current event(s) as aforesaid metrics are subject to time, location, population metrics and genotype/phenotype of the pathogen(s), modes of transmission, and sessional variations. Also, the etiologic the potential of the infectious agent(s) being passed from infected patient to other uninfected and/or infected human/animal host (contagiousness, the transmissibility of pathogens) (PMID: 30560777). An outbreak of infectious disease is expected to prevail if R0 is &gt;1 and ebb if R0 is&lt;1 (J Math Biol. 1990;28:365). The primary factors that define R0 value are: a. the time duration of contagiousness (transmissibility of the diseases by direct or indirect contact with an infected person) after an individual is infected, b. the likelihood of infection per contact between a susceptible person and c. the rate of contact (number of times of an infectious person or vector (a live organism(s) or inanimate object as a tool to transfer the pathogen) with another person (St. Meth. Med Res. 1993;2:23). Other contributing factors for determining the R0 values could be, the etiologic agent, host, environmental factors (temperature, drought, long winters, adverse weather patterns such as a hurricane), public health resources(availability toilets vs open defecation, portable water vs water reservoirs, water wells, slums, open drainage, lack of sewage treatment plant, lack of water processing facility for potable water supply, heavy metals, arsenic, fluoride contamination in water supply, the policy environment (absence decision-making authorities / absence of civic bodies-elected) the contact rate, including population density, social organization (e.g., integrated vs. segregated), seasonality, human social behavior, organizational behavior(s), and innate genetic 10:928).

369196,Understanding Twitter Telehealth Communication during the COVID-19 Pandemic using Hetero-Functional Graph Theory,2020,"COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counseling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatraemia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of the postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU, from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.","Christ-Crain, Mirjam; Hoorn, Ewout J; Sherlock, Mark; Thompson, Chris J; Wass, John A H",Eur J Endocrinol,,482
369698,A practical tool to enhance the chances of success of digital agriculture interventions for sustainable development in Africa and India,2021,"Respiratory diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, with highly varied vulnerability to disease between individuals. The underlying reasons of disease susceptibility are unknown, but often include a variable immune response in lungs. Recently, we identified a surprising novel role of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R), a primarily lymphoid-associated regulator, in fetal-specified, lung-resident macrophage development. Here, we report that traditional, hematopoietic stem cell-derived myeloid cells in the adult lung, peripheral blood, and bone marrow also depend on IL7R expression. Using single and double germline knockout models, we found that eosinophil numbers were reduced upon deletion of IL7R&#945;. We then employed two Cre recombinase models in lineage tracing experiments to test whether these cells developed through an IL7R&#945;+ pathway. Despite the impact of IL7R&#945; deletion, IL7R-Cre labeled only a minimal fraction of eosinophils. We therefore examined the intrinsic versus extrinsic requirement for IL7R in the production of eosinophils using reciprocal hematopoietic stem cell transplantation assays. These assays revealed that extrinsic, but not eosinophil-intrinsic, IL7R is required for eosinophil reconstitution by HSCs in the adult lung. To determine which external factors may be influencing eosinophil development and survival, we performed a cytokine array analysis between wild-type and IL7R&#945;-deficient mice and found several differentially regulated proteins. These findings expand upon our previous publication that IL7R is required not only for proper lymphoid cell development and homeostasis, but also for myeloid cell homeostasis in tissues.","Cool, Taylor; Worthington, Atesh; Poscablo, Donna; Hussaini, Adeel; Forsberg, E Camilla",Exp. hematol,,482

369904,E-commerce in Trade Companies during the Conditions of a Pandemic Crisis – Case Studies,2021,"The novel coronavirus, generally known as COVID-19, is a new type of coronavirus which first appeared in Wuhan Province of China in December 2019. The biggest impact of this new coronavirus is its very high contagious feature which brings the life to a halt. As soon as data about the nature of this dangerous virus are collected, the research on the diagnosis of COVID-19 has started to gain a lot of momentum. Today, the gold standard for COVID-19 disease diagnosis is typically based on swabs from the nose and throat, which is time-consuming and prone to manual errors. The sensitivity of these tests are not high enough for early detection. These disadvantages show how essential it is to perform a fully automated framework for COVID-19 disease diagnosis based on deep learning methods using widely available X-ray protocols. In this paper, a novel, powerful and robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed and proposed for the detection of COVID-19 disease using publicly available datasets. This model is used to decide whether a given chest X-ray image of a patient has COVID-19 or not with an accuracy of 99.20%. Experimental results on clinical datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is believed that study proposed in this research paper can be used in practice to help the physicians for diagnosing the COVID-19 disease.","Irmak, E.; Ieee,",2020 Medical Technologies Congress,,482

376101,Digital media to guarantee food security in Colombia during COVID-19,2020,"China has proposed the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) policy to advance the stable development of renewable energy. The RPS requires each province to achieve a stated minimum share of renewable energy power in the total provincial power generation. However, there is an obvious mismatch between the actual capability of generating renewable power and the assigned responsibility for the share of renewable energy power based on the RPS in some provinces. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the renewable power dispatching strategy across provinces for satisfying the RPS requirements in China and to assess the corresponding pressure for each province. A renewable energy power dispatching model is developed, and an economically feasible strategy for dispatching renewable energy power in Chinese provinces in 2020–2022 was obtained. The results indicate that it is necessary to dispatch 395.2 and 140.4 TWh of hydropower and non-hydropower nationwide, respectively, in 2022 to fulfill the RPS target when the COVID-19 is effectively controlled worldwide. If COVID-19 cannot be effectively controlled, 376.6 and 127.8 TWh of hydropower and non-hydropower must be dispatched nationwide to fill the gap. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Zhejiang are faced with a relatively high pressure under the RPS target. Finally, a path for each province to achieve its RPS target is proposed.","Yu, Biying Zhao Zihao Zhao Guangpu An Runying Sun Feihu Li Ru Peng Xiaohan",Renewable Energy,,482

382849,Covid-19: We need to understand the risks to tackle them,2020,"Substantial health disparities exist across race/ethnicity in the USA, with Black Americans often most affected. The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. While there have been ample studies describing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, relatively few have established an empirical link between these disparities and structural racism. Such empirical analyses are critically important to help defuse ""victim-blaming"" narratives about why minority communities have been badly hit by COVID-19. In this paper, we explore the empirical link between structural racism and disparities in county-level COVID-19 outcomes by county racial composition. Using negative binomial regression models, we examine how five measures of county-level residential segregation and racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes as well as incarceration rates are associated with county-level COVID-19 outcomes. We find significant associations between higher levels of measured structural racism and higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, even after adjusting for county-level population sociodemographic characteristics, measures of population health, access to healthcare, population density, and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. One percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.1% increase in county case rate. This association decreased to 0.4% when structural racism indicators were included in our model. Similarly, one percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.8% increase in county death rates, which became non-significant after adjustment for structural racism. Our findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that structural racism is an important driver of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and reinforce existing calls for action to address structural racism as a fundamental cause of health disparities.","Tan, Shin Bin; deSouza, Priyanka; Raifman, Matthew",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,482

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the social and mental effects of the pandemic. We focused on individuals living in private households aged 40 years and older. Participants were asked about pandemic-related changes in receiving and providing support (e.g. personal care, help with household chores), problems arising in taking care of older persons and changes in well-being. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses to show how support changed, problems with support came up and well-being changed in the light of the pandemic and how all this was related. RESULTS: Due to the pandemic older respondents in particular were no longer able to provide the necessary support for others. Especially women reported problems in taking care of older individuals. We found a decrease in well-being for all respondents but most significantly for women and individuals aged 80 years and older. Moreover, problems in the provision of care due to the pandemic and lower well-being were clearly linked. CONCLUSION: Our study showed significant changes in support patterns and well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial part of the respondents reported more loneliness and lower life satisfaction compared to before the pandemic, especially women supporting others. In these pandemic times, informal caregiving is severely hampered. Future pandemic-related measures should be carefully planned bearing such issues in mind.","Brandt, Martina; Garten, Claudius; Grates, Miriam; Kaschowitz, Judith; Quashie, Nekehia; Schmitz, Alina",Z Gerontol Geriatr,,482

In accordance with a guidance document issued by the Anticoagulation Forum, The Brooklyn Hospital Center (TBHC) anticoagulation clinic in Brooklyn, New York implemented measures including telemedicine follow-ups instead of in-person clinic visits, extending the interval of INR testing, and reviewing eligible candidates for transition from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants. This study describes the outcomes of one hospital-based clinic location in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 became a significant concern in the New York City area. The primary outcome of time-in-therapeutic range (TTR) for patients receiving warfarin was 60.6 % and 65.8 % in the pre-COVID and post-COVID groups, respectively (p = 0.21). For secondary outcomes, there was no difference in percent of therapeutic INRs (51.5 % pre-COVID v. 44.8 % post-COVID, p = 0.75) or percent of INRs &#8805; 4.5 (2.3 % pre-COVID v. 4 % post-COVID, p = 0.27). Based on the data reported in this study, the short-term changes implemented at TBHC's anticoagulation clinic did not appear to cause reductions in safety and efficacy of chronic warfarin therapy management.","Cope, Rebecca; Fischetti, Briann; Eladghm, Nourhan; Elaskandrany, Mahy; Karam, Nardine",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,482

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus unexpectedly identified at hemorrhoidectomy pathologic evaluation is not uncommon. We hypothesized this is occurring more frequently and sought to evaluate its impact on outcomes. METHODS: The Kentucky Cancer Registry, a premier population database, was queried for all squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases between 2007 and 2016. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus patients were compared with nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. Patient demographics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 722 squamous cell carcinoma of the anus cases identified, 3.05% (n = 22) were within hemorrhoidectomy specimens. Demographics were similar between hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus versus nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. Chemoradiation was the most common treatment strategy among all patients, and there were similar rates of disease, persistence, recurrence, and survival between hemorrhoidal and nonhemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma. Stage I disease was more common in the hemorrhoid group compared with the nonhemorrhoid group (63% vs 27%, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinoma of the anus comprised 3.05% of our population-based cohort. Hemorrhoidal squamous cell carcinomas of the anus were more likely to receive chemoradiation compared with local excision, but there were similar oncologic outcomes. We postulate that some individuals may receive overtreatment with chemoradiation owing to imprecise labeling of hemorrhoid specimens. For this reason, we advocate for separate submission of each hemorrhoid specimen.","O039,; Brien, Stephen J; Ellis, C Tyler; McDowell, Jaclyn; Galandiuk, Susan; Polk, Hiram C",Surgery (St. Louis),,482

388887,"More Resources, Community Outreach Needed to Boost Contact Tracing",2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection ranges from asymptomatic through to fatal COVID-19 characterized by a 'cytokine storm' and lung failure. Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Meanwhile, vitamin D supplementation should be strongly advised for people likely to be deficient.","Rhodes, J M; Subramanian, S; Laird, E; Griffin, G; Kenny, R A",J. intern. med,,482
390378,Operation Community Impact responds to food insecurity and challenges faced by dairy producers,2020,"Job insecurity—seen in practices like temporary work, furloughs, and site closures—is an ongoing reality for increasing numbers of workers. While the communicative constitution of resilience in situations of job loss has received significant attention, we know little about how resilience is constituted in the face of ongoing job insecurity. This study explores that question by considering how a group of employees enacted resilience during the 22-month period between the announcement that their worksite would close and the actual closure. Based on in-depth interviews, this study considers how soon-to-be terminated employees created and maintained resilience by (de)centering themselves, framing the future optimistically, affirming their value, keeping work in perspective, and caring for one another. These findings point to the importance of sensemaking that enabled employees to hold conflicting emotions and interpretations in tension and meaningfully enact purpose, agency, and humanity. Specifically, the analysis suggests that maintaining dialectics and cultivating dignity are important for constituting resilience. This study contributes to our understanding of the communicative constitution of resilience by offering a sixth central process—maintaining dialectics—to the communication theory of resilience and suggesting that workplace interactions that cultivate dignity enable resilience.","Wieland, Stacey M.

390379,Operation Community Impact responds to food insecurity and challenges faced by dairy producers,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid increase of space in highly infectious disease intensive care units (ICUs). At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), a virtual intensive care unit (vICU) was used amid the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to detail the novel adaptations and rapid expansion of the vICU that were applied to achieve patient-centric solutions while protecting staff and patients' families during the pandemic. METHODS: The planned vICU implementation was redirected to meet the emerging needs of conversion of COVID-19 ICUs, including alterations to staged rollout timing, virtual and in-person staffing, and scope of application. With the majority of the hospital critical care physician workforce redirected to rapidly expanded COVID-19 ICUs, the non-COVID-19 ICUs were managed by cardiovascular surgeons, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and acute care surgeons. HMH expanded the vICU program to fill the newly depleted critical care expertise in the non-COVID-19 units to provide urgent, emergent, and code blue support to all ICUs. RESULTS: Virtual family visitation via the Consultant Bridge application, palliative care delivery, and specialist consultation for patients with COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the vICU implementation. Patients with COVID-19, who were isolated and separated from their families to prevent the spread of infection, were able to virtually see and hear their loved ones, which bolstered the mental and emotional status of those patients. Many families expressed gratitude for the ability to see and speak with their loved ones. The vICU also protected medical staff and specialists assigned to COVID-19 units, reducing exposure and conserving personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telecritical care has been established as an advantageous mechanism for the delivery of critical care expertise during the expedited rollout of the vICU at Houston Methodist Hospital. Overall responses from patients, families, and physicians are in favor of continued vICU care; however, further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of telecritical care in the treatment of critically ill patients.","Dhala, Atiya; Sasangohar, Farzan; Kash, Bita; Ahmadi, Nima; Masud, Faisal",J Med Internet Res,,482
391395,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura after Ad26.COV2-S Vaccination,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was initially identified in India in December 2020. Due to its high transmissibility, its prevalence in the U.S.A. grew from a near-zero baseline in early May 2021 to nearly 100% by late August 2021, according to CDC tracking. We accessed openly available data sources from the public health authorities of seven U.S. states, five U.S. counties, and the District of Columbia on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests split by the COVID-19 vaccination status of individuals tested during this period. Together, these time series enable estimation and tracking of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE*) (against RT-PCR diagnosed infection) concurrently with the growth of Delta variant prevalence in those locations. Our analyses reveal that in each locality the VE* for the combined set of all three US vaccines remained relatively stable and quite well-performing, despite the dramatic concurrent rise of Delta variant prevalence. We conclude that the Delta variant does not significantly evade vaccine-induced immunity. The variations in our measured VE* appear to be driven by demographic factors affecting the composition of the vaccinated cohorts, particularly as pertains to age distribution. We report that the measured VE*, aggregated across the collected sites, began at a value of about 0.9 in mid-May, declined to about 0.76 by mid-July, and recovered to about 0.9 by mid-September. SummaryWe estimated local COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness using RT-PCR COVID-19 test data broken out by vaccination status from select localities in the U.S.A. between 15 May and 15 September 2021 while the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was ascending from essentially zero prevalence to total dominance of the genome, and showed that the rise of the Delta variant had negligible effect on vaccine effectiveness.","Blaiszik, Ben; Graziani, Carlo; Olds, James L.; Foster, Ian",,,482

The virus has now spread to over 168 countries including the United States, where the first cluster of cases was observed in the Seattle metropolitan area in Washington. Given the rapid increase in the number of cases in many localities, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we evaluated assays using seven different primer-probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those that used the E-gene primer-probe set described by Corman et al. (V. M. Corman, O. Landt, M. Kaiser, R. Molenkamp, et al., Euro Surveill 25:2000045, 2020, https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045) and the N2 set developed by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf). All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer-probe set or kit used. These results will provide valuable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.","Nalla, Arun K; Casto, Amanda M; Huang, Meei-Li W; Perchetti, Garrett A; Sampoleo, Reigran; Shrestha, Lasata; Wei, Yulun; Zhu, Haiying; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J. clin. microbiol,,482

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the psychosomatic effects and the fear of stigma which patients may face after the end of treatment and discharge from hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a non-intervention perspective study conducted in the Department of Infectious Diseases of University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis (Greece). Patients on the discharge day completed questionnaires in which 5 topics were evaluated: pain/discomfort, anxiety/distress, fear/worries, stigma and tolerance of treatment. The questionnaires were derived from similar Quality of Life Tools. The total score of each patient was normalized as percentage. RESULTS: Females and younger than 40 years old had more worries and fears on discharge day. Significant factors were days of hospitalization, days of fever and need of oxygen therapy. Patients who hospitalized more than 10 days, particularly in isolation negative pressure rooms, with persistent fever more than 7 days and need of oxygen therapy had more anxiety, worries for their clinical condition and fear of stigma. The majority of patients (80%) were expecting to face moderate to severe problems with family members, friends and colleagues underlying the dimensions of stigma. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to evaluate the psychosocial aspects of this infection and limit the stigma which patients may face returning to their daily routine. Further studies are needed with larger patient series and with the usage of psychometric instruments.","Theano, Penlioglou; Periklis, Panagopoulos; Vasilis, Petrakis; Elli, Kapetanidou; Dimitrios, Papazoglou",Psychiatr Danub,,482

403007,Investigating open innovation strategic alignment for sustainable competitive advantage in the automotive supply chain in South Africa,2021,"This study aimed to examine the relationship of general cognitive function with gaming use, and to identify elements of intelligence predicting increased gaming use. In total, 160 young adults participated in this study. Two clinical groups (n = 97) were defined: excessive gaming users diagnosed with internet gaming disorder (IGD) (n = 64) and the high-risk users (n = 33). The control group (n = 63) was also divided into regular gamers (n = 14) and non-gamers (n = 49). Participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV and self-reported questionnaires regarding IGD severity and gaming hours. The IGD group had significantly lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) scores, compared with regular gamers and non-gamers. The IGD group also exhibited lower Working Memory Index (WMI) scores, compared with non-gamers. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly lower PSI score, compared with non-gamers. Furthermore FSIQ, VCI, WMI, and PSI scores were significant predictors of gaming hours in the IGD group. For the high-risk group, FSIQ, WMI, and VCI scores were negatively associated with gaming hours. Our study demonstrates the need to address the importance of enhancing working memory and verbal ability, thus, preventing the development of gaming addiction among individuals at high-risk gamers.","Jang, Joon Hwan Chung Sun Ju Choi Aruem Ji Yoon Lee Kim Bomi Park Minkyung Park Susan Jung-Seok Choi",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,482

Evidence has shown a circular relationship between perceived threat and the risk of developing negative mood, which might impact the affect balance of older adults. We aimed to investigate the positive and negative feelings expressed by young-old (60-70 years) and old-old (over 71 years) Spanish adults during the lockdown of the COVID-19 first wave, and the social and psychological variables associated.Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in 528 participants using a questionnaire composed of sociodemographic data and validated scales for resilience (Brief Resilient Coping Scale) and emotions (Scale of Positive and Negative Experience).Results: We found a positive balance between positive and negative feelings with no differences between both groups. Regression analysis showed that social network and resilience, but not age, are significant predictors of both greater positive feelings and lower negative feelings.Conclusions: Our results evidence the relevance of promoting targeted support psychological and social measures that effectively help older adults to cope with such a difficult scenario as the current pandemic.Clinical implications: Health-care providers must develop targeted care strategies aimed at providing emotional support for older adults from a holistic perspective.","Facal, David; Rodríguez-González, Raquel; Martínez-Santos, Alba-Elena; Gandoy-Crego, Manuel",Clin Gerontol,,482

O estudo de antígenos e proteínas recombinantes de N. caninum gerou uma série de informações para um melhor diagnóstico e diferenciação deste protozoário e demais agentes a ele relacionados. No presente trabalho, propomos a expressão do clone do gene da proteína interna Nc56 de N. caninum em sistema procarioto (Escherichia coli), para avaliar sua antigenicidade frente a soros de bovinos imunoreativos contra Neospora caninum e Toxoplasma gondii. Para tanto, estabelecemos as condições ideais de expressão da proteína (indução por 4 horas e concentração de L-arabinose de 0,2%) e posteriormente avaliamos duas formas de purificação do produto recombinante (cromatografia de afinidade por metal imobilizado e eluição direta do gel de SDS-PAGE), constatando que a eluição de proteínas recombinantes diretamente do gel de SDS-PAGE mostrou-se o procedimento mais adequado para evitar a presença de proteínas contaminantes advindas do sistema procarioto de expressão. Foi selecionado um painel de soros bovinos (animais de campo), previamente testados pela reação de imunofluorescência indireta (RIFI) para avaliar sua reatividade para Neospora caninum e Toxoplasma gondii. Utilizamos o soro de um bezerro macho da raça Holandesa recém-nascido, colhido antes da administração de colostro materno (mãe soronegativa pela RIFI-Nc e RIFI-Tg) como controle negativo. O controle positivo foi obtido do mesmo bezerro após inoculação experimental de taquizoítos viáveis de N. caninum, quando este animal já apresentava seis meses de idade. O ELISA indireto foi realizado com microplacas de poliestireno com 96 cavidades de fundo chato sensibilizadas com 10 &mu;g/mL de proteína recombinante purificada Nc56 e apresentou altas densidades ópticas tanto para soros bovinos positivos na RIFI para N. caninum quanto para T. gondii, quando comparadas com a densidade óptica do soro controle negativo. A proteína recombinante purificada e o extrato bruto de proteínas solúveis em tampão desnaturante foram submetidos ao teste de Western-blotting, para avaliação de antigenicidade frente a soros de animais positivos e negativos para N. caninum e T. gondii, previamente testados por RIFI.

To better understand this functional interplay, we used Biotin Identification in human embryonic kidney cells to identify proximity interaction partners for GATA3, TCF7 (TCF1), SPI1, HLF, IKZF1, PAX5, ID1, and ID2. The proximity interaction partners shared among the lineage-restricted transcription factors included ARID1a, a BRG1-associated factor complex component. CUT&RUN analysis revealed that ARID1a shared binding with TCF7 and GATA3 at a substantial number of putative regulatory elements in mouse T cell progenitors. In support of an important function for ARID1a in lymphocyte development, deletion of Arid1a in early lymphoid progenitors in mice resulted in a pronounced developmental arrest in early T cell development with a reduction of CD4+CD8+ cells and a 20-fold reduction in thymic cellularity. Exploring gene expression patterns in DN3 cells from Wt and Arid1a-deficient mice suggested that the developmental block resided in the DN3a to DN3b transition, indicating a deficiency in ß-selection.

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of a large population of pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and compare them with patients with severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Brazilian data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, gathered from January 1st to July 14th, 2020. The sample included 4,784 patients (2,570 with confirmed COVID-19, 659 with influenza, 1,555 with ORV). Outcome measures included clinical features, preexisting comorbidities, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, need for ventilatory support, and death. RESULTS: Compared with the influenza and ORV groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher proportion of newborns and adolescents, as well as lower frequencies of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Although use of invasive ventilatory support was similar among groups, death rate was highest for COVID-19 (15.2% vs. 4.5% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001), with death risk more than three times the other groups (adjusted OR=3.7 [95% CI 2.5-5.6]). The presence of two or more comorbidities further increased this risk (OR=4.8 [95% CI 3.5-6.6]). Preexisting comorbidities were reported in 986 patients with severe COVID-19 (38%). Mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was significantly higher for almost all comorbidities reported. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate than other viral respiratory illnesses, despite the lower frequency of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Death risk was strongly associated with preexisting comorbidities.","Sousa, Braian L A; Sampaio-Carneiro, Magda; de Carvalho, Werther B; Silva, Clovis A; Ferraro, Alexandre A",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,482

413410,Active and Distance Learning in Neuroscience Education,2020,"Measles is a very contagious infectious disease, and vaccination is the only medical aid to counter the spread of the infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of vaccination schedule and type of vaccine, number of doses, and sex on the immune response. In a population of Italian medical students (8497 individuals born after 1980 with certificate of vaccination and quantitative measurement of antibodies against measles), the prevalence of positive antibodies to measles and antibody titer was measured. Vaccination schedule such as number of doses and vaccine type (measles alone or combined as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)) and sex were the variables considered to influence the immune response. The vaccination schedule depends on the year of birth: students born before 1990 were prevalently vaccinated once and with measles vaccine alone (not as MMR). One dose of vaccine induces a significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) higher positive response and antibody titer than two doses, in particular when measles alone is used (p &lt; 0.0001). Females have a significantly higher percentage of positive response (p = 0.0001) than males but only when the MMR formulation was used. Multiple linear regression confirms that sex significantly influences antibody titer when only MMR is used, after one (p = 0.0002) or two (p = 0.0060) doses. In conclusion, vaccination schedule and, partially, sex influence immune response to measles vaccination. Most notably, the measles vaccine alone (one dose) is more effective than one and two doses of MMR.","Trevisan, Andrea Mason Paola Nicolli Annamaria Maso Stefano Scarpa Bruno Moretto Angelo Scapellato Maria Luisa",Vaccines,,482

414854,Developing Distance Learning Monitoring Dashboard with Google Sheet: An Approach for Flexible and Low-Price Solution in Pandemic Era,2020,"Background: The COVID­19 pandemic and associated public health measures have disrupted the lives of people around the world. It is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the COVID­19 pandemic are insidious and affect the mental health of young children and adolescents now and will in the future. The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescent's mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote children's and adolescents' mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed them and put the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, and absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents. Key Practitioner Message: The COVID-19 pandemic's physical restrictions and social distancing measures have affected each and every domain of life. Although the number of children and adolescents affected by the disease is small, the disease and the containment measures such as social distancing, school closure, and isolation have negatively impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern. Anxiety, depression, disturbances in sleep and appetite, as well as impairment in social interactions are the most common presentations. It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on children's and adolescents' mental health. As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescents' mental health status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of the current or future pandemics.","Meherali, Salima; Punjani, Neelam; Louie-Poon, Samantha; Abdul Rahim, Komal; Das, Jai K; Salam, Rehana A; Lassi, Zohra S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,482
415766,Re-thinking sustainability and food in tourism,2020,"The endotracheal intubation of rabbits is difficult. The anesthetic risk is high because of the narrow difference between the effective and the lethal dose. We used a safe and simple method. Ten male animals received intramuscular injection of acepromazine, cetamine, and xylazine. Ten minutes later, an endotracheal canula was inserted trough a small cervical incision on the crico-tyroid membrane, to administrate oxigen and halothane. Thoracotomy was performed in the 5th. left intercostal space and a pulmonary biopsy too. The left lung collapsed and ventilation of the right lung remained for the next 30 minutes. Arterial blood pH was measured at the beginning of the procedure, after thoracotomy and after 30 minutes of selective ventilation. After 30 minutes, left pulmonary expantion was permited and thoracotomy closed without pneumotorax. As soon as the animals started breathing spontaneously the endotracheal canula was removed and crico-thyroid membrane closed with 7-0 polypropilene suture. Two weeks later the animals were submitted to euthanasia with a new lung biopsy and the trachea and laryng examined. During the procedure the animals had no important haemodinamics or gasometric disturbance. The results were good and brought us to the conclusion that it is a simple and effective method of anesthesia for thoracic surgery in rabbits.","Kallas, Elias; Brandão Schnaider, Taylor; Juliano, Yara; Ferreira Novo, Neil; Elias Kallas, Ibrahim; de Fátima Brasil Engelman, Miriam; Carvalho Kallás, Alexandre; Fernando de Castro, Luiz",Acta cir. bras.,,482
415930,A review of research into air transport and tourism:: Launching the Annals of Tourism Research Curated Collection on Air Transport and Tourism,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Information from critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is limited and in many cases coming from health systems approaches different from the national public systems existing in most countries in Europe. Besides, patient follow-up remains incomplete in many publications. Our aim is to characterize acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients admitted to a medical critical care unit (MCCU) in a referral hospital in Spain. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of consecutive ARDS COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in our MCCU. SETTING: 36-bed MCCU in referral tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal/pharyngeal swabs. INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. RESULTS: Forty-four ARDS COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Median age was 61.50 (53.25 - 67) years and most of the patients were male (72.7%). Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities (52.3 and 36.4% respectively). Steroids (1mg/Kg/day) and tocilizumab were administered in almost all patients (95.5%). 77.3% of the patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 16 days [11-28]. Prone position ventilation was performed in 33 patients (97%) for a median of 3 sessions [2-5] per patient. Nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 13 patients (29.5%). Tracheostomy was performed in ten patients (29.4%). At study closing all patients had been discharged from the CCU and only two (4.5%) remained in hospital ward. MCCU length of stay was 18 days [10-27]. Mortality at study closing was 20.5% (n 9); 26.5% among ventilated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The seven-week period in which our MCCU was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients has been challenging. Despite the severity of the patients and the high need for invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality was 20.5%.","Ramírez, P; Gordón, M; Martín-Cerezuela, M; Villarreal, E; Sancho, E; Padrós, M; Frasquet, J; Leyva, G; Molina, I; Barrios, M; Gimeno, S; Castellanos, Á","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,482

This study aimed to investigate the role of apoptosis in the etiology of lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19. This multicentered, prospective, and case-control study was conducted with polymerase chain reaction (+) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, and an age-gender-matched control group. Samples were taken at the time of diagnosis and analyzed via flow cytometry within 24 h. The participants' demographic data and initial laboratory tests were also recorded. In total, 33 patients with COVID-19 (mean age = 45.4 ± 17.2) and 25 controls (mean age = 43.4 ± 17.4) participated in the study. All patients were identified as having mild (16), moderate (5), or severe (12) disease severity. Both early and late apoptotic cells in B and T lymphocytes were increased in all patients with COVID-19 (p < .05). Early apoptotic (EA) B and T lymphocytes were also higher in severe cases compared to mild cases (p = .026). There was no significant difference between lymphopenia and apoptosis in patients with COVID-19. However, patients with lymphopenia (n = 14) and severe COVID-19 (p = .013) had increased EA T lymphocytes. This study's results show that B and T lymphocytes' apoptosis increases in patients with COVID-19. In addition, enhanced T lymphocyte apoptosis is associated with disease severity in lymphopenic patients with COVID-19.","Cizmecioglu, Ahmet; Akay Cizmecioglu, Hilal; Goktepe, Mevlut Hakan; Emsen, Ayca; Korkmaz, Celalettin; Esenkaya Tasbent, Fatma; Colkesen, Fatma; Artac, Hasibe",J Med Virol,,482
417604,Learners' Satisfaction with the Website Performance of an Open and Distance Learning Institution: A Case Study,2021,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has not only created a global health crisis, but it is also now threatening the environment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach is required to fight against the pandemic and reduce the environmental risks associated with the disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE). This paper explores an innovative way to reduce pandemic-generated waste by recycling the used face masks with other waste materials in civil constructions. In this research, for the first time, a series of experiments, including modified compaction, unconfined compression strength and resilient modulus tests, were conducted on the blends of different percentages of the shredded face mask (SFM) added to the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) for road base and subbase applications. The experimental results show that RCA mixed with three different percentages (i.e., 1%, 2% and 3%) of SFM satisfied the stiffness and strength requirements for pavements base/subbase. The introduction of the shredded face mask not only increased the strength and stiffness but also improved the ductility and flexibility of RCA/SFM blends. The inclusion of 1% SFM to RCA resulted in the highest values of unconfined compressive strength (216 kPa) and the highest resilient modulus (314.35 MP). However, beyond 2%, increasing the amount of SFM led to a decrease in strength and stiffness.","Saberian, Mohammad; Li, Jie; Kilmartin-Lynch, Shannon; Boroujeni, Mahdi",Sci Total Environ,,482

417930,Analysis of student learning styles and geometry thinking skills: During the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The purpose of this study was to identify changes in family conflict and abuse dynamics during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders from the perspectives of youth calling a national child abuse hotline. We analyzed text and chat transcripts from Childhelp's National Child Abuse Hotline from May-June 2020 that were flagged as coming from a child with a COVID-19-related concern (N = 105). Thematic analysis was used to identify COVID-19 related influences of family conflict as well as how COVID-19 constraints influenced coping and survival for youth reporting distress or maltreatment to the hotline. Family conflict most commonly disclosed stemmed from parental or child mental health concerns, often manifesting in escalated child risk taking behaviors, parental substance use, and violence in the home. Conflict was also mentioned surrounding caregiver issues with child productivity while sheltering-in-place, commonly related to school or chores. Youth often voiced feeling unable to find relief from family conflict, exacerbated from physical distance from alternative social supports, technological isolation, and limited contact with typical safe places or supportive adults. To cope and survive, youth and crisis counselors found creative home-based coping skills and alternative reporting mechanisms. Understanding the unique impact of COVID-19 on youth in homes with family conflict and abuse can point to areas for intervention to ensure we are protecting the most vulnerable as many continue to shelter-in-place. In particular, this study revealed the importance of online hotlines and reporting mechanisms to allow more youth to seek out the help and professional support they need.","Sinko, Laura; He, Yuan; Kishton, Rachel; Ortiz, Robin; Jacobs, Larel; Fingerman, Michelle",J Fam Violence,,482
419013,The Covid-19 Pandemic and the Implementation of the European Green Deal,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) may be susceptible to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, anti-CRC/COVID-19 treatment options are currently unavailable. Since niacin is a vitamin with cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory functions, this study aimed to evaluate the possible functional roles and underlying mechanisms of action of niacin as an anti-COVID-19 and -CRC therapy. INTERVENTIONS: We used a series of network pharmacology-based and computational analyses to understand and characterize the binding capacity, biological functions, pharmacological targets and therapeutic mechanisms of niacin in CRC/COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We revealed the clinical characteristics of CRC patients and COVID-19 patients, including predisposing genes, survival rate and prognosis. Moreover, the results of molecular docking analysis indicated that niacin exerted effective binding capacity in COVID-19. Further, we disclosed the targets, biological functions and signaling pathways of niacin in CRC/COVID-19. The analysis indicated that niacin could help in treating CRC/COVID-19 through cytoprotection, enhancement of immunologic functions, inhibition of inflammatory reactions and regulation of cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, five core pharmacological targets of niacin in CRC/COVID-19 were also identified, including BCL2L1, PTGS2, IL1B, IFNG and SERPINE1. CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, revealed the niacin-associated molecular functions and pharmacological targets for treating CRC/COVID-19, as COVID-19 remains a serious pandemic. But the findings were not validated in actual CRC patients infected with COVID-19, so further investigation is needed to confirm the potential use of niacin for treating CRC/COVID-19.","Li, Rong; Li, Yu; Liang, Xiao; Yang, Lu; Su, Min; Lai, Keng Po",,,482

420386,Teaching Novice Science Teachers Online: Considerations for Practice-Based Pedagogy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is important for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. METHODS: We present a clinical validation of a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N1) gene. Off-board lysis on an automated nucleic acid extraction system was optimized with endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and NL63). Genomic RNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a recombinant viral protein coat were used as control materials and compared for recovery from nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: Nucleic acid extraction showed decreased recovery of endemic Coronavirus in vitro transcribed RNA (NL63) compared with attenuated virus (OC43). SARS-CoV-2 RNA had more reliable recovery from extraction through amplification than genomic RNA. Recovery of genomic RNA was improved by combining lysis buffer with clinical matrix before adding RNA. The RT-PCR assay demonstrated 100% in silico sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy across samples was 100% (75 of 75). Precision studies showed 100% intra-run, inter-run, and inter-technologist concordance. The limit of detection was 264 copies per milliliter (estimated 5 copies per reaction; 35.56 mean threshold cycle value). CONCLUSIONS: This SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrates appropriate characteristics for use under an Emergency Use Authorization. Endemic coronavirus controls were useful in optimizing the extraction procedure. In the absence of live or attenuated virus, recombinant virus in a protein coat is an appropriate control specimen type for assay validation during a pandemic.","SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Frame, Ithiel; Falcon, Alejandra; Jacob, Jerin; Wagenfuehr, Jennifer; Mitui, Midori; Park, Jason Y; Filkins, Laura",J Appl Lab Med,,482
421473,Responding to racial injustice by listening and learning from employees,2021,"BACKGROUND: Philadelphia and its suburbs were an epicenter for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, alterations were made in breast cancer care at a community hospital. METHODS: The authors developed a prospective database of all the patients with invasive or in situ breast cancer between March 1 and June 15 at their breast center. Any change in a breast cancer plan due to the pandemic was documented, and the patients were grouped into two cohorts according to whether a change was made (CTX) or no change was made (NC) in their care. The patients were asked a series of questions about their care, including those in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder two-item questionnaire (GAD-2), via telephone. RESULTS: The study enrolled 73 patients: 41 NC patients (56%) and 32 CTX patients (44%). The two cohorts did not differ in terms of age, race, or stage. Changes included delay in therapy (15.1%) and use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET, 28.8%). The median time to surgery was 24 days (interequartile range [IQR], 16-45 days) for the NC patients and 82 day s (IQR, 52-98 days) for the CTX patients (p &#8804; 0.001). The median duration of NET was 78 days. The GAD-2 showed anxiety positivity to be 29.6% for the CTX patients and 32.4% for the NC patients (p = 1.00). More than half (55.6%) of the CTX patients believed COVID-19 affected their treatment outlook compared with 25.7% of the NC patients (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: A prospective database captured changes in breast cancer care at a community academic breast center during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. 44% of patients experienced a change in breast cancer care due to COVID-19.

423042,Future themes of mathematics education research: an international survey before and during the pandemic,2021,"RATIONALE: COPD is the most common non-infectious pulmonary disease among people living with HIV, independent of smoking. However, the cause for this enhanced susceptibility remains unclear, and the effects of HIV on pulmonary perfusion and ventilation are unknown. METHODS: We used PET-CT in 46 smokers and non-smokers, 23 of whom had documented HIV infection. Emphysema was assessed by CT and perfusion by nitrogen-13 (13NN) PET scans. After removal of image noise, vertical and axial gradients in perfusion were calculated. We tested for differences in the total spatial heterogeneity of perfusion (CV2Qtotal) and its components (CV2Qtotal = CV2Qvgrad (vertical gradient) + CV2Qzgrad (axial gradient) + CV2Qr (residual heterogeneity)) among groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic parameters among groups, and all subjects had minimal radiographic evidence of emphysema. Compared to controls, non-smokers living with HIV had a significantly greater CV2 Qr/ CV2Qtotal (0.48 vs 0.36, P = 0.05) and reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal (0.46 vs 0.65, P = 0.038). Smokers also had a reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal, however, there was no significant difference in CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal between smokers living with and without HIV (0.39 vs 0.34, P = 0.58), despite a decreased vertical perfusion gradient (Qvgrad) in smokers living with HIV. CONCLUSION: In non-smokers living with well-controlled HIV and minimal radiographic emphysema, HIV infection contributes to pulmonary perfusion abnormalities similar to smokers. These data indicate the onset of subclinical pulmonary perfusion abnormalities that could herald the development of significant lung disease in these susceptible individuals.","Kohli, Puja; Kelly, Vanessa Jane; Hibbert, Kathryn; Corleis, Bjorn; Kone, Mamary; Cho, Josalyn; Defaria-Yeh, Doreen; Kwon, Douglas; Medoff, Benjamin; Harris, Robert Scott; Winkler, Tilo",J. nucl. med,,482

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 4530 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to three tertiary care hospitals in New York City from March 1 to June 30, 2020 to identify patients who had more than one brain MRI. We reviewed the initial and final MRI for each patient to (1) measure the percent change in the bicaudate index and third ventricular diameter and (2) evaluate changes in the presence and severity of white matter changes. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had two MRIs separated by a median of 22 [Interquartile range (IQR) 14-30] days. Ventricle size increased for 15 patients (71%) between scans [median bicaudate index 0.16 (IQR 0.126-0.181) initially and 0.167 (IQR 0.138-0.203) on final imaging (p < 0.001); median third ventricular diameter 6.9 mm (IQR 5.4-10.3) initially and 7.2 mm (IQR 6.4-10.8) on final imaging (p < 0.001)]. Every patient had white matter changes on the initial and final MRI; between images, they worsened for seven patients (33%) and improved for three (14%). CONCLUSIONS: On serial imaging of critically ill patients with COVID-19, ventricle size frequently increased over several weeks. White matter changes were often unchanged, but in some cases they worsened or improved, demonstrating there is likely a spectrum of pathophysiological processes responsible for these changes.","Agarwal, Shashank; Melmed, Kara; Dogra, Siddhant; Jain, Rajan; Conway, Jenna; Galetta, Steven; Lewis, Ariane",Neurocritical care,,482

The aims of this study were to describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital and intensive care, and to investigate predictors of outcome to characterize severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study used Canadian data from 32 selected hospitals included in a global multisite cohort between Jan. 24 and July 7, 2020. Adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who received care in an intensive care unit (ICU) and a sampling of up to the first 60 patients receiving care on hospital wards were included. We performed descriptive analyses of characteristics, interventions and outcomes. The primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality, with secondary analyses of the length of hospital and ICU stay. RESULTS: Between January and July 2020, among 811 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-75) years, 495 (61.0%) were men, 46 (5.7%) were health care workers, 9 (1.1%) were pregnant, 26 (3.2%) were younger than 18 years and 9 (1.1%) were younger than 5 years. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 (IQR 3-10) days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, shortness of breath, cough and malaise. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac, kidney and respiratory disease were the most common comorbidities. Among all patients, 328 received care in an ICU, admitted a median of 0 (IQR 0-1) days after hospital admission. Critically ill patients received treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (88.8%), renal replacement therapy (14.9%) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.0%); 26.2% died. Among those receiving mechanical ventilation, 31.2% died. Age was an influential predictor of mortality (odds ratio per additional year of life 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.09). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 commonly had fever, respiratory symptoms and comorbid conditions. Increasing age was associated with the development of critical illness and death; however, most critically ill patients in Canada, including those requiring mechanical ventilation, survived and were discharged from hospital.","Murthy, Srinivas; Archambault, Patrick M; Atique, Anika; Carrier, François Martin; Cheng, Matthew P; Codan, Cassidy; Daneman, Nick; Dechert, William; Douglas, Sarah; Fiest, Kirsten M; Fowler, Robert; Goco, Geraldine; Gu, Yusing; Guerguerian, Anne-Marie; Hall, Richard; Hsu, Jimmy M; Joffe, Ari; Jouvet, Philippe; Kelly, Laurel; Kho, Michelle E; Kruisselbrink, Rebecca J; Kumar, Deepali; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios James; Lamontagne, François; Lee, Todd C; Menon, Kusum; O039,; Grady, Heather; Hearn, Katie; Ovakim, Daniel H; Pharand, Scott G; Pitre, Tyler; Reel, Riley; Reeve, Brenda; Rewa, Oleksa; Richardson, David; Rishu, Asgar; Sandhu, Gyan; Sarfo-Mensah, Shirley; Shadowitz, Ellen; Sligl, Wendy; Solomon, Joshua; Stelfox, Henry T; Swanson, Ashleigh; Tessier-Grenier, Hubert; Tsang, Jennifer L Y; Wood, Gordon",CMAJ Open,,482

To date, little evidence on COVID-related concerns have been produced and no report has provided structured feedback from the point of view of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism or of their family/carers. AIMS: To provide systemised evidence-based information of the priority concerns for people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Senior representatives of major UK-based professional and service-user representative organisations with a stake in the care of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism were contacted to provide a list of concerns across three domains: 'mental health and challenging behaviour', 'physical health and epilepsy' and 'social circumstances and support'. The feedback was developed into statements on frequently reported priorities. These statements were then rated independently by expert clinicians. A video-conference meeting to reconcile outliers and to generate a consensus statement list was held. RESULTS: Thirty-two organisations were contacted, of which 26 (81%) replied. From the respondent's data, 30 draft consensus statements were generated. Following expert clinician review, there was initially strong consensus for seven statements (23%), increasing to 27 statements (90%) following video conferencing. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations highlight the expectations of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism in the current pandemic. This could support policymakers and professionals' deliver and evidence person-centred care.","Tromans, Sam; Kinney, Michael; Chester, Verity; Alexander, Regi; Roy, Ashok; Sander, Josemir W; Dudson, Harry; Shankar, Rohit",BJPsych Open,,482

432134,Consumer panic buying: Realizing its consequences and repercussions on the supply chain,2021,"Government responses and lockdowns, even done well, have also caused increased morbidity and mortality by a reduction in patients seeking treatment for non-COVID-19 conditions, and the postponement of therapy such as surgery and preventive screening. This opportunity cost of the lockdown also includes the morbidity and mortality induced by unemployment and mental health issues. Whether these risks of lockdown are outweighed by the projected lives saved from dying of COVID-19 has still to be adequately analysed both here and overseas, but such analyses are essential in understanding the circumstances under which such measures are ethically justified. Equity of information-provision has been problematic. There have been issues of access to digital information and telehealth, especially for people who are poor or homeless.29 Understanding the risks, benefits and ethics of virtual healthcare is evolving concurrently with its widescale implementation.","Hall, K.

432951,From ecology of childhood to psychology of sustainable development,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global, national, and local public health concern which has caused a significant outbreak in all countries and regions for both males and females around the world. Automated detection of lung infections and their boundaries from medical images offers a great potential to augment the patient treatment healthcare strategies for tackling COVID-19 and its impacts. Detecting this disease from lung CT scan images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose patients. However, finding the presence of infected tissues and segment them from CT slices faces numerous challenges, including similar adjacent tissues, vague boundary, and erratic infections. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a two-route convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting global and local features for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. Each pixel from the image is classified into the normal and infected tissues. For improving the classification accuracy, we used two different strategies including fuzzy c-means clustering and local directional pattern (LDN) encoding methods to represent the input image differently. This allows us to find more complex pattern from the image. To overcome the overfitting problems due to small samples, an augmentation approach is utilized. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved precision 96%, recall 97%, F score, average surface distance (ASD) of 2.8 ± 0.3 mm, and volume overlap error (VOE) of 5.6 ± 1.2%.","Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid; Bendechache, Malika; Amirabadi, Amir; Ab Rahman, Mohd Nizam; Baseri Saadi, Soroush; Aghamohammadi, Amirhossein; Kooshki Forooshani, Mersedeh",Biomed Res Int,,482

The CRS was evidenced by raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, elevated cytokine levels (IFN-Î³/IL-2R/IL-18/IL-16/IL-10) and steroid responsiveness. The close temporal association of vaccination and diagnosis of CRS in this case suggests that CRS was a vaccine-related adverse event; with anti-PD1 blockade as a potential contributor.

Specifically, it predicted pain, depression, and anxiety disorders, negatively among adults younger than 45 years, yet positively among seniors older than 70 years. Adults who were female, were unsure about their chronic diseases, or exercised less were more likely to have mental health issues. This study, being the first paper to examine age curvilinearly, suggests future research to pay more attention to nonlinear predictors of mental health disorders in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Jiyao; Zhang, Stephen X; Wang, Yifei; Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar; Mokhtari Dinani, Maryam; Nazarian Madavani, Abbas; Nawaser, Khaled",Int J Ment Health Addict,,482

Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since most of these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low- and middle-income countries. In order to develop an inexpensive SARS CoV2 detection protocol using available resources we evaluated the SYBR Green based detection of SARS-CoV-2 to establish a suitable assay. To do so, we adapted one of the WHO recommended TaqMan-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green. Our results indicate that SYBR-Green detection of ORF1b-nsp14 target represents a reliable cost-effective alternative to increase the testing capacity.","Pereira-Gómez, Marianoel; Fajardo, Álvaro; Echeverría, Natalia; López-Tort, Fernando; Perbolianachis, Paula; Costábile, Alicia; Aldunate, Fabián; Moreno, Pilar; Moratorio, Gonzalo",J Virol Methods,,482

Fractal analysis of medical imaging has a potential to quantify this structural heterogeneity in the tumor AIMS: The purpose of this study is to quantify this structural abnormality in the tumor applying fractal analysis to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) image and to evaluate its biomarker value for predicting survival of surgically treated gastric cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 108 gastric cancer patients (77 men and 31 women; mean age: 69.1 years), who received curative surgery without any neoadjuvant therapy, were retrospectively investigated. Portal-phase CE-CT images were analyzed with use of a plug-in tool for ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA), and the fractal dimension (FD) in the tumor was calculated using a differential box-counting method to quantify structural heterogeneity in the tumor. Tumor FD was compared with clinicopathologic features and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: High FD value of the tumor significantly associated with high T stage and high pathological stage (P = 0.009, 0.007, respectively). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with higher FD tumors (FD > 0.9746) showed a significantly worse DSS (P = 0.009, log rank). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor FD, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors for DSS. In subset analysis of lymph-node positive gastric cancers, only tumor FD was an independent prognostic factor for DSS. CONCLUSION: CT fractal analysis can be a useful biomarker for gastric cancer patients, reflecting survival and clinicopathologic features.","Watanabe, Hiroki; Hayano, Koichi; Ohira, Gaku; Imanishi, Shunsuke; Hanaoka, Toshiharu; Hirata, Atsushi; Kano, Masayuki; Matsubara, Hisahiro",Dig. dis. sci,,482
445931,Beyond COVID-19: turning crisis to opportunity in Nigeria through urban agriculture,2020,"Infection with the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with the development of a viral pneumonia with severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure. In many cases these patients will require mechanical ventilation; but in others the severity of disease is significantly less and may not need invasive support. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a widely used modality of delivering high concentrations of oxygen and airflow to patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, but its use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is poorly described. Concerns with use of HFNC have arisen including aerosolization of viral particles to healthcare workers (HCW) to delaying intubation and potentially worsening of outcomes. However, use of HFNC in other coronavirus pandemics and previous experimental evidence suggest HFNC is low risk and may be effective in select patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. With the significant increase in resource utilization in care of patients with SARS-CoV-2, identification of those that may benefit from HFNC allowing allocation of ventilators to those more critically ill is of significant importance. In this manuscript, we review pertinent literature regarding the use of HFNC in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and address many concerns regarding its use.","Suffredini, Dante A; Allison, Michael G",J Intensive Care Med,,482

Education and environment after the coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia has been proved to be associated with hospital mortality in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. However, the detailed association of thrombocytopenia with subsequent progression of organ functions and long-term prognosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains to be explored. METHODS: Medical records of 167 confirmed cases of critically ill COVID-19 from February 16 to March 21, 2020 were collected in this two-center retrospective study. 180-day's outcome and clinical organ development in patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia were analyzed. FINDINGS: Among all 167 patients, the median age was 66 years and 67.07% were male. Significant differences were noticed in laboratory findings including white blood cells, blood urea, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and SOFA score between groups of thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. Older age, lower platelet count and longer activated partial thromboplastin time at admission were determined to be risk factors of 28-day mortality, and all three, together with higher white blood cells were risk factors of 180-day mortality. Subsequent changes of six-point ordinal scale score, oxygenation index, and SOFA score in patients with thrombocytopenia showed marked worsening trends compared with patients without thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had significantly higher mortality not only in 28 days, but also in 90 days and 180 days. The time-course curves in non-survival group showed a downtrend of platelet count and oxygenation index, while the curve of six-point ordinal scale kept an uptrend. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with thrombocytopenia had much lower probability of survival (p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: The thrombocytopenia was associated with the deterioration of respiratory function. Baseline platelet count was associated with subsequent and long-term mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Zhu, Yuan; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yiming; Liu, Fang; Zhou, Qing; Peng, Zhiyong",PLoS One,,482

Acceptance of wearing masks is still low in many countries, making it extremely difficult to keep the pandemic at bay. In an experimental study, participants (N = 88) had to assess how strange they felt when wearing a face mask while being exposed to displays of groups of varying numbers of mask wearers. Three different types of face masks were shown: simple homemade masks, FFP2 masks, and loop scarfs. The higher the frequency of people wearing masks in the displayed social group, the less strange the participants felt about themselves, an essential precondition for accepting wearing masks. This effect of a descriptive social norm was particularly effective when people saw others wearing less intrusive masks, here, simple homemade masks. © The Author(s) 2021.","Carbon, C.

455246,Misa online: solusi sementara dan bermasalah,2021,"BACKGROUND: Studies have highlighted that fear and anxiety generated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are important psychological factors that affect all populations studied. There is currently still a lack of research on specific amplification factors regarding anxiety and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite established associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, there is currently a lack of empirical data that has investigated the associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Urgent research is needed to better understand better the role of repeated media consumption concerning COVID-19 in amplifying fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 anxiety. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the associations between fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, and cyberchondria. METHODS: A convenience sample of 694 respondents (343 males, 351 females) completed an online survey that included the Cyberchondria Severity Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Anxiety Sensitively Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The results showed that Fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 predicted cyberchondria: ß=.39, SE=.04, P<.001, t=11.16, 95% CI [0.31, 0.45] and ß=.25, SE=.03, P<.001, t=7.67, 95% CI [0.19, 0.32], respectively. Also, intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 with cyberchondria. In reciprocal model, the standardized total effects of the cyberchondria on fear of COVID19 (ß = .45, SE=.04, P<.001, t= 15.31, 95% CI [0.39, 0.51]) and COVID-19 anxiety (ß = .36, SE=.03, P<.001, t= 11.29, 95% CI [0.30, 0.41]) were statistically significant, with moderate effect sizes. Compared to males, females obtained statistically significantly higher scores of cyberchondria (t[692]=-2.85, P=.004, Cohen's d=.22), COVID-19 anxiety (t(692)=-3.32, P<.01, Cohen's d=.26), and anxiety sensitivity (t[692]=-3.69, P<.001, Cohen's d=.29). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide further support in better understanding the role of COVID-19 in amplifying cyberchondria. Finally, based on the findings here, cyberchondria must be viewed as a significant public health issue. Importantly, increasing awareness about cyberchondria and online behavior at both individual and collective levels must be prioritized to enhance preparedness and to reduce adverse effects of current and future medical disasters.","Wu, Xue; Nazari, Nabi; Griffiths, Mark D",J. med. internet res,,482

In this study, we constructed a reverse genetics system of SARS-CoV-2 by assembling the viral cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector with deletion of the spike (S) gene. Transfection of the cDNA into cells results in the production of an RNA replicon that keeps the capability of genome or subgenome replication but is deficient in virion assembly and infection due to the absence of S protein. Therefore, such a replicon system is not infectious and can be used in ordinary biological laboratories. We confirmed the efficient replication of the replicon by demonstrating the expression of the subgenomic RNAs which have similar profiles to the wild-type virus.

Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined optimal allocation strategies with one and two doses of vaccine under various degrees of viral transmission. Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine vitally depends on the single-dose efficacy. With high single-dose efficacy, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 22% more deaths than a strategy prioritizing two-dose vaccination for older adults. With low or moderate single-dose efficacy, mixed vaccination campaigns with complete coverage of older adults are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across all adult populations. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.","Matrajt, Laura; Eaton, Julia; Leung, Tiffany; Dimitrov, Dobromir; Schiffer, Joshua T; Swan, David A; Janes, Holly",Nat Commun,,482

Determinants of mortality in the general population are now clear, but specific data on patients with cancer remain limited, particularly in Latin America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal multicenter cohort study of patients with cancer and confirmed COVID-19 from Oncoclínicas community oncology practice in Brazil was conducted. The primary end point was all-cause mortality after isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in patients initially diagnosed in an outpatient environment. We performed univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis and recursive partitioning modeling to define the baseline clinical determinants of death in the overall population. RESULTS: From March 29 to July 4, 2020, 198 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database, of which 167 (84%) had solid tumors and 31 (16%) had hematologic malignancies. Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (77%), largely for advanced or metastatic disease (64%). The overall mortality rate was 16.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 22.7). In univariate models, factors associated with death after COVID-19 diagnosis were age &#8805; 60 years, current or former smoking, coexisting comorbidities, respiratory tract cancer, and management in a noncurative setting (P < .05). In multivariable logistic regression and recursive partitioning modeling, only age, smoking history, and noncurative disease setting remained significant determinants of mortality, ranging from 1% in cancer survivors under surveillance or (neo)adjuvant therapy to 60% in elderly smokers with advanced or metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Mortality after COVID-19 in patients with cancer is influenced by prognostic factors that also affect outcomes of the general population. Fragile patients and smokers are entitled to active preventive measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and close monitoring in the case of exposure or COVID-19-related symptoms.","Ferrari, Bruno L; Ferreira, Carlos Gil; Menezes, Márcia; De Marchi, Pedro; Canedo, Jorge; Melo, Andréia Cristina de; Jácome, Alexandre A; Reinert, Tomás; Paes, Rafael Duarte; Sodré, Bárbara; Barrios, Carlos H; Dienstmann, Rodrigo",JCO Glob Oncol,,482

This perspective discusses the burden, challenges and potential opportunities for improvement of CVD prevention and control efforts in SSA. AREAS COVERED: This paper focuses on ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and their key contributors of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia which are well-established, rapidly rising and significant contributors to disease burden in SSA. However, their prevention, detection, treatment and control of are currently disorganised, inconsistent, unreliable and insufficient with most SSA countries not geared to respond to this growing problem. National policies are frequently lacking or, if available, remain poorly implemented, for the control of these conditions. Primary healthcare systems have not adapted to cope with these rising CVD burdens and remain weak, underfunded and under resourced. Numerous barriers at the healthcare service, healthcare provider and patient levels prevent optimal CVD risk factor care. EXPERT OPINION: Innovative approaches such as task-shifting with the reallocation of care to lower-level healthcare workers and the potential use of inexpensive technological options should be encouraged to provide equitable CVD preventive and curative solutions to SSA's poor.","Peer, Nasheeta; Baatiema, Leonard; Kengne, Andre-Pascal",Expert rev. cardiovasc. ther,,482

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus that has introduced itself into the human population in the current era, after SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Molecular and cellular studies of the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus are still in the early stages of research; however, based on similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, it can be hypothesized that the NF-&#954;B, cytokine regulation, ERK, and TNF-&#945; signaling pathways are the likely causes of inflammation at the onset of COVID-19. Several drugs have been prescribed and used to alleviate the adverse effects of these inflammatory cellular signaling pathways, and these might be beneficial for developing novel therapeutic modalities against COVID-19.

These laboratories are mandated to maintain the health of their communities by identifying, diagnosing, and warning constituents of potential and real health emergencies. Due to the changing characteristics of public health threats and their cross-jurisdictional nature, laboratories are facing increased pressure to ensure that they respond in a consistent and coordinated manner. Here, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) Emerging Leader Program Cohort 11 members have compiled stories from subject matter experts (SMEs) at PHLs with direct involvement in crises to determine the characteristics of a successful response. Experts examined a diverse selection of emerging threats from across PHLs, including infectious diseases, opioids, natural disasters, and government shutdowns. While no public health crisis will be identical to another, overarching themes were consistent across subjects. Experiences from SMEs that could improve future responses to emerging threats are highlighted.","Charlton, Carmen L; Hull, Noah; Sloma, Cari Roark; Bonifas, Mary; Johnson, Matthew; Strain, Anna K; Wolford, Tyler; Staley, Sherrie; Perkins, Carey; Razzaque, Rafia; Courtney, Colleen; Bind, Eric P",Clin. microbiol. rev,,482
461212,Making Remote Learning Engaging,2021,"CRISPR-Cas systems recognize foreign genetic material using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). In type II systems, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) hybridizes to crRNAs to drive their processing and utilization by Cas9. While analyzing Cas9-RNA complexes from Campylobacter jejuni, we discovered tracrRNA hybridizing to cellular RNAs, leading to formation of ""noncanonical"" crRNAs capable of guiding DNA targeting by Cas9. Our discovery inspired the engineering of reprogrammed tracrRNAs that link the presence of any RNA of interest to DNA targeting with different Cas9 orthologs. This capability became the basis for a multiplexable diagnostic platform termed LEOPARD (leveraging engineered tracrRNAs and on-target DNAs for parallel RNA detection). LEOPARD allowed simultaneous detection of RNAs from different viruses in one test and distinguished severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its D614G (Asp614âGly) variant with single-base resolution in patient samples.","Jiao, Chunlei; Sharma, Sahil; Dugar, Gaurav; Peeck, Natalia L; Bischler, Thorsten; Wimmer, Franziska; Yu, Yanying; Barquist, Lars; Schoen, Christoph; Kurzai, Oliver; Sharma, Cynthia M; Beisel, Chase L",Science,,482

METHOD: The study was performed on patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography lung diagnosis. The relationship between lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and De Ritis ratio were analysed in the first blood samples of the patients. The difference between gender was also compared with the independent sample t-test. Alpha value was accepted <0.05. RESULTS: The De Ritis was significantly higher in females (p = .040). The De Ritis ratio was associated with CK in both gender. There was no significant difference in the biochemical parameters according to gender. CONCLUSION: The De Ritis ratio appears to be a parameter that can be used in COVID-19 patients. However, more detailed and comprehensive studies including the symptoms of patients are needed.","Yazar, Hayrullah; Kayacan, Yildirim; Ozdin, Mehmet",Arch Physiol Biochem,,482

Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit individuals working in the supply chain departments in different healthcare sectors in Saudi Arabia. One hundred and three pharmaceutical and medical supply chain employees participated in the study. Most of the participants (58.3%) were aged &#8805;35 years, male (65%), and pharmacists (92.2%). The majority of participants had at least two years of experience in supply chain (77.6%), worked in public hospitals (95.15%), and were mostly working at healthcare institutions located in Riyadh province (59.2%). Approximately 51% of the participants reported shortages of 10 or more essential drugs. Tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, dexamethasone, enoxaparin, interferon beta-1b, cisatracurium besylate, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, methimazole, and methylprednisolone were reported to be in shortage by at least 8% of the participants. Almost 70% of the participants reported that the pandemic did not significantly impact the prices of prescription drugs in shortage (e.g., &#8805;25%). Moreover, about 70% of the participants reported direct purchasing or procurement of drugs in shortage. Surgical masks, face shields, medical gowns, and N95 respirators were reported to be in short supply by 33% or more of the participants. Approximately 53% of the participants reported the prices of PPE in shortage had seen an increase by at least 25% during the pandemic. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, its impact was largely manageable in Saudi healthcare institutions. This can be attributable to multiple reasons such as the effective exchange programs between hospitals and the drastic increase in public healthcare spending to ameliorate the negative impact of the pandemic on the healthcare sector.","Aljadeed, Rana; AlRuthia, Yazed; Balkhi, Bander; Sales, Ibrahim; Alwhaibi, Monira; Almohammed, Omar; Alotaibi, Abdulaziz J; Alrumaih, Ali M; Asiri, Yousif",,,482

However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","Ghavasieh, Arsham; Bontorin, Sebastiano; Artime, Oriol; Domenico, Manlio De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09649v1.pdf,482

A model of goal-directed behavior,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in the spread of COVID-19 and the numbers of infected patients worldwide has highlighted the need for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and more advanced therapy. This need is more urgent in resource-constrained settings. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: The current study was conducted based on a retrospective cohort design. . METHODS: The participants included 665 definite cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital from February 20 to May 14, 2020. The baseline characteristics of patients were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant odds ratio (OR) for ICU admission. RESULTS: Participants were aged 59.52±16.72 years, and the majority (55.6%) of them were male. Compared to non-ICU patients (n=547), the ICU patients (n=118) were older, had more baseline comorbidities, and presented more often with dyspnea, convulsion, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and less often with myalgia. Significant OR (95% CI) of ICU admission was observed for the 60-80 age group (2.42, 95%CI: 1.01; 5.79), &#8805;80 age group (3.73, 95%CI: 1.44; 9.42), &#8805;3 comorbidities (2.07, 95%CI: 1.31; 3.80), loss of consciousness (6.70, 95%CI: 2.94, 15.24), tachypnea (1.79, 95%CI: 1.03, 3.11), and SpO2<90 (5.83, 95%CI: 2.74; 12.4). Abnormal laboratory results were more common among ICU-admitted patients; in this regard, leukocytosis (4.45, 95%CI: 1.49, 13.31), lymphopenia (2.39, 95%CI: 1.30; 4.39), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (1.99, 95%CI: 1.04; 3.83), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.25, 95%CI: 1.18-4.30) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed that consolidation (1.82, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.24), pleural effusion (3.19, 95%CI: 1.71, 5.95), and crazy paving pattern (8.36, 95%CI: 1.92, 36.48) had a significant OR of ICU admission. CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the predictors of ICU admission were identified among epidemiological characteristics, presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings.","Hatami, Hossein; Soleimantabar, Hussein; Ghasemian, Mehrdad; Delbari, Negar; Aryannezhad, Shayan",J Res Health Sci,,482

466519,Towards the development of sustainable tourism in pakistan: A study of the role of tour operators,2021,"PREMISE: Plant genome size ranges widely, providing many opportunities to examine how genome size variation affects plant form and function. We analyzed trends in chromosome number, genome size, and leaf traits for the woody angiosperm clade Viburnum to examine the evolutionary associations, functional implications, and possible drivers of genome size. METHODS: Chromosome counts and genome size estimates were mapped onto a Viburnum phylogeny to infer the location and frequency of polyploidization events and trends in genome size evolution. Genome size was analyzed with leaf anatomical and physiological data to evaluate the influence of genome size on plant function. RESULTS: We discovered nine independent polyploidization events, two reductions in base chromosome number, and substantial variation in genome size with a slight trend toward genome size reduction in polyploids. We did not find strong relationships between genome size and the functional and morphological traits that have been highlighted at broader phylogenetic scales. CONCLUSIONS: Polyploidization events were sometimes associated with rapid radiations, demonstrating that polyploid lineages can be highly successful. Relationships between genome size and plant physiological function observed at broad phylogenetic scales may be largely irrelevant to the evolutionary dynamics of genome size at smaller scales. The view that plants readily tolerate changes in ploidy and genome size, and often do so, appears to apply to Viburnum.","Moeglein, Morgan K; Chatelet, David S; Donoghue, Michael J; Edwards, Erika J",Am. j. bot,,482

Various formal and non-formal institutions including their routines are forced to conduct face-to-face learning and they are directed towards online learning. The implementation of online learning itself can not be undertaken optimally due to several things such as inadequate networking until teachers who are not ready for the technology. The impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic was not only affected in formal education, but a great effect was also gotten by non-formal education such as tutoring institutions. Due to the importance of learning guidance on student achievement, the existence of institutional education and guidance on learning must always be a concern. A qualitative method with a descriptive approach was employed in this research. Data collection was undertaken through observation, interviews, literature study, concluding. The validity of the data analysis and documentation. Data were analyzed through data reduction, data presentation, and concluding. The validity of the data analysis technique used source triangulation. The results indicated that the existence of a tutoring institution in the city of Bandar Lampung tended to delay because of the increasing demand for online learning. The pandemic period participated in providing socio-economic impacts for tutoring institutions in the city of Bandar Lampung, including reduced income because of the small number of registrants, as well as additional costs for meeting facilities in online learning.

471463,The Decrease in Hospital Visits at Universitas Sebelas Maret Hospital Due to the Level of Stress and Fear of COVID 19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, different strategies have been explored to stem the spread of the disease and appropriately manage patient flow. Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liège University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","Gilbert, Allison; Brasseur, Edmond; Petit, Mérédith; Donneau, Anne Françoise; Diep, AnhNguyet; Hetzel Campbell, Suzanne; Servotte, Jean-Christophe; Piazza, Justine; Ancion, Aurore; Gensburger, Mathieu; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",Acta Clin Belg,,482

472605,Use of Augmented and Virtual Reality in Remote Higher Education: A Systematic Umbrella Review,2021,"From the beginning of 2020, the governments and the health systems around the world are tackling infections and fatalities caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a ""cytokine storm"" and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals. We look at the many lessons learnt from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic and relate it to the very little but fast incoming information that is available from the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with overweight and obesity.","Bhattacharya, Indranil; Ghayor, Chafik; Pérez Dominguez, Ana; Weber, Franz E",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,482

Specifically, the Italian regions are a metapopulation represented by network nodes and the network links are the interactions between those regions. Then, we modify the network-based SIR model in order to take into account the different lockdown measures adopted by the Italian Government in the various phases of the spreading of the COVID-19. Our results indicate that the network-based model better predicts the daily cumulative infected individuals when time-varying lockdown protocols are incorporated in the classical SIR model.","Pizzuti, Clara; Socievole, Annalisa; Prasse, Bastian; Mieghem, Piet Van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14453v1.pdf,482

474020,David Oliver: The medical examiner role could transform our approach to handling death,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth is an important tool in helping to provide services for hard-to-reach populations. One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS: Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS: Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that a wide range of services and types of assessments may be amenable to telehealth procedures. Further, the findings have immediate applications as the field shifts towards telehealth due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Bullard, Lauren; Harvey, Danielle; Abbeduto, Leonard",J Telemed Telecare,,482

Studies showed COVID-19 affected not only the lung but also other organs. In this study, we aimed to explore the cardiac damage in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected data of 100 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to April 10, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, and treatment. In-hospital mortality were observed. Cardiac damage was defined as plasma hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) over 34.2 pg/ml and/or N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) above 450 pg/ml at the age < 50, above 900 pg/ml at the age < 75, or above 1800 pg/ml at the age &#8805; 75. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old. 69 (69.0%) had comorbidities, mainly presenting hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fever (69 [69.0%]), cough (63 [63.0%]), chest distress (13 [13.0%]), and fatigue (12 [12.0%]) were the common initial symptoms. Cardiac damage occurred in 25 patients. In the subgroups, hsTnI was significantly higher in elder patients (&#8805; 60 years) than in the young (median [IQR], 5.2 [2.2-12.8] vs. 1.9 [1.9-6.2], p = 0.018) and was higher in men than in women (4.2 [1.9-12.8] vs. 2.9 [1.9-7.4], p = 0.018). The prevalence of increased NTproBNP was significantly higher in men than in women (32.1% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.006), but was similar between the elder and young patients (20.0% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.554). After multivariable analysis, male and hypertension were the risk factors of cardiac damage. The mortality was 4.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac damage exists in patients with the severe type of COVID-19, especially in male patients with hypertension. Clinicians should pay more attention to cardiac damage.","Li, Jing; Zhang, Yinghua; Wang, Fang; Liu, Bing; Li, Hui; Tang, Guodong; Chang, Zhigang; Liu, Aihua; Fu, Chunyi; Lv, You; Gao, Jing",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,482

479944,Effect of Lockdown due to COVID-19 on the Aerosol and Trace Gases Spatial Distribution over India and Adjoining Regions,2021,"This paper presents a three-component work. The first component sets the overall theoretical context which lies in the argument that the increasing complexity of the world has made it more difficult for International Relations (IR) to succeed both in theory and practice. The era of information and the events of the 21st century have moved IR theory and practice away from real policy making (Walt, 2016) and have made it entrenched in opinions and political theories difficult to prove. At the same time, the rise of the""Fourth Paradigm - Data Intensive Scientific Discovery""(Hey et al., 2009) and the strengthening of data science offer an alternative:""Computational International Relations""(Unver, 2018). The use of traditional and contemporary data-centered tools can help to update the field of IR by making it more relevant to reality (Koutsoupias, Mikelis, 2020). The""wedding""between Data Science and IR is no panacea though. Changes are required both in perceptions and practices. Above all, for Data Science to enter IR, the relevant data must exist. This is where the second component comes into play. I mine the CIA World Factbook which provides cross-domain data covering all countries of the world. Then, I execute various data preprocessing tasks peaking in simple machine learning which imputes missing values providing with a more complete dataset. Lastly, the third component presents various projects making use of the produced dataset in order to illustrate the relevance of Data Science to IR through practical examples. Then, ideas regarding the future development of this project are discussed in order to optimize it and ensure continuity. Overall, I hope to contribute to the""fourth paradigm""discussion in IR by providing practical examples while providing at the same time the fuel for future research.","Podiotis, Panagiotis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05640v1.pdf,482

The primary aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroprevalence rates among HCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-facing oncology HCPs working at three large UK hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing [Luminex and point-of-care (POC) tests] on two occasions 28 days apart (June-July 2020). RESULTS: In total, 434 HCPs were recruited: nurses (58.3%), doctors (21.2%), radiographers (10.4%), administrators (10.1%); 26.3% reported prior symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2. All participants were PCR negative during the study, but 18.4% were Luminex seropositive on day 1, of whom 42.5% were POC seropositive. Nurses had the highest seropositive prevalence trend (21.3%, P = 0.2). Thirty-eight per cent of seropositive HCPs reported previous SARS-CoV-2 symptoms: 1.9 times higher odds than seronegative HCPs (P = 0.01). Of 400 participants retested on day 28, 13.3% were Luminex seropositive (92.5% previously, 7.5% newly). Thirty-two per cent of initially seropositive HCPs were seronegative on day 28. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of PCR-negative patient-facing oncology HCPs, almost one in five were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive at the start of the pandemic's first wave. Our findings that one in three seropositive HCPs retested 28 days later became seronegative support regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing until widespread immunity is achieved by effective vaccination.","Favara, D M; McAdam, K; Cooke, A; Bordessa-Kelly, A; Budriunaite, I; Bossingham, S; Houghton, S; Doffinger, R; Ainsworth, N; Corrie, P G",Clin. oncol,,482
482485,How to prepare for a second wave of coronavirus,2020,"Recent measurements of spin-polarized electron collisions with halocamphor molecules have observed intriguing trends in their dissociative electron attachment (DEA) chiral asymmetries. While the differences between the DEA asymmetries of 3-bromocamphor (3BrC) and 3-iodocamphor (3IC) were consistent with the larger atomic number of iodine, the even higher chiral asymmetry reported for 10-iodocamphor (10IC) was unexpected. In fact, the helicity densities and the distances from the iodine atoms to the closest chiral centers would suggest smaller asymmetries for 10IC compared to 3IC. To better understand the observed trends, we performed electron scattering and bound state calculations, as well as Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations for the three halocamphors. Our results indicate that the DEA signals stem exclusively from halide ions produced by the fast dissociation of low-lying &#963;* anion states. While we also found dipole bound states and higher-lying shape resonances, we do not expect those states to significantly contribute to the observed yields. Despite the fact that we do not account for the spin-orbit interactions or reaction dynamics, the energies and autoionization lifetimes of the &#963;* resonances strongly support larger DEA yields for 10IC than 3BrC. The more efficient dissociation could explain the fourfold difference between the maximum DEA chiral asymmetries, since the difference in the atomic numbers of iodine and bromine only accounts for a factor of two. Additionally, our calculations suggest that the twofold difference between the DEA asymmetries of the iodocamphor isomers could be related to the partial suppression of the cross section for electron attachment to 3IC, compared to 10IC.","Ruivo, Julio Cesar; Kossoski, Fábris; Varella, Márcio T do N",PCCP.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, routine SARS-CoV-2 testing in long-term care facilities in the Province of Salzburg and centralized hospitalization in the COVID-19 unit of the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg (Austria) irrespective of symptoms was implemented. Baseline characteristics and the course of COVID-19 disease were assessed among hospitalized long-term care facility residents within the COVID-19 Registry of the Austrian Group Medical Tumor Therapy (AGMT; NCT04351529). Between the 24th of March and the 20th of April 2020, 50 COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized. The median age was 84.5 years (range: 79-88) and the median number of comorbidities and baseline medication classes was 6 (IQR: 4-7) and 5 (IQR: 3-6), respectively. At admission, 31 residents (62%) were symptomatic, nine residents (18%) pre-symptomatic whereas ten residents (20%) remained asymptomatic. The 30-day mortality rate from hospitalization was 32% and significantly higher in symptomatic residents at admission when compared to asymptomatic residents including pre-symptomatic residents (48% [95% CI: 27-63%] versus 5% [95% CI: 0-15%], p=0.006). The Early Warning Score (EWS) at admission was associated with 30-day mortality: high risk: 100%, intermediate risk: 50% (95% CI: 0-78%), and low risk: 21% (95% CI: 7-32%) (p<0.001). In light of comparably low mortality rates between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic hospitalized COVID-19-positive residents, we suggest the supply of comparable intensity and quality of monitoring and care in long-term care facilities as an alternative to immediate hospitalization upon a positive COVID-19 test in asymptomatic residents.","Huemer, Florian; Rinnerthaler, Gabriel; Jörg, Benedikt; Morre, Patrick; Stegbuchner, Birgit; Proksch, Elisabeth; Fleimisch, Stefanie; Oberkofler, Hannes; Kremser, Iris; Greil, Richard; Egle, Alexander",Geroscience,,482

We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the weighted average illusion, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer's choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misconceptions like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.","Hong, Matt-Heun; Witt, Jessica K.; Szafir, Danielle Albers",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03766v1.pdf,482

In this work, we applied selected deep learning models including multilayer perceptron, random forest, and different versions of long short-term memory (LSTM), using three data sources to train the models, including COVID-19 occurrences, basic information like coded country names, and detailed information like population, and area of different countries. The main goal is to forecast the outbreak in nine countries (Iran, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, and the USA). The performances of the models are measured using four metrics, including mean average percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R 2. The best performance was found for a modified version of LSTM, called M-LSTM (winner model), to forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic in the mentioned countries. For this purpose, we collected the data from January 22 till July 30, 2020, for training, and from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020, for the testing phase. Through experimental results, the winner model achieved reasonably accurate predictions (MAPE, RMSE, NRMSE, and R 2 are 0.509, 458.12, 0.001624, and 0.99997, respectively).

488351,Analysis and Prediction of Player Population Changes in Digital Games During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with coronary heart disease often suffer adverse psychological reactions, such as anxiety and depression. The dual-track interactive nursing model is a nursing intervention aimed to provide specific and community nursing. For patients with chronic diseases, this model can improve the patients' self-management and rehabilitation. The effect of this model on the mental health of patients with chronic diseases has been unanimously recognized by researchers. In this study, a dual-track interactive nursing model intervention was conducted on the anxiety and depression in elderly patients with coronary heart disease to verify the psychological effect of the model. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From June 2018 to June 2019, 136 elderly patients with coronary heart disease (mean age of 63.5±8.26 years) from three communities in Changsha, Hunan Province, China were selected as subjects. A total of 53 and 50 patients were identified in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The control group underwent routine longitudinal referral, whereas the intervention group was subjected to a two-track interactive nursing model intervention. The Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and related questionnaires were used to monitor and compare the two groups before and after the intervention and employed for scoring and comparative analysis. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mental health scores of the intervention group in total score, somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, and paranoia are significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). The intervention group has scored significantly higher in coping style but significantly lower in negative coping than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of the dual-track interactive nursing model intervention in the management of patients with coronary heart disease can improve the self-management and the mental health of patients with coronary heart disease.","Yang, Jiao; Hu, Hongling; Li, Yamin",Psychiatr Danub,,482

With no available vaccine, the treatment is primarily symptomatic for those affected and preventative for those at risk. Most countries have taken action to curtail the spread of COVID-19 through measures such as lockdowns, social distancing and voluntary self-isolation. Whilst necessary, such measures and the disease itself, may have an adverse impact on mental health. In view of research from previous pandemic crises, it is known that such situations are likely to increase stress levels and have negative psychiatric effects. The impact is likely to be felt by the general public, sufferers of COVID-19, their families and friends, persons with pre-existing mental health conditions and healthcare workers.","Haider, Imran Ijaz; Tiwana, Farah; Tahir, Sania Mumtaz",Pak.

490076,Successful Online Learning Experience: Perceptions of Chinese Undergraduate Students,2021,"Background Across the globe, elective surgeries have been postponed to limit infectious exposure and preserve hospital capacity for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the ramp down in cardiac surgery volumes may result in unintended harm to patients who are at high risk of mortality if their conditions are left untreated. To help optimize triage decisions, we derived and ambispectively validated a clinical score to predict intensive care unit length of stay after cardiac surgery. Methods and Results Following ethics approval, we derived and performed multicenter valida tion of clinical models to predict the likelihood of short (&#8804;2 days) and prolonged intensive care unit length of stay (&#8805;7 days) in patients aged &#8805;18 years, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or aortic, mitral, and tricuspid value surgery in Ontario, Canada. Multivariable logistic regression with backward variable selection was used, along with clinical judgment, in the modeling process. For the model that predicted short intensive care unit stay, the c-statistic was 0.78 in the derivation cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. For the model that predicted prolonged stay, c-statistic was 0.85 in the derivation and 0.78 in the validation cohort. The models, together termed the CardiOttawa LOS Score, demonstrated a high degree of accuracy during prospective testing. Conclusions Clinical judgment alone has been shown to be inaccurate in predicting postoperative intensive care unit length of stay. The CardiOttawa LOS Score performed well in prospective validation and will complement the clinician's gestalt in making more efficient resource allocation during the COVID-19 period and beyond.","Sun, Louise Y; Bader Eddeen, Anan; Ruel, Marc; MacPhee, Erika; Mesana, Thierry G",J Am Heart Assoc,,482

Although South Korea reduced the number of newly confirmed cases and is on the way to stabilizing the situation with its disease prevention policies, problems remain. The main issue is the reconfirmation of the virus after recovery. South Korean experts believe the reconfirmed cases are caused by reactivation of the virus inside the patients' body, rather than by virus reinfection after recovery. When considering reconfirmed COVID-19 cases, it is important to keep social distancing even after treating the infection. Despite no cases of reconfirmed patients infecting others having been reported yet, reexamination of patients after recovery is thought to be pivotal to prevent reactivation.","Kang, Yun-Jung; Joo, Hyunjoo",J.

In the light of intersecting inequalities such as class, race/ethnicity and gender, an explosion of Sinophobia, social stigma and physical attacks targeting people of East Asian and Southeast Asian appearance or heritage has been widely reported in Euro-American media. This article will focus on the case of Italy during the initial stage of the pandemic in early 2020. Italy has not only been the first European country to be exposed to the pandemic and to undergo national lockdown but also a country where the wave of racist assaults started in late January 2020, even before the first clusters have been detected. The critical investigation of Italian media discourses will highlight how deep-rooted, colonialist and ambivalent assumptions about the ?Oriental?, ?Asian?, ?Chinese? and ?yellow? other may have been crucial to the reproduction of racism against specific people, cultures and civilizations, regardless of nationality, class and gender. It will refer in particular to the concept of ?yellowness?, resulting from a process of bio-cultural racialization within the hegemonic frame of ?Western?, ?White? or ?Italian? identity. Furthermore, it will indicate how this process of racialized othering has emerged, but has also been contested, within the specific context of citizenship, Asian immigrants and governmental actions in contemporary Italy. The overall aim is not so much to denounce higher levels of racism in Italy compared to other Euro-American countries;rather, this article refers to the Italian case to stress how both global and local trajectories do mutually overlap to shape, and eventually to transform, a national context, offering further insights on the glo-calization of the civilizational ?West?/?East? divide in the 21st century.","Miyake, Toshio",Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism,,482

A study was carried out, which was based on interviewing university students and workers in professional environments. Therefore, it is crucial to have a booking system for meeting rooms that allows the meeting attendees to get information about the sanitization status of the meeting rooms they would attend meeting in. To help prevent the fear of attending meetings, a web-interface was developed to give the users the necessary information that would enhance their sense of safety. The system was evaluated in a qualitative approach where students and professionals were asked to provide feedback. The evaluation results showed a considerable increase in people’s confidence and comfort to attend meetings in meeting rooms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sarwar, H.

Here, we report the detection of variants within the genome of these strains. Pairwise alignment analysis using blastx was performed between these sequences and the UniProtKB data for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to identify amino acid variations. Variants analysis was performed using multiple Bioinformatics tools. We noticed for the first time 18 mutations that have never been reported before. Among those, a frame shift (8651A>) in NSP4, a stop codon 6887A > T in NSP3 and two missense mutations in spike S2 were found. In addition, we found 28 variants in ORF1ab alone. A previously reported variant, 23403A > G, in the spike protein S2 was mostly seen. Two other known mutations 25563G > T in ORF3a and 14408C > T in ORF1ab were detected respectively in 6 and 8 out of the 11 isolates.

However, good recognizers would be distinguished, not only by the number of faces they discriminate but also by the number of rejected stimuli as unfamiliar. When it comes to face recognition, it is important to remember that position, to some extent, would not entail a high cognitive cost, unlike other processes in similar areas of the brain. The aim of this paper was to examine participant's recognition profiles according to face position. For this reason, a recognition task was carried out by employing the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces. Reaction times and accuracy were employed as dependent variables and a cluster analysis was carried out. A total of two profiles were identified in participants' performance, which differ in position in terms of reaction times but not accuracy. The results can be described as follows: first, it is possible to identify performance profiles in visual recognition of faces that differ in position in terms of reaction times, not accuracy; secondly, results suggest a bias towards the left. At the applied level, this could be of interest with a view to conducting training programs in face recognition.","Moret-Tatay, Carmen; Baixauli-Fortea, Inmaculada; Grau-Sevilla, M Dolores",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,482

Hypertension, as the most common comorbidity for patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has resulted in cases with more severe symptoms and higher mortality. The risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension are unknown. Methods. All the available and confirmed patients with COVID-19 from February 3 to March 10, 2020, were enrolled from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, radiological assessments, and treatments on admission were extracted and compared. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 in patients with hypertension and the severity of the cohort. Results. A total of 430 available patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study, including 151 eligible patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. After PSM analysis, 141 patients without hypertension and 141 cases with hypertension were well matched. Compared with cases without hypertension, patients with hypertension were more severe (28.4% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that neutrophil count (OR: 1.471;p = 0.001), coronary heart disease (OR: 5.281;p = 0.011), and the level of K+ (OR: 0.273;p &lt; 0.001) were associated with patients with hypertension. In addition, the percentage of pulmonary infection volume was larger in cases with hypertension (4.55 vs. 5.8, p = 0.017) and was a high risk factor for severe COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (OR: 1.084;p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion. On admission, coronary heart disease, neutrophil count, and the level of K+ were associated with COVID-19 patients with hypertension. The percentage of the pulmonary infection volume was significantly larger in COVID-19 patients with hypertension and was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity of the cohort.

To analyze how governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in these six Latin American countries, we use an index of government response, created by the University of Oxford. To explore the effects of these governmental mitigation policies on reducing social mobility, we use Google mobility reports. We also analyze how these policies may have influenced COVID-19 mortality rates. Overall, the results showed that both timelier and more stringent implementation of the public policies analyzed to address the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be associated with higher mobility reductions and lower mortality rates. We draw five policy lessons from the way each country implemented these mitigation policies. KEY MESSAGE: Timelier and more stringent implementation of these public policies may contribute to a higher mobility reduction in several public spaces and to lower mortality rates. The effectiveness of the closure and containment policies in each Latin American country seem to depend on the degree of compliance of their respective populations and to their socioeconomic living conditions. Economic and social policies of income support and debt relief provided by governments allowed people to comply with closure and containment policies. Health systems should maintain high levels of policy stringency together with effective surveillance through testing policy and contact tracing.","Martinez-Valle, Adolfo",J Public Health Policy,,482

500595,Creative tourism development models towards sustainable and regenerative tourism,2021,"Opioid overdose deaths continue to rise with fatalities involving synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its derivatives, increasing sharply in 2020 and accelerating further during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many lives have been saved by administering naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression, the fatal effect of opioids;however, these effects of fentanyl derivatives are reportedly more difficult to reverse with naloxone than those of other opioids like heroin. The current study examined the ability of naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression produced by fentanyl and 2 of its derivatives. Minute volume (VE) was measured using head plethysmography in 4 rhesus monkeys breathing air. On separate occasions, monkeys received saline or naloxone (0.032 mg/kg) 30 min after administration of the smallest dose of fentanyl, 3-methylfentanyl or carfentanil that decreased VE to &lt;70% of control. Fentanyl and its derivatives dose-dependently decreased ventilation, although their potency varied markedly;carfentanil was 10-fold more potent than 3-methylfentanyl and 100-fold more potent than fentanyl. For each opioid, the dose that decreased VE varied slightly across individual monkeys (fentanyl: 17.8-56 µg/kg;3-methylfentanyl: 3.2-5.6 µg/kg;carfentanil: 0.32-0.56 µg/kg), although those doses reliably decreased ventilation within 30 min such that VE ranged from 57-63% of control. Ventilatory depression was evident for at least 90 min. Naloxone reversed the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl with the mean VE increasing to 112% and 120% of control, respectively, within 15 min;however, this attenuation by naloxone did not last long, beginning to wane 30 min after its administration. In contrast, naloxone was not as effective in reversing the ventilatory-depressant effects of carfentanil;VE was &lt;70% of control 15 min after naloxone and remained &lt;90% at all time points. Thus, reversal of the ventilatory-depressant effects of fentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl was similar to each other and to that obtained previously with heroin, supporting the effectiveness of naloxone in attenuating ventilatory depression involving these opioids. Differences between carfentanil and pharmacologically equivalent doses of other opioids suggest that naloxone is not equally potent, and might not be equally effective, in reversing all opioids and underscores the importance of developing novel treatment options for opioid overdose.","Gerak, Lisa France Charles",The FASEB Journal,,482

Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remain understudied. METHODS: We used a multicenter federated research network to compare clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SOT to a propensity--matched cohort of patients without SOT. RESULTS: We identified 2307 SOT recipients and 231 047 nontransplant patients with COVID-19. Transplant patients were more likely to be male individuals, older, have a body mass index >30 kg/m2, and have comorbid hypertension, diabetes, nicotine dependence, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease compared with the nontransplant group (P < 0.05). One-to-one matching was performed for diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, race, nicotine dependence, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and gender. There was no difference in the composite outcome of intubation or mechanical ventilation at 30 days (risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.26) or 60 days (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.24) between the 2 groups. Hospitalization rate was higher in the transplant cohort (30.97% versus 25.47%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.34). There was no difference in mortality at 30 days (6.45% versus 5.29%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.88-1.68) or 60 days postdiagnosis (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.83-1.32). More patients in the SOT group developed acute renal injury compared with non-SOT cohort (24.73% versus 14.29%; RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.53-1.96). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SOT have high COVID-19-related mortality; however, propensity-matched analyses reveal that this increased risk is secondary to higher burden of comorbidities. SOT status independently increases risk of hospital admission and acute kidney injury.","Hadi, Yousaf B; Naqvi, Syeda F Z; Kupec, Justin T; Sofka, Sarah; Sarwari, Arif",Transplantation,,482

505516,Covid 19 lockdown-air quality reflections in Indian cities,2021,"background Healthcare workers fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous pressure, which puts them at an increased risk of developing psychological problems. Aims This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis. Methods A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems. results The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively. The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems. In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems. Conclusions Psychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems. The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.","Que, Jianyu; Shi, Le; Deng, Jiahui; Liu, Jiajia; Zhang, Li; Wu, Suying; Gong, Yimiao; Huang, Weizhen; Yuan, Kai; Yan, Wei; Sun, Yankun; Ran, Maosheng; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin",General Psychiatry,,482

How might it energise young students with images that empower them to develop a prophetic stance towards their future and the future of humanity? We first consider the need for a paradigm shift in the way we tell the Christian Story Then, taking our lead from the theology of Karl Rahner which allows us to take a cosmic view of Christian religious experience, and from various writers who apply such a view to different areas of Christian life, we attempt a synthesis of current theological thought Lastly, we suggest how this shift might be applied to the religious education curriculum in order to provide an answer to the questions posed above","Faller, Paul",Journal of Religious Education,,482

508138,Hands-On Approaches to Education during a Pandemic,2021,"Audio signals generated by the human body (e.g., sighs, breathing, heart, digestion, vibration sounds) have routinely been used by clinicians as diagnostic or progression indicators for diseases and disease onset. However, until recently, such signals were usually collected through manual auscultation at scheduled visits. Research has now started to use digital technology to gather bodily sounds (e.g., from digital stethoscopes) for cardiovascular or respiratory examination, which could then be used for automatic analysis. Some initial work shows promise in detecting diagnostic signals of COVID-19 from voice and coughs. In this paper we describe our data analysis over a large-scale crowdsourced dataset of respiratory sounds collected to aid diagnosis of COVID-19. We use coughs and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Our results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. We also show how we distinguish a user who tested positive for COVID-19 and has a cough from a healthy user with cough, and users who tested positive for COVID-19 and have a cough from users with asthma and a cough. Our models achieve an AUC above 70% across all tasks. Clearly these results are preliminary and only scratch the surface of the possibilities of the exploitation of this type of data and audio-based machine learning. This work opens the door to further investigation of how automatically analysed respiratory patterns could be used as pre-screening signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis.","Brown, Chloe; Chauhan, Jagmohan; Grammenos, Andreas; Han, Jing; Hasthanasombat, Apinan; Spathis, Dimitris; Xia, Tong; Cicuta, Pietro; Mascolo, Cecilia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05919v1.pdf,482

Immunothrombosis has recently been demonstrated to contribute to the thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy. As the primary components of immunothrombosis, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) could be induced by complement cascade components and other proinflammatory mediators. We aimed to explore the clinical roles of NETs and the regulation of complement on the NET formation in COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited 135 COVID-19 patients and measured plasma levels of C5, C3, cell-free DNA and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA. Besides, the formation of NETs was detected by immunofluorescent staining and the cytotoxicity to vascular endothelial HUVEC cells was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: We found that the plasma levels of complements C3 and MPO-DNA were positively related to coagulation indicator fibrin(-ogen) degradation products (C3: r = 0.300, p = 0.005; MPO-DNA: r = 0.316, p = 0.002) in COVID-19 patients. Besides, C3 was positively related to direct bilirubin (r = 0.303, p = 0.004) and total bilirubin (r = 0.304, p = 0.005), MPO-DNA was positively related to lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.306, p = 0.003) and creatine kinase (r = 0.308, p = 0.004). By using anti-C3a and anti-C5a antibodies, we revealed that the complement component anaphylatoxins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients strongly induced NET formation. The pathological effect of the anaphylatoxin-NET axis on the damage of vascular endothelial cells could be relieved by recombinant carboxypeptidase B (CPB), a stable homolog of enzyme CPB2 which can degrade anaphylatoxins to inactive products. CONCLUSIONS: Over-activation in anaphylatoxin-NET axis plays a pathological role in COVID-19. Early intervention in anaphylatoxins might help prevent thrombosis and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yue; Han, Kai; Du, Chunjing; Li, Rui; Liu, Jingyuan; Zeng, Hui; Zhu, Liuluan; Li, Ang",Crit Care,,482

Methods: The federal Area Health Resource File was used to assess system capacity and critical care-related resources and COVID-19-related risk factors at the county level. Data were described with summary statistics, cross-tabulations, and bivariate tests to discern differences across county rurality categories (2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes). Results: Kansas has 105 counties. Metropolitan counties had an average of 1.5 physicians (M.D. or D.O., any specialty) per 1,000 people, while rural counties had 0.8. A total of 63.5% of rural counties had no anesthesia providers and 100.0% of rural counties had no pulmonary disease physicians. While 96 counties have at least one hospital, nearly 90% rural counties had no intensive care unit (ICU) services. The percent of the population estimated to be over 65 was higher among rural counties (24.2%) than metropolitan counties (19.3%). On average, rural counties had nearly twice as many deaths per 1,000 people by cardiovascular disease and more chronic obstructive pulmonary disease deaths than metropolitan and nonmetropolitan/urban adjacent counties. Conclusions: Kansas faced limited ICU capabilities and physician workforce shortages in rural counties, both in primary care and specialties such as anesthesia and pulmonology. In addition, nonmetropolitan/urban adjacent and rural population age structures and mortality rates potentially demonstrated an increased risk to overwhelm local healthcare systems. This may have serious implications for rural health, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Berland, H.; Hughes, D.",Kansas Journal of Medicine,,482

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. This included patients hospitalised with pneumonia and investigated for suspected PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from 1 March 2020 to 17 May 2020; controls were patients with CAP from 5 July 2019 to 31 January 2020. The primary outcome was to determine the risk of developing PE in both groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for PE. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were included; 72 cases (47% male; mean age 59 (±15) years), and 72 controls (56% male; mean age 58 (±20) years). PE was diagnosed in 23.6% of the cases versus 6.9% of the controls. The adjusted odds ratio for PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with those with CAP was 3.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-10.04, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The odds of developing PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are three-times higher than in those with CAP. The results provide a quantitative assessment of the risk of PE in COVID-19 pneumonia, a condition new to healthcare, compared to other forms of pneumonia with a well-established scientific basis.","El-Sayed, M S; Jones, T A",Clin. radiol,,482

COVID-19 cases may be misdiagnosed as dengue, particularly when relying on DENV IgM, which can remain positive months after infection. To estimate the extent of this problem, we evaluated sera from 42 confirmed COVID-19 patients for evidence of DENV infection. No cases of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV coinfection were identified. However, recent DENV infection, indicated by the presence of DENV IgM and/or high level of IgG antibodies, was found in seven patients. Dengue virus IgM and/or high IgG titer should not exclude COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is appropriate when dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) or RT-PCR is negative.

No significant differences were found in SDQ-S scores between these groups. CONCLUSION: Key findings suggest that level of parental stress and behavioral concerns were significantly influenced by diagnoses, and partly by gender and presence of developmental delay. Thus, psychosocial support may need to be tailored based on these findings to provide optimum quality of care for patients and families.","Judd-Glossy, Laura; Ariefdjohan, Merlin; Ketzer, Jill; Curry, Stefanie; Schletker, Julie; Edmonds, Tiffany; Krause, Amy; Simmons, Hope; Pena, Alberto; De La Torre, Luis; Bischoff, Andrea",Pediatr. surg. int,,482

METHODS: We collected data published day by daily from the first COVID-19 case until May 3, 2020, the end of lockdown, by Italy's Protezione Civile Department. Linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate possible correlations between the number of confirmed cases/100.000 residents and the number of new cases/100.000/day before lockdown, with the number of deaths/100.000 residents at sixty days, in each Italian region. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between the number of confirmed cases before lockdown and mortality up to sixty days (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.57) as well as between the incidence rate of new cases per day and mortality up to sixty days (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.73). Regression coefficients indicated about two deaths up to sixty days for every new patient with confirmed COVID-19 before lockdown, and 37 deaths for every new infected subject per day until the lockdown decree of March 9, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Every new infected subject before lockdown counted on the death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Ciccarelli, Michele; Carrizzo, Albino; Vecchione, Carmine; Galasso, Gennaro",Int J Infect Dis,,482
515445,Opportunity in crisis: The role of universal design for learning in educational redesign,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide and the pandemic has yet to wane. Despite its associated significant morbidity and mortality, there are no definitive cures and no fully preventative measures to combat SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the urgency to identify the pathobiological mechanisms underlying increased risk for and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mounting. One contributing factor, the accumulation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, is a leading trigger for the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the IRF (interferon regulatory factors), such as IRF7. Activation of these pathways, particularly in the lung and other organs, such as the heart, contributes to a burst of cytokine release, which predisposes to significant tissue damage, loss of function, and mortality. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds damage-associated molecular patterns is expressed in the lung and heart, and in priming organs, such as the blood vessels (in diabetes) and adipose tissue (in obesity), and transduces the pathological signals emitted by damage-associated molecular patterns. It is proposed that damage-associated molecular pattern-RAGE enrichment in these priming tissues, and in the lungs and heart during active infection, contributes to the widespread tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the RAGE axis might play seminal roles in and be a target for therapeutic intervention in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Roy, Divya; Ramasamy, Ravichandran; Schmidt, Ann Marie",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,,482

516279,Critical success factors for food tourism destinations: A socio-cultural perspective,2020,"Policy makers have implemented multiple non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 worldwide crisis. Interventions had the aim of reducing close proximity interactions, which drive the spread of the disease. A deeper knowledge of human physical interactions has revealed necessary, especially in all settings involving children, whose education and gathering activities should be preserved. Despite their relevance, almost no data are available on close proximity contacts among children in schools or other educational settings during the pandemic. Contact data are usually gathered via Bluetooth, which nonetheless offers a low temporal and spatial resolution. Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) radios emerged as a more accurate alternative that nonetheless exhibits a significantly higher energy consumption, limiting in-field studies. In this paper, we leverage a novel approach, embodied by the Janus system that combines these radios by exploiting their complementary benefits. The very accurate proximity data gathered in-field by Janus, once augmented with several metadata, unlocks unprecedented levels of information, enabling the development of novel multi-level risk analyses. By means of this technology, we have collected real contact data of children and educators in three summer camps during summer 2020 in the province of Trento, Italy. The wide variety of performed daily activities induced multiple individual behaviors, allowing a rich investigation of social environments from the contagion risk perspective. We consider risk based on duration and proximity of contacts and classify interactions according to different risk levels. We can then evaluate the summer camps' organization, observe the effect of partition in small groups, or social bubbles, and identify the organized activities that mitigate the riskier behaviors.

This paper presents the spatial differentiation in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths during the full year (March 2020-March 2021) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Poland versus green-blue spaces (green-i.a. forests, orchards, meadows and pastures, recreational and rest areas, biologically active arable land; blue-lakes and artificial water reservoirs, rivers, ecological areas and internal waters) and population density. The analysis covers 380 counties, including 66 cities. This study used daily reports on the progress of the pandemic in Poland published by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland and unique, detailed data on 24 types of land use available in the Statistics Poland database. Statistical relationships were determined between the above-mentioned environmental variables and the variables characterizing COVID-19 (cases and deaths). Various basic types of regression models were analysed. The optimal model was selected, and the determination coefficient, significance level and the values of the parameters of these relationships, together with the estimation error, were calculated. The obtained results indicated that the higher the number of green-blue spaces in individual counties, the lower the total number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. These relationships were described by logarithmic and homographic models. In turn, an increase in the population density caused an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the power model. These results can be used in the current analysis of the spread of the pandemic, including the location of potential outbreaks. In turn, the developed models can be used as a tool in forecasting the development of the pandemic and making decisions about the implementation of preventive measures.","Ciupa, Tadeusz; Suligowski, Roman",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,482

With a particular focus on distributional outcomes, two simulations are run, a mild and a severe scenario. The findings show significant evidence of decline in economic growth and employment, with the decline harsher for the severe scenario. The microeconomic results show that the pandemic moves the income distribution curve such that more households fall under the poverty line while at the same time, inequality declines. The latter result is driven by the disproportionate decline in incomes of richer households while the poorest of the poor are cushioned by government social grants that are kept intact during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding and its economic modelling as well as the data used to operationalise the model will need to be updated and improved upon as more information about the disease and the economy becomes available.","Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret; Henseler, Martin; Mabugu, Ramos; Maisonnave, Hélène",,,482

METHODS: Primary care givers of children with CF and PCD aged 3-16 years were asked to enrol in the study. Primary care givers of TD children were included as control group. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) was used, and questions related to sleep habits during the pandemic were asked. Results of the three groups were compared. RESULTS: Primary care givers of 33 children with CF, 16 children with PCD and 66 TD children were included in the study. There were no differences in terms of age and gender between the three groups. Changes in sleep patterns during the pandemic were more common among TD children and their families, with 75% of the children and 80% of their families sleeping later than before. The sleep initiation and maintenance disorder scores were higher in TD children (P = 0.001), whereas the sleep breathing disorder scores were higher in children with PCD (P = 0.001), and the sleep hyperhidrosis scores were higher in children with CF and PCD (P = 0.011). No relationships were found between sleep parameters and clinical findings of children with lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: Children's sleep habits have changed during the pandemic. Children with chronic lung diseases and even TD children may experience sleep disturbances during this period.","Sismanlar Eyuboglu, Tugba; Aslan, Ayse Tana; Ramasli Gursoy, Tugba; Asfuroglu, Pelin; Soysal, Azime Sebnem; Yapar, Dilek; Ilhan, Mustafa Necmi",J. paediatr. child health,,482

To obtain a better understanding of the metabolism of cities and directions for urban planning interventions, this paper offers empirical evidence on the association between the diversity and density of urban functions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, using a robust density index that was determined via a Monte Carlo simulation. By conducting association analyses, it was found that highly dense station areas tended to display low diversity at multiple scales. Further investigation indicated that this negative correlation was owing to different spatial characteristics of functions and complementary functioning among highly accessible station areas. This paper argues for considering both diversity and density in urban planning to make station areas vibrant and resilient.","Kumakoshi, Yusuke; Koizumi, Hideki; Yoshimura, Yuji",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12107v1.pdf,482

In this study, we searched for diagnostic studies from the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases to calculate the pooled diagnostic accuracy measures using bivariate random-effects model meta-analysis. As a result, 22 from a total of 1613 articles, including 2282 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 1485 healthy persons or patients without SARS-CoV-2, were selected for a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of the summary receiver operator curve (SROC) were: (a) 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.90), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and (b) 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65-0.81), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97) for IgM. A subgroup analysis among detection methods indicated the sensitivity of IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were slightly lower than those using gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (P > .05). These results showed that the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM had high diagnostic efficiency to assist the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study aimed to systematically compare the degree of face shield contamination between endoscopists who performed EGD on patients lying in the left lateral decubitus (LL) and prone positions. METHODS: This is a randomized trial in patients scheduled for EGD between April and June 2020. Eligible 212 patients were randomized with 1:1 allocation. Rapid adenosine triphosphate test was used to determine contamination level using relative light units of greater than 200 as a cutoff value. All eligible patients were randomized to lie in either the LL or prone position during EGD. The primary outcome was the rate of contamination on the endoscopist's face shield. RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (63%), with a mean age of 60 ± 13 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. There was no face shield contamination after EGD in either group. The number of coughs in the LL group was higher than the prone group (1.38 ± 1.8 vs 0.89 ± 1.4, P = 0.03). The mean differences in relative light units on the face shield before and after EGD in the LL and prone groups were 9.9 ± 20.9 and 4.1 ± 6 (P = 0.008), respectively. CONCLUSION: As measured by the adenosine triphosphate test, performing diagnostic EGD does not lead to contamination on the face shield of the endoscopist. However, placing patients in the prone position may further mitigate the risk.","Pittayanon, Rapat; Faknak, Natee; Ananchuensook, Prooksa; Prasoppokakorn, Thaninee; Plai‐dum, Suppawatsa; Thummongkhol, Tiwaporn; Paitoonpong, Leilani; Rerknimitr, Rungsun",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506983/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15416,482

However, the analysis identifies some countries with greater and some with lesser levels of maturity in capacity building than expected only on the basis of their development and scale of Internet use. Further research focused on the dynamics of under- and over-performance of different nations might illuminate where regional contexts could place a brake on, or provide an impetus for, under- or over-performance in cybersecurity capacity building.

Identifying the precise parasite antigens that mediate immunity is essential for vaccine design, but has proved difficult. Completion of the Plasmodium falciparum genome revealed thousands of potential vaccine candidates, but a significant bottleneck remains in their validation and prioritization for further evaluation in clinical trials. Focusing initially on the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite proteome, we used peer-reviewed publications, multiple proteomic and bioinformatic approaches, to select and prioritize potential immune targets. We expressed 109 P. falciparum recombinant proteins, the majority of which were obtained using a mammalian expression system that has been shown to produce biologically functional extracellular proteins, and used them to create KILchip v1.0: a novel protein microarray to facilitate high-throughput multiplexed antibody detection from individual samples. The microarray assay was highly specific; antibodies against P. falciparum proteins were detected exclusively in sera from malaria-exposed but not malaria-naïve individuals. The intensity of antibody reactivity varied as expected from strong to weak across well-studied antigens such as AMA1 and RH5 (Kruskal–Wallis H test for trend: p < 0.0001). The inter-assay and intra-assay variability was minimal, with reproducible results obtained in re-assays using the same chip over a duration of 3 months. Antibodies quantified using the multiplexed format in KILchip v1.0 were highly correlated with those measured in the gold-standard monoplex ELISA [median (range) Spearman's R of 0.84 (0.65–0.95)]. KILchip v1.0 is a robust, scalable and adaptable protein microarray that has broad applicability to studies of naturally acquired immunity against malaria by providing a standardized tool for the detection of antibody correlates of protection. It will facilitate rapid high-throughput validation and prioritization of potential Plasmodium falciparum merozoite-stage antigens paving the way for urgently needed clinical trials for the next generation of malaria vaccines.","Kamuyu, Gathoni; Tuju, James; Kimathi, Rinter; Mwai, Kennedy; Mburu, James; Kibinge, Nelson; Chong Kwan, Marisa; Hawkings, Sam; Yaa, Reuben; Chepsat, Emily; Njunge, James M.; Chege, Timothy; Guleid, Fatuma; Rosenkranz, Micha; Kariuki, Christopher K.; Frank, Roland; Kinyanjui, Samson M.; Murungi, Linda M.; Bejon, Philip; Färnert, Anna; Tetteh, Kevin K.

Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, other manifestations, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, and immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, have been described. We present a case of a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab with a marked biochemical improvement. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present a Caucasian patient with COVID-19 who developed a marked elevation of inflammatory parameters with ferritin 36,023 μg/L, but also elevated C-reactive protein 334 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L, 1 week after admission to the intensive care unit. He met five of eight criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but he lacked the high fever and cytopenia seen in the majority of cases. He was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, and over the next days, a rapid decrease in ferritin and C-reactive protein levels was observed. However, his respiratory failure only improved gradually, and he was weaned off the respirator 11 days later. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may induce a hyperinflammatory clinical picture and in some cases develop into hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In our patient’s case, therapeutic interleukin-6 blockade abrogated signs of hyperinflammation but did not seem to improve pulmonary function. Measurement of ferritin and C-reactive protein, as well as quantification of interleukin-6 on indication, should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19. Specific treatment in such patients must also be contemplated, preferably in randomized controlled trials.","Tholin, Birgitte; Hauge, Marit Teigen; Aukrust, Pål; Fehrle, Lutz; Tvedt, Tor Henrik",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054818/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-020-02503-9,482

However, information on longer-term clinical sequelae following acute COVID-19 is emerging. We followed a group of persons with COVID-19 in Zambia at two months to assess persistent symptoms. Methods In September 2020, we re-contacted participants from SARS-CoV-2 prevalence studies conducted in Zambia in July 2020 whose PCR tests were positive. Participants with valid contact information were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that captured demographics, pre-existing conditions, and types and duration of symptoms. We describe the frequency and duration of reported symptoms and used chi-square tests to explore variability of symptoms by age group, gender, and underlying conditions. Results Of 302 participants, 155 (51%) reported one or more acute COVID-19-related symptoms in July 2020. Cough (50%), rhinorrhoea (36%) and headache (34%) were the most frequently reported symptoms proximal to diagnosis. The median symptom duration was 7 days (IQR: 3-9 days). At a median follow up of 54 days (IQR: 46-59 day), 27 (17%) symptomatic participants had not yet returned to their pre-COVID-19 health status. These participants most commonly reported cough (37%), headache (26%) and chest pain (22%). Age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions were not associated with persistent symptoms. Conclusion A notable percentage of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in July still had symptoms nearly two months after their diagnosis.

614683,Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (Edition 6),2020-05-08,"Antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 slowly wane over time. Here, we examined how time affects antibody potency. To assess the impact of antibody maturation on durable neutralizing activity against original SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOCs), we analyzed receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG antibodies in convalescent plasma taken 1–10 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Longitudinal evaluation of total RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody revealed declining total antibody titers but improved neutralization potency per antibody to original SARS-CoV-2, indicative of antibody response maturation. Neutralization assays with authentic viruses revealed that early antibodies capable of neutralizing original SARS-CoV-2 had limited reactivity toward B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and P.1 (501Y.V3) variants. Antibodies from late convalescents exhibited increased neutralization potency to VOCs, suggesting persistence of cross-neutralizing antibodies in plasma. Thus, maturation of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 potentiates cross-neutralizing ability to circulating variants, suggesting that declining antibody titers may not be indicative of declining protection.","Moriyama, Saya; Adachi, Yu; Sato, Takashi; Tonouchi, Keisuke; Sun, Lin; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Yamada, Souichi; Kinoshita, Hitomi; Nojima, Kiyoko; Kanno, Takayuki; Tobiume, Minoru; Ishijima, Keita; Kuroda, Yudai; Park, Eun-Sil; Onodera, Taishi; Matsumura, Takayuki; Takano, Tomohiro; Terahara, Kazutaka; Isogawa, Masanori; Nishiyama, Ayae; Kawana-Tachikawa, Ai; Shinkai, Masaharu; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Nakamura, Shigeki; Okai, Takahiro; Okuma, Kazu; Matano, Tetsuro; Fujimoto, Tsuguto; Maeda, Ken; Ohnishi, Makoto; Wakita, Takaji; Suzuki, Tadaki; Takahashi, Yoshimasa",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321002594; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321002594?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.06.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246326/,482

NHLs are associated with disease- and treatment-related immunodeficiencies which may generate unusual COVID-19 dynamics and pose unique management challenges. We report the unusual clinical course of COVID-19 in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) exposed to nine doses of Rituximab shortly before infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He had a prolonged asymptomatic phase, with negative molecular and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2, followed by a rapidly progressive evolution to severe COVID-19. Despite detection of viral RNA overlapped with first symptoms occurrence, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed an asynchronous pattern, with IgG first appearing 2 days after RNA positivity and IgM never being detected throughout the entire clinical course. While disease-associated immune derangements and/or previous treatments involving anti-CD20 antibodies might have contributed to COVID-19 dynamics in our patient, data suggests that antibody testings, without concurrent molecular assessment for SARS-CoV-2, may turn inadequate for monitoring of MCL patients, and in general NHL patients heavily exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies, during the current pandemics. We suggest that repeated molecular testing of nasopharyngeal swab should be implemented in these subjects despite a negative serology and absence of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the same reasons, a customized strategy needs to be developed for patients exposed to anti-CD20 antibodies, based on different features and mechanism of action of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and novel vaccinomics developments.","Marcacci, Gianpaolo; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Volzone, Francesco; Falcone, Umberto; Parrella, Roberto; Donnarumma, Daniela; D’Ovidio, Silvia; Annunziata, Anna; Micallo, Giovanni; Portella, Giuseppe; De Chiara, Annarosaria; De Filippi, Rosaria; Crisci, Stefania; Pinto, Antonio",Infect Agent Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13027-021-00376-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078415/,482

The model predicts nonlinear market depth and the result that small shocks to fundamentals (e.g., supply or informational shocks) can cause abrupt price movements. We demonstrate that short-sale constraints intensify asset price collapses relative to upward movements. The model also generates contagion between uncorrelated assets. These results are consistent with the main puzzling features observed during market crashes, namely abrupt and asymmetric price movements that are not driven by major news events but coupled with a spillover effect between unrelated markets.","Ouzan, Samuel",Econ Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2020.06.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264999319319315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834333/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999319319315?v=s5,482

Moreover, the gut–brain axis can be altered by several factors such as diet, lifestyle, infections, and antibiotic treatment. Diet alterations generate gut dysbiosis, which affects immune system responses, inflammation mechanisms, the intestinal permeability, as well as the production of short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters by gut microbiota, which are essential to the correct function of neurological processes. Recent studies indicated that patients with generalized anxiety or eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders) show a specific profile of gut microbiota, and this imbalance can be partially restored after a single or multi-strain probiotic supplementation.

There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020. RESULTS: A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. CONCLUSION: In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment. ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.","Takhar, Arunjit; Walker, Abigail; Tricklebank, Stephen; Wyncoll, Duncan; Hart, Nicholas; Jacob, Tony; Arora, Asit; Skilbeck, Christopher; Simo, Ricard; Surda, Pavol",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-05993-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314050/,482

Ideally, field-deployable non-invasive, sensitive techniques are required to detect low viral load exposures among asymptomatic children. We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody conversion by high-throughput Luminex assays in saliva samples collected weekly in 1,509 children and 396 adults in 22 Summer schools and 2 pre-schools in 27 venues in Barcelona, Spain, from June 29th to July 31st 2020, between the first and second COVID-19 pandemic waves. Saliva antibody conversion defined as ≥4-fold increase in IgM, IgA and/or IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens between two visits over a 5-week period was 3.22% (49/1518), or 2.36% if accounting for potentially cross-reactive antibodies, six times higher than the cumulative infection rate (0.53%) by weekly saliva RT-PCR screening. IgG conversion was higher in adults (2.94%, 11/374) than children (1.31%, 15/1144) (p=0.035), IgG and IgA levels moderately increased with age, and antibodies were higher in females. Most antibody converters increased both IgG and IgA antibodies but some augmented either IgG or IgA, with a faster decay over time for IgA than IgG. Nucleocapsid rather than spike was the main antigen target. Anti-spike antibodies were significantly higher in individuals not reporting symptoms than symptomatic individuals, suggesting a protective role against COVID-19. To conclude, saliva antibody profiling including three isotypes and multiplexing antigens is a useful and more user-friendly tool for screening pediatric populations to determine SARS-CoV-2 exposure and guide public health policies during pandemics.","Dobaño, Carlota; Alonso, Selena; Fernández de Sevilla, Mariona; Vidal, Marta; Jiménez, Alfons; Tomas, Gemma Pons; Jairoce, Chenjerai; Melé Casas, María; Rubio, Rocío; Hernández García, María; Ruiz-Olalla, Gemma; Girona-Alarcón, Mònica; Barrios, Diana; Santano, Rebeca; Mitchell, Robert A.; Puyol, Laura; Mayer, Leonie; Chi, Jordi; Melero, Natalia Rodrigo; Carolis, Carlo; Garcia-Miquel, Aleix; Bonet-Carne, Elisenda; Claverol, Joana; Cubells, Marta; Fortuny, Claudia; Fumadó, Victoria; Jou, Cristina; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Izquierdo, Luis; Bassat, Quique; Gratacós, Eduard; Aguilar, Ruth; García-García, Juan José; Moncunill, Gemma; Jordan, Iolanda",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440593,482

OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines the development and effectiveness of a hybrid-virtual simulation-based workshop designed to improve patient care by improving clinical skills of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in detecting and managing rare and complex psychiatric emergencies. METHODS: Three clinical vignettes based on near-miss psychiatric cases were developed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and nurses in psychiatry and experts in simulation-based medical education. The workshop, ‘SafePsych’ was delivered in a simulation laboratory while and broadcast via Zoom video-conferencing platform to observers. Debriefing followed each clinical scenario. Participants completed preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires to evaluate clinical knowledge. RESULTS: The workshop was attended by consultants (n=12) and NCHDs in psychiatry and emergency medicine (n=19), and psychiatric nurses (n=5). In the psychiatry NCHD group, test scores significantly improved following the workshop (p<0.001). There were significant improvements in the test scores with a mean difference of 2.56 (SD 1.58, p<0.001). Feedback from participants and observers was positive, with constructive appraisals to improve the virtual element of the workshop. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training is effective in teaching high risk, rare complex psychiatric cases to psychiatry NCHDs. Further exploration of the learning needs of nursing staff is required. Future workshop delivery is feasible in the COVID-19 environment and beyond, using a virtual element to meet social distancing requirements while enhancing the reach of the training.","Tong, Kezanne; McMahon, Eimear; Reid-McDermott, Bronwyn; Byrne, Dara; Doherty, Anne M",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497099/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001533,482
642817,Contact tracing apps and values dilemmas: A privacy paradox in a neo-liberal world,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Although abuse experienced by older adults is common and expected to increase, disclosure, reporting and interventions to prevent or mitigate abuse remain sub-optimal. Incorporating principles of harm reduction into service provision has been advocated as a strategy that may improve outcomes for this population. This paper explores whether and how these principles of harm reduction were employed by professionals who provide services to older adults experiencing abuse. METHODS: Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 23 professionals providing services to older adults experiencing abuse across three Western provinces of Canada was conducted. Key principles of harm reduction (humanism, incrementalism, individualism, pragmatism, autonomy, and accountability without termination) were used as a framework for organizing the themes. RESULTS: Our analysis illustrated a clear congruence between each of the six harm reduction principles and the approaches reflected in the narratives of professionals who provided services to this population, although these were not explicitly articulated as harm reduction by participants. Each of the harm reduction principles was evident in service providers’ description of their professional practice with abused older adults, although some principles were emphasized differentially at different phases of the disclosure and intervention process. Enactment of a humanistic approach formed the basis of the therapeutic client-provider relationships with abused older adults, with incremental, individual, and pragmatic principles also apparent in the discourse of participants. While respect for the older adult’s autonomy figured prominently in the data, concerns about the welfare of the older adults with questionable capacity were expressed when they did not engage with services or chose to return to a high-risk environment. Accountability without termination of the client-provider relationship was reflected in continuation of support regardless of the decisions made by the older adult experiencing abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Harm reduction approaches are evident in service providers’ accounts of working with older adults experiencing abuse. While further refinement of the operational definitions of harm reduction principles specific to their application with older adults is still required, this harm reduction framework aligns well with both the ethical imperatives and the practical realities of supporting older adults experiencing abuse.

In this paper, we examine what we identify as key traits of Cuban health security, as they play out on both international and domestic fronts. We argue that Cuba demonstrates a strong health security capacity, both in terms of its health systems support and crisis response activities internationally, and its domestic disease control activities rooted in an integrated health system with a focus on universal healthcare. Health security in Cuba, however, also faces challenges. These concern Cuba’s visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island—in particular, the effects of the US embargo. While Cuba does not frame its disease control activities within the discourse of health security, we argue that the Cuban case demonstrates that it is possible to make strides to improve capacity for health security in resource-constrained settings. The successes and challenges facing health security in Cuba, moreover, provide points of reflection relevant to the pursuit of health security globally and are thus worth further consideration in broader health security discussions.","Wenham, Clare; Kittelsen, Sonja K",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409329/,482

A very narrow pattern of pandemic flu-specific IgG epitope recognition was observed in the serum from individuals who later contracted H1N1 infection. Moreover, the pandemic influenza infection generated IgG reactivity to two adjacent epitopes of the neuraminidase protein. The differential serum IgG recognition was focused on haemagglutinin 1 (H1) and restricted to classical antigenic sites (Cb) in both the vaccinated controls and individuals with flu infections. We further identified a novel epitope VEPGDKITFEATGNL on the Ca antigenic site (251–265) of the pandemic flu haemagglutinin, which was exclusively recognized in serum from individuals with previous vaccinations and never in serum from individuals with H1N1 infection (confirmed by RNA PCR analysis from nasal swabs). This epitope was mapped to the receptor-binding domain of the influenza haemagglutinin and could serve as a correlate of immune protection in the context of pandemic flu. The study shows that unbiased epitope mapping using peptide microarray technology leads to the identification of biologically and clinically relevant target structures. Most significantly an H1N1 infection induced a different footprint of IgG epitope recognition patterns compared with the pandemic H1N1 vaccine.","Ambati, Aditya; Valentini, Davide; Montomoli, Emanuele; Lapini, Guilia; Biuso, Fabrizio; Wenschuh, Holger; Magalhaes, Isabelle; Maeurer, Markus",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12448; https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25639813/,482

649216,Reimagining information science and technology beyond traditional boundaries in the global coronavirus pandemic situation,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND Individuals with pre-existing mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the negative impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic seems to have on mental health. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to assess whether patients with mental illness experienced deterioration in mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown of Denmark in the Spring of 2020. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey coupled with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees. The latter enabled analysis of attrition and weighting of results. The online questionnaire included the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in symptoms during lockdown using the pre-pandemic period as reference. RESULTS A total of 992 randomly drawn patients with mental illness from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region responded to the questionnaire (response rate = 21.6%). The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 28, respectively. A total of 52% of the respondents reported that their mental health had deteriorated during the lockdown, while 33% reported no change, and 16% reported improvement. The most commonly reported reasons for deterioration were loneliness, disruption of routines, concerns regarding the coronavirus, less contact with family/friends, boredom, and reduced access to psychiatric care. CONCLUSION More than half of the patients reported worsening of their mental health during the pandemic lockdown. There should be an increased emphasis on ensuring both social and clinical support for individuals with mental illness during pandemics.","Kølbæk, Pernille; Jefsen, Oskar Hougaard; Speed, Maria; Østergaard, Søren Dinesen",Nordic journal of psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533424/; https://doi.org/10.1080/08039488.2021.1970222,482

BLOCK-CKD was a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, for uncontrolled hypertension in patients with stage 3b/4 chronic kidney disease. The study tested the hypothesis that addition of KBP-5074 to standard treatment lowers blood pressure without increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients (N=162) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to once-daily oral treatment with placebo, KBP-5074 0.25 mg, or KBP-5074 0.5 mg. The primary end point was systolic blood pressure change from baseline at day 84. Baseline mean (SD) systolic blood pressure was 155.3 (13.55) mm Hg. After 84 days, the placebo-subtracted treatment mean difference (SE) was −7.0 (3.37) mm Hg with KBP-5074 0.25 mg (P=0.0399) and −10.2 (3.32) mm Hg with KBP-5074 0.5 mg (P=0.0026). Hyperkalemia incidence, ≥5.6 <6 mmol/L, were similar among groups 5 (8.8%) placebo, 6 (11.8%) 0.25 mg, and 9 (16.7%) 0.5 mg patients. No hyperkalemia ≥6.0 mmol/L was observed. We conclude that KBP-5074 effectively lowers blood pressure with some risk of hyperkalemia in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled blood pressure.

651532,The Corona-Pandemic: A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Regional and Global Governance,2020-08-04,"Antibacterial activity of nanoparticles has received significant attention worldwide because of their great physical and chemical stability, excellent magnetic properties, and large lattice constant values. These properties are predominate in the food science for enhancing the overall quality, shelf life, taste, flavor, process-ability, etc., of the food. Nanoparticles exhibit attractive antibacterial activity due to their increased specific surface area leading to enhanced surface reactivity. When nanoparticles are suspended in the biological culture, they encounter various biological interfaces, resulting from the presence of cellular moieties like DNA, proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, etc., which helps antibacterial properties in many ways. This paper reviews different methods used for the synthesis of nanoparticles but is specially focusing on the green synthesis methods owing to its non-toxic nature towards the environment. This review highlights their antibacterial application mainly in the food sector in the form of food-nanosensors, food-packaging, and food-additives. The possible mechanism of nanoparticles for their antibacterial behavior underlying the interaction of nano-particles with bacteria, (i) excessive ROS generation including hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), OH(−) (hydroxyl radicals), and O(−)(2)(2) (peroxide); and (ii) precipitation of nano-particles on the bacterial exterior; which, disrupts the cellular activities, resulting in membranes disturbance. All these phenomena results in the inhibition of bacterial growth. Along with this, their current application and future perspectives in the food sector are also discussed. Nanoparticles help in destroying not only pathogens but also deadly fungi and viruses. Most importantly it is required to focus more on the crop processing and its containment to stop the post-harvesting loss. So, nanoparticles can act as a smart weapon towards the sustainable move.","Kumar, P.; Mahajan, P.; Kaur, R.; Gautam, S.",Mater Today Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtchem.2020.100332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835156/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468519420300926; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468519420300926,482

METHODS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. RESULTS: We analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79–0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97–0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34–0.35) for scores above four points. CONCLUSION: A clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making in emergency care.

To explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown (LCD) on organic aerosols, the mixing states and evolution processes of amine-containing particles were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer from January to March 2020 in Liaocheng, which is a seriously polluted city in North China. The counts and percentages of amine-containing particles in total obtained particles during the pre-LCD (547832, 29.8 %) were higher than those during the LCD (283983, 20.7 %) and post-LCD (102026, 18.4 %), mainly due to the reduced emission strength of amines and suppressed gas-to-particle partitioning of amines during the LCD and post-LCD. (74)(C(2)H(5))(2)NH(2)(+) was the most abundant amine marker, which accounted for 98.2 %, 98.4 %, and 96.7 % of all amine-containing particles during the pre-LCD, LCD, and post-LCD, respectively. Correlation analysis and temporal variations indicated that the gas-to-particle partitioning of amines was facilitated by the stronger acidic environment and lower temperature, while the effect of RH and aerosol liquid water content was minor. The A-OC particles were the most abundant type (accounting for ∼40 %) throughout the observation period. The temporal profiles and correlation analysis suggested that the impact of the increased O(3) on the amines and their oxidation products (e.g., trimethylamine oxide) was minor. The identified particle types, correlation analysis, and the potential source contribution function results implied that the amine-containing particles were mainly derived from local and surrounding sources during the LCD, while those were mainly affected by long-range transport during the pre-LCD and post-LCD. Our results could deepen the comprehension of the sources and atmospheric processing of amines in the urban area of North China during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Zheng; Zhou, Ruiwen; Wang, Yiqiu; Wang, Gehui; Chen, Min; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yachen; Yi, Yanan; Hou, Zhanfang; Guo, Qingchun; Meng, Jingjing",Environ Pollut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426186/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S026974912101469X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974912101469X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117887,482

A few months later, this viral infection had spread worldwide and became a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is multifactorial and associated with both specific antiviral as well as inflammatory responses, the extent of which may determine why some individuals are asymptomatic while others develop serious complications. Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action.","Cardone, Marco; Yano, Masahide; Rosenberg, Amy S.; Puig, Montserrat",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574265/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01131,482

ObjectiveTo examine the possible impact of obesity on COVID-19 death rates. DesignMeasure associations between obesity rates in 2016 and COVID-19 deaths/million population through 2/25/2021, across countries. SettingGlobal Participants167 countries for which obesity and death data were available, grouped by population size, with multiples of 10 countries in each of 8 groups plus a group including all 57 countries with obesity rates <15%. Outcome and measuresUsing Excel, COVID-19 deaths/million were regressed on the obesity rate for each country, based on obesity being a key factor in COVID hospitalizations and deaths. Using the least squares formula for the best fit for each model, R2, components of the formula, and the percentage of world population represented, were recorded for each group. ResultsObesity rates ranged from 2.1% to 37.9% and death rates ranged from 0.4/million to 1,892/million for groups representing up to 91% of global population. Results for the 8 population groups had R2 from 0.30 to 0.90 with slopes of the fitted line ranging from 27.9-51.0. Countries with obesity rates <15% had consistently low death rates ([≤]233/million), R2 of 0.003 and slope of the line=1.01. ConclusionsFor most countries about one-third of the difference in COVID death rates was due to obesity while in countries with obesity <15%, consistently low death rates were not associated with obesity. Reduced obesity rates could potentially have lowered the COVID death toll.","Adams, Mary L",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.21253222,482

METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study at the University Hospital Basel, we included all patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection hospitalised from 27 February 2020 to 10 May 2021. Patients&rsquo; characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record system. The primary outcome of this study was temporal trends of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality in patients hospitalised on the intensive care unit (ICU), admission to ICU, renal replacement therapy and length of hospital stay, as well as a descriptive analysis of risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period we included 943 hospitalisations of 930 patients. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 53&ndash;76) and 63% were men. The numbers of elderly patients, patients with multiple comorbidities and need for renal replacement therapy decreased from the first and second to the third wave. The median length of stay and need for ICU admission were similar in all waves. Throughout the study period 88 patients (9.3%) died during the hospital stay. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar over the course of the first two waves (9.5% and 10.2%, respectively), whereas it decreased in the third wave (5.4%). Overall mortality in patients without comorbidities was low at 1.6%, but it increased in patients with any comorbidity to 12.6%. Predictors of all-cause mortality over the whole period were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 10-year increase 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45&ndash;2.26; p &lt;0.001), male sex (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00&ndash;2.82; p = 0.048), immunocompromising condition (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.01&ndash;4.33; p = 0.048) and chronic kidney disease (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.35&ndash;3.76; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In our study in-hospital mortality was 9.5%, 10.2% and 5.4% in the first, second and third waves, respectively.

Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential for understanding how best to reduce mortality whilst ensuring minimal social restrictions to the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. In this work, we have extended the generic SIR framework to analyse empirical infection and fatality data from different regions to investigate the reinfection frequency of the disease. Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect from subsequent exposure in the short term, however, no such cases have been documented.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and its product angiotensin 1–7, are thought to have counteracting effects against the adverse actions of other, better known and understood, members of the RAS. The physiological and pathological importance of ACE2 and angiotensin 1–7 in the cardiovascular system are not completely understood, but numerous experimental studies have indicated that these components have protective effects in the heart and blood vessels. Here, we provide an overview on the basic properties of ACE2 and angiotensin 1–7 and a summary of the evidence from experimental and clinical studies of various pathological conditions, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial remodelling, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, and diabetes mellitus. ACE2-mediated catabolism of angiotensin II is likely to have a major role in cardiovascular protection, whereas the relevant functions and signalling mechanisms of actions induced by angiotensin 1–7 have not been conclusively determined. The ACE2–angiotensin 1–7 pathway, however, might provide a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, especially in patients with overactive RAS.

The addition of a serological testing could reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for colleges/universities in the United States, without compromising the efficacy of the testing plan. Objectives. To determine whether a college/university reopening SARS-CoV-2 testing plan that includes serological testing can be cost-saving compared to a PCR-only testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: We assessed costs of serological testing in addition to PCR testing under various scenarios of university sizes (2000, 10,000, and 40,000) and epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15%; cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the school year 5-30%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. We estimated total testing costs and relative percentage of cost-savings of different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing) scenarios between September 2020-May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Testing costs of serological testing and PCR testing, Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to PCR testing. Results: Including baseline serology testing alongside routine regular PCR testing can reduce total test volumes and related costs throughout the school year. While the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million for university size 10,000), including serologic testing could achieve the up to 20% cost-savings relative to PCR testing alone. The insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. If PCR testing is outsourced, however, the inclusion of serological testing becomes always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: While regular PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for containing epidemics, including serology testing may help achieve cost-savings if outbreaks are anticipated, or if baseline seropositivity is high.","Jo, Y.; Singh, R.; Rao, G.; Galea, S.; Nichols, B.

Even though no clinical study has yet demonstrated that a ventilatory strategy to limit the risk of P-SILI can improve the outcome, the concept of P-SILI relies on sound physiological reasoning, an accumulation of clinical observations and some consistent experimental data. In this review, we detail the main pathophysiological mechanisms by which the patient’s respiratory effort could become deleterious: excessive transpulmonary pressure resulting in over-distension; inhomogeneous distribution of transpulmonary pressure variations across the lung leading to cyclic opening/closing of nondependent regions and pendelluft phenomenon; increase in the transvascular pressure favoring the aggravation of pulmonary edema. We also describe potentially harmful patient-ventilator interactions. Finally, we discuss in a practical way how to detect in the clinical setting situations at risk for P-SILI and to what extent this recognition can help personalize the treatment strategy.","Carteaux, Guillaume; Parfait, Mélodie; Combet, Margot; Haudebourg, Anne-Fleur; Tuffet, Samuel; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205783/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10122738,482
