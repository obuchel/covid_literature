The animals of the PMV and VILI groups were ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 and 35 ml kg(−1), respectively, for 90 minutes. After the first 60 minutes of ventilation, the animals in the laser groups were irradiated (808 nm, 100 mW power density, 20 J cm(−2) energy density, continuous emission mode, and exposure time of 5 s) and after 30 minutes of irradiation, the animals were euthanized. Lung samples were removed for morphological analysis, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and real time quantitative polynucleotide chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The VILI group showed a greater acute lung injury (ALI) score with an increase in neutrophil infiltration, higher neutrophil count in the BAL fluid and greater cytokine mRNA expression compared to the PMV groups (p < 0.05). The VILI ± laser group when compared to the VILI group showed a lower ALI score (0.35 ± 0.08 vs. 0.54 ± 0.13, p < 0.05), alveolar neutrophil infiltration (7.00 ± 5.73 vs. 21.50 ± 9.52, p < 0.05), total cell count (1.90 ± 0.71 vs. 4.09 ± 0.96 × 10(5), p < 0.05) and neutrophil count in the BAL fluid (0.60 ± 0.37 vs. 2.28 ± 0.48 × 10(5), p < 0.05). Moreover, LLLT induced a decrease in pro-inflammatory and an increase of anti-inflammatory mRNA levels compared to the VILI group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, LLLT was found to reduce the inflammatory response in an experimental model of VILI.","Fazza, Thaís Fernanda; Pinheiro, Bruno Valle; da Fonseca, Lídia Maria Carneiro; da Silva Sergio, Luiz Philippe; Botelho, Mateus Pinto; de Moura Lopes, Gabrielle; de Paoli, Flavia; da Fonseca, Adenilson de Souza; Lucinda, Leda Marília Fonseca; Reboredo, Maycon Moura",Photochem Photobiol Sci,680,22

Here, we investigate the impact of sudden environmental shock, the M(s) 7.0 2013 Ya’an earthquake, on the mobile communications patterns of local families, which we operationalize using anonymized individual-level mobile telecommunications metadata from family plan subscribers of a major carrier (N = 35,565 people). We demonstrate that families’ communications dynamics after the earthquake depended on their triadic embeddedness structure, a structural metric we propose that reflects the number of dyads in a family triad that share social ties. We find that individuals in more embedded family structures were more likely to first call other family plan members and slower in calling non-family ties immediately after the earthquake; these tendencies were stronger at higher earthquake intensity. In the weeks after the event, individuals in more embedded family structures had more reciprocal communications and contacted more social ties in their broader social network. Overall, families that are structurally more embedded displayed higher levels of intra-family coordination and mobilization of non-family social connections.","Jia, Jayson S.; Li, Yiwei; Lu, Xin; Ning, Yijian; Christakis, Nicholas A.; Jia, Jianmin",Nat Commun,680,3

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following: human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the study’s limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely “Aedes ecology” and “transmission dynamics.” There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of different methods in the included studies highlights the interplay of multiple factors linking urbanisation with ecological, entomological, and epidemiological parameters and the need to consider a variety of these factors for designing effective public health approaches.","Kolimenakis, Antonios; Heinz, Sabine; Wilson, Michael Lowery; Winkler, Volker; Yakob, Laith; Michaelakis, Antonios; Papachristos, Dimitrios; Richardson, Clive; Horstick, Olaf",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,680,22

However, the prevalence of social isolation, specifically with regard to sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, is not well known. METHODS: Database was the Leipzig population-based study of adults (LIFE-Adult Study, n = 10,000). The short form of the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) was used to assess social isolation (cutoff < 12 points). Sampling weights were applied to account for differences in sampling fractions. RESULTS: Data were available for 9392 study participants; 51.6% were women, the mean age was 45.2 years (SD = 17.3). The prevalence of social isolation was 12.3% (95% CI 11.6–13.0) across ages 18–79 years. Social isolation was more prevalent in men (13.8%, 95% CI 12.8–14.8) compared to women (10.9%, 95% CI 10.0–11.8; [Formula: see text] (1) = 18.83, p < .001), and it showed an increase with increasing age from 5.4% (95% CI 4.7–6.0) in the youngest age group (18–39 years) to 21.7% (95% CI 19.5–24.0) in the oldest age group (70–79 years; [Formula: see text] (4) = 389.51, p < .001). Prevalence differed largely with regard to socioeconomic status (SES); showing lower prevalence in high SES (7.2%, 95% CI 6.0–8.4) and higher prevalence in low SES (18.6%, 95% CI 16.9–20.3; [Formula: see text] (2) = 115.78; p < .001). CONCLUSION: More than one in ten individuals in the adult population reported social isolation, and prevalence varied strongly with regard to sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. Social isolation was particularly frequent in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. From a public health perspective, effective prevention of and intervention against social isolation should be a desired target as social isolation leads to poor health. Countermeasures should especially take into account the socioeconomic determinants of social isolation, applying a life-course perspective.","Röhr, Susanne; Wittmann, Felix; Engel, Christoph; Enzenbach, Cornelia; Witte, A.

Amongst them, time series classification consists in predicting the class of a time series according to a set of already classified data. However, the performance of a time series classification algorithm depends on the quality of the known labels. In real applications, time series are often labeled by an expert or by an imprecise process, leading to noisy classes. Several algorithms have been developed to handle uncertain labels in case of non-temporal data sets. As an example, the fuzzy k-NN introduces for labeled objects a degree of membership to belong to classes. In this paper, we combine two popular time series classification algorithms, Bag of SFA Symbols (BOSS) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with the fuzzy k-NN. The new algorithms are called Fuzzy DTW and Fuzzy BOSS. Results show that our fuzzy time series classification algorithms outperform the non-soft algorithms especially when the level of noise is high.","Wagner, Nicolas; Antoine, Violaine; Koko, Jonas; Lardy, Romain",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,680,3

SUMMARY ANSWER: This RT-PCR assay showed high sensibility, repeatability and reproducibility for SARS-CoV–2 detection in seminal plasma and spermatozoa fractions, with a detection limit of 17 genomes/reaction. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: SARS-CoV–2 pandemic brings numerous concerns, such as the safety of gametes for patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies, fertility preservation or sperm donation. Transient viremia and expression of SARS-CoV–2 receptors in testis and accessory glands bring the question of the presence of the virus in sperm samples. Moreover, the contamination during sperm collection may be possible. The few available studies about this issue mostly showed the absence of SARS-CoV–2 detection in semen of COVID–19 patients, except one reported study. All these studies performed SARS-CoV–2 detection with RT-PCR assays approved for naso-pharyngeal swabs, without a process specifically validated for semen fractions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Method validation was conducted between July 2020 and January 2021. SARS-CoV–2 direct detection was performed according to the French Society of Microbiology guidelines (SFM). Repeatability (n = 6), reproducibility (n = 3), limit of quantification (n = 2) and of detection (n = 6) were evaluated in seminal plasma (SP) and spermatozoa samples isolated after density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved. In addition, variability of the whole analytical method efficiency was evaluated in samples of men with normal (n = 6) or altered sperm parameters (n = 6). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Samples were surplus semen obtained from men undergoing routine semen analysis after granting informed consent. Assays were performed on SP and frozen spermatozoa fractions. After automated RNA extraction (MGISP–960, MGI-Tech®), real-time RT-PCR was performed using the one-step multiplex TaqPath COVID–19 kit (ThermoFisher®) targeting three viral regions (ORF1, nucleocapsid-N and spike-S proteins). An exogenous internal control was added before RNA extraction. Positive samples and dilution ranges were prepared with a standard (SARS-CoV–2 inactivated virus, QnosticTM Randox®). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: RT-PCR assay applied for human sperm samples has been previously validated and is routinely used for SARS-CoV–2 detection in naso-pharyngeal swabs. We evaluated the efficiency of RNA extraction and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV–2 detection in semen fractions. The qualitative and quantitative performance of the whole analytical method was validated with an accuracy profile for SP and spermatozoa fractions. Overall, for repeatability, the standard deviation (SD) of the cycle threshold (Ct) was lower than 0.40 for the strong positive sample and 0.50 for the low positive one. An exception was observed for the S target of the low positive SP samples (SD = 3) which was consistent with S being the less sensitive target of the assay. For reproducibility, SD of the Ct was lower than 0.30 for the strong positive sample and 0.80 for the low positive, except for the S target of the low positive (SD = 1.5). The linearity range was determined for N target, the most sensitive target of the RT-PCR assay. It layed between 5200 and 52 SARS-CoV–2 genomes/reaction. The limit of detection of the RT-PCR assay was 17 viral genomes/reaction. Equal efficiency of the assay was observed for SP and spermatozoa independently of semen parameters (normal and altered sperm parameters). Limitations, reasons for caution: Our detection method was validated for the whole process: RNA extraction (reagents and system), RT-PCR (reagents and thermocycler QuantStudio 5(TM)) and for both SP and frozen spermatozoa fractions. Variability might be observed with a different extraction system or a different type of biological sample. Wider implications of the findings: This validated RT-PCR assay enables accurate and reliable screening of SARS-CoV–2 in SP and spermatozoa fractions, mandatory to investigate the presence of the virus in semen samples of patients undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, fertility preservation or sperm donation, and to ensure viral safety in the cryobanking process during covid–19 pandemic.

During the course of infection, the CNS is the most commonly damaged organ among invaded tissues. The polymorphic rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) is a key serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) kinase that phosphorylates host proteins to modulate acute virulence. However, the basis of neurotropism and the specific substrates through which ROP18 exerts neuropathogenesis remain unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we performed proteomic analysis of proteins that selectively bind to active ROP18 and identified RTN1-C, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is preferentially expressed in the CNS. We demonstrated that ROP18 is associated with the N-terminal portion of RTN1-C and specifically phosphorylates RTN1-C at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118. ROP18 phosphorylation of RTN1-C triggers ER stress-mediated apoptosis in neural cells. Remarkably, ROP18 phosphorylation of RTN1-C enhances glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) acetylation by attenuating the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC), and this event is associated with an increase of neural apoptosis. These results clearly demonstrate that both RTN1-C and HDACs are involved in T. gondii ROP18-mediated pathogenesis of encephalitis during Toxoplasma infection.","An, Ran; Tang, Yuewen; Chen, Lijian; Cai, Haijian; Lai, De-Hua; Liu, Kang; Wan, Lijuan; Gong, Linli; Yu, Li; Luo, Qingli; Shen, Jilong; Lun, Zhao-Rong; Ayala, Francisco J; Du, Jian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,680,20

The aim of this survey was to study changes in lifestyle habits, treatment adherence, and mental health status in patients with cardiometabolic disease, but no clinical evidence of COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms. Results: A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3 ± 15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018). No physical activity was reported by 38% of patients. Only 15% of patients met minimum recommendations of physical activity (more than 150 minutes/week) and vegetable and fruit intake. Low/very low income (45.5%) was associated with a lower level of physical activity (p < 0.0001), less fruit and vegetables intake (p < 0.0001), more tobacco use (p < 0.001) and perception of depression (p < 0.001). Low educational level was also associated with the perception of depression (OR 1.46, CI 1.26-1.70; p < 0.01).

Lacking effective diagnostics and therapies made this pandemic challenging to manage since the SARS-CoV-2 transmits via human-to-human, enters via ACE2 and TMPSSR2 receptors, and damages organs rich in host cells, spreads via symptomatic carriers and is prominent in an immune-compromised population. New SARS-CoV-2 informatics (structure, strains, like-cycles, functional sites) motivated bio-pharma experts to investigate novel therapeutic agents that act to recognize, inhibit, and knockdown combinations of drugs, vaccines, and antibodies, have been optimized to manage COVID-19. However, successful targeted delivery of these agents to avoid off-targeting and unnecessary drug ingestion is very challenging. To overcome these obstacles, this mini-review projects nanomedicine technology, a pharmacologically relevant cargo of size within 10 to 200 nm, for site-specific delivery of a therapeutic agent to recognize and eradicate the SARS-CoV-2, and improving the human immune system. Such combinational therapy based on compartmentalization controls the delivery and releases of a drug optimized based on patient genomic profile and medical history. Nanotechnology could help combat COVID-19 via various methods such as avoiding viral contamination and spraying by developing personal protective equipment (PPE) to increase the protection of healthcare workers and produce effective antiviral disinfectants surface coatings capable of inactivating and preventing the virus from spreading. To quickly recognize the infection or immunological response, design highly accurate and sensitive nano-based sensors. Development of new drugs with improved activity, reduced toxicity, and sustained release to the lungs, as well as tissue targets; and development of nano-based immunizations to improve humoral and cellular immune responses. The desired and controlled features of suggested personalized therapeutics, nanomedicine, is a potential therapy to manage COVID-19 successfully.

Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study, we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to COVID-19 negative, ventilated patients with ARDS and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. EVLWI and cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in 25 patients with COVID-19 ARDS subsequent to intubation and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. At intubation, EVLWI was noticeably elevated and significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p < 0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p = 0.003) suggested a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable in both cohorts. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and in-hospital mortality (23.2 ± 6.7% vs. 30.3 ± 6.0%, p = 0.025). Also, EVLWI showed a significant between-subjects (r = - 0.60; p = 0.001) and within-subjects correlation (r = - 0.27; p = 0.028) to Horowitz index. Compared to non COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. High EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression on ICU.","Rasch, Sebastian; Schmidle, Paul; Sancak, Sengül; Herner, Alexander; Huberle, Christina; Schulz, Dominik; Mayr, Ulrich; Schneider, Jochen; Spinner, Christoph D; Geisler, Fabian; Schmid, Roland M; Lahmer, Tobias; Huber, Wolfgang",Sci Rep,680,32

RESULTS: The results showed that serum lncRNA TINCR level was significantly increased in BC, especially in TNBC. High circulating lncRNA TINCR was significantly correlated with worse clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of TNBC. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum lncRNA TINCR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of TNBC. However, little association was found between serum lncRNA TINCR and the prognosis of non-TNBC. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that serum lncRNA TINCR might be a useful novel and non-invasive biomarker for the prognosis prediction of TNBC.","Wang, Xiaojie; Li, Shuang; Xiao, Huiyu; Deng, Xiaoqin",Technol Cancer Res Treat,680,16

Between late February and March 2020, COVID-19 was epidemic in the community of Daegu city and Gyeongsangbuk-do region (D-G region) in Korea. We aimed to clarify the changes in the health-seeking behaviors of stroke patients and stroke care services by region in Korea through analysis of data from Korean Stroke Registry (KSR). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data with acute stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients between 2019 and 2020. We compared the stroke onset to hospital arrival (onset-todoor) time of these patients in the D-G region and other regions in Korea during the epidemic period in 2020 (post-COVID-19: February 18-March 31, 2020) and the same period in 2019 (Pre-COVID- 19). In addition, we investigated the in-hospital stroke pathways with the patients. Results: 1,792 patients in pre-COVID-19 and 1,555 patients in post-COVID-19 who visited KSRregistered hospitals were analyzed. Compared to pre-COVID-19, the number of patients registered in KSR decreased in most regions in post-COVID-19. In the D-G region, the number of registered patients decreased by two thirds, and the proportion of patients with TIA decreased significantly. (9.97% to 2.91%). Unlike other regions, the median onset-to-door time increased significantly in the D-G region (361 versus 526.5 minutes, p=0.0084). The proportion of patients with onset-to-door time within 3 hours also decreased significantly (36.45% versus 28.16%, p=0.0485). Patients in their 60s and 70s and mild symptoms (NIHSS score 0 to 3) came to the hospital later. As a result, the patients who underwent thrombectomy also decreased, but the treatment time did not differ between the two periods. Conclusion: During the epidemic of COVID-19, the patients residing in the epicenter showed distinct changes in health-seeking behavior. Appropriate public education about stroke is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jeong, H. Y.; Lee, E. J.; Kang, M. K.; Nam, K. W.; Bae, J.; Jeon, K.; Kim, T. J.; Jung, K. H.; Ko, S. B.; Oh, M.

Our analysis was three-fold: (i) understand the relationship between engagement and features via correlation analysis; (ii) find the most relevant feature subsets to predict engagement via feature selection; and (iii) find the semantic topics that best characterize the dataset via topic modeling. We found that ad expenditure, text size, ad lifetime, and sentiment were the top features predicting users' engagement to the ads. Additionally, positive sentiment ads were more engaging than negative ads, and sociolinguistic features (e.g., use of religion-relevant words) were identified as highly important in the makeup of an engaging ad. Linear SVM and Logistic Regression classifiers achieved the highest mean F-scores (93.6% for both models), determining that the optimal feature subset contains 12 and 6 features, respectively.

The present article proposes defined organizational measures (e.g., telephone and video appointments, rearranging waiting areas and implementing hygiene measures and social distancing rules at stable patient numbers) and medical measures (collaboration with practice-based physicians with regard to primary diagnostics, rapid COVID-19 testing, continuing already-initiated insect venom immunotherapy in the outpatient setting by making use of the maximal permitted injection intervals, prompt initiation of insect venom immunotherapy during the summer season, and, where necessary, using outpatient regimens particularly out of season) for the care of insect venom allergy patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Worm, Margitta; Ballmer-Weber, Barbara; Brehler, Randolf; Cuevas, Mandy; Gschwend, Anna; Hartmann, Karin; Hawranek, Thomas; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Homey, Bernhard; Jakob, Thilo; Novak, Natalija; Pickert, Julia; Saloga, Joachim; Schäkel, Knut; Trautmann, Axel; Treudler, Regina; Wedi, Bettina; Sturm, Gunter; Rueff, Franziska",Allergo J Int,680,3

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to the emergency room from December 2017 to February 2019 who underwent upper urinary tract decompression due to concern for infection in the setting of obstructing urolithiasis. Over 30 clinical parameters were assessed and a composite risk score was created. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise regression were performed to identify predictors of true UTI. RESULTS: 98 patients met inclusion criteria, of which a true UTI was identified in 50 (51%). The standard model of serum WBC>15 or temperature>38°C had an AUC of only 0.67 to predict UTI. A multivariable regression-based 4-point risk score (1-point for each of the following: positive urinary gram stain, perinephric fat stranding on CT, serum C-reactive protein >21.95, and serum procalcitonin >0.36) had an AUC of 0.91 to predict UTI. Individually, these components had AUC of 0.68, 0.68, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. The chances of confirmed UTI were 8%, 11%, 68%, and 100% for risk scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3-4 respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Only 50% of patients with a suspected UTI and an obstructing stone were ultimately confirmed to have a UTI. A risk score consisting of gram stain, perinephric fat stranding, CRP, and PCT can improve UTI prediction and warrants further study.","Wymer, Kevin M; Sharma, Vidit; Manka, Madeleine; Agarwal, Deepak K; Dodge, Nicole; Gettman, Matthew; Rivera, Marcelino E",J. endourol,680,16

Because HCoV-OC43 uses cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for cell entry, VeroE6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 may show a clear CPE after HCoV-OC43 infection. The aim of this study was to construct a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay for HCoV-OC43 based on CPE evaluation using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells showed clear CPEs 3 to 4 days after low-titer HCoV-OC43 infection. Evaluation of viral kinetics indicated that the viral titer in the culture supernatant of VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells in the early stages of infection was higher than that of other cells. In comparison, between the CPE-based and the IPA-based (i.e., the reference titer) methods, the titer measured with CPE evaluation 4 to 5 days after infection using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells showed a much smaller difference from the reference titer than that measured using other cells. Thus, the TCID50 assay using CPE evaluation with VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells provides the correct titer value and will greatly contribute to future research on HCoV-OC43.IMPORTANCE HCoV-OC43 rarely shows a cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cell lines, and thus the plaque and TCID50 assays by CPE observation are not applicable for titration; the indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) is used instead. However, the IPA is relatively complex, time-consuming, costly, and not suitable for simultaneous titration of many samples. We developed a TCID50 assay using CPE evaluation with TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells that provides the same accuracy as the conventional IPA-based viral titration and does not require any staining procedures using antibodies or substrates. This titration method will greatly contribute to future research on HCoV-OC43 by allowing simple, low-cost, and accurate titration of this virus.","Hirose, Ryohei; Watanabe, Naoto; Bandou, Risa; Yoshida, Takuma; Daidoji, Tomo; Naito, Yuji; Itoh, Yoshito; Nakaya, Takaaki",MSphere,680,1

COVID-19 exhibits a strong human-to-human transmission infectivity and could cause acute respiratory diseases. Asymptomatic carriers are able to infect other healthy persons, and this poses a challenge for public health; the World Health Organization (WHO) has already announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Nucleic acid testing, considered as the current primary method for diagnosing COVID-19, might lead to false negatives and is difficult to be applied for every suspected patient because of the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Meanwhile, detecting specific antibodies in blood, such as the IgM antibody, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is another choice for COVID-19 diagnosis, as it is widely accepted that IgM is an important indicator in the acute infection period. In this study, a colloidal gold nanoparticle-based lateral-flow (AuNP-LF) assay was developed to achieve rapid diagnosis and on-site detection of the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the indirect immunochromatography method. For preparing AuNP-LF strips, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 NP) was coated on an analytical membrane for sample capture, and antihuman IgM was conjugated with AuNPs to form the detecting reporter. Optimization of AuNP-LF assay was carried out by altering the pH value and the amount of antihuman IgM. The performance of AuNP-LF assay was evaluated by testing serum samples of COVID-19 patients and normal humans. The results were compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of AuNP-LF assay were determined to be 100 and 93.3%, respectively, and an almost perfect agreement was exhibited by Kappa statistics (κ coefficient = 0.872). AuNP-LF assay showed outstanding selectivity in the detection of IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 virus with no interference from other viruses such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and dengue virus (DFV). AuNP-LF assay was able to achieve results within 15 min and needed only 10-20 μL serum for each test. As a whole, in the light of its advantages such as excellent specificity and stability, easy operation, low cost, and being less time-consuming, AuNP-LF assay is a feasible method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary hospitals and laboratories, especially in emergency situations in which numerous samples need to be tested on time. ©","Huang, Chao; Wen, Tian; Shi, Feng-Juan; Zeng, Xiao-Yan; Jiao, Yong-Jun",ACS Omega,680,16

METHODS: The gene expression omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen the whole genome expression data related with coronavirus infection. The R language package was used for differential expression analysis and KEGG/GO enrichment analysis. The core genes were screened by PPI network analysis using STRING online analysis website. Then the self-developed apparent precision therapy prediction platform (EpiMed) was used to analyze diseases, drugs and related target genes. RESULTS: A database in accordance with the criteria was found, which was derived from SARS coronavirus. A total of 3606 differential genes were screened, including 2148 expression up-regulated genes and 1458 expression down-regulated genes. GO enrichment mainly related with viral infection, hematopoietic regulation, cell chemotaxis, platelet granule content secretion, immune activation, acute inflammation, etc. KEGG enrichment mainly related with hematopoietic function, coagulation cascade reaction, acute inflammation, immune reaction, etc. Ten core genes such as PTPRC, ICAM1, TIMP1, CXCR5, IL-1B, MYC, CR2, FSTL1, SOX1 and COL3A1 were screened by protein interaction network analysis. Ten drugs with potential intervention effects, including glucocorticoid, TNF-&#945; inhibitor, salvia miltiorrhiza, sirolimus, licorice, red peony, famciclovir, cyclosporine A, houttuynia cordata, fluvastatin, etc. were screened by EpiMed plotform. CONCLUSION: SARS coronavirus infection can affect the hematopoietic system by changing the expression of a series of genes. The potential intervention drugs screened on these grounds are of useful reference significance for the basic and clinical research of COVID-19.","Zhang, Jun-Dong; Yang, Bo; Chen, Hao-Ran; Chi, Xiao-Hua; Chen, Xi-Meng; Zhi, Peng; Zhang, Hao-Min; Wang, Zi-Ning; Guo, Bin; Wang, Yi-Xing; Sun, Wan-Jun; Lu, Xue-Chun",Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,680,3

S1P receptors are involved in several cellular and physiological events, including lymphocyte/hematopoietic cell trafficking. An S1P gradient (low in tissues, high in blood), maintained by synthetic and degradative enzymes, regulates lymphocyte trafficking. Because lymphocytes live long (which is critical for adaptive immunity) and recirculate thousands of times, the S1P-S1PR pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. The S1PR1 modulators lead to receptor internalization, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation, which renders lymphocytes incapable of following the S1P gradient and prevents their access to inflammation sites. These drugs might also block lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes by inhibiting transendothelial migration. Targeting S1PRs as a therapeutic strategy was first employed for multiple sclerosis (MS), and four S1P modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod) are currently approved for its treatment. New S1PR modulators are under clinical development for MS, and their uses are being evaluated to treat other immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and psoriasis. A clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 treated with ozanimod is ongoing. Ozanimod and etrasimod have shown promising results in IBD; while in phase 2 clinical trials, ponesimod has shown improvement in 77% of the patients with psoriasis. Cenerimod and amiselimod have been tested in SLE patients. Fingolimod, etrasimod, and IMMH001 have shown efficacy in RA preclinical studies. Concerns relating to S1PR modulators are leukopenia, anemia, transaminase elevation, macular edema, teratogenicity, pulmonary disorders, infections, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, S1PR modulators exhibit different pharmacokinetics; a well-established first-dose event associated with S1PR modulators can be mitigated by gradual up-titration. In conclusion, S1P modulators represent a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for immune-mediated diseases.","Pérez-Jeldres, Tamara; Alvarez-Lobos, Manuel; Rivera-Nieves, Jesús",Drugs,680,24

Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non‐asthmatic mothers. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent‐completed questionnaire. RESULTS: Twelve‐month‐old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4–12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent‐perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory‐confirmed viral infection (n = 16). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.","Murphy, Vanessa E.; Mattes, Joerg; Powell, Heather; Baines, Katherine J.; Gibson, Peter G.",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,680,1

SARS-CoV-2-specific pTfh responses across all three protein specificities correlate with antibody neutralization with the strongest correlation observed for S protein-specific responses. When examined over time, pTfh responses increase in frequency and magnitude in convalescence, and robust responses with magnitudes greater than 5% were detected only at the second convalescent visit, an average of 38 days post-symptom onset.

That was mainly a result of swift restrictive measures such as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders to confine the spread of the virus and the rising number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. This work is driven by analyzing five types of real-world data sets from Detroit related to traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing index, and crashes from January 2019 to June 2020. The primary goals of this work are: i) figuring out the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation network usage (traffic volume) and safety (crashes) for the City of Detroit, ii) determining whether each type of data (e.g. traffic volume data) could be a useful factor in the confirmed-cases prediction, and iii) providing an early future prediction method for COVID-19 rates, which can be a vital contributor to life-saving advanced preventative and preparatory responses. In addressing these problems, the prediction results of six feature groups are presented and analyzed to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data. Then, a deep learning model was developed using long short-term memory networks to predict the number of confirmed cases within the next week. The model demonstrated a promising prediction result with a coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]) of up to approximately 0.91. Furthermore, six essential observations with supporting evidence are presented, which will be helpful for decision-makers to take specific measures that aid in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health and safety.
