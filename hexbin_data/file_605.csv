News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","Haines, Seline; Caccamo, Amy; Chan, Fonda; Galaso, German; Catinchi, Alexis; Gupta, Puneet K.",Neurodiagn J,605,1

We present NGS-PrimerPlex, an efficient and versatile command-line application that designs primers for different refined types of amplicon-based genome target enrichment. It supports nested and anchored multiplex PCR, redistribution among multiplex reactions of primers constructed earlier, and extension of existing NGS-panels. The primer design process takes into consideration the formation of secondary structures, non-target amplicons between all primers of a pool, primers and high-frequent genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlapping. Moreover, users of NGS-PrimerPlex are free from manually defining input genome regions, because it can be done automatically from a list of genes or their parts like exon or codon numbers. Using the program, the NGS-panel for sequencing the LRRK2 gene coding regions was created, and 354 DNA samples were studied successfully with a median coverage of 97.4% of target regions by at least 30 reads. To show that NGS-PrimerPlex can also be applied for bacterial genomes, we designed primers to detect foodborne pathogens Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus considering variable positions of the genomes.","Kechin, Andrey; Borobova, Viktoria; Boyarskikh, Ulyana; Khrapov, Evgeniy; Subbotin, Sergey; Filipenko, Maxim",PLoS Comput Biol,605,1

NEC occurs in 2–5% of all preterm infants although the majority of cases develop in infants less than 36 weeks of gestational age. It has been noted that infants born at earlier gestational age, develop NEC at a later chronological age. The average age of onset of disease is 20.2 days for infants born less than 30 weeks of gestation whereas disease onset is reduced to 13.8 days for infants born at 31–33 weeks and 5.4 days for infants born after 34 weeks of gestation. Epidemiological studies have identifi ed multiple risk factors for NEC, although a history of hypoxia, asphyxia and the introduction of enteral feeding are characteristically associated with premature infants that develop NEC. Despite its predilection for premature infants, NEC has also been described in term infants particularly those with cyanotic heart disease. There is no clear evidence to suggest that geographical origin, ethnicity or gender alter the incidence of NEC.","Hunter, Catherine J.; Ford, Henri R.; Camerini, Victoria",Pediatric Surgery,605,1

The necessity of their improvement led to the major effort towards development of vaccine delivery systems that are generally particulate (e.g., nano- and microparticles) and have comparable dimensions to the pathogens (viruses or bacteria). The mode of action of these adjuvants is not fully understood but implies the stimulation of the innate or antigen-specific immune responses, and/or the increase of antigen uptake or processing by antigen-presenting cells (APC). Moreover, enhancement of adjuvant activity through the use of micro- and nanoparticulate delivery systems often resulted from the synergistic effects producing immune responses stronger than those elicited by the adjuvant or delivery system alone. Among particulate adjuvants, biodegradable micro- and nanoparticles of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycoside) (PLGA) or poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) have been reported to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses against an encapsulated protein antigen. Cationic and anionic polylactide co-glycolide (PLG) microparticles have been successfully used to adsorb a variety of agents, which include plasmid DNA, recombinant proteins and adjuvant active oligonucleotides and are also currently tested in several vaccine applications. Another approach envisions specific targeting of APC, especially peripheral DC and exploitation of particulate systems that are small enough for lymphatic uptake (polystyrene nanobeads). Micro- and nanoparticles offer the possibility of enhancement of their uptake by appropriate cells through manipulation of their surface properties. Still, questions regarding toxicity and molecular interaction between micro- and nano-particles and immune cells, tissues and whole organisms remain to be addressed. These risks and other possible side effects should be assessed in detail especially if mass-production and massive administration of such preparations is to be considered.","Ilyinskii, P.",Silicon Versus Carbon,605,1

On the one hand, there are the unspecific, non-adaptive immune reactions, which recognize and eliminate invading foreign pathogens. This so-called natural or innate immune system becomes primarily active after a virus has overcome the external physical protection barriers of the body (skin, mucous membranes). It consists of dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells). They have proteins that serve as receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and complement receptors, for specific structures of pathogens and for the soluble products of the innate immune system (acute-phase proteins, factors of the complement system, cytokines, chemokines and interferons). The effects and functions of cytokines, chemokines and interferons will be discussed separately in Chap. 8. The specific, adaptive immune response is the second line of defence, and is developed only during or after the establishment of an infection. It includes antibody-producing B cells – the humoral immune system – as well as T-helper (T(H)) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which collectively constitute the cellular defence system. The adaptive immune reactions can selectively recognize certain pathogen types or subtypes, and in the case of a reinfection, they are able to recognize the pathogens again and eliminate them. They are long-lasting and a subset of stimulated lymphocytes transform into memory cells during their development, which confers on the organism an efficient protective immunity against infections with the same pathogen. The systems of the specific and non-specific immune responses are in close contact with each other, particularly via cytokines, chemokines and interferons. An immune response is generally triggered by antigens. These may be the infectious pathogens, individual protein components or sugar structures. The immune system recognizes these as foreign, and thus can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous components. However, the antigens must be of a certain size to trigger different immune responses. Molecules with a molecular mass of less than 3–4 kDa are usually incapable of doing that.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,605,1

Eine wichtige Rolle spielen sie auch als Auslöser von Asthmaattacken. Es findet eine stete Kozirkulation mehrerer Serotypen statt, im gemäßigten Klima gibt es Herbst-, Winter- und Frühjahrsepidemien, die Übertragung geschieht weit häufiger über infizierte Sekrete als durch Aerosole. Rhinoviren gehören zu den Picornaviren. Rhinoviren sind sehr kleine Viren mit einem positiven Einzelstrang-RNA-Genom ohne Lipidhülle und daher gegen Detergens enthaltende Desinfektionsmittel sehr resistent. Sie sind empfindlich gegen Umgebungs-pH außerhalb des Bereichs 5,0–7,5. Zurzeit bilden sie zusammen mit den Enteroviren das Genus Enterovirus der Picornaviren. Serologisch lassen sich über 100 Typen unterscheiden. Kennzeichnend ist die Bindungsfähigkeit an das von den meisten Rhinoviren für die Zelladsorption genützte ICAM-1 (interzelluläres Adhäsionsmolekül).

This study investigated the role of curcumin chitosan (CuCs) nanocomposite as a potential anti-HCV-4a agent in human hepatoma cells Huh7. METHODS: Docking of curcumin and CuCs nanocomposite and binding energy calculations were carried out. Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) and CuCs nanocomposite were prepared with an ionic gelation method and characterized with TEM, zeta size and potential, and HPLC to calculate encapsulation efficiency. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on Huh7 cells using MTT assay and confirmed with cellular and molecular assays. Anti-HCV-4a activity was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The strength of binding interactions between protein ligand complexes gave scores with NS3 protease, NS5A polymerase, and NS5B polymerase of -124.91, -159.02, and -129.16, for curcumin respectively, and -68.51, -54.52, and -157.63 for CuCs nanocomposite, respectively. CuCs nanocomposite was prepared at sizes 29–39.5 nm and charges of 33 mV. HPLC detected 4% of curcumin encapsulated into CsNPs. IC50 was 8 µg/mL for curcumin and 25 µg/mL for the nanocomposite on Huh7 but was 25.8 µg/mL and 34 µg/mL on WISH cells. CsNPs had no cytotoxic effect on tested cell lines. Apoptotic genes’ expression revealed the caspase-dependent pathway mechanism. CsNPs and CuCs nanocomposite demonstrated 100% inhibition of viral entry and replication, which was confirmed with HCV core protein expression. CONCLUSION: CuCs nanocomposite inhibited HCV-4a entry and replication compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role as an effective therapeutic agent.","Loutfy, Samah A; Elberry, Mostafa H; Farroh, Khaled Yehia; Mohamed, Hossam Taha; Mohamed, Aya A; Mohamed, ElChaimaa B; Faraag, Ahmed Hassan Ibrahim; Mousa, Shaker A",Int J Nanomedicine,605,1

Yet, replication often is not employed on larger scales, as naïvely mirroring a computation once effectively halves the machine size, and as keeping replicated simulations consistent with each other is not trivial. We demonstrate for the ExaHyPE engine—a task-based solver for hyperbolic equation systems—that it is possible to realise resiliency without major code changes on the user side, while we introduce a novel algorithmic idea where replication reduces the time-to-solution. The redundant CPU cycles are not burned “for nothing”. Our work employs a weakly consistent data model where replicas run independently yet inform each other through heartbeat messages whether they are still up and running. Our key performance idea is to let the tasks of the replicated simulations share some of their outcomes, while we shuffle the actual task execution order per replica. This way, replicated ranks can skip some local computations and automatically start to synchronise with each other. Our experiments with a production-level seismic wave-equation solver provide evidence that this novel concept has the potential to make replication affordable for large-scale simulations in high-performance computing.","Samfass, Philipp; Weinzierl, Tobias; Hazelwood, Benjamin; Bader, Michael",High Performance Computing,605,1

We have shown previously that the galactosyl‐α1,3‐galactosyl (Galα1,3Gal) xenoantigen and the similar ABO histo‐blood group antigens are transferred onto virus from the producer cell, resulting in sensitisation of the virus to the respective NAb in a C’‐dependent manner. Here we show that measles virus (Mv) that expresses Galα1,3Gal termini can drive the proliferation of human T cells in the presence of serum and autologous DC, whereas without such targets, measles, as expected, suppress T cell reactivity. The use of affinity‐purified NAb to Galα1,3Gal and rabbit C’ demonstrated the components in human serum responsible for this effect. Proteasome inhibition and blocking of antigen presentation showed that the increased T cell proliferation was mediated by MHC class I cross‐presentation of immune complexes. These results lend further support to the idea that polymorphic carbohydrates of the Galα1,3Gal/ABO type serve as important targets for NAb and C’ and that their expression on virus has influenced their evolution by contributing to protection against viral transmission within as well as between species.

Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been shown to have increased vulnerability and risk to disasters due to links between racism, vulnerability, and economic power, based on disadvantage related to different disaster stages: 1) reduced perception of personal disaster risk; 2) lack of preparedness; 3) reduced access and response to warning systems; 4) increased physical impacts due to substandard housing; 5) likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes; 6) cultural insensitivity on the part of emergency workers; 7) marginalization, lower socio-economic status, and less familiarity with support resources leading to protracted recovery; and 8) diminished standard of living, job loss, and exacerbated poverty during reconstruction and community rebuilding. Moreover, given that psychiatric morbidity is predictable in populations exposed to disasters, mental health and psychosocial support programs should increasingly become a standard part of a humanitarian response. In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare. So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources.

The best values of IC(50) (inhibiting concentration) and SI (selectivity index) were demonstrated by the lead compound 4i in which the 1,2,3-triazolylribofuranosyl fragment is attached to the N1 atom of the quinazoline-2,4-dione moiety via a butylene linker (IC(50) = 30 μM, SI = 24) and compound 8n in which the 1,2,3-triazolylribofuranosyl fragment is attached directly to the N5 atom of the 6-methyluracil moiety (IC(50) = 15 μM, SI = 5). According to theoretical calculations, the antiviral activity of the 1,2,3-triazolyl nucleoside analogues 4i and 8n against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) influenza virus can be explained by their influence on the functioning of the polymerase acidic protein (PA) of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).

It is causing mass destruction in mankind allowing them to lock inside home to contain the disease. At present, there are no remedial medicines, drugs, or vaccines available in the market. Researchers are trying their best level to produce drugs to fight againts the disease. Various efforts are being considered by using different directions of scientific knowledge and technologies on treating the disease. The existing antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, pitavastatin, nelfinavir, perampanel, and praziquantel are being administered as remedies of covid-19 patients. Unfortunately, none of these drugs works absolutely against the current pandemic. Therefore, bioactive molecules from plants, animals, and microorganisms could be a better option to treat against the covid-19 and its family. Plants can treat many diseases due to the presence of bioactive molecules and their antiviral properties. Presence of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, polyphenols, curcumin, kaempferol, catechin, naringenin, quercetin, apigenin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, oleuropein, and epigallocatechin can fight against the coronavirus including covid-19. The listed plants such as litchi seeds, Houttuynia cordata, Chinese Rhubarb extracts, beta-sistosterol from Isatis indigotica root extract have capacity to obstruct the enzymatic activity of SARS. In this article, we have highlighted the bioactive molecules from different plants, animals, and microorganism and their potential activity against the coronavirus. It is a need of the hour to come together to explore more on such bioactive compounds of plants, animals and other microorganism to fight against the covid-19.","Singh, Yengkhom Disco; Jena, Barsarani; Ningthoujam, Rina; Panda, Sneha; Priyadarsini, Pratigyan; Pattanayak, Sabita; Panda, Manasa Kumar; Singh, Mayanglambam Chandrakumar; Satapathy, Kunja Bihari",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),605,1

Increasing ventilator WOB is known as a risk factor for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). In addition, the minimization of WOB is crucial to facilitate the weaning process. Several studies have assessed the effects of varying inspiratory flow waveforms on the patient’s WOB during assisted ventilation, but there are few studies on the different effect of inspiratory flow waveforms on ventilator WOB during controlled ventilation. METHODS: In this paper, we analyze the ventilator WOB, termed mechanical work (MW) for three common inspiratory flow waveforms both in normal subjects and COPD patients. We use Rohrer’s equation for the resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and lung airways. The resistance of pulmonary and chest wall tissue are also considered. Then, the resistive MW required to overcome each component of the respiratory resistance is computed for square and sinusoidal waveforms in volume-controlled ventilation (VCV), and decelerating waveform of flow in pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). RESULTS: The results indicate that under the constant I:E ratio, a square flow profile best minimizes the MW both in normal subjects and COPD patients. Furthermore, the large I:E ratio may be used to lower MW. The comparison of results shows that ETT and lung airways have the main contribution to resistive MW in normals and COPDs, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings support that for lowering the MW especially in patients with obstructive lung diseases, flow with square waveforms in VCV, are more favorable than decelerating waveform of flow in PCV. Our analysis suggests the square profile is the best choice from the viewpoint of less MW.","Monjezi, Mojdeh; Jamaati, Hamidreza",Biomed Eng Online,605,1

We adopted a machine learning technique to analyze the air quality impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown from January to April 2020 for six megacities with different lockdown durations. Compared with the scenario without lockdowns, we estimated that the lockdown reduced ambient NO(2) concentrations by 36–53% during the most restrictive periods, which involved Level-1 public health emergency response control actions. Several cities lifted the Level-1 control actions during February and March, and the avoided NO(2) concentrations subsequently dropped below 10% in late April. Traffic analysis during the same periods in Beijing and Chengdu confirmed that traffic emission changes were a major factor in the substantial NO(2) reduction, but they were also associated with increased O(3) concentrations. The lockdown also reduced PM(2.5) concentrations, although heavy pollution episodes occurred on certain days due to the enhanced formation of secondary aerosols in association with the increased atmospheric oxidizing capacity. We also observed that the changes in air pollution levels decreased as the lockdown was gradually eased in various cities.","Wang, Yunjie; Wen, Yifan; Wang, Yue; Zhang, Shaojun; Zhang, K.

The article interprets the bolsonarism on the basis of the analysis of social and political conditions that allowed the moralization of politics to become the central axis of the power struggle.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical benefit of strategic planned relaparotomy in patients with NOMI using detailed perioperative information. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included NOMI patients who underwent laparotomy. In-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, incidence of total adverse events, ventilator-free days, and intensive care unit (ICU)–free days were compared between groups experiencing the planned and on-demand relaparotomy strategies. Analyses were performed using a multivariate mixed effects model and a propensity score matching model after adjusting for pre-operative, intra-operative, and hospital-related confounders. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients from 17 hospitals were included, of whom 107 (59.1%) were treated using the planned relaparotomy strategy. The multivariate mixed effects regression model indicated no significant differences for in-hospital mortality (61 patients [57.0%] in the planned relaparotomy group vs. 28 patients [37.8%] in the on-demand relaparotomy group; adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.94 [0.78–4.80]), as well as in 28-day mortality, adverse events, and ICU-free days. Significant reduction in ventilator-free days was observed in the planned relaparotomy group. Propensity score matching analysis of 61 matched pairs with comparable patient severity did not show superiority of the planned relaparotomy strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The planned relaparotomy strategy, compared with on-demand relaparotomy strategy, did not show clinical benefits after the initial surgery of patients with NOMI. Further studies estimating potential subpopulations who may benefit from this strategy are required.

For example, primate TRIM5α uses its rapidly evolving ‘v1’ loop to bind retroviral capsids, and single mutations in this loop can dramatically improve retroviral restriction. However, it is unknown whether such gains of viral restriction are rare, or if they incur loss of pre-existing function against other viruses. Using deep mutational scanning, we comprehensively measured how single mutations in the TRIM5α v1 loop affect restriction of divergent retroviruses. Unexpectedly, we found that the majority of mutations increase weak antiviral function. Moreover, most random mutations do not disrupt potent viral restriction, even when it is newly acquired via a single adaptive substitution. Our results indicate that TRIM5α’s adaptive landscape is remarkably broad and mutationally resilient, maximizing its chances of success in evolutionary arms races with retroviruses.","Tenthorey, Jeannette L; Young, Candice; Sodeinde, Afeez; Emerman, Michael; Malik, Harmit S",,605,1

Few studies have reported the findings of lung biopsies in COVID-19. Here, granulomatous inflammation was reported for the first time in COVID-19 lung biopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman presented to a primary care facility with fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Antibiotherapy was administered for 10 days with the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection. However, her condition did not improve and she was admitted to the hospital. In physical examination, crepitant rales were heard in both lungs. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were detected in laboratory tests and she was referred to the hematology clinic. Bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometry showed she had acute myeloid leukemia. Computed tomography-integrated positron emission tomography with a history of previous breast cancer revealed a heterogeneous mass-like lesion in the left lung. The primary malignancy could not be ruled out and tru-cut biopsy was performed. Tests for tuberculosis were negative. Throat swab sample was taken and a real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed that she had COVID-19. Radiological findings were evaluated as the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography 6 days after biopsy. Alveolar damage, edema, vascular congestion, mild inflammatory infiltration, type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial fibrosis, early fibrotic changes, fibrinous, organized pneumonia pattern, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, and desquamation in alveolar epithelial cells were noted in lung biopsy.

The acute effects of allergen‐challenge on nasal interleukin‐8 (IL‐8), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and α(2)‐macroglobulin were examined in atopic subjects with common cold symptoms. Twenty‐three patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16 outside the pollen season. Diluent and allergen challenges, followed by nasal lavages, were carried out about 3 months before and 4 days after virus inoculation. Seventeen patients developed significant common cold symptoms with increased nasal lavage fluid levels of α(2)‐macroglobulin, IL‐8, and ECP at baseline (p<0.001–0.05 versus before inoculation), and were further increased by allergen challenge (p<0.001–0.05); IL‐8 and ECP levels were correlated (r=0.63, p<0.001). Before inoculation, the six patients who later did not develop common cold symptoms had high levels of IL‐8 and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and exhibited strong allergen‐induced plasma exudation responses (α(2)‐macroglobulin). After inoculation, IL‐8 and ECP did not increase in these symptomless subjects. In conclusion, high nasal interleukin‐8 and myeloperoxidase levels and exudative hyperresponsiveness may protect against infection. The association between nasal interleukin‐8 and eosinophil cationic protein in common cold, particularly that observed in nasal lavage fluids after allergen‐induced acute exudation of plasma, suggests the involvement of interleukin‐8 in exacerbation of airway mucosal eosinophil activity.","Greiff, L.; Andersson, M.; Svensson, C; Linden, M; Myint, S; Persson, C.G.a",Eur Respir J,605,1

METHODS: A questionnaire requesting general data, staff data and workload data of the centers was developed and sent by means of an online cloud-based software instrument to all Italian pediatric surgery Units. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 34 (65%) out of 52 centers. NICU bedside surgery is reported in 81.8% of the pediatric surgery centers. A lower prevalence of bedside surgical practice in the NICU was reported for Southern Italy and the islands than for Northern Italy and Central Italy (Southern <Northern<Central, p < 0.03). The most frequent clinical characteristics of neonates was preterm neonates with birthweight < 1200 g, with cardiorespiratory instability and/or ventilatory dependence. The most frequently selected indications to surgery were pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, central venous catheter (CVC) positioning, intestinal perforation, patent ductus arteriosus ligation and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. More than 60% of respondents report no institutional recommendations and dedicated informed consent on bedside surgical procedures. The lack of dedicated areas and infrastructures is considered a relative contraindication to the performance of bedside surgery.

Recently,the emergence of carbapenem resistance strains are constantly being reported and a growing source of concern for pediatricians. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported 4 cases of neonatal septicemia caused by Raoultella planticola. Their gestational age was 211 to 269 days, and their birth weight was 1490 to 3000 g.The R. planticola infections were detected on the 9th to 27th day after hospitalization and occured between May and June. They clinically manifested as poor mental response, recurrent cyanosis, apnea, decreased heart rate and blood oxygen, recurrent jaundice, fever or nonelevation of body temperature. The C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were elevated at significantly in the initial phase of the infection,and they had leukocytosis or leukopenia. Prior to R.planticola infection,all of them recevied at least one broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-27d.All the R.planticola strains detected were only sensitive to amikacin, but resistant to other groups of drugs: cephalosporins (such as cefazolin, ceftetan,etc) and penicillins (such as ampicillin-sulbactam,piperacillin,etc),and even developed resistance to carbapenem. All the infants were clinically cured and discharged with overall good prognosis. CONCLUSION: Neonatal septicemia caused by Raoultella planticola mostly occured in hot and humid summer, which lack specific clinical manifestations. Pediatricians should keep in mind that R. planticola can be a potential source of neonatal sepsis and even has the potential to acquire carbapenem-resistance.

In all three experiments, the load was manipulated using an auditory 2-back task.

In Experiment 1 we demonstrated an effect of cognitive load such that there was a lower proportion of fixations and time spent fixating toward the confederate in the load condition. A similar pattern of results was found in Experiment 2 when a within-subject design was used. In Experiment 3, which employed a less authentic social situation (i.e., video), a similar effect of cognitive load was observed.

Amid speculation about the far-reaching effects of temporarily applicable measures and foresights about the advent of an ethos that has been heralded by the media as the ‘new normal’, the ubiquitous phenomenon of social distancing calls for a fundamental ontological elucidation. The purported hermeneutic that is situated in the broader place branding and experiential marketing literatures places Covid-19 in the shoes of Being, and, therefore, imagines how Being would behave ontologically if it were a virus. By arguing that the virus does operate like Being, five theses are put forward as experiential interpretive categories with regard to the ontological status of Covid-19. The adopted approach makes the following contributions to the extant literature: First, it addresses a wholly new phenomenon in place branding, namely a pre-branded place whose meaning is non-negotiable, globally applicable and seemingly equivalent to pure void. Second, it advances the application of phenomenological research in place branding and experiential consumption by highlighting the aptness of the so far peripheral (in the marketing discipline) strand of Heideggerian fundamental ontology. Third, it extends the meaning of place in the place branding literature, by showing how spatialization is the outcome of temporalization, in line with the adopted phenomenological perspective.","Rossolatos, George",Place Brand Public Dipl,605,1

This paper presents a robotic system developed as a personal coach for older adults aiming to motivate older adults to participate in physical activities. The robot instructs the participants, demonstrates the exercises and provides real-time corrective and positive feedback according to the participant’s performance as monitored by an RGB-D camera. Two robotic systems based on two different humanoid robots (Nao, toy-like and Poppy, mechanical-like) were developed and implemented using the Python programming language. Experimental studies with 32 older adults were conducted, to determine the preferable mode and timing of the feedback provided to the user to accommodate user preferences, motivate the users and improve their interaction with the system. Additionally, user preferences with regards to the two different humanoid robots used were explored. The results revealed that the system motivated the older adults to engage more in physical exercises. The type and timing of feedback influenced this engagement. Most of these older adults also perceived the system as very useful, easy to use, had a positive attitude towards the system and noted their intention to use it. Most users preferred the more mechanical looking robot (Poppy) over the toy-like robot (Nao).","Avioz-Sarig, Omri; Olatunji, Samuel; Sarne-Fleischmann, Vardit; Edan, Yael",Int J Soc Robot,605,1

Considering that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is involved in cellular detoxification, it may play an important role in susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or its outcome. In the present study, the association between the Ile105Val GSTP1 polymorphism (rs1695) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its outcome was investigated. Data on the prevalence (per 10(6) people), case-fatality (per 100 infected cases), and mortality (per 10(6) people) of COVID-19 and various potential confounders (the life expectancy at birth, density of medical doctors, density of nursing and midwifery personnel, and the gross national income per capita) were used. The latest data available for 45 countries were used for the study. RESULTS: In multivariate linear regression analyses, the Val105 allelic frequency showed positive association with the log-prevalence (partial r = 0.308, p = 0.042) and log-mortality of COVID-19 (partial r = 0.316, p = 0.037). The log-fatality did not show association with the allelic frequency. In the next step, only countries with the gross national income per capita more than $15,000 were included in the analysis. In the selected countries, the frequency of Val105 was positively associated with the log-prevalence (partial r = 0.456, p = 0.009) and log-mortality of COVID-19 (partial r = 0.544, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that countries with higher Val105 allelic frequency of the rs1695 polymorphism showed higher prevalence and mortality of COVID-19.","Saadat, Mostafa",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,605,1

While other causes of pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) respond to fluid infusion, HRS does not. HRS incidence is 5% in children with chronic liver conditions before liver transplantation. Type 1 HRS is an acute and rapidly progressive form that often develops after a precipitating factor, including gastrointestinal bleeding or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, while type 2 is considered a slowly progressive form of kidney failure that often occurs spontaneously in chronic ascites settings. HRS pathogenesis is multifactorial. Cirrhosis causes portal hypertension; therefore, stasis and release of vasodilator substances occur in the hepatic vascular bed, leading to vasodilatation of splanchnic arteries and systemic hypotension. Many mechanisms seem to work together to cause this imbalance: splanchnic vasodilatation; vasoactive mediators; hyperdynamic circulation states and subsequent cardiac dysfunction; neuro-hormonal mechanisms; changes in sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, and vasopressin. In patients with AKI and cirrhosis, fluid expansion therapy needs to be initiated as soon as possible and nephrotoxic drugs discontinued. Once HRS is diagnosed, pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors, mainly terlipressin plus albumin, should be initiated. If there is no response, other options can include surgical venous shunts and kidney replacement therapy. In this regard, extracorporeal liver support can be a bridge for liver transplantation, which remains as the ideal treatment. Further studies are necessary to investigate early biomarkers and alternative treatments for HRS.","Liu, Priscila Menezes Ferri; de Carvalho, Sarah Tayná; Fradico, Pollyanna Faria; Cazumbá, Maria Luiza Barreto; Campos, Ramon Gustavo Bernardino; Simões e Silva, Ana Cristina",Pediatr Nephrol,605,1

Rift Valley fever is endemic in sub‐Saharan Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula, with periodic epidemics characterised by 5–15 years of inter‐epizootic periods. In the last two decades, RVF was notified in new African regions (e.g. Sahel), RVF epidemics occurred more frequently and low‐level enzootic virus circulation has been demonstrated in livestock in various areas. Recent outbreaks in a French overseas department and some seropositive cases detected in Turkey, Tunisia and Libya raised the attention of the EU for a possible incursion into neighbouring countries. The movement of live animals is the most important pathway for RVF spread from the African endemic areas to North Africa and the Middle East. The movement of infected animals and infected vectors when shipped by flights, containers or road transport is considered as other plausible pathways of introduction into Europe. The overall risk of introduction of RVF into EU through the movement of infected animals is very low in all the EU regions and in all MSs (less than one epidemic every 500 years), given the strict EU animal import policy. The same level of risk of introduction in all the EU regions was estimated also considering the movement of infected vectors, with the highest level for Belgium, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands (one epidemic every 228–700 years), mainly linked to the number of connections by air and sea transports with African RVF infected countries. Although the EU territory does not seem to be directly exposed to an imminent risk of RVFV introduction, the risk of further spread into countries neighbouring the EU and the risks of possible introduction of infected vectors, suggest that EU authorities need to strengthen their surveillance and response capacities, as well as the collaboration with North African and Middle Eastern countries.","Nielsen, Søren Saxmose; Alvarez, Julio; Bicout, Dominique Joseph; Calistri, Paolo; Depner, Klaus; Drewe, Julian Ashley; Garin‐Bastuji, Bruno; Rojas, José Luis Gonzales; Schmidt, Christian Gortázar; Michel, Virginie; Chueca, Miguel Ángel Miranda; Roberts, Helen Clare; Sihvonen, Liisa Helena; Stahl, Karl; Calvo, Antonio Velarde; Viltrop, Arvo; Winckler, Christoph; Bett, Bernard; Cetre‐Sossah, Catherine; Chevalier, Veronique; Devos, Clazien; Gubbins, Simon; Monaco, Federica; Sotiria‐Eleni, Antoniou; Broglia, Alessandro; Abrahantes, José Cortiñas; Dhollander, Sofie; Stede, Yves Van Der; Zancanaro, Gabriele",EFSA J,605,1

This paper examines this and related contemporary terms, in order to consider the complex and contradictory nature of enforced sites of isolation, with reference to the historical literature. The centrality of spatial practices in the current pandemic is emphasised, with a focus on the normally unobserved, micro practices of individuals under ‘lockdown’. The paper reports on an interview study conducted at a large UK Higher Education institution during the Covid-19 ‘lockdown’, and analyses the accounts of six academics, focusing particularly on their embodied and sociomaterial practices, with reference to the etymological analysis. The paper considers the extent to which their reported experiences reflect the various meanings of the term sequestrato, going on to propose that their working practices, particularly focused on screens and video calls, are characterised by a need to ‘perform the university’. I speculate on how the ontological nature of the university itself has been fundamentally altered by the closure of the campus and lockdown, proposing that the site of the university is now radically dispersed across these sequestered bodies. I conclude by calling into the question the accuracy of the term ‘online teaching and learning’, instead suggesting that in a fundamental sense, none of these practices is in fact ‘online’ or digital.","Gourlay, Lesley",Postdigit Sci Educ,605,1

Therefore, communication structures should be established in order to prevent information gaps between medical partners, particularly in case of larger geographical distances. OBJECTIVE: The article describes different kinds of electronic record systems and emphasizes the differences between electronic case records, managed by medical doctors, and electronic health records (EHR), which will be introduced on January 1, 2021. Some useful applications and experiences in the use of intersectoral health records are presented MATERIALS AND METHODS: Communication via EHR must follow current guidelines and approved concepts. As application scenarios in oncologic care or advisory services for COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care or nephrology patients, some experiences of the EHR provider RZV are presented. Finally, a forecast for the period beginning January 1, 2021, describes the linkage of electronic case records with the EHR. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The electronic case record has proven its usefulness in several intersectoral settings. In addition to direct integration into primary systems, it enables an entirely digital communication processes. Additional services, e.g., provision of image data or online forms, can increase the acceptance of electronic case records. In the future, it will be important to link electronic case records directly with the EHR, to avoid placing an increased burden on physicians during communication with other service providers and patients.","Stein, M.",MKG-Chirurg,605,1

In this study, at first, a discriminatory structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was employed, but only one active compound (compound 1, IC(50) = 2.25 μM) was identified. The low hit rate (2.63%) which derives from the weak discriminatory power of docking among high-scored molecules was observed in our virtual screening (VS) process for IRAK1 inhibitor. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI) method, which employed a support vector machine (SVM) model, integrated information of molecular docking, pharmacophore scoring and molecular descriptors was constructed to enhance the traditional IRAK1-VS protocol. Using AI, it was found that VS of IRAK1 inhibitors excluded by over 50% of the inactive compounds, which could significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the SBVS model. Moreover, four active molecules (two of which exhibited comparative IC(50) with compound 1) were accurately identified from a set of highly similar candidates. Amongst, compounds with better activity exhibited good selectivity against IRAK4. The AI assisted workflow could serve as an effective tool for enhancement of SBVS.","Che, Jinxin; Feng, Ruiwei; Gao, Jian; Yu, Hongyun; Weng, Qinjie; He, Qiaojun; Dong, Xiaowu; Wu, Jian; Yang, Bo",Front Oncol,605,1

AIMS: To determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental-health and pregnancy plans of women with IBD. METHODS: Women with IBD (age 18–45) were asked to anonymously complete surveys on baseline demographics, IBD characteristics, and mental health comorbidities. They were also asked to comment on prior symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and whether they were tested for the virus. Finally, patients were asked to complete three mental health surveys to reflect on anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7)), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) symptoms prior to and during the pandemic. Total scores were reported as continuous variables and means with standard deviations (SD) were compared using paired T-tests. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (12 UC, 17 CD) were included. 14 patients were preconception, 12 were pregnant, and 3 were post-partum. The mean age was 31.4 (SD 3.7). Fifteen of 29 (51.7%) of patients were on anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Twelve (41.4%) and 6 (20.7%) patients had pre-morbid anxiety and depression prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 symptoms were reported in 8 patients (27.5%). Six patients had undergone COVID-19 testing, all of whom had a negative test. Four patients indicated that COVID-19 had negatively affected their plans for pregnancy, with reasons reported including fear of the hospital (n=1), fear of COVID-19 impact on the fetus (n=2), and uncertainty on the duration of COVID-19 (n=1). During the pandemic, fourteen of 28 (50%) patients experienced symptoms of anxiety (GAD score > 5), with a majority (70%) experiencing mild symptoms (score 5–9). During the pandemic, 60.7% (17/28) and 71.4% (20/28) reported symptoms of depression (PHQ9 > 4) and at least moderate stress (PSS > 14) respectively. Furthermore, compared to pre-pandemic, 57.1% (16/28) and 67.9% (19/28) had an increase in depression and stress symptoms during the pandemic respectively. This appeared to only apply to those with CD, but not UC (Table 1). Compared to pre-pandemic, those with stricturing CD appeared to have higher stress scores whereas those with fistulizing and perianal disease appeared to have higher depression scores during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1). A lower house-hold income and a reduction in exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to increase the risk of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of women with IBD indicate worsening of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains critical that health-care professionals address these mental health concerns during these otherwise difficult times.

Living in rural locations may pose a barrier to regular specialist care. Saskatchewan (SK) has a large rural population. Prior to COVID-19, telehealth (TH) in SK was not routinely used for either patient assessment or follow up. Furthermore, TH was exclusively between hospitals and specific TH sites without direct contact using patient’s personal phones. AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess the differences in demographics, disease characteristics, outcomes, and health care utilization between patients from rural SK with IBD who used TH and those who did not. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed on all rural patients (postal code S0*) with IBD in SK who were followed at the Multidisciplinary IBD Clinic in Saskatoon between January 2018 and February 2020. Patients were classified as using TH if they had ever used it. Information on demographics, disease characteristics, and access to IBD-related health care in the year prior to their last IBD clinic visit or endoscopy was collected. Data was not collected for clinic visits after March 1, 2020 as all outpatient care became remote secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mean, standard deviations, median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported. Mann-Witney U and Chi-Square tests were used to determine differences between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 288 rural SK IBD patients were included, 30 (10.4%) used TH and 258 (89.6%) did not. Patient demographics were not significantly different between the two groups; although, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of ulcerative colitis patients (17% TH vs. 38% non-TH, p=0.02). The percentage of patients with clinical remission was 87% for TH patients and 74% for non-TH patients (p=0.13). There were no significant differences in health care utilization patterns and biochemical markers of disease, including c-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FCP) (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the pandemic, a small percentage of patients with IBD in rural SK ever used TH. A small proportion of UC patients used TH. No significant differences in disease characteristics, outcomes, or health care utilization were identified. Further study is warranted to identify barriers to use of this technology to tailor care to this patient group and improve access to care, especially now as the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the use of virtual care.

The obesity index has almost tripled since 1975, which is an alarming state. Most of the individuals are currently becoming overweight or have inappropriate body mass index (BMI) conditions. Obesity is characterized by increased fat accumulation and thus poses a higher health risk. There is increased size and volume of fat cells in the body, which usually accounts for obesity. Many investigations have been carried out in this area, such as behavioral improvements, dietary changes, chemical involvements, etc., but presently no such goals are established to manage these health concerns. Based on previous literature reports and our interpretation, the current review indicates the involvement of various transcriptional and transporter functions in modifying the above-mentioned health conditions. Various transcriptional factors such as Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) impart a significant effect on the physiology and pathology of metabolic dysfunction such as obesity. FoxO1 plays a dual role whether in the progression or suppression of metabolic processes depending on its targets. Thus, in the current study, will be discussed the dual role of FoxO1 in metabolic conditions (such as obesity), also summarizing the role of various other transcriptional factors involved in obesity.","Behl, Tapan; Kaur, Ishnoor; Sehgal, Aayush; Singh, Sukhbir; Zengin, Gokhan; Negrut, Nicoleta; Nistor-Cseppento, Delia Carmen; Pavel, Flavia Maria; Corb Aron, Raluca Anca; Bungau, Simona",Int J Mol Sci,605,1

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the primary drug used for the treatment of KD, which may significantly reduce the occurrence of coronary artery lesions. However, the specific molecular profile changes of KD caused by IVIG treatment have remained elusive and require further research. The present study was designed to identify key genes, pathways and immune cells affected by IVIG treatment using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods. The results suggested that myeloid cells and neutrophils were affected by IVIG treatment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis identified that hematopoietic cell lineages and osteoclast differentiation may have an important role in the mechanism of action of IVIG treatment. Immune cell analysis indicated that the levels of monocytes, M1 macrophages, neutrophils and platelets were markedly changed in patients with KD after vs. prior to IVIG treatment. The key upregulated genes, including ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein, GINS complex subunit 1 and microRNA-30b-3p in whole blood cells of patients with KD following treatment with IVIG indicated that these IVIG-targeted molecules may have important roles in KD. In addition, these genes were further examined by literature review and indicated to be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and virus-related immune response in patients with KD. Therefore, the present results may provide novel insight into the mechanisms of action of IVIG treatment for KD.","Huang, Hongbiao; Xu, Lei; Ding, Yueyue; Qin, Jie; Huang, Chengcheng; Li, Xuan; Tang, Yunjia; Qian, Guanghui; Lv, Haitao",Exp Ther Med,605,1

This study aimed to assess the prevalence, cardiovascular risk factors, and used medications of CAD in AF patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, case-control study utilized data from the Jordanian Atrial Fibrillation (Jo-Fib) registry. Investigators collected clinical features, history of co-existing comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc, and HAS BLED scores for all AF patients aged >18 visiting 19 hospitals and 30 outpatient cardiology clinics. A multivariable binary logistic regression was used to asses for factors associated with higher odds of having CAD. Results: Out of 2000 patients with AF, 227 (11.35%) had CAD. Compared to the rest of the sample, those with CAD had significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (82.38%; p < 0.01), hypercholesterolemia (66.52%, p < 0.01), diabetes (56.83%, p < 0.01), and smoking (18.06%, p = 0.04). Patients with AF and CAD had higher use of anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents combination (p < 0.01) compared to the rest of the sample. Females had lower CAD risk than males (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24–0.50). AF Patients with dyslipidemia (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.8–3.4), smoking (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1–2.6), higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.4–1.7), and asymptomatic AF (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3–2.6) had higher risk for CAD. Conclusions: Owing to the increased prevalence of CAD in patients with AF, better control of cardiac risk factors is recommended for this special group. Future studies should investigate such interesting relationships to stratify CAD risk in AF patients. We believe that this study adds valuable information regarding the prevalence, epidemiological characteristics, and pharmacotherapy of CAD in patients with AF.","Al-Makhamreh, Hanna K.; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Q.; Shaban, Ala’ E.; Obiedat, Abdelrahman F.; Hammoudeh, Ayman J.",Medicina (Kaunas),605,1

The data were collected from 10,042 rural households in six Chinese provinces. The results reveal that rural residents with internet access have significantly higher energy, protein, and fat intake than those without. Chinese rural residents with internet access consumed 1.35% (28.62 kcal), 5.02% (2.61 g), and 4.33% (3.30 g) more energy, protein, and fat, respectively. There was heterogeneity in regard to the intake of energy, protein, and fat among those in different income groups. Moreover, non-staple food consumption is the main channel through which internet access affects nutritional intake. The results demonstrate that the local population uses the internet to improve their nutritional status.

Current treatments either are less effective or result in further acquired resistance. At the same time, several new antimicrobial discovery approaches are expensive, slow, and relatively poorly equipped for translation into the clinical world. Therefore, the use of nanomaterials is presented as a suitable solution. In particular, this review discusses selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) as one of the most promising therapeutic agents based in the nanoscale to treat infections effectively. This work summarizes the latest advances in the synthesis of SeNPs and their progress as antimicrobial agents using traditional and biogenic approaches. While physiochemical methods produce consistent nanostructures, along with shortened processing procedures and potential for functionalization of designs, green or biogenic synthesis represents a quick, inexpensive, efficient, and eco-friendly approach with more promise for tunability and versatility. In the end, the clinical translation of SeNPs faces various obstacles, including uncertain in vivo safety profiles and mechanisms of action and unclear regulatory frameworks.

The aim of our retrospective study was to explore the dose–response patterns associated with RP by a multi-center voxel-based analysis. In a heterogeneously treated population of 382 thoracic cancer patients, we confirmed the previously described heart–lung interaction in the development of RP. The empowerment of VBA with a novel description of dose map spatial properties based on probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) and connectograms provided valuable additional and independent information on the radiobiology of RP. ABSTRACT: This study investigates the dose–response patterns associated with radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients treated for thoracic malignancies with different radiation modalities. To this end, voxel-based analysis (VBA) empowered by a novel strategy for the characterization of spatial properties of dose maps was applied. Data from 382 lung cancer and mediastinal lymphoma patients from three institutions treated with different radiation therapy (RT) techniques were analyzed. Each planning CT and biologically effective dose map (α/β = 3 Gy) was spatially normalized on a common anatomical reference. The VBA of local dose differences between patients with and without RP was performed and the clusters of voxels with dose differences that significantly correlated with RP at a p-level of 0.05 were generated accordingly. The robustness of VBA inference was evaluated by a novel characterization for spatial properties of dose maps based on probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) and connectograms. This lays robust foundations to the obtained findings that the lower parts of the lungs and the heart play a prominent role in the development of RP. Connectograms showed that the dataset can support a radiobiological differentiation between the main heart and lung substructures.","Palma, Giuseppe; Monti, Serena; Pacelli, Roberto; Liao, Zhongxing; Deasy, Joseph O.; Mohan, Radhe; Cella, Laura",Cancers (Basel),605,1

Substantial efforts have been made to prevent suicide for many decades. The internet has become an important arena for suicide prevention and intervention. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one study has analyzed suicidal comments online from the perspective of rhetorical structure with incomplete rhetorical relations. We aimed to examine the rhetorical differences between Chinese social media users who died by suicide and those without suicidal ideation. Methods: The posts of 15 users who died by suicide and 15 not suffering from suicide ideation were annotated by five postgraduates with expertise in analyzing suicidal posts based on rhetorical structure theory (RST). Group differences were compared via a chi-square test. Results: Results showed that users who died by suicide posted significantly more posts and used more rhetorical relations. Moreover, the two groups displayed significant differences in 17 out of 23 rhetorical relations. Limitations: Because this study is largely exploratory and tentative, caution should be taken in generalizing our findings. Conclusions: Our results expand the methods of RST to the online suicidal identification field. There are implications for population-based suicide prevention by combining rhetorical structures with context analysis.","Liu, Xingyun; Liu, Xiaoqian",Healthcare (Basel),605,1

Upon mixing with Na-alginate, followed by gelation and freeze-dying, highly macroporous composite scaffolds were obtained with open and connected pores and uniformly dispersed mineral phase as determined by scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties of the scaffolds were influenced by the composition of calcium phosphate fillers being improved as Ca2+ concentration increased while Mg2+ concentration decreased. HAP formation within all scaffolds was investigated in simulated body fluid (SBF) during 28 days under static conditions while the best candidate (Mg substituted HAP filler, precursor solution with [Ca + Mg]/P molar ratio of 1.52) was investigated under more physiological conditions in a biomimetic perfusion bioreactor. The continuous SBF flow (superficial velocity of 400 µm/s) induced the formation of abundant HAP crystals throughout the scaffolds leading to improved mechanical properties to some extent as compared to the initial scaffolds.

Several studies have been conducted to decide whether the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients indicate COVID-19. While these efforts resulted in successful classification systems, the design of a portable and cost-effective COVID-19 diagnosis system has not been addressed yet. The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm. Second, the global features are extracted from the chest X-ray or CT scans using multi-channel fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments (MFrLFMs). Finally, the most significant features (local and global) are selected. The proposed system steps are integrated to fit the low computational and memory capacities of the embedded system. The proposed method has the smallest computational and memory resources,less than the state-of-the-art methods by two to three orders of magnitude, among existing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods.","Hosny, Khalid M; Darwish, Mohamed M; Li, Kenli; Salah, Ahmad",PLoS One,605,31

Hospital facilities especially the ambulatory clinics began to adjust the ways to triage, assess and treat patients by using methods that do not rely on traditional face-face encounter. Here, we present one such scenario from the initial phase of pandemic in which team effort was involved in a diabetic emergency to overcome the barriers of emergent ambulatory care. Case Description: We present a 78-year-old female with past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, multi-nodular goiter, hypertension, mild coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure and dyslipidemia who called the clinic with an elevated point of care glucose of 436mg/dl. Other symptoms included high fever, polyuria and polydipsia having just been discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. She was on metformin 500 mg twice a day, glimepiride 2 mg daily, methimazole 5 mg daily, carvedilol 12.5 mg twice a day, losartan 100 mg daily, pravastatin 20 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg daily. Her most recent blood work showed an A1C of 8% (7.4 and 7.1 last year), TSH - 0.29 (0.4 -4.5 mIU/ml), FT4 - 1.1 (0.8–1.8 ng/ml), metabolic panel showed plasma glucose of 283 mg/dl along with normal electrolytes and kidney function. The patient was admitted to hospital about a week ago with flu like illness and high fever and was found to be COVID positive and was discharged home with instructions on isolation and follow up. However, while at home she noticed hyperglycemia 400–500 mg/dl despite oral agents, associated with polyuria and polydipsia but no nausea or vomiting. Given the significant symptomatic hyperglycemia along with symptomatic COVID infection it was clear that she acutely needed insulin therapy. As the patient was insulin naïve and COVID positive, there were several barriers in initiating insulin without hospitalization: we could not get her into the Endocrine office and she was declined ED evaluation because of her COVID positivity. She and the family were relatively computer novice so could not access our electronic health record video system. After discussion over the phone, our certified diabetes educator walked them through the process of downloading an app for video communication. Utilizing remote video communication, the patient’s 20-year-old grandson was educated on all the steps of Insulin use for the patient as she was still delirious. Gratifyingly, she responded well to initiation of insulin and subsequent glucoses were in the 100’s along with improvement in her symptoms. Conclusion: This case emphasizes how team effort and the zeal of health care community to serve patients can overcome shortcomings.","Mundada, Rachana Marco Cheryl Miller Jeffrey L.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,605,16

Methods: The experimental study method was adopted. DPCs from the vibrissa of male C57BL/6J mice aged 5 to 6 weeks and keratinocytes (KCs) from the skin of newborn C57BL/6J mice were obtained by enzyme-digestion method. Stable expression of DPCs markers such as nerve cell adhesion molecules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ß-catenin, and &#945;-smooth muscle actin were identified by immunofluorescence method in the third passage of the former cells, while the latter primary cells stably expressed keratin 15, a marker of KCs. The 8th passage of DPCs were resuspended with GelMA and inoculated on the bottom surface of the Transwell plate insert, and then the GelMA drops were photocrosslinked and cultured upside down later. The DPCs aggregation in the GelMA drops after culture of 0 (immediately) and 3 day (s) was observed under an optical microscope (the DPCs aggregates were the biomimetic DPSs). Cell viability in biomimetic DPSs cultured for 3 days was detected by live/dead staining kit. The primary DPCs and the 8th passage of DPCs with traditionally two-dimensional culture, and the biomimetic DPSs prepared by the above-mentioned method were set as primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing was performed of 3 samples in each group after three days of culture using the high-throughput sequencing technology platform. The principal component analysis, Pearson similarity analysis, and differentially expressed genes screening were performed using OmicShare Tools based on the transcriptome data. Cluster analysis of expression patterns of differentially expressed genes was performed using time series trend analysis software. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes with specific expression patterns were performed using the OmicShare Tools. The cells were grouped as before, and the sex determining region Y-Box 8 (SOX8), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), collagen type &#935;&#935;â ¥ alpha 1 chain (COL26A1), and wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 6 (Wnt6) were screened out from the differentially expressed genes according to the random number table, which were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to verify the consistency between mRNA expression of differentially expressed genes and sequencing results (n=9); the mRNA expressions of DPCs biological function markers fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), Wnt10a, lymphoid enhancement factor 1 (LEF1), ALP, ß-catenin, versican, and SOX2 were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR (n=9). Three male BALB/c nude mice aged 5-6 weeks were divided into primary DPCs group, 8th passage of DPCs group, and biomimetic DPSs group. The primary DPCs, the 8th passage of DPCs, and the biomimetic DPSs were mixed with primary KCs at a ratio of 2â¶1 in cell number and then injected subcutaneously into corresponding groups, with 6 injection regions for each mouse. Two weeks after the injection, the full-thickness skin of the injection region was taken, the regenerated hair was counted, and regenerated hair follicle was observed after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, Tukey test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: After 3 days of culture, DPCs aggregated into biomimetic DPSs in GelMA hanging drops from the dispersed state on culture day 0, and the cells in the biomimetic DPSs had good cell activity. After 3 days of culture, principal component analysis showed that compared with that of 8th passage of DPCs group, the variation degree among samples within primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was relatively close, and the variation degree was the lowest between samples of biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group; the variation degree of gene profile data of more than 90% of DPCs samples in 3 groups could be explained by the first and second principal components. Pearson similarity analysis showed that samples within each group had good repeatability. The similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group was 0.84-0.95, and the similarity between samples of primary DPCs group and 8th passage of DPCs group was 0.72-0.87. The differentially expressed genes among the three groups were analyzed and 642 differentially expressed genes with group intersection were screened out. Clusters of expression patterns showed that two gene expression patterns showed a significant trend (P<0.05), the first pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly lower than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, and the second pattern showed that gene expression of 8th passage of DPCs group was significantly higher than that of primary DPCs group or biomimetic DPSs group, including a total of 411 differentially expressed genes. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 411 differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in Wnt signaling pathway and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway (P<0.05), while GO enrichment analysis showed that GO terms such as extracellular matrix, classical Wnt signaling pathway, and cell differentiation were significantly enriched (P<0.05). The mRNA expressions of SOX8, MMP-9, COL26A1 and Wnt6 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group (q=15.950, 8.854, 11.890, 11.050, 9.851, 5.884, 7.418, 4.870, P<0.01), consistent with the sequencing data. Compared with those of primary DPCs group and biomimetic DPSs group, the mRNA expressions of FGF7, Wnt10a, LEF1, ALP, ß-catenin, versican, and SOX2 in 8th passage of DPCs group were significantly decreased (q=11.470, 9.795, 4.165, 9.242, 10.970, 10.570, 8.005, 7.472, 4.976, 3.651, 4.784, 5.236, 6.825, 5.214, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Two weeks after injection, nude mice in 8th passage of DPCs group failed to regenerate hair, while the numbers of hair regenerated in biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group were close (q=1.852, P>0.05) and both were significantly higher than the number of 8th passage of DPCs group (q=18.980, 17.130, P<0.01). In 8th passage of DPCs group, only necrotic foci were found in the injection region of the skin of nude mice, while regenerated hair follicles were observed in the injection region of both biomimetic DPSs group and primary DPCs group, and melanosis was observed in the cross section of hair follicles. Conclusions: Based on GelMA biomimetic microenvironment and hanging drop method, the biomimetic DPSs culturing model prepared by three dimensional culture of DPCs can restore the hair follicle inducing ability of high passage of DPCs to a certain extent, and its biological characteristics are more similar to those of the primary DPCs, which can restore the characteristics of DPCs.","Huang, G; Chen, L",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,605,27

However, unlike most other countries, much of Sweden's implementation focused on voluntary and stepwise action, rather than legislation and compulsory measures, leading to considerable attention in the international media.Six main narratives emerged in the international media reporting on Sweden during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) Life is normal in Sweden, (2) Sweden has a herd immunity strategy, (3) Sweden is not following expert advice, (4) Sweden is not following WHO recommendations (5) the Swedish approach is failing and (6) Swedes trust the government. While these narratives are partially grounded in reality, in some media outlets, the language and examples used to frame the story distorted the accuracy of the reporting.This debate examines the ways in which international media both constructs and represents a pandemic, and the implications for how researchers engage with news and social media. Cross-country comparison and the sharing of best practice are reliant on accurate information. The Swedish example underlines the importance of fact checking and source critique and the need for precision when presenting data and statistics. It also highlights limitations of using culture as an explanation for behavior, and the pitfalls of evaluating policy during a pandemic.","Irwin, Rachel Elisabeth",Global Health,605,16

As a result, novel methods ranging from asset network estimation to hierarchical asset selection and portfolio allocation are now part of practitioners' toolboxes. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian structural constraints from the point of view of financial market times series data. In particular, we present natural justifications, supported by empirical evidence, for the usage of the Laplacian matrix as a model for the precision matrix of financial assets, while also establishing a direct link that reveals how Laplacian constraints are coupled to meaningful physical interpretations related to the market index factor and to conditional correlations between stocks. Those interpretations lead to a set of guidelines that practitioners should be aware of when estimating graphs in financial markets. In addition, we design numerical algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to learn undirected, weighted graphs that take into account stylized facts that are intrinsic to financial data such as heavy tails and modularity. We illustrate how to leverage the learned graphs into practical scenarios such as stock time series clustering and foreign exchange network estimation. The proposed graph learning algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in an extensive set of practical experiments. Furthermore, we obtain theoretical and empirical convergence results for the proposed algorithms. Along with the developed methodologies for graph learning in financial markets, we release an R package, called fingraph, accommodating the code and data to obtain all the experimental results.","Cardoso, Jos'e Vin'icius de Miranda; Ying, Jiaxi; Palomar, Daniel Perez",,605,29

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of these interventions is required. OBJECTIVES: Using a living systematic review approach, to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence. SEARCH METHODS: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform, and trial registries. Searches were done on 17 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. For safety assessments, we also included non-controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if 500 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 2' tool for RCTs, and for NRSIs, the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence, using the GRADE approach, for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, improvement and worsening of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease), quality of life (including fatigue and functional independence), grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies (12 RCTs, 1 NRSI) with 48,509 participants, of whom 41,880 received convalescent plasma. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We identified a further 100 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, and 33 studies reporting as being completed or terminated. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease Eleven RCTs and one NRSI investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 48,349 participants with moderate to severe disease. Nine RCTs compared convalescent plasma to placebo treatment or standard care alone, and two compared convalescent plasma to standard plasma (results not included in abstract). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We included data on nine RCTs (12,875 participants) to assess the effectiveness of convalescent plasma compared to placebo or standard care alone. Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 12,646 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on clinical improvement for all participants when assessed by liberation from respiratory support (RR not estimable; 8 RCTs, 12,682 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on the chance of being weaned or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation for the subgroup of participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.93; 2 RCTs, 630 participants; low-certainty evidence). It does not reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; 4 RCTs, 11,765 participants; high-certainty evidence). We did not identify any subgroup differences. We did not identify any studies reporting quality of life, and therefore, do not know whether convalescent plasma has any impact on quality of life. One RCT assessed resolution of fatigue on day 7, but we are very uncertain about the effect (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42; 309 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Safety of convalescent plasma We included results from eight RCTs, and one NRSI, to assess the safety of convalescent plasma. Some of the RCTs reported on safety data only for the convalescent plasma group. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma increases or reduces the risk of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; 4 RCTs, 905 participants; low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.90; 2 RCTs, 414 participants; low-certainty evidence). A summary of reported events of the NRSI (reporting safety data for 20,000 of 35,322 transfused participants), and four RCTs reporting safety data only for transfused participants (6125 participants) are included in the full text. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and asymptomatic or mild disease We identified one RCT reporting on 160 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo treatment (saline). Effectiveness of convalescent plasma We are very uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.65; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of convalescent plasma on developing severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms (RR not estimable; low-certainty evidence). We identified no study reporting quality of life. Safety of convalescent plasma We do not know whether convalescent plasma is associated with a higher risk of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). This is a living systematic review. We search weekly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have high certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for the treatment of individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on measures of clinical improvement. We are uncertain about the adverse effects of convalescent plasma. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, heterogeneous reporting of outcomes is still problematic. There are 100 ongoing studies and 33 studies reporting in a study registry as being completed or terminated. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around hyperimmune immunoglobulin therapy for people with any disease severity, and convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease.","Piechotta, Vanessa; Iannizzi, Claire; Chai, Khai Li; Valk, Sarah J; Kimber, Catherine; Dorando, Elena; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail A; Roberts, David J; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,605,16

Within 10 days of identification of the first healthcare worker infection, both hospitals had closed, and all patients were discharged or decanted to other facilities within the state. The entire hospital staff (approximately 1300 people) and their households (approximately 3000-4000 people) were furloughed for 14 days to halt the spread of infection. During the furlough period, a decommissioning, terminal clean and recommissioning process was undertaken alongside recovery and reorientation of the workforce to personal protective equipment. Within 4 days of closure, an Australian Defence Force and Australian Medical Assistance Team team opened the prioritised emergency department to provide emergency care for the local community, supported by modified diagnostic services. The decommissioning and cleaning rolled on over the ensuing month, in a predetermined priority order. As staff returned from quarantine, they recommissioned their clinical areas. The final ward, a modified medical isolation wing, reopened on day 29. ISSUE: Disaster management activities may be grouped under four main headings: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. There are many opportunities for improvement and learning, and this article focuses on the local response and recovery, describing the process undertaken from the perspective of a small management group. Authors CC, HE, TB and MW were on the ground during the decommissioning process, then managed aspects of the cleaning and recommissioning remotely from furlough. Authors TA and TC provided specialist IPC support and developed education remotely. LESSONS LEARNED: Almost 2 months on, no new COVID-19 infections had been reported. The aim of this article is to provide a foundation for site-specific adaptation to include in pandemic escalation plans in other regional and rural settings.","Cheek, Colleen; Elmer, Hayley; Anderson, Tara; Baxter, Trent; Wooler, Maxine",Rural Remote Health,605,20

In particular, the BPS-P model improves on Engel's by articulating and evidencing the multiple pathways between biological, psychological, and social influences on health and identifying mechanisms that might be implicated in these pathways. Yet its analytic treatment of these influences as ""separate systems"" means that, as with Engel's model, the BPS-P model is more a list of ingredients than an integrated whole. In this commentary, following Haslam et al.'s (2019) specification of a sociopsychobio model, we underscore the value of a synthetic appreciation of biology, psychology, and society as dynamically interdependent aspects of an integrated whole which is more than just the sum of its parts and the pathways between them. In particular, our alternative framework centres on an appreciation of people as social beings whose group memberships and associated social identities open up 'changeways' (not just pathways) that, as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, can fundamentally restructure biology, psychology and society.","Haslam, S Alexander; Haslam, Catherine; Jetten, Jolanda; Cruwys, Tegan; Bentley, Sarah V",Soc Sci Med,605,1

Microarray binding experiments, using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library, showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. A hexasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units was identified as the minimal binding epitope. Surface plasmon resonance showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with a much higher affinity to heparin (KD = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (KD = 1 μM) alone. It was also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. However, exogenous administered heparin or a highly sulfated HS oligosaccharide inhibited RBD binding to cells. Furthermore, an enzymatic removal of HS proteoglycan from physiological relevant tissue resulted in a loss of RBD binding. The data support a model in which HS functions as the point of initial attachment allowing the virus to travel through the glycocalyx by low-affinity high-avidity interactions to reach the cell membrane, where it can engage with ACE2 for cell entry. Microarray binding experiments showed that ACE2 and HS can simultaneously engage with the RBD, and it is likely no dissociation between HS and RBD is required for binding to ACE2. The results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a starting material for therapeutic agent development. ©","Liu, L.; Chopra, P.; Li, X.; Bouwman, K. M.; Tompkins, S.

DESIGN: A multicentre observational study comparing outcomes from a prospective cohort during the pandemic [COVID-19-ectopic pregnancy registry (CEPR)] compared with a historical pre-pandemic cohort [non-COVID-19-ectopic pregnancy registry (NCEPR)]. SETTING: Five London university hospitals. POPULATION AND METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically with ectopic pregnancy (March 2020-August 2020) were entered into the CEPR and results were compared with the NCEPR cohort (January 2019-June 2019). An adjusted analysis was performed for potentially confounding variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, management (expectant, medical and surgical), length of treatment, number of hospital visits (non-surgical management), length of stay (surgical management) and 30-day complications. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-one women met the inclusion criteria: 162 CEPR and 179 NCEPR. A significantly lower percentage of women underwent surgical management versus non-surgical management in the CEPR versus NCEPR (58.6%; 95/162 versus 72.6%; 130/179; P = 0.007). Among patients managed with expectant management, the CEPR had a significantly lower mean number of hospital visits compared with NCEPR (3.0, interquartile range [IQR] [3, 5] versus 9.0, [5, 14]; P = <0.001). Among patients managed with medical management, the CEPR had a significantly lower median number of hospital visits versus NCEPR (6.0, [5, 8] versus 9, [6, 10]; P = 0.003). There was no observed difference in complication rates between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Women were found to undergo significantly higher rates of non-surgical management during the COVID-19 first wave compared with a pre-pandemic cohort. Women managed non-surgically in the CPER cohort were also managed with fewer hospital attendances. This did not lead to an increase in observed complication rates.

However, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are frequent comorbid conditions, complicating the assessment of hypertension's individual contribution to the risk. The aims of this study were to evaluate the contributions of hypertension alone, T2DM alone, or their combination to the risk of death, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/respiratory failure, and severe COVID-19 infection. Additionally, we assessed risks associated with elevated blood pressure and fasting blood glucose on the same three clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic models were used for these analyses. Among the 3400 patients, 3327(97.9%) survived and 73(2.1%) died. Compared to patients having neither hypertension nor T2DM (n = 1392), the risk of mortality was significantly higher in patients with T2DM alone (n = 226, OR 5.26 [95% CI: 2.39-11.58]) or with T2DM in combination with hypertension (n = 507, OR 3.02, [95% CI: 1.48-6.15]). Similarly, T2DM was a risk factor for development of ARDS/respiratory failure and severe infection. Hypertension alone (n = 1275) only conferred additional risk for the development of severe infection (OR 1.22 [95% CI: 1.00-1.51]). In conclusion, neither hypertension nor elevated blood pressure was independent risk factors for death or ARDS/respiratory failure but hypertension marginally increased the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The risk associated with hypertension is accentuated through its confounding effect on T2DM.","Sun, Yuhui; Guan, Xizhou; Jia, Lijing; Xing, Ning; Cheng, Liuquan; Liu, Bo; Zhang, Sibing; He, Kunlun",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),605,14

This new virus produces the so-called coronavirus 2019 or COVID-19. Although several studies have supported the epidemiological hypothesis that weather patterns may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, the most recent have concluded that summer weather may offer partial or no relief of the COVID-19 pandemic to some regions of the world. Some of these studies have considered only meteorological variables, while others have included non-meteorological factors. The statistical and modelling techniques considered in this research line have included correlation analyses, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, differential equations, or spatio-temporal models, among others. In this paper we provide a systematic review of the recent literature on the effects of climate on COVID-19’s global expansion. The review focuses on both the findings and the statistical and modelling techniques used. The disparate findings reported seem to indicate that the estimated impact of hot weather on the transmission risk is not large enough to control the pandemic, although the wide range of statistical and modelling approaches considered may have partly contributed to the inconsistency of the findings. In this regard, we highlight the importance of being aware of the limitations of the different mathematical approaches, the influence of choosing geographical units and the need to analyse COVID-19 data with great caution. The review seems to indicate that governments should remain vigilant and maintain the restrictions in force against the pandemic rather than assume that warm weather and ultraviolet exposure will naturally reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Briz-Redón, Álvaro; Serrano-Aroca, Ángel",Prog.

Realizing the challenges as a result of this pandemic affecting the daily practice of the HCT centers and the recognition of the variability in practice worldwide, the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research's (CIBMTR) Health Services and International Studies Committee have jointly produced an expert opinion statement as a general guide to deal with certain aspects of HCT, including diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 in HCT recipient, pre- and post-HCT management, donor issues, medical tourism, and facilities management. During these crucial times, which may last for months or years, the HCT community must reorganize to proceed with transplantation activity in those patients who urgently require it, albeit with extreme caution. This shared knowledge may be of value to the HCT community in the absence of high-quality evidence-based medicine. © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Few data are available on the post-lockdown phase in terms of health-care procedures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care, and no data are available specifically from IBD units. We aimed to investigate how IBD management was restructured during the lockdown phase, the impact of the restructuring on standards of care and how Italian IBD units have managed post-lockdown activities. METHODS: A web-based online survey was conducted in two phases (April and June 2020) among the Italian Group for IBD affiliated units within the entire country. We investigated preventive measures, the possibility of continuing scheduled visits/procedures/therapies because of COVID-19 and how units resumed activities in the post-lockdown phase. RESULTS: Forty-two referral centres participated from all over Italy. During the COVID-19 lockdown, 36% of first visits and 7% of follow-up visits were regularly done, while >70% of follow-up scheduled visits and 5% of first visits were done virtually. About 25% of scheduled endoscopies and bowel ultrasound scans were done. More than 80% of biological therapies were done as scheduled. Compared to the pre-lockdown situation, 95% of centres modified management of outpatient activity, 93% of endoscopies, 59% of gastrointestinal ultrasounds and 33% of biological therapies. Resumption of activities after the lockdown phase may take three to six months to normalize. Virtual clinics, implementation of IBD pathways and facilities seem to be the main factors to improve care in the future. CONCLUSION: Italian IBD unit restructuring allowed quality standards of care during the COVID-19 pandemic to be maintained. A return to normal appears to be feasible and achievable relatively quickly. Some approaches, such as virtual clinics and identified IBD pathways, represent a valid starting point to improve IBD care in the post-COVID-19 era.","Saibeni, Simone; Scucchi, Ludovica; Dragoni, Gabriele; Bezzio, Cristina; Miranda, Agnese; Ribaldone, Davide Giuseppe; Bertani, Angela; Bossa, Fabrizio; Allocca, Mariangela; Buda, Andrea; Mocci, Gianmarco; Soriano, Alessandra; Mazzuoli, Silvia; Bertani, Lorenzo; Baccini, Flavia; Loddo, Erika; Privitera, Antonino Carlo; Sartini, Alessandro; Viscido, Angelo; Grossi, Laurino; Casini, Valentina; Gerardi, Viviana; Ascolani, Marta; Ruscio, Mirko Di; Casella, Giovanni; Savarino, Edoardo; Stradella, Davide; Pumpo, Rossella; Cortelezzi, Claudio Camillo; Daperno, Marco; Ciardo, Valeria; Nardone, Olga Maria; Caprioli, Flavio; Vitale, Giovanna; Cappello, Maria; Comberlato, Michele; Alvisi, Patrizia; Festa, Stefano; Campigotto, Michele; Bodini, Giorgia; Balestrieri, Paola; Viola, Anna; Pugliese, Daniela; Armuzzi, Alessandro; Fantini, Massimo C; Fiorino, Gionata",United European Gastroenterol J,605,33

The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of the patients treated for COVID-19 at Guadarrama Hospital and to identify the associated mortality factors in those admitted in an acute situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted from 3/15 to 5/15/2020. Sociodemographic, mental, functional, analytical, clinical, radiological and therapeutic variables were collected. Factors associated with mortality were analysed using a bivariate and multivariate study. RESULTS: Two hundred eleven patients were included: 102 (48.3%) in an acute situation and 109 (51.7%) in the convalescent phase, the median (interquartile range) age was 82 (72, 85) years. The most frequent symptoms were fever, cough and respiratory failure. The 89.9% had pneumonia. An acute mortality rate of 26.5% (27/102) was detected and the associated factors were: respiratory failure (P 0.002), Charlson index (ChI)&#8805;3 (P<0.001), CURB&#8805;2 (P 0.011), low SatO2/FiO2 ratio (<0.001), elevated urea (P<0.001) and creatinine (P 0.036), hypoproteinemia (P 0.037) and age (P<0.018). The deceased had a worse functional situation than the survivors (P 0.025). In the multivariate analysis, SatO2/FiO2 ratio (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.07-4.63; P 0.031) and ChI&#8805;3 (OR: 4.25; 95% CI: 1.06-17.04; P 0.041) were independent factors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 patients treated were mostly severe cases. The variables associated with mortality were age, respiratory failure, comorbidity, kidney failure, and malnutrition. Respiratory failure and comorbidity outweigh age as independent risk factors for mortality.","Carrillo Alcalá, M Elena; Minaya Saiz, Jesús",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol. (Ed. impr.),605,20

It expresses the opinion that the speed and scale of the response to COVID-19 are affected by the important role that China plays in the global economy. By contrast, insufficient and less timely action was initially undertaken in West African countries during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. It concludes by stating why preparedness for and response to all disease outbreaks, also in countries of lower economic importance, should become a priority in the global health agenda.","Maffioli, Elisa M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,605,29
