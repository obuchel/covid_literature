180,180,180,Animal models of acute lung injury,12.759242,8.708636,2008-09-11,"Acute lung injury in humans is characterized histopathologically by neutrophilic alveolitis, injury of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium, hyaline membrane formation, and microvascular thrombi. Different animal models of experimental lung injury have been used to investigate mechanisms of lung injury. Most are based on reproducing in animals known risk factors for ARDS, such as sepsis, lipid embolism secondary to bone fracture, acid aspiration, ischemia-reperfusion of pulmonary or distal vascular beds, and other clinical risks. However, none of these models fully reproduces the features of human lung injury. The goal of this review is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of existing models of lung injury. We review the specific features of human ARDS that should be modeled in experimental lung injury and then discuss specific characteristics of animal species that may affect the pulmonary host response to noxious stimuli. We emphasize those models of lung injury that are based on reproducing risk factors for human ARDS in animals and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the extent to which each model reproduces human ARDS. The present review will help guide investigators in the design and interpretation of animal studies of acute lung injury.","Matute-Bello, Gustavo; Frevert, Charles W.; Martin, Thomas R.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,708,8

Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.","Dréau, D.; Lallès, J.P.; Salmon, H.; Toullec, R.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,708,8

Although we are still waiting for the first detailed structure of a pseudoknot, their role in processes such as translational autoregulation or ribosomal frameshifting has been extensively studied and is now well established. Pseudoknot structures appear to play a pivotal role in small subunit ribosomal RNA and in the noncoding regions of viral RNAs. There are also strong indications that RNA pseudoknots are highly suitable structural motifs for the recognition and binding of proteins.","Pleij, Cornelis W.A.",Curr Opin Struct Biol,708,5

Faecal specimens from 18 non-diarrhoeal control patients were also examined, of which three contained rotavirus. Forty-three (72 per cent) gastroenteritis patients had rotavirus detectable in stools by electron microscopy or immune electron microscopy. Of the remainder, 17 patients were regarded as having non-rotavirus diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Esch. coli. was isolated from seven patients of whom six yielded stable toxin producers (ST+), four labile toxin producers (LT+) and two dual toxigenic strains (ST+/LT+). All ST+ isolates appeared to be of low enterotoxigenicity as indicated by low gut weight/carcass weight ratios in the infant mouse assay. Rotavirus was the commonest aetiological agent (72 per cent), bacterial pathogens (alone) accounted for only five per cent and no enteric pathogens were found in 15 per cent of cases. Non-agglutinable rotavirus, presumably a different serotype, was seen in both gastroenteritis and control patients. Rotavirus ‘satellite’ particles previously undescribed were demonstrated in a number of stool samples.","Goldwater, Paul N.",J Infect,708,1

To determine the possible role of common enteric pathogens in this disease, 40 veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (cases) and 25 dairy calves diagnosed with enteric infection (control) were investigated. The veal calves were negative for several known enteric pathogens except for pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates that expressed multiple virulence attributes. To determine whether such isolates have a significant association with hemorrhagic enteritis in veal calves, we compared the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in the 40 veal calves with the prevalence of similar E. coli in the dairy calves that were diagnosed with colibacillosis within the same season of the year. Escherichia coli isolates from the two groups of calves were tested for several properties of E. coli related to pathogenicity, i.e. production of verotoxins, heat-stable enterotoxin (ST(a)), heat-labile enterotoxin, enterohemolysin, K99 fimbrial antigens, hemagglutination activity, and attachment to Hep-2 tissue culture cells. Escherichia coli that produces ST(a) were more commonly isolated from veal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis (45%) than from dairy calves with enteritis (12%) (P<0.05). Various patterns of attachment of E. coli to Hep-2 tissue culture cells were studied. The E. coli that demonstrated aggregative patterns of attachment were more commonly represented in veal calves (32%) than in dairy calves (8%). We observed that there was no correlation between ST(a) production and K99 pili expression among the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates that were recovered from veal calves. This may indicate the emergence of K99-negative ETEC, probably as a result of the wide use of K99-based vaccines.","Saeed, A.Mahdi; Bowersock, T.; Runnels, L.; Teclaw, R.F.",Prev Vet Med,708,1

A format for collation of information on birthdate and date of death was assembled into a matrix which improved conceptualization of the data and which simplified procedures for estimation of mortality rates. Contemporary and birth cohort life table methods, mortality density estimations and relative risk assessment were used to ascertain if there were high-risk groups of calves that could be identified by age, day-of-the-week born, day-of-the-week died and sex. During the outbreak of neonatal diarrhea on this dairy, female calves were found to have experienced an atypically higher rate of mortality (10.7%) than did males (5.3%). Calves of both sexes died between the ages of 9 and 19 days. In addition, the risk of dying was 11 times greater for calves born on Wednesdays than for those born on Saturdays. These findings formed the basis for recommended changes in management of neonatal calves on the dairy.","Thurmond, Mark C.",Prev Vet Med,708,27

What I am trying to say is that we encounter pricing all the time, even if we do not immediately recognize these moments as pricing moments. These encounters are scattered, unstructured, in pieces.

If people with diabetes are population of a separate country, it would be the third largest in the world, and almost one percent of its population would be dying annually. In 2019, 79% of the total number of adults with diabetes (463 million) lived in developing countries, projected to increase to 84% of the total number (700 million) in 2045. Most developing countries have not been able to provide the current standards of diabetes care. The economic meltdown from the COVID-19 pandemic would further aggravate the financial situation in their healthcare systems making it more difficult to allocate resources for diabetes and its complications. In order to manage the burden of diabetes prevalence, each developing country should know its own stratified diabetes prevalence as there may be differences with the external estimates based on extrapolations. Additionally, it needs to find the prevalence of undiagnosed cases and map the diabetes care services across all healthcare levels. An example of a country with limited resources that managed to obtain such data from the National e-Health System proves that it could be done in any developing country.","Smokovski, Ivica",Managing Diabetes in Low Income Countries,708,13

We then prove that we capture both path bisimilarity and strong path bisimilarity of any small open maps situation. We then look at the particular case of finitary diagrams with values in real or rational vector spaces.

The concept of inclusivity is presented and economic policies for the distribution of income and wealth and the issue of social security. Moreover, the issue of intergenerational justice is highlighted, through two key elements that characterize it: intergenerational mobility and debt management, as it is an issue that usually leads to the transfer of debt for repayment to future generations.","Petrakis, Panagiotis E.; Kostis, Pantelis C.",Policies for a Stronger Greek Economy,708,13

It introduces three post-war phases that frame Bosnian politics and victims’ struggle. The first phase from 1995 to 1999 was defined by emergency post-war stabilization when victims started forming their associations and organizing first advocacy campaigns under the wider umbrella of ‘truth and justice’. In the second phase that lasted until approximately 2006 centralization efforts and external state-building dominated local politics. This was also a period when victims sought out international and domestic allies to press for dramatic changes in their redress. In the last phase that followed, a ‘two steps forward, three steps back’ pattern of progress could be observed, accompanied by flawed Europeanization and re-nationalization of politics. Victims’ struggle grew into polarizing movements and inter-group animosities. A key goal became the pursuit of a formal ‘status’, i.e. a legal recognition of a victim group as eligible for material and in-kind support. Just like politics, victims’ struggle started to be dominated by nationalism and hierarchies of suffering.

Generally, the homogeneity of a battery pack is evaluated by characterizing the cells individually in terms of capacity, mass, impedance. Particularly, high quality electrochemical data heavily relies on the availability of high precision current source to minimize the discrepancy induced by the channel-to-channel variation. Here, a facile and precise measurement method is reported for screening cell-to-cell variations, in which voltage is the only indicator parameter independent of high precision current source. In detail, by connecting the cells in series (CiS), the measurement error of electrochemical data caused by stability and discrepancy of current sources among different charge/discharge equipment can be effectively avoided. The findings of this work showed that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply and sensitively detected with CiS configuration. For example, the relative standard deviation, which is the evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity, was 2.14% based on CiS while it was 0.43% based on individual measurements. The simple and precise CiS measurement is promising for evaluation of cell quality or module integration quality. In addition, this work can also provide a solid foundation for the development of detection algorithms for battery management systems to rapidly monitor battery homogeneity.","Xie, Leqiong; Ren, Dongsheng; Wang, Li; Chen, Zonghai; Tian, Guangyu; Amine, Khalil; He, Xiangming",Scientific reports,708,7

Furthermore, the pathomechanisms of diabetes improvement of partly anatomically differing operations is not fully understood. METHODS A loop duodenojejunostomy (DJOS) with exclusion of one third of intestinal length, a sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or a combination of DJOS + SG was performed in 8-week-old male ZDF rats. One, three, and six months after surgery, an oral glucose tolerance test and measurements of GLP-1, GIP, insulin, and bile acids were conducted. RESULTS After an initial (4 weeks) equal glucose control, DJOS and DJOS + SG showed significantly lower glucose levels than SG 3 and 6 months after surgery. There was sharp decline of insulin levels in SG animals over time, whereas insulin levels in DJOS and DJOS + SG were preserved. GIP levels were significantly larger in both groups containing a sleeve at all three time points, whereas GLP-1 was equal in all groups at all time. Bile acid levels were significantly higher in the DJOS compared to the SG group at all time points. Interestingly, the additional SG in the DJOS + SG group led to lower bile acid levels 1 and 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION The effect of SG on glucose control was transient, whereas a duodenal exclusion was the more effective procedure in this model due to a sustained pancreatic function with a preserved insulin secretion.","Laessle, Claudia; Nenova, Gergana; Marjanovic, Goran; Seifert, Gabriel; Kousoulas, Lampros; Jaenigen, Bernd; Fichtner-Feigl, Stefan; Fink, Jodok Matthias",Obesity surgery,708,19

Traditionally, all HBPC disciplines managed a patient (Full IDT), a costly approach to maintain. The recent PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly) regulation provides for a flexible approach of annual assessments from a core team with involvement of additional disciplines dependent upon patient needs (Core+). Current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) HBPC guidance specifies Full IDTs care for medically-complex and functionally-impaired Veterans similar to PACE participants. We evaluated whether VA HBPC has adopted the flexible structure of the PACE regulation, aligned to Veteran needs. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING All 139 VA HBPC programs administered across 379 sites. PARTICIPANTS 55,173 Veterans enrolled in HBPC during fiscal year 2018. MEASUREMENTS Patients' HBPC physician, nurse, psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker, therapist, dietitian, and pharmacist visits were grouped into interdisciplinary team types. Patient frailty was classified using VA HNHR v2 (High-Need High-Risk version 2, a measure of high, medium, and low risk of long-term institutionalization). Medical complexity was measured by clusters of impairment in the JEN frailty index (JFI). JFI clusters were validated by VA's Nosos measure to project cost and Care Assessment Need (CAN) measure of hospitalization and mortality risk. RESULTS HBPC provided Full IDT care to 21%, Core+ care to 54%, and Home Health+ (HHA+) care (skilled home health services plus additional disciplines, without primary care) to 16% of Veterans. Team type was associated with medical complexity (X2 2863.5 [66 df], p < 0.0001). High-risk Veterans (72% of sample) were more likely to receive Full IDT care (X2 62.9, 1 df), p < 0.0001), while low-risk Veterans (28%) were more likely to receive HHA+ care (X2 314.8, 1 df, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION There is a strong association between HBPC team patterns and patient frailty, indicating tailoring of care to match Veteran needs. This article is protected by copyright.

The study’s main purpose is to identify the past trends in the medical spa field from the tourist and medical perspectives and to anticipate the future research focuses in the field. In this regard, the article is based on four objectives that create a descriptive picture of the research in the medical spa area, such as (i) studying the current state of the art, (ii) analysing the most visible articles in the field, (iii) highlighting the leading research interests in medical spa research and (iv) anticipating new possible research trends that link cost-effective medical spa activity to COVID-19 post-recovery treatments. A total of 627 articles, published between 1997 and 2021 (March), were analysed, and the data were interpreted using the VOS Viewer software. The study results indicate that high interest in medical spas started to become observable in 2015, when the funding bodies became interested in this field and began supporting publishing and research regarding medical spas. The main subjects investigated in previous studies were related to the specific issues of the industry and tourism activity. They also considered the medical approach of the spa and the use of natural resources in treating different diseases. Except for these main interests, since 2020, it has started to become evident that another approach in the published studies may lead to a new trend in research. The study results show that researchers have begun to investigate the possibility of using medical spa resorts to aid post-COVID-19 recovery, which is considered a cost-efficient option for completing traditional treatment. This new focus in research proves that the medical spa field can rebrand itself as playing a supportive role in national healthcare systems in countries with a long tradition in balneotherapy, and gives a new developing trajectory to the medical spa industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Using an in vitro model of murine emperipolesis, we characterized neutrophils entering megakaryocytes using live-cell spinning disk microscopy and electron microscopy. Approximately half of neutrophils exited the megakaryocyte rapidly, typically in 10 minutes or less, displaying ameboid morphology as they passed through the host cell (fast emperipolesis). The remaining neutrophils assumed a sessile morphology, most remaining within the megakaryocyte for at least 60 minutes (slow emperipolesis). These neutrophils typically localized near the megakaryocyte nucleus. By ultrastructural assessment, all internalized neutrophils remained morphologically intact. Most neutrophils resided within emperisomes, but some could be visualized exiting the emperisome into the cell cytoplasm. Neutrophils in the cytoplasm assumed close contact with the platelet-forming demarcation membrane system or with the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, as confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Together, these findings reveal that megakaryocyte emperipolesis reflects at least two processes, fast and slow emperipolesis, each with its own characteristic transit time, morphology, and intracellular localization, suggesting distinct functions. Key Points Neutrophil passage through megakaryocytes, termed emperipolesis, diverges into fast and slow forms that differ in transit time, morphology, and intracellular localization During emperipolesis, neutrophils can reside in vacuoles (emperisomes) or escape into the cell cytoplasm to assume positions near the megakaryocyte’s demarcation membrane system, endoplasmic reticulum, or nucleus.","Huang, Frank Y.; Cunin, Pierre; Radtke, Felix A.; Grieshaber-Bouyer, Ricardo; Nigrovic, Peter A.",bioRxiv,708,1

With vaccination of CoVID coming to market, it is necessary to observe the effects of this vaccination on the global scale. Along with this observation it is essential to understand the spreading trend of CoVID post vaccination, which will help Governments to deploy vaccination centres in the areas where CoVID might re-spread. In order to solve this issue, the underlying text proposes a novel transfer learning approach. This approach learns from the spreading patterns of CoVID which are being currently observed, and links it with the vaccination measures taken by the Government during the previous Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918. This linkage is backed up by the analysis of re-spreading of Spanish Influenza post its vaccination. In order to develop an effective prediction system, the linkage information is given to a transfer learning system. This system enables effective prediction of post vaccination CoVID spread.

The present study focuses on higher education and examines the implications of the transition from in-class learning to learning via the Zoom platform in an academic institute of engineering. Specifically, we focus on how the transition affected interpersonal communication. We examined the manifestation of the four media richness theory (MRT) dimensions as reported in the subjective evaluations of the lecturers and students. We gathered information from various formal and informal oral and textual sources and found that shifting away from in-class learning was detrimental to all four dimensions of interpersonal communication. Using Te’eni’s cognitive-affective model of communication, we examined whether successful educators used communication strategies to overcome potential harm to the learning process. We found a diverse use of six communication strategies to maintain mutual understanding and positive emotions. We recommend that educators apply these communicational strategies to compensate for the forced distance from the richest media, thus promoting a high level of effective learning in cognitive and affective terms. © 2021 The Author(s).

The World Health Organization believes that this new CoV-19 epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020Worldwide.The mortality rate of this viral infection ranges from 2% in Pakistan to 14.4% in Italy. Lympopenia, elevated transminase, proteinuria, increased LDH, and C-reactive protein levels are all common laboratory findings in the early stages of the disease. Covid patients have experienced a variety of complications, including extreme pneumonia, ARDS, heart defects, sepsis and septic shock, and respiratory tract super infection. Methodology: This retrospective observational research study was carried out at the Gynecology Unit of MardanMedical Complex, Mardan and Combined Military Hospital, Risalpur for 06 months duration from April 2020 to September 2020. In a pre-constructed data collection form, biochemical and radiological parameters of medical history, test results, symptoms, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes were noted. Patients treated in an outpatient setting were not included in the study. Results: There were 121 patients in total, with mean age of 27 having standard deviation +/- 5, having range 19-40 years. 48.3% pregnant women reported their first pregnancy(primigravida). 51.3% of SARS-Cov-2 were in their 3 rd trimester while 34.7% were in their 35-40 weeks of gestational age. Common complications are gestational hypertension (PIH) (16 cases), hypothyroidism (14 cases) and gestational diabetes (GDM) 9 cases. More than half (53%) of patients are asymptomatic. Common symptoms are cough (22%) and fever (11%). The incidence of multiple organ failure was 2% as shown in table 01. Lymphopenia was common (84%). A CT scan of 24 patients showed bilateral invasion. Conclusion: COVID-19 has a negative impact on the foetus, according to our results. Although pregnant women do not seem to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications than non-pregnant adults, previous research has suggested that pregnant women could be at higher risk for negative pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, foetal pain and respiration, symptoms, and LBW in a newborn baby.","Khan, N.; Wasim, Z.; Rizwan, A.

State-of-the-art approaches first select the most relevant dates from the original event timeline then produce per-date news summaries. Date selection is driven by either per-date news content or date-level references. When coping with complex event data, characterized by inherent news flow redundancy, this pipeline may encounter relevant issues in both date selection and summarization due to a limited use of news content in date selection and no use of high-level temporal references (e.g., the past month). This paper proposes a paradigm shift in timeline summarization aimed at overcoming the above issues. It presents a new approach, namely Summarize Date First, which focuses on first generating date-level summaries then selecting the most relevant dates on top of summarized knowledge. In the latter stage, it performs date aggregations to consider high-level temporal references as well. The proposed pipeline also supports frequent incremental timeline updates more efficiently than previous approaches. We tested our unsupervised approach both on existing benchmark datasets and on a newly proposed benchmark dataset describing the COVID-19 news timeline.

Well-founded concerns have been raised on how the restrictions affect young people’s well-being and their possibilities to get support. Youths use digital technologies in their everyday lives, and it can be assumed that the usage has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can also be a benefit when coping with the situation. This paper explores young people’s subjective experiences regarding digital services, digital societal participation, and social interactions in the early phases of COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the youths’ backgrounds in relation to their utilisation of digital technologies and services are examined. A mixed-method survey including closed-ended and open-ended questions was conducted in spring 2020. The sample included 49 young Finnish people aged 15–26. Results suggest that digitality supports youths in their activities, such as work and school, societal participation, and social interactions. Also, problems, such as inadequate ICT skills and technical issues were identified. Furthermore, the ICT-savvy youths seem to benefit highly from digitality in comparison to their less ICT-savvy peers.

Rheumatic disease and their immunosuppressant therapies placed many patients into the 'clinically extremely vulnerable' group when the UK's shielding guidance commenced on 23 March 2020. The impact of DMARDs/glucocorticoids/biologics on COVID-19 remains under investigation 1. A recent study suggested caution may be required with rituximab and sulfasalazine in COVID-19 patients 2. Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatology patients in Northern Ireland by assessing demographics, rheumatic disease, medications, disease progress, shielding advice, access to primary & tertiary care and incidence of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was completed in Northern Ireland. The study duration was between 23rd November 2020 and 22nd January 2021. The questionnaire included consent, demographic details, medication history, comorbidities, disease course, patient experience, shielding advice, COVID-19 illness and hospitalisation. The survey was publicised by sending 6,032 Belfast Trust NHS patients a link via SMS, posters were displayed in rheumatology departments, and links made available via NHS/Versus Arthritis social media platforms. Results: There were 2,615 responses and of these 2,539 had been completed and were analysed. Most respondents were aged 45+ (78.27%) and female (N=1819). Rheumatoid arthritis (41%) and psoriatic arthritis (29%) were the most common diagnoses. Just over one third (35.27%, N=896) of patients were on biological drugs. Most patients were taking methotrexate (28.04%) followed by hydroxychloroquine (15.20%) and adalimumab (12.52%). The majority (79.6%) continued treatment during the pandemic. There was evidence of disease 'flaring' in 30.75% of patients who had stopped treatment. Of the respondents surveyed 7.8% (N=198), tested positive for Covid-19 and of these 77.55% reported that they had received adequate shielding advice, primarily from GP or UK government sources. Only 11.11% (N=22) of those who tested positive for Covid-19 required hospital admission and 2 patients required intensive care support. Both patients requiring ICU were not on immunosuppression. Less than one third of patients testing positive for COVID-19 were on biological drugs (30.3%, N=60). Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity. Of the 22 patients hospitalised with COVID-19, 13.64% (N=3) were on solitary sulphasalazine therapy. Conclusion: The survey showed low levels of COVID-19 hospitalisation despite most patients continuing DMARD/biologic/glucocorticoid therapy. This has been replicated in other studies 1, however data continues to be gathered on the safety of some biologic drugs particularly rituximab 2. Most of our patients received clear understandable shielding guidance from a variety of sources. Many patients expressed fear of mortality, isolation and mental health issues. The survey findings indicated that stopping medication can have a negative impact on disease control.","McKee, P.; Irvine, A.; Riddell, C.; Ball, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,708,13

One such challenge is the anxiety that is created in many people faced with the risk of death from the disease. Another issue is understanding how individuals cope psychologically with the threat of death from the disease. In this study we examine the manifestation of death anxiety and various coping mechanisms through the lens of terror management theory (TMT) and online platforms. We take a novel approach to testing the theory using big data analytics and machine learning, focusing on the user-generated content of Twitter users. Based on a sample of all tweets in the UK mentioning COVID-19 terms over a 5-month period, we evaluate dictionary mentions of anxiety and death, and various TMT defense mechanisms, and calculate the pattern of latent death anxiety or ‘terror’ states of Twitter users via Hidden Markov Models. The research identifies four online ‘terror’ states, with high death and anxiety mentions during the peak of the pandemic. Further we examine various TMT defense mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature for coping with death anxiety and find that online social connection, achievement and religion all play important roles in improving the model and explaining movement between states. The paper concludes with various implications of the study for future research and practice.","Barnes, Stuart J.",Computers in Human Behavior,708,32

To-date, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on the likelihood of such outbreaks remain unclear. In this study, we used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models, to track zoonotic outbreaks through wild animals’ joint propensities to engage in social-ecological co-interactions with humans, and their social grooming interactions with conspecifics. We collected behavioral and demographic data on 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) living in (peri)urban environments across Asia. Outbreak sizes predicted by the SIR models were related to structural features of the social networks, and particular properties of individual animals’ connectivity within those networks. Outbreak sizes were larger when the first-infected animal was highly central, in both types of networks. Across host-species, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques, the effects of network centrality on outbreak sizes were stronger through macaques’ human co-interaction networks compared to grooming networks. Our findings, independent of pathogen-transmissibility, suggest that wildlife populations in the Anthropocene are vulnerable to zoonosis more so due to their propensities to aggregate around anthropogenic factors than their gregariousness with conspecifics. Thus, the costs of zoonotic outbreaks may outweigh the potential/perceived benefits of jointly interacting with humans to procure anthropogenic food. From One Health perspectives, animals that consistently interact with both humans and conspecifics across time and space are useful targets for disease spillover assessments and control.","Balasubramaniam, Krishna N.; Aiempichitkijkarn, Nalina; Kaburu, Stefano S.

It may be that, as the president of Australia's home education representative body stated during the pandemic, Covid school closures offered a ""risk-free trial""of home education (Lever, 2020) by providing an a-posteriori experience of education outside of schools. Building on the Covid experiences, this paper suggests that 'accidentally falling into' home education may be significant in understanding parents' home education choices. Using numbers of home educators from Australia, and the associated data on their location and ages, this paper argues responsibilisation (see Doherty & Dooley, 2018) provides a suitable lens to examine how parents may decide, after an a-posteriori experience such as Covid school closures and previous, often negative, experiences of schooling, to home educate in the medium to long term. This paper proposes that increasing numbers of home educators will be seen in various jurisdictions where families perceive themselves responsibilised to home educate due to Covid as an a-posteriori experiences of home education. The paper proposes these families are 'accidental' home educators (English, 2021). By contrast, much more stable is the 'deliberate' home education population, those whose choices are based in a-priori beliefs about schooling. The paper proposes that the accidental home education category may be better able to explain the growing numbers of home educators in Australia and across the world, providing a means for governments to respond to the needs of this cohort, and the policies required to manage this population. © 2021 Rebecca English, published by Sciendo 2021.","English, R.",Journal of Pedagogy,708,7

Nonetheless, studies on ML Practitioners typically draw populations from Big Tech and academia, as researchers have easier access to these communities. Through this selection bias, past research often excludes the broader, lesser-resourced ML community -- for example, practitioners working at startups, at non-tech companies, and in the public sector. These practitioners share many of the same ML development difficulties and ethical conundrums as their Big Tech counterparts; however, their experiences are subject to additional under-studied challenges stemming from deploying ML with limited resources, increased existential risk, and absent access to in-house research teams. We contribute a qualitative analysis of 17 interviews with stakeholders from organizations which are less represented in prior studies. We uncover a number of tensions which are introduced or exacerbated by these organizations' resource constraints -- tensions between privacy and ubiquity, resource management and performance optimization, and access and monopolization.

Those with greater perceived or actual life stress are vulnerable to develop or reinstate problematic behaviours characterised by addiction and compulsive mechanisms. Thus, we assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation measures affected alcohol consumption and internet use in the general population.MethodsWe developed an online international survey, entitled Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,346 adults (≥18 years), which measured changes in amount and severity of alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test;AUDIT),online gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form;IGDS9-SF), and pornography viewing (Cyber Pornography Addiction Test;CYPAT) before (post-hoc recall)and during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown. These measures were related to ten COVID-19-specific stress factors. Lastly, we assessed psychiatric factors widely recognized to be associated with problematic alcohol and internet use such as anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;HADS), and impulsivity (Short Impulsive-Behavior Scale;SUPPS-P).ResultsOf the sample, we observed an overall increase in online gaming and a decrease alcohol consumption and pornography viewing. Those who increased their amount and severity of alcohol use (36%) during lockdown reported stress associated with the pandemic itself, such as being an essential worker directly caring for those with or having a loved one become severely ill from COVID-19. Further, those residing in the United Kingdom- as opposed the United States or Canada- increased their weekly amount of alcohol consumption. Alternatively, those who increased online gaming (64%) and pornography viewing (43%)reported low frequency or poor quality social interactions resultant of lockdown measures. All three groups displayed higher levels of depression, anxiety, and urgency impulsivity.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the theoretical mechanism of negative emotionality underlying forms of compulsive behaviour driven by stress, depression, and anxiety;while highlighting distinct avenues by which these behaviours can manifest. Limitations include subjects being within varying phases of lockdown during the time of testing and a large degree of study dropout (n=1,515). We emphasise the relevance of identifying those in need of greater support services to mitigate negative health outcomes associated with problematic alcohol consumption and internet usage in the context of COVID-19 isolation.","Sallie, Samantha N.; Ritou, Valentin J.

Especially, during the economic down period, the crisis may spread in the guarantee network like a domino. Monitoring the financial status, preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default diffusion path.

While it is one of the several must-do actions to prevent forward spread in the Covid-19 infections, at the same time, the effect of wearing a mask in naive face recognition systems have shown lower system performance in several cases and conditions. Simultaneously, only a handful of research studies have focused on a non-medical face mask with realistic images data set. This research proposed a new data set of realistic fabric face mask data set to be evaluated using surface curvature and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The classification applied support vector machine (SVM). One hundred seventy-six images in the data set were analyzed with various properties, resulting in several experiments. The experiments' parameters were color properties, approaches in surface curvature, i.e., Gaussian, mean and principal curvature, angle and distance in GLCM, GLCM properties, i.e., contrast, homogeneity, correlation and energy, also kernel functions in SVM. The best accuracy result, 87.5%, was derived from the combinations of these parameters. This research also improved the running time of the recognition process while maintaining the system's performance.","Lionnie, R.; Apriono, C.; Gunawan, D.","2021 Ieee International Iot, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference",708,20

It considers what new materialism might offer for those of us working within international law in the way of new insights, resources, practices or politics. It first sets the contours of new materialism within the broader material turn. It then elaborates three main tenets of new materialism’s methodology, theory, and ontology: its attention to matter in its physicality;the embedded and entangled subject;and the vitality or agency of objects. The article focuses on how new materialist work might help us to understand, first, subjectivity and second, power and accountability in international law. It concludes that new materialist approaches offer important and compelling insights, working against entrenched categories and structures that continue to perpetuate or excuse violence and harm in international law’s doctrines and practices. These insights provide resources for rethinking power and subjectivity, and the role these play in international law. However, those of us working to consider how we can respond to pressing crises of justice and coexistence within international law may find new materialism most powerful when brought into relation, and deep conversation, with more structural methodologies. Notably ‘older’ (Marxist or historical) materialisms grasp embedded power relations and deep-rooted systemic harms in more concrete ways. This is, the article concludes, a conversation that international law scholars are well placed to contribute to, deepening both ‘old’ and ‘new’ materialist insights for international law.","Hohmann, Jessie",Leiden Journal of International Law,708,8

Meanwhile, scientists remain one of the most trusted groups of professionals and are looked to as both sources of inspiration for society’s collective curiosity and effective messengers of useful technical information. While traditional scientific training has not emphasized the skills needed to coherently translate nuanced scientific research to audiences beyond one’s inner academic circle, today’s scientists (and, prominently, scientists-in-training) are increasingly seeking out ways to engage with such broader audiences and apply their skills to real-world problems. Here, we offer engagement strategies for scientists across levels of scale (e.g., at the individual, lab group, department/university, and cross-institutional levels), highlighting both existing opportunities and areas where improved capacity for science engagement is warranted. We argue that efforts to enhance and harmonize engagement efforts will have multi-faceted benefits, with greater opportunities for science-society dialogues, enhanced equity and inclusivity in such dialogues, and broader professional opportunities for early career scientists. While we acknowledge that the development of effective scientific engagement skills requires interest, effort, time and resources, we argue that the development of skills for effective public engagement is a worthwhile and necessary element of scientific training that enables unique, rewarding, and multifaceted professional opportunities.","Keller, Adrienne B.; Limaye, Vijay S.",Sustainability,708,1

The quantitative assessment of the B cell help potential of CD4+ T cells is limited by the lack of suitable antigen-specific functional assays. Here, we describe a highly efficient antigen-specific T-B co-cultures for quantitative measurement of T-dependent B cell responses. Using Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific setup, we show that early priming and activation of CD4+ T cells is important for the mutualistic collaboration between antigen-specific T and B cells, which could be achieved by supplementing the co-cultures with autologous monocytes. We further show that monocyte-derived growth factors provide the impetus for productive T-B collaboration by conferring optimal survivability in the cultured cells. This study provides first evidence of C-type lectin domain family 11 member A (CLEC11A/SCGF) as an essential growth factor for B cell survival. Importantly, we demonstrate the successful translation of monocyte supplemented T-B co-cultures in qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory CD4+ T cells by quantifying several correlates of productive T-B cross-talk like plasma cell output, secreted antibody, antibody secreting cells and IL21 secreting T cells. Thus, the method described here can provides qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 spike CD4+ T cells after natural infection and can be applied to assess the B cell help function of memory CD4+ T cells generated in response to COVID-19 vaccine.","Ansari, A.; Sachan, S.; Jit, B.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant change to prison visits worldwide, with limits or bans on face-to-face contact. Understanding the experiences and needs of children during this period remains limited. This paper presents the findings of a survey of 84 carers of 184 children across Australia, investigating children's experiences of contact with their imprisoned parent both before and during COVID-19 restrictions. Although most carers reported maintaining contact during restrictions, a range of difficulties were noted: reduced availability;the effect of prison-based issues, including lockdowns;and the suitability of video/telephone visits for young children. Some described the benefits of videoconferencing, including reduced travel time and cost, and not needing to take children into a prison environment. Despite this, respondents typically described the negative impact of restrictions, and lack of physical contact, on children's emotional well-being. Our findings suggest that, for video visiting to be successful, it should be complementary to in-person visits, tailored to the needs of children, with support offered to families.","Flynn, Catherine Bartels Lorana Dennison Susan Taylor Helen Harrigan Susy",Child & Family Social Work,708,7

However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases typically spread through interactions between individuals and therefore cause infections to be correlated. Inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and similar diseases, we consider an infection model over networks which generalizes the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this infection model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. We prove that when the network and infection parameters are conducive to 'strong community structure;' our proposed adaptive, graph-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm, and is even order-optimal in certain parameter regimes.

This is true, for example, of social insects, for whom the spread of disease can pose a high risk to colony survival. In light of such behaviors, the present study investigated a different way of developing strategies to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, we considered the strategies ants use to handle epidemics and limit disease spread within colonies. To enhance our understanding of these strategies, we explored ants' social systems and how they specifically respond to infectious diseases. The early warning threshold system reflects the importance of building mechanisms and making early decisions to enable appropriate actions to be taken to control the spread of disease and develop alternative plans. Determining thresholds is a complex process with several factors related to decision-making. For example, reliable warnings about pathogens among ants require the defense system to allocate more members to more valuable resources. The effectiveness of ants' disease-control strategies is rooted in behaviors such as social coordination between members, organizational immunity, disease-outbreak reduction, behavioral plasticity, and risk-threshold determination. Understanding such behaviors among ants could inspire the development of new strategies for limiting the spread of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics.","Ali, G.

Here, we analyzed fecal and saliva samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected and post COVID-19 patients and controls considering multiple influencing factors during hospitalization. Design 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal and saliva samples from 108 COVID-19 and 22 post COVID-19 patients, 20 pneumonia controls and 26 asymptomatic controls. Patients were recruited over the first and second corona wave in Germany and detailed clinical parameters were considered. Serial samples per individual allowed intra-individual analysis. Results We found the gut and oral microbiota to be altered depending on number and type of COVID-19-associated complications and disease severity. The occurrence of individual complications was correlated with low-risk (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausznitzii) and high-risk bacteria (e.g., Parabacteroides). We demonstrated that a stable gut bacterial composition was associated with a favorable disease progression. Based on gut microbial profiles, we identified a model to estimate mortality in COVID-19. Conclusion Gut microbiota are associated with the occurrence of complications in COVID-19 and may thereby influencing disease severity. A stable gut microbial composition may contribute to a favorable disease progression and using bacterial signatures to estimate mortality could contribute to diagnostic approaches. Importantly, we highlight challenges in the analysis of microbial data in the context of hospitalization.","Schult, David; Reitmeier, Sandra; Koyumdzhieva, Plamena; Lahmer, Tobias; Middelhoff, Moritz; Erber, Johanna; Schneider, Jochen; Kager, Juliane; Frolova, Marina; Horstmann, Julia; Fricke, Lisa; Steiger, Katja; Jesinghaus, Moritz; Janssen, Klaus-Peter; Protzer, Ulrike; Neuhaus, Klaus; Schmid, Roland M.; Haller, Dirk; Quante, Michael",bioRxiv,708,32

Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4), and its mouse homologue, caspase-11 (CASP11), are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2-infected Casp11-/- mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) and gasdermin-D knock out (Gsdmd-/-) mice. GSDMD is a downstream effector of CASP11 and CASP1. Notably, viral titers were similar in the three genotypes. Global transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected WT, Casp11-/- and Gsdmd-/- lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in Casp11-/- mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL6, and CXCL1, and neutrophil functions, were reduced in Casp11-/- lungs. Additionally, Casp11-/- lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity.

As real time data were difficult to acquire, Cancer Australia used surrogate measures to infer where reductions in medical services occurred. We analysed data available through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), a list of the medical services and professional attendances subsidised by the Australian Government, for the five highest incidence cancers: breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, and skin cancers. Methods: We identified over 500 MBS item codes for diagnostic and treatment procedures for malignancies and pre-cancerous conditions. Item codes were categorised into analysis groups based on cancer type and/or similarities in type of service. Data were examined at national and jurisdictional levels for 2020 to determine reductions during the initial COVID-19 period and to monitor subsequent recovery. Data were compared to 2019 to account for normal seasonal variation. Results: Australia's first wave of the pandemic ran from March to May, and a second wave in the state of Victoria alone ran from July to September 2020. We observed notable reductions across all diagnostic and surgical procedure groups examined, with initial reductions observed between March and April for diagnostic procedures, and a one-month delay for surgical procedures, between April and May. Some services showed an initial recovery in May, with many showing partial or full recovery by June. For some groups, analyses showed sustained reductions over the 12- month period. While COVID-19 case numbers were greater during the second wave, the impact on services was less pronounced, likely owing to more refined policy approaches to managing health system and workforce capacity. There was further recovery by September for some but not all services. Similar patterns of change were observed across all Australian states and territories, with some variation by jurisdiction. Conclusions: The pandemic has impacted the delivery of cancer care. Any potential delays in diagnoses and treatment due to these reductions in services may lead to more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis and poorer patient outcomes including recurrence and survival.

These ways include 1) directly through increased risk in suicides with respect to psycho-social stress or lack of connectivity 2) increased risk for psychopathologies such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and others, which in turn can decrease longevity in indirectly, and 3) a worse/healthier lifestyle that may be associated through decreased/improved social connectivity. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ways in which these psychosocial factors could be impacted by policy came into focus. Attempting to quantify the potential future impact of such policies on longevity through psycho-social changes appeared necessary to allow better guidance of policy making. Objective: This presentation aims to leverage the experience gained from making a projection of the impact of pandemic mitigation strategies on longevity in the early advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsThe authors model indicated the high need for measures that are protective of the general populations’ psychosocial health in the face of a pandemic and associated mitigation strategies. Discussion: This presentation will discuss issues concerning quantifications of the impact of COVID-19 related policy on psychosocial health. The assumptions necessary to arrive at projective models may be at odds with parts of the current culture in the field. The presentation will discuss potential strategies in order for the scientific community to be better prepared for similar events in the future.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Moser, D.",European Psychiatry,708,22

They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using in silico analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8°C to 10°C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8°C to 16°C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (>90°C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug. Overall, such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs based on DARPins.","Schilling, Johannes; Jost, Christian; Ilie, Ioana Mariuca; Schnabl, Joachim; Buechi, Oralea; Eapen, Rohan S.; Truffer, Rafaela; Caflisch, Amedeo; Forrer, Patrik",bioRxiv,708,16

More recent studies have also deep-sequenced longitudinal viral samples originating from experimental challenges to gain a better understanding of how these viruses may evolve in vivo and between transmission events. These studies have often identified nucleotide variants that can replicate more efficiently within hosts and also transmit more effectively between hosts. Quantifying the degree to which a mutation impacts viral fitness within a host can improve identification of variants that are of particular epidemiological concern and our ability to anticipate viral adaptation at the population level. While methods have been developed to quantify the fitness effects of mutations using observed changes in allele frequencies over the course of a host’s infection, none of the existing methods account for the possibility of cellular coinfection. Here, we develop mathematical models to project variant allele frequency changes in the context of cellular coinfection and, further, integrate these models with statistical inference approaches to demonstrate how variant fitness can be estimated alongside cellular multiplicity of infection. We apply our approaches to empirical longitudinally-sampled H5N1 sequence data from ferrets. Our results indicate that previous studies may have significantly underestimated the within-host fitness advantage of viral variants. These findings underscore the importance of considering the process of cellular coinfection when studying within-host viral evolutionary dynamics.","Zhu, Huisheng; Allman, Brent E; Koelle, Katia",bioRxiv,708,16

In addition to its classical role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has immunomodulatory properties, downregulating the inflammatory response by central and peripheral mechanisms. In this review, we describe the roles of 5-HT in the regulation of systemic inflammation and the potential benefits of the use of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a coadjutant therapy to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.","Costa, Luis H A; Santos, Bruna M; Branco, Luiz G S",Eur J Pharmacol,708,25

The threshold value &#964; k of the bifurcation is deduced and quantitatively analyzed. Numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical results with suitable examples. The research reveals that the COVID-19 outbreak may recur over a period of time, which can be helpful to increase the number of tested people with or without symptoms in order to be able to early identify the clusters of infection.

In this article, we report on the demographic profile and ocular disorders from our 20 rural eye centres during lockdown-I and its comparison with the pre-lockdown period. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all patients who visited or had teleconsultations at the 20 rural centres in our network between March 23 and April 19, 2020. Demographic and clinical details were collected from electronic medical records (EMR). Subspecialty was decided based on the diagnosis. Patients who needed advanced care were referred to the higher tertiary centres. We report the profile of patients seen and managed at the rural centres and the reasons for referrals. We also compare the data with the pre-lockdown period. Results: During the lockdown-I period, a total of 263 patients were treated including 48 teleconsultations (18.25%). The mean age was 48.16 years (SD: 19.53 years). There were 118 females (44.87%). As compared to pre-lockdown, during the lockdown, the patient visits were highest in the cornea and anterior segment specialty with 114 patients (43.35%), including conjunctivitis (n = 25; 22.32%). Of the 263 patients, 24 patients (9.12%) were referred to tertiary centres. This includes 6/27 (22.22%) patients of microbial keratitis.

METHODS: Outer (1,006,512 RT-PCR tests results for SARS-CoV-2) and proprietary (34,660 respiratory samples) epidemiological data was used. Fifteen European countries were studied. Dates of research: March 2 - May 22, 2020. RESULTS: As of April 21, 2020, the mean population infection rate (PIR) for the European countries considered, was 9.66%. It decreased to 6.85% by May 22, 2020. The model predicted 5.68% PIR, giving accuracy of 79.40%. SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is limited by an extremum that may be observed for closed communities. A concept of effective reproduction number is introduced as a function of r0 with maximum at r0 = 4.671 and value reff. = 0.315 for the full-lockdown mode and r0 = 5.539 and reff. = 0.552 for the no-lockdown mode of SARS-CoV-2 containment. Full-lockdown and no-lockdown modes resulted in the outcomes not strikingly different from each other in terms of herd immunity values. CONCLUSION: In case of a second wave of COVID-19 disease in Europe, it will coincide with seasonal common cold surge, spanning from mid-September 2020 to mid-February 2021, with a median in November-December 2020. Strict epidemiological surveillance must be observed in Europe at that time.","Sharov, Konstantin S",J. Formos. Med. Assoc,708,5

They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time RT-PCR, yield semiquantitative results only. Droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR; three were identified as the most efficient, precise, and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. For example, the analytical efficiency for the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set was approximately 83%, whereas assay precision, measured as the coefficient of variation, was approximately 2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively.

The purpose of the current study was to help build a theory for how early repeating patterning knowledge contributes to early math development, focusing on development in children aged 4-6 years. The current study examined the relation between 65 preschool children's repeating patterning knowledge (via a fast, teacher-friendly measure) and their end-of-kindergarten broad math and numeracy knowledge, controlling for verbal and visual-spatial working memory (WM) skills as well as end-of-pre-K (pre-kindergarten) broad math knowledge. Relations were also examined between repeating patterning and specific aspects of numeracy knowledge-knowledge of the count sequence to 100 and the successor principle. Children's repeating patterning knowledge was significantly predictive of their broad math and general numeracy knowledge, as well as one specific aspect of their numeracy knowledge (counting to 100), even after controlling for verbal and visual-spatial WM skills. Further, repeating patterning knowledge remained a unique predictor of general numeracy knowledge and counting to 100 after controlling for end-of-pre-K broad math knowledge. The relation between repeating patterning and mathematics may be explained by the central role that identifying predictable sequences based on underlying rules plays in both. Theories of math development and early math instruction standards should thus give even greater attention to the role of children's repeating patterning knowledge.","Zippert, Erica L; Douglas, Ashli-Ann; Rittle-Johnson, Bethany",J Exp Child Psychol,708,16

The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5­11°C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33·4 %; Chile 26·4 %) and mid-latitude (France 27·3 %; Portugal 21·2 %; Austria 19·3 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.","Kara, Murat; Ekiz, Timur; Ricci, Vincenzo; Kara, Özgür; Chang, Ke-Vin; Özçakar, Levent",Br J Nutr,708,16

A crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it. Different strategies are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA and Europe tend to introduce restrictions of considerable temporal length. They vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually relaxed. An interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses have repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy. After a few positive cases are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this paper we show that the Australian model can be generalized and given a rigorous mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term pain for collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of nonlinear control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding how to implement short-term lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of their merits and possible limitations. Our model predicts the duration of the severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data collected in Italy, it turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g. controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete lockdown with one or two months of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where the lockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate coronavirus impact on economy.","Bisiacco, Mauro; Pillonetto, Gianluigi",,708,24

The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed via an online survey conducted from March 27, 2020 to April 26, 2020. The 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional version (MISS-HP) was administered along with measures of clinician mental health and burnout. A total of 3,006 physicians and nurses who completed the questionnaire were included in the final analysis. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the associations, including that between COVID-19 patient exposure and the risk of moral injury. Results: MISS-HP scores strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms. The estimated prevalence of MI in the total sample was 41.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [39.3%, 43.0%]. HCPs providing medical care to COVID-19 patients experienced a 28% greater risk of MI than those providing medical care to patients without the coronavirus (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56], p = .01). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HCPs in mainland China are at risk for significant MI symptoms as well as mental health problems and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. MI symptoms are strongly correlated with higher clinician burnout, greater psychological distress, and lower level of subjective well-being. Effective strategies are needed to address MI and other mental health problems in frontline health care workers treating those with and without COVID-19 disease.

Objectives: In this article, we reviewed the varied neuroimaging patterns in patients with COVID-19-associated neurological complications. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv). The search terms we used were ""COVID -19 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"" and ""SARS-CoV-2 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology"". Results: Neuroimaging abnormalities are common in old age and patients with comorbidities. Neuroimaging abnormalities are largely vascular in origin. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy results in large vessel occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. COVID-19-associated intracerebral hemorrhage resembles anticoagulant associated intracerebral hemorrhage. On neuroimaging, hypoxic-ischemic damage along with hyperimmune reaction against the SARS-COV-2 virus manifests as small vessel disease. Small vessel disease appears as diffuse leukoencephalopathy and widespread microbleeds, and subcortical white matter hyperintensities. Occasionally, gray matter hyperintensity, similar to those observed seen in autoimmune encephalitis, has been noted. In many cases, white matter lesions similar to that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been described. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in COVID-19 seems to be a parainfectious event and autoimmune in origin. Many cases of acute necrotizing encephalitis resulting in extensive damage to thalamus and brain stem have been described; cytokine storm has been considered a pathogenic mechanism behind this. None of the neuroimaging abnormalities can provide a clue to the possible pathogenic mechanism. Conclusions: Periventricular white-matter MR hyperintensity, microbleeds, arterial and venous infarcts, and hemorrhages are apparently distinctive neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with COVID-19.","Garg, Ravindra K; Paliwal, Vimal K; Malhotra, Hardeep S; Sharma, Praveen K",Neurol India,708,4

The relationship between poverty and race is complex, with a diverse set of structural and systemic factors driving higher rates of poverty among minority populations. The factors that specifically contribute to the disproportionate rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, are not clearly understood. METHODS: We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 test results from community-based testing sites in Los Angeles, California, between June and December, 2020. We used tester zip code data to link those results with United States Census report data on average annual household income, rates of healthcare coverage, and employment status by zip code. RESULTS: We analyzed 2 141 127 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 245 154 (11.4%) were positive. Multivariable modeling showed a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among Hispanic communities than among other races. We found an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 positivity among individuals from zip codes with an average annual household income <US$65 000 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72 to 1.82), as well as from zip codes with <85% of individuals with health insurance (aOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33), and <60% of individuals employed (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.44). CONCLUSIONS: Residence in zip codes with lower average annual household income, lower rates of employment, or lower rates of health insurance was associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further research is needed into how those factors increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among populations of lower socioeconomic status in order to develop targeted public health interventions.","Allan-Blitz, Lao-Tzu; Goldbeck, Cameron; Hertlein, Fred; Turner, Isaac; Klausner, Jeffrey D",J Prev Med Public Health,708,20

Descriptive and between-group analyses along with thematic coding were used. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 261 acute care physicians. Feelings of anxiety related to the pandemic were common (65 percent), as well as fears of psychological distress if required to triage scarce resources (77 percent). Only 49 percent of respondents felt confident in making resource allocation decisions. Both critical care and emergency physicians favored multidisciplinary teams over single physicians to allocate scarce critical care resources. Critical care physicians were supportive of decision making by teams not involved in patient care (3.4/5 versus 2.9/5 p = 0.04), whereas emergency physicians preferred to maintain their involvement in such decisions (3.4/5 versus 4.0/5 p = 0.007). Free text responses identified five themes for subsequent action including the need for further guidance on existing triage policies, ethical support in decision making, medicolegal protection, additional tools for therapeutic communications, and healthcare provider psychological support. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for collaboration between policymakers and frontline physicians to develop critical care resource triage policies that wholly consider the diversity of provider perspectives across practice environments.","Mulla, Ali; Bigham, Blair L; Frolic, Andrea; Christian, Michael D",J Emerg Manag,708,15

As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country's healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country's healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country's healthcare system. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine's nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh's COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries.","Abedin, Minhazul; Islam, Mohammad Aminul; Rahman, Farah Naz; Reza, Hasan Mahmud; Hossain, Mohammad Zakir; Hossain, Mohammad Anwar; Arefin, Adittya; Hossain, Ahmed",PLoS One,708,24

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether OCD exacerbated during the first wave of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Twenty-nine children and adolescents with OCD were evaluated in the midst of the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (April-May 2020). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), by means of a functional questionnaire and by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-child version (OCI-CV) questionnaires. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were not found to have exacerbated during the period investigated, as evident by a lack of change in CGI- severity scores and by improvement rather than deterioration among more participants, based on the CGI improvement scores. Additionally, the children and adolescents reported better general functioning during the COVID-19 period and had relatively low scores on the OCI-CV scale. Our findings indicate that Israeli children and adolescents with OCD coped well with COVID-19 during the first two months of the pandemic and mostly did not experience exacerbation of OCS. However, due to the short duration of exposure to the pandemic at the time of the study, social isolation and lockdown might have masked OCS; thus, further longitudinal studies are needed.","Schwartz-Lifshitz, Maya; Basel, Dana; Lang, Claudia; Hertz, Nimrod; Dekel, Idit; Zohar, Joseph; Gothelf, Doron",J Obsessive Compuls Relat Disord,708,1

METHODS: Retrospective, observational, consecutive case series of patients admitted with ICH to Maimonides Medical Center from March 1 through July 31, 2020, who had confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were analyzed. ICH rates among all strokes were compared to the same time period in 2019 in two-week time intervals. Correlation of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation. More than half (6) suffered either deep or cerebellar hemorrhages; only 2 were lobar hemorrhages. Two of 8 patients with severe pneumonia survived. During the NYC COVID-19 peak period in April, ICH comprised the highest percentage of all strokes (40%), and then steadily decreased week-after-week (pâ¯=â¯0.02). SBPV and NLR were moderately and weakly positively correlated to discharge modified Rankin Scale, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 associated ICH is often associated with at least one known ICH risk factor and severe pneumonia. There was a suggestive relative surge in ICH among all stroke types during the first peak of the NYC pandemic. It is important to be vigilant of ICH as a possible and important manifestation of COVID-19.","Mishra, Sanskriti; Choueka, Murray; Wang, Qiang; Hu, Chloe; Visone, Stephanie; Silver, Michael; Stein, Evan G; Levine, Steven R; Wang, Qingliang T",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,708,20

Both viruses cause a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmits efficiently. Serological assays confirm all virus transmission events. Although the experiments do not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bariatric Surgery globally. METHODS: We conducted a global online survey of bariatric surgeons between 16/04/20 - 15/05/20. The survey was endorsed by five national bariatric surgery societies and circulated amongst their memberships. Authors also shared the link through their personal networks, email groups, and social media. RESULTS: 703 respondents from 77 countries completed the survey. Respondents reported a drop in elective bariatric activity from a median (IQR) of 130 (60-250) procedures in 2019 to a median of 0 (0-2) between16/03/2020 and 15/04/2020 during the pandemic. The corresponding figures for emergency activity were 5 (2-10) and 0 (0-1) respectively. 441 (63%) respondents did not perform any bariatric procedures during this time period. Surgeons reported outcomes of 61 elective bariatric surgical procedures during the pandemic with 13 (21%) needing ventilation and 2 (3.3%) deaths. Of the 13 emergency bariatric procedures reported, 5 (38%) needed ventilation and 4 (31%) died. 90 (13%) surgeons reported having had to perform a bariatric surgical or endoscopic procedure without adequate Personal Protective Equipment.

The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration. METHODS: The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa <0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa >0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively).

The survey consisted of Likert scale and open space questions surrounding changes necessitated by the pandemic. Following survey closure quantitative data were analysed using Google Forms and Excel. Qualitative data from the survey were reviewed by all team members to identify relevant themes.ResultOverall response rate was 40% (29), with participants from 5 NHS trusts. 72% (21) of educators felt they had adequate equipment and resources to facilitate virtual teaching. 55% (16) felt they had adequate training and skills to use virtual teaching platforms effectively. However only 17% (5) felt that students were able to engage in virtual teaching to the same extent as face to face sessions, and just 35% (10) of educators reported enjoying virtual teaching. 76% (22) agreed that information from the University about adjustments to clinical placements was adequate. 66% (19) felt that there had been adequate support to ensure the safety of students, supervisors and patients.

However educators were able to identify some benefits, such as inviting speakers from outside the local area, improved access to manager's hearings and tribunals and the use of simulated patients. There were also innovative suggestions, such as interactive quizzes and feedback polls within sessions. Most educators felt students had not received adequate patient contact during the pandemic and suggestions for improvement were less readily identified, they included changes to work place based assessments and timetabling.

Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are related to individuals' adherence to government measures. This study evaluated KAP toward COVID-19 among university students in Japan between May 22 and July 16, 2020, via an online questionnaire, and it further investigated the associated determining KAP factors. Among the eligible respondents (n = 362), 52.8% were female, 79.0% were undergraduate students, 32.9% were students whose major university subjects were biology-related, 35.4% were from the capital region, and 83.7% were Japanese. The overall KAP of university students in Japan was high. All respondents (100%) showed they possessed knowledge on avoiding enclosed spaces, crowded areas, and close situations. Most respondents showed a moderate or higher frequency of washing their hands or wearing masks (both at 96.4%). In addition, 68.5% of respondents showed a positive attitude toward early drug administration. In the logistic regressions, gender, major subjects, education level, nationality, residence, and psychological factors (private self-consciousness and extroversion) were associated with knowledge or attitudes toward COVD-19 (p < 0.05). In the logistic and multiple linear regressions, capital regions, high basic knowledge, high information acquisition, correct information explanations contributed positively to preventative action (p < 0.05). Non-capital regions, male gender, non-bio-backgrounds, high public self-consciousness, high advanced knowledge, incorrect information explanations, and high extroversion contributed negatively to self-restraint (p < 0.05). Moreover, self-restraint was decreasing over time. These findings clarify the Japanese university students' KAP and the related factors in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they may help university managers, experts, and policymakers control the future spread of COVID-19 and other emerging infections.","Hatabu, Asuka; Mao, Xinhua; Zhou, Yi; Kawashita, Norihito; Wen, Zheng; Ueda, Mikiko; Takagi, Tatsuya; Tian, Yu-Shi",PLoS One,708,33

In addition, BCG has cross-mycobacterial effects against non-tuberculous mycobacteria and off-target (also called non-specific or heterologous) effects against other infections and diseases. More recently, BCG's effects on innate immunity suggest it might improve the immune response against viral respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2. New TB vaccines, developed over the last 30â¯years, show promise, particularly in prevention of progression to disease from TB infection in young adults.

The aim of this study is to identify high-risk phenotypes of diabetes associated with COVID-19 severity and death. METHODS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review and meta-analysis on observational studies investigating phenotypes in individuals with diabetes and COVID-19-related death and severity. Four different databases were searched up to 10 October 2020. We used a random effects meta-analysis to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) with 95% CI. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by the GRADE tool. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles, including 17,687 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For COVID-19-related death among individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, there was high to moderate certainty of evidence for associations (SRR [95% CI]) between male sex (1.28 [1.02, 1.61], n = 10 studies), older age (>65 years: 3.49 [1.82, 6.69], n = 6 studies), pre-existing comorbidities (cardiovascular disease: 1.56 [1.09, 2.24], n = 8 studies; chronic kidney disease: 1.93 [1.28, 2.90], n = 6 studies; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 1.40 [1.21, 1.62], n = 5 studies), diabetes treatment (insulin use: 1.75 [1.01, 3.03], n = 5 studies; metformin use: 0.50 [0.28, 0.90], n = 4 studies) and blood glucose at admission (&#8805;11 mmol/l: 8.60 [2.25, 32.83], n = 2 studies). Similar, but generally weaker and less precise associations were observed between risk phenotypes of diabetes and severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with a more severe course of diabetes have a poorer prognosis of COVID-19 compared with individuals with a milder course of disease. To further strengthen the evidence, more studies on this topic that account for potential confounders are warranted.

Parkinson disease (PD) affects facial musculature leading to ""hypomimia"" or ""masked facies."" OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether modern computer vision techniques can be applied to detect masked facies and quantify drug states in PD. METHODS: We trained a convolutional neural network on images extracted from videos of 107 self-identified people with PD, along with 1595 videos of controls, in order to detect PD hypomimia cues. This trained model was applied to clinical interviews of 35 PD patients in their on and off drug motor states, and seven journalist interviews of the actor Alan Alda obtained before and after he was diagnosed with PD. RESULTS: The algorithm achieved a test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 on 54 subjects to detect PD hypomimia, compared to a value of 0.75 for trained neurologists using the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III Facial Expression score. Additionally, the model accuracy to classify the on and off drug states in the clinical samples was 63% (22/35), in contrast to an accuracy of 46% (16/35) when using clinical rater scores. Finally, each of Alan Alda's seven interviews were successfully classified as occurring before (versus after) his diagnosis, with 100% accuracy (7/7). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle pilot study demonstrated that computer vision holds promise as a valuable tool for PD hypomimia and for monitoring a patient's motor state in an objective and noninvasive way, particularly given the increasing importance of telemedicine.","Abrami, Avner; Gunzler, Steven; Kilbane, Camilla; Ostrand, Rachel; Ho, Bryan; Cecchi, Guillermo",J Med Internet Res,708,24

As elective urologic procedures are being reduced to conserve resources, we sought to quantify the PPE used per case to determine the impact on potentially limited resources needed for protecting healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective analysis of all urologic procedures in March 2019 and March 2020 was performed. Additionally, all urologic procedures performed by vascular interventional radiology (VIR) in May 2019 and March 2020 were included in the analysis. Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. Articles of PPE were defined as surgical bonnet/hat and mask, and disposable or reusable gown with 1 pair of surgical gloves. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-seven urologic and VIR procedures were included in the analysis. The mean PPE per case varied significantly between endoscopic and robotic categories. Robotic assisted laparoscopic cystectomy required the most hats and masks (14.5 per case in March 2019) whereas percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement by VIR required the fewest (3.1 in May 2019 and March 2020). CONCLUSION: PPE consumption varied significantly across urologic procedures. Robotic-assisted cases require the most PPE and percutaneous nephrostomy placement by VIR requires the fewest. While PPE shortages are currently being addressed national and internationally, our results provide a baseline benchmark for articles of PPE required should another pandemic or global disaster requiring careful attention to resource allocation occur in the future.","Sobel, David; Gn, Martus; O039,; Rourke, Timothy K; Tucci, Chris; Pareek, Gyan; Golijanin, Dragan; Elsamra, Sammy",Urology,708,25

Increasingly the focus amongst the policy makers and general public is on the potential third wave. Due to uncertainties regarding emergence of new variants and reinfections, instead of projecting our best guess scenario, in this report we conduct an extensive scenario analysis for Mumbai and track peak fatalities in the coming months in each of these scenarios. Our key conclusions are - As per our model, about 80% of Mumbai population has been exposed to Covid-19 by June 1, 2021. Under the assumption that all who are exposed have immunity against further infection, it is unlikely that Mumbai would see a large third wave. It is the reinfections that may lead to a large wave. Reinfections could occur because of declining antibodies amongst the infected as well as by variants that can break through the immunity provided by prior infections. Even under a reasonably pessimistic scenario we observe the resulting peak to be no larger than that under the second wave. We further observe that under the scenario where the reinfections are mild so that they affect the fatality figures negligibly, where the new variants (beyond the existing delta variant) have a mild impact, as the city opens up, we observe a small wave in the coming months. However, if by then the vaccine coverage is extensive, this wave will be barely noticeable. We also plot $R_t$, the infection growth rate at time $t$, and highlight some interesting observations.","Juneja, Sandeep; Mittal, Daksh",,708,24

I use simulation by an agent-based model as well as the mathematics of multi-type branching-processes to illustrate how the SS epidemic differs from the more familiar uniform epidemic (e.g., caused by influenza). The conclusions may surprise the reader: (a) The SS epidemic must be described by at least two numbers, such as the mean reproductive number (of""secondary""cases caused by a""primary case""), R0, and the variance of same, call it V0; (b) Even if R0>1, if V0>>R0 the probability that an infection-chain caused by one primary case goes extinct without intervention may be close to one (e.g., 0.97); (c) The SS epidemic may have a long""kindling period""in which sporadic cases appear (transmitted from some unknown host) and generate a cluster of cases, but the chains peter out, perhaps generating a false sense of security that a pandemic will not occur; (d) Interventions such as isolation (or contact-tracing and secondary case isolation) may prove efficacious even without driving R0 below one; (e) The efficacy of such interventions diminishes, but slowly, with increasing V0 at fixed R0. From these considerations, I argue that the SS epidemic has dynamics sufficiently distinct from the uniform case that efficacious public-health interventions can be designed even in the absence of a vaccine or other form of treatment.","Wick, W.

However, the neurobiological mechanisms of anhedonia are poorly understood as few studies have disentangled the specific effects of anhedonia from other co-occurring symptoms. Here, we take a transdiagnostic, dimensional approach to distinguish anhedonia alterations from other internalizing symptoms on intrinsic functional brain circuits. 53 adults with varying degrees of anxiety and/or depression completed resting-state fMRI. Neural networks were identified through independent components analysis. Dual regression was used to characterize within-network functional connectivity alterations associated with individual differences in anhedonia. Modulation of between-network functional connectivity by anhedonia was tested using region-of-interest to region-of-interest correlational analyses. Anhedonia was associated with visual network hyperconnectivity and expansion of the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Additionally, anhedonia was associated with decreased between-network connectivity among default, salience, dorsal attention, somatomotor, and visual networks. Findings suggest that anhedonia is associated with aberrant connectivity and structural alterations in resting-state networks that contribute to impairments in reward learning, low motivation, and negativity bias characteristic of depression. Results reveal dissociable effects of anhedonia on resting-state network dynamics, characterizing possible neurocircuit mechanisms for intervention.","Geller, Whitney N; Liu, Kevin; Warren, Stacie L",Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,708,1

Developing novel therapeutics and a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 requires an understanding of the similarities and differences between the various human coronaviruses with regards to their phylogenic relationships, transmission, and management. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that humans were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and the virus rapidly spread from the outbreak epicenter in Wuhan, China to various parts of the world. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have now been identified in particular regions. It is apparent that MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 present with several common symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea in mild cases, but can also progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Understanding the molecular steps leading to SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells and the viral replication cycle can illuminate crucial targets for testing several potential therapeutics. Genomic and structural details of SARS-CoV-2 and previous attempts to generate vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS have provided vaccine targets to manage future outbreaks more effectively. The coordinated global response against this emerging infectious disease is unique and has helped address the need for urgent therapeutics and vaccines in a remarkably short time.","Oves, Mohammad; Ravindran, Mithunan; Rauf, Mohd Ahmar; Omaish Ansari, Mohammad; Zahin, Maryam; Iyer, Arun K; Ismail, Iqbal M I; Khan, Meraj A; Palaniyar, Nades",,708,21

An element-specific corrective term is derived as the difference between the 1s eigenvalues obtained from the self-consistent solutions to the non- or scalar-relativistic Kohn-Sham equations and the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equations for a free neutral atom. We examine the dependence of this corrective term on the molecular environment and on the amount of exact exchange in hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. This corrective term is then added as a perturbation to the quasiparticle energies from partially self-consistent and single-shot $GW$ calculations. We show that this element-specific relativistic correction, when applied to a previously reported benchmark set of 65 core-state excitations [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 1840 (2020)], reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) with respect to experiment from 0.55 to 0.30 eV and eliminates the species dependence of the MAE, which otherwise increases with the atomic number. The relativistic corrections also reduce the species dependence for the optimal amount of exact exchange in the hybrid functional used as starting point for the single-shot $G_0W_0$ calculations. Our correction scheme can be transferred to other methods, which we demonstrate for the Delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) approach based on density functional theory.","Keller, Levi; Blum, Volker; Rinke, Patrick; Golze, Dorothea",,708,21

Here, we propose a simple and immediate clustering approach to categorize Italian regions working on the prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases prior to the start of phase two on 4 May 2020. Applying both hierarchical and k-means clustering, we identified three regional groups: regions in cluster 1 exhibited higher prevalence and the highest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases; those classified into cluster 2 constituted an intermediate group; those in cluster 3 were regions with a lower prevalence and the lowest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. At the provincial level, we used a similar approach but working on the prevalence and trend of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases. Notably, provinces in cluster 1 exhibited the highest prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Provinces in clusters 2 and 3, instead, showed a median prevalence of approximately 11 cases per 10,000 residents. However, provinces in cluster 3 were those with the lowest trend of cases. K-means clustering yielded to an alternative cluster solution in terms of the prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our study described a simple and immediate approach to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic at the regional and provincial level. These findings, at present, offered a snapshot of the epidemic, which could be helpful to outline the hierarchy of needs at the subnational level. However, the integration of our approach with further indicators and characteristics could improve our findings, also allowing the application to different contexts and with additional aims.","Maugeri, Andrea; Barchitta, Martina; Agodi, Antonella",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),708,1

However, allocating the COVID-19 vaccine globally poses a novel challenge of redistribution, one that cannot be effectively undertaken using current mechanisms for the dispensation of aid. An examination of the origins and implicit logic of global public goods theory shows that it would not be effective as a framework in this context. I argue that while it is a useful rhetorical tool to underscore the need for global access, it fails to account for concerns arising out of structural inequities between countries in the Global South and North. In addition to being ill-defined, the phrase encodes a neoliberal logic - one that prioritises the protection of private capital over democratic claims of redistribution and social justice. To ensure global access, our attention must be focussed instead on explicitly accounting for inequities, securing access for countries in the Global South and addressing the norm-setting powers of pharmaceutical companies.","Saksena, Nivedita",Glob Public Health,708,16

To control the rate of transmission, governments advocated that the public practice social distancing, which included staying at home. However, compliance with stay-at-home orders has varied between countries such as China and the United States, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying the national differences. Based on the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model, health beliefs and behavioral intention are suggested as possible explanations. A total of 498 Chinese and 292 American college students were recruited to complete an online survey. The structural equation modeling results showed that health beliefs (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, and barriers) and behavioral intention played multiple mediating roles in the association between nationality and actual stay-at-home behaviors. Notably, the effect via perceived barriers â behavioral intention was stronger than the effects via perceived susceptibility and severity â behavioral intention. That is, American participants perceived high levels of susceptibility whereas Chinese participants perceived high levels of severity, especially few barriers, which further led to increased behavioral intention and more frequent stay-at-home behaviors. These findings not only facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cross-country differences in compliance with stay-at-home orders during peaks in the COVID-19 pandemic but also lend support for mitigation of the current global crisis and future disease prevention and health promotion efforts.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Hwang, Jacqueline; Wang, Jia; Yang, Yi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),708,24

The study also explored whether SHD counts during the pandemic were affected by lockdown severity (measured using the lockdown stringency index [LSI]) and COVID-19 case numbers. We utilized publicly available SHD data from January 2018 through November 2020, and employed AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling, to predict SHD during the COVID-19 period (March 21 to November 28, 2020). We used Poisson and negative binomial regression to assess ecological associations between the LSI and COVID-19 case numbers, controlling for seasonality, and SHD counts during the COVID-19 period. On average, observed SHD counts were lower than predicted counts during this period (p < 0.05 [except Alberta]).
