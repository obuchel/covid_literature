Subconjunctival draining minimally-invasive glaucoma devices such as the Xen gelatin implant and InnFocus stent have been introduced as a treatment to prevent glaucoma progressing.These implants provide a channel to allow aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye to drain into the subconjunctival space on the surface of the eye thus reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and mimicking the mechanism of the most commonly undertaken glaucoma surgery, trabeculectomy. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subconjunctival draining minimally-invasive glaucoma devices in treating people with open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension whose condition is inadequately controlled with drops. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 10 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Xen gelatin implant or InnFocus MicroShunt to other surgical treatments (other minimally-invasive glaucoma device techniques, trabeculectomy), laser treatment or medical treatment. We also planned to include trials where these devices were combined with phacoemulsification compared to phacoemulsification alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We planned to have two review authors independently extract data from reports of included studies using a data collection form and analyse data based on methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was mean change in IOP. Secondary outcomes included proportion of participants who were drop-free; proportion of participants who achieved an IOP of 21 mmHg or less, 17 mmHg or less or 14 mmHg or less; and proportion of participants experiencing intra- and postoperative complications. We planned to measure all outcomes in the short-term (six to 18 months), medium-term (18 to 36 months), and long-term (36 months onwards). MAIN RESULTS We found no completed RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We found one ongoing study (NCT01881425). The study compares InnFocus MicroShunt to trabeculectomy in people with primary open angle glaucoma. The primary outcome is greater than 20% IOP reduction from baseline to 12 months' follow-up. A total of 889 people aged between 40 and 85 years have been enrolled. The estimated study completion date is November 2019. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently no high-quality evidence for the effects of subconjunctival draining minimally-invasive glaucoma devices for medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma. Properly designed RCTs are needed to assess the medium- and long-term efficacy and safety of this technique.","King, Anthony J; Shah, Anupa; Nikita, Eleni; Hu, Kuang; Mulvaney, Caroline A; Stead, Richard; Azuara-Blanco, Augusto",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,828,1

The clinician must utilize published pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and effective inhibitory concentration information to determine potential dosing regimens for individual patients when treating specific pathogens. Using minimum inhibitory concentrations known to successfully block growth for target pathogens, the pharmacokinetics of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole can be utilized to establish empiric dosing regimens for critically ill patients while considering organ of clearance impairment.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series from 2012 to 2014. SETTING Single tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS All cochlear implant recipients undergoing 1.5-T MRI without internal magnet removal. INTERVENTION(S) MRI after tight headwrap application. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient tolerance, complications, and characteristics of imaging artifact. RESULTS Nineteen ears underwent a total of 34 MRI scans. Two patients did not tolerate imaging with the headwrap in place and required magnet removal before rescanning. One subject experienced two separate episodes of polarity reversal in the same device from physical realignment (i.e., flipping) of the internal magnet requiring surgical repositioning. Three patients were discovered to have canting of the internal magnet after imaging. In all three cases, the magnet could be reseated by applying gentle firm pressure to the scalp until the magnet ""popped"" back into place. These patients continue to use their device without difficulty and have not required surgical replacement. In patients receiving head MRI, the ipsilateral internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle could be visualized without difficulty in 94% of cases. There were no episodes of cochlear implant device failure or soft tissue complications. CONCLUSION Under controlled conditions, 1.5-T MRI can be successfully performed in most patients without the need for cochlear implant magnet removal. In nearly all cases, imaging artifact does not impede evaluation of the ipsilateral skull base. Patients should be counseled regarding the risk of internal magnet movement that may occur in up to 15% of cases, even with tight headwrap application. If internal magnet polarity reversal occurs, a trial of reversing the external magnet can be considered. If canting or mild displacement of the internal magnet occurs, an attempt at reseating can be made by applying gentle firm pressure to the scalp over the internal magnet. If conservative measures fail, the magnet should be surgically repositioned to minimize interruption of device use and to prevent scalp complications.","Carlson, Matthew L; Neff, Brian A; Link, Michael J; Lane, John I; Watson, Robert E; McGee, Kiaran P; Bernstein, Matt A; Driscoll, Colin L W","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",828,27

Typical symptoms are vomiting, nausea and severe watery diarrhea. Because of the lack of cell lines susceptible to human norovirus infection, pathomechanisms and replication cycle are largely unknown. Here, we address the issue of how norovirus infection could lead to epithelial barrier dysfunction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression of the non-structural norovirus protein p20 in the epithelial cell line HT-29/B6 was activated through a tetracycline sensitive promoter. Tight junction proteins were studied by Western blot and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Apoptoses were detected in TUNEL stainings. Epithelial restitution was monitored by conductance scanning after induction of single cell lesions. RESULTS Changes in the expression or localization of the tight junction proteins occludin and/or claudin-1, -2,- 3, -4, -5, -7 and -8 could be ruled out to mediate epithelial barrier modulation. Cell motility was also unaltered by p20. Investigation of epithelial apoptosis revealed an accumulation of apoptic cells in epithelial monolayers after induction of p20 expression. In epithelial cell restitution assays, an arrest was identified in p20 expressing cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed an inability for condensation and redistribution of cellular actin, which led to a reduced transepithelial electrical resistance. CONCLUSIONS Functional data for norovirus protein p20 suggest a role in modulation of the actin cytoskeleton leading to barrier dysfunction through impairment of restitution of epithelial defects.","Hillenbrand, Bernd; Günzel, Dorothee; Richter, Jan F; Höhne, Marina; Schreier, Eckart; Schulzke, Jörg-Dieter; Mankertz, Joachim",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,828,16

METHODS We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent MIS staging for endometrial cancer at our institution from 01/09-12/12. Data collection involved the review of all operative notes, postoperative follow-up visit notes, and postoperative imaging reports. Appropriate statistical tests were used. RESULTS We identified 760 eligible patients (LSC, 193; RBT, 567). The overall median age was 61years (range, 33-90). The median BMI was 28.5kg/m2 for LSC (range, 16.6-67.6) and 29.5kg/m2 for RBT (range, 17.9-66) patients (p=0.8). A trocar site hernia developed in 16 patients (2.1%)-5 (2.6%) of 193 LSC and 11 (1.9%) of 567 RBT patients (p=0.6). Median time to hernia diagnosis was 13months (range, 5-20.5) and 18months (range, 3-49), respectively (p=0.5). All hernias in the LSC cohort developed at the camera trocar site. In the RBT cohort, 10 developed at the camera trocar site and 1 at a lateral trocar site. Only BMI was associated with the development of hernias. A hernia was diagnosed in 7 (6.9%) of 101 patients with a BMI ≥40kg/m2 compared with 9 (1.4%) of 659 with a BMI <40kg/m2 (p=0.001). CONCLUSION MIS for endometrial cancer is associated with a low rate of trocar site hernia formation, with similar rates associated with RBT and standard LSC. Higher BMI is associated with the development of postoperative trocar site hernias.","Cybulska, Paulina; Schiavone, Maria B; Sawyer, Brandon; Gardner, Ginger J; Zivanovic, Oliver; Brown, Carol L; Jewell, Elizabeth L; Sonoda, Yukio; Barakat, Richard R; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Leitao, Mario M",Gynecologic oncology,828,12

This paper describes current practices and challenges conducting anal cancer screening for WLWH at an urban integrated safety-net system and a non-profit community-based HIV clinic. We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative stakeholders to assess knowledge, clinic practices and procedures, and experiences with anal cancer screening. Interview transcripts and fieldnotes were thematically analyzed using an iterative deductive and inductive coding scheme. Findings were organized by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains and constructs. Provider-level barriers to conducting anal cancer screening included limited knowledge of guidelines. System-level barriers included: structural characteristics such as lack of coordination between clinics to discern provider roles and responsibilities; and limitations in available resources such as configuration of electronic health records and infrastructure to manage referrals of abnormal anal Pap results. We conclude that anal cancer screening and follow-up for WLWH requires organization and coordination between multiple care teams, updated clinical information systems to facilitate communication and support anal Pap ordering and result documentation, and infrastructure that includes policies and protocols for management of abnormal results.

In some cases, these substances have been used in the pharmaceutical industry for human disease treatments. Most fish poisons generally have potent cytolytic activity, probably through cardiovascular and neuromuscular effects. In the case of marine stingrays, the injuries made by their tail venom apparatus are caused by the mechanical penetration of their sting and a subsequent venom release. This study focused on the evaluation of substances with cytotoxic activity in the epithelium that covers the venom apparatus from the marine stingray Hypanus dipterurus. To demonstrate the above, the hemolytic, proteolytic and cytotoxic capacities of H. dipterurus epithelium substances were determined. Discs impregnated with epithelial extract were used on blood agar plates. The proteolytic activity was analyzed using casein as substrate and for gelatin the liquefaction activity test. To determine the cytotoxicity degree of the extracts, the proliferation and cell viability MTT bioassay was implemented on human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). The results showed that no hemolytic or proteolytic activity existed against casein associated with the epithelial extract, but gelatin hydrolysis and cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell line were observed. This study concludes that the substances found in the epithelium covering the H. dipterurus stingray venom apparatus are a mixture of various proteins, among which, glycosylated anionic proteins represent a potential source of molecules with cytotoxic and hydrolytic activity.","Marrón-Grijalba, Estrella; Cardona-Félix, César Salvador; Cruz-Escalona, Víctor Hugo; Muñoz-Ochoa, Mauricio; Cabral-Romero, Claudio; Hernández-Delgadillo, René; Rivera-Pérez, Crisalejandra; Aguila-Ramírez, Ruth Noemí",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,828,1

Conflicting evidence exists whether patients with POAF after cardiac surgery have an increased long-term risk of stroke and other adverse events. Methods and Results We prospectively followed for up to 5 years 4624 patients without prior atrial fibrillation who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in an international study. POAF was defined as atrial fibrillation that occurred during the initial hospitalization for surgery, lasted for ≥5 minutes, and required treatment. Outcomes assessed were a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and its individual components. Median age was 67 years, and 778 (16.8%) had an episode of POAF. The incidence of the composite outcome was 6.84 and 4.10 per 100 patient-years in patients with and without POAF, and the incidence of stroke was 0.75 versus 0.45, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.16-1.59) for the composite outcome; 1.33 (95% CI, 1.10-1.61) for death; 1.58 (95% CI, 1.23-2.02) for myocardial infarction, and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.81-2.00) for stroke. In a landmark analysis excluding events of the initial hospital admission, the aHRs were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.03-1.54) for the composite outcome, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.03-1.59) for death, 1.70 (95% CI, 0.86-3.36) for myocardial infarction, and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.59-1.93) for stroke. At hospital discharge, 10.7% and 1.4% of patients with and without POAF received oral anticoagulation, respectively.

The difficulties associated with preparing for examinations under such unique and challenging circumstances cannot be underestimated. Working from home, during social distancing, surrounds students with the extra family stresses that we are all facing during this pandemic. This combined with a new, unfamiliar examination format will inevitably lead to students feeling daunted. While some would argue that an OBE may reward good problem solvers, students still require a strong foundation of knowledge. The luxury of reference will not be afforded in all clinical settings thus leading to concerns regarding students skimming over essential learning points.

This barrier function typically requires a contiguous cell layer but since teeth penetrate the oral epithelium, a modified barrier has evolved, called the junctional epithelium (JE). In health, the JE attaches to the tooth, sealing the inside of the body against oral micro-organisms. Breakdown of the JE barrier results in periodontal ligament (PDL) disintegration, alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. Using lineage tracing and DNA pulse-chase analyses, we identified an anatomical location in the JE that supported both fast- and slow-cycling Wnt-responsive stem cells that contributed to self-renewal of the tissue. Stem cells produced daughter cells with an extraordinarily high rate of turnover that maintained JE integrity for 1.4 y in mice. Blocking cell proliferation via a chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) eliminated fast-cycling stem cells, which caused JE degeneration, PDL destruction, and bone resorption. Upon removal of 5-Fu, slow-cycling stem cells regenerated both the structure and barrier function of the JE. Taken together, our studies identified a stem cell population in the JE and have potential clinical implications for prevention and treatment of periodontitis.","Yuan, X; Chen, J; Gauer, J; Xu, Q; Van Brunt, L A; Helms, J A",Journal of dental research,828,1

AREAS COVERED The PUBMED database was searched 2016-2020. The clinical manifestation of SAE is delirium, SE additionally is characterized by focal neurological symptoms. SAE is caused by inflammation with endothelial/microglial activation, increase of permeability of the blood-brain-barrier, hypoxia, imbalance of neurotransmitters, glial activation, axonal and neuronal loss. Septic-embolic (SEE) and septic-metastatic encephalitis (SME) are characterized by focal ischemia (SEE) and small abscesses (SME). The continuum between SAE, SME and SEE is documented by imaging techniques and autopsies. The backbone of treatment is rapid optimum antibiotic therapy. Experimental approaches focus on modulation of inflammation, stabilization of the blood-brain barrier and restoration of membrane/mitochondrial function. EXPERT OPINION The most promising diagnostic approaches are new imaging techniques. The most important measure to fight delirium remains establishment of daily structure and adequate sensory stimuli. Dexmedetomidine and melatonin appear to reduce the frequency of delirium, their efficacy in SAE and SE remains to be established. Drugs already licensed for other indications or available as food supplements which may be effective in SAE are statins, L-DOPA/benserazide, β-hydroxybutyrate, palmitoylethanolamide and tetracyclines or other bactericidal non-lytic antibiotics.","Tauber, Simone C; Djukic, Marija; Gossner, Johannes; Eiffert, Helmut; Brück, Wolfgang; Nau, Roland",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,828,1

In the current investigation, we performed a detailed assessment of foot sole sensibility in women with morbid obesity (n = 13; age = 38.85, SD = 8.09 years) status in comparison with leaner women (n = 13; age = 37.62, SD = 7.10 years). We estimated tactile feet sole sensibility through graduated monofilament light touch applied at several hotspots of both feet soles, covering the toes, metatarsal heads, midfoot internal and lateral arches, and heel. Intergroup comparisons per foot sole region indicated significantly lower sensibility for the group with morbid obesity under the fifth and third metatarsal heads, midfoot lateral and internal arches and heel. We found a large variation across the sole regions, with the lowest difference between the obese and lean groups observed under the hallux (18%) and the largest difference observed under the lateral arch of the midfoot (76%). Correlation analyses between body weight and sensibility scores revealed a significant positive correlation among participants who were leaner (rs = 0.56, p = 0.05) but not among participants who were obese (rs = -0.06, p = 0.83). Mainly, our results showed that morbid obesity was associated with significantly higher cutaneous sensibility thresholds, with large variability of the sensibility deficit across different regions of both feet soles. Due to its functional relevance for body balance control, reduced sensibility thresholds among women who are morbidly obese may have implications for stance stability.","Bueno, Jair Wesley Ferreira; Coelho, Daniel Boari; Souza, Caroline Ribeiro de; Teixeira, Luis Augusto",Perceptual and motor skills,828,1

The VOCAL-Penn cirrhosis surgical risk score was recently developed and internally validated in the national Veterans Affairs health system, however to date this score has not been evaluated in independent cohorts. The goal of this study was to compare the predictive performance of VOCAL-Penn to the Mayo risk, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), and MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) scores in two large health systems. APPROACH & RESULTS We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgical procedures of interest at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center or University of Pennsylvania Health System from 1/1/2008-10/1/2015. The outcomes of interest were 30- and 90-day post-operative mortality. C-statistics, calibration curves, Brier scores, and the index of prediction accuracy (IPA) were compared for each predictive model. RESULTS A total 855 surgical procedures were identified. The VOCAL-Penn score had the numerically highest C-statistic through 90 days post-operative mortality, (e.g., 0.82 vs. 0.79 Mayo vs. 0.78 MELD-Na vs. 0.79 MELD), though differences were not statistically significant. Calibration was excellent for VOCAL-Penn, MELD, and MELD-Na, however the Mayo score consistently overestimated risk. VOCAL-Penn had the lowest Brier score and highest IPA at both timepoints, suggesting superior overall predictive model performance. In subgroup analyses of higher-MELD patients, VOCAL-Penn had significantly higher C-statistics as compared to MELD and MELD-Na. CONCLUSIONS The VOCAL-Penn score (www.vocalpennscore.com) has excellent discrimination and calibration for post-operative mortality among diverse patients with cirrhosis. Overall performance is superior to Mayo, MELD, and MELD-Na scores. In contrast to MELD/MELD-Na, VOCAL-Penn retains excellent discrimination among higher MELD patients.","Mahmud, Nadim; Fricker, Zachary; Panchal, Sarjukumar; Lewis, James D; Goldberg, David S; Kaplan, David E",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,828,31

Performed a descriptive literature review, using the descriptors 'COVID-19', 'Nanotechnology', 'Respiratory Syndrome' and 'Hydroxychloroquine', in the PubMed, ScienceDirect and SciElo databases. After analyzing the articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided into 3 sessions: Coronavirus: definitions, classifications and epidemiology, pharmacological aspects of hydroxychloroquine and pharmaceutical nanotechnology in targeting of drugs. We used 131 articles published until July 18, 2020. Hydroxychloroquine seems to promote a reduction in viral load, in vivo studies, preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells, and the safety of its administration is questioned due to the toxic effects that it can develop, such as retinopathy, hypoglycemia and even cardiotoxicity. Nanosystems for the delivery of drugs in the respiratory system may be a viable alternative for the administration of hydroxychloroquine, which may enhance the therapeutic effect of the drug with a consequent decrease in its toxicity, providing greater safety for implementation in the clinic in the treatment of COVID-19.","Cavalcanti, Iago Dillion Lima; de Fátima Ramos Dos Santos Medeiros, Sandrelli Meridiana; Dos Santos Macêdo, Daniel Charles; Ferro Cavalcanti, Isabella Macário; de Britto Lira Nogueira, Mariane Cajubá",Current drug delivery,828,1

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed and recruitment was done via personalized email sent to program coordinators of 113 ACGME-accredited otolaryngology training programs within the Unites States. The message requested a breakdown of the amount of time and specialty in which first year otolaryngologic residents rotated. Interval follow ups were sent at 3 and 6 months for coordinators who had not responded. RESULTS Response rate was 79.7% (90/113). General surgery and surgical intensive care unit were the two most common non-otolaryngologic rotations (92.2% and 96.6% respectively) while ophthalmology and radiation oncology were the least common at 7.8% each. All first year residents spend time on an inpatient otolaryngologic rotation, while 30.7% spend time on outpatient rotations. The most common subspecialties were head and neck oncology (40.0%) followed by pediatric otolaryngology (36.0%). CONCLUSIONS Otolaryngologic training continues to become more slanted towards specialty-specific training and a concurrent reduction in ""off-service"" rotations. General inpatient services still predominate the intern year both inter- and intra-departmentally. These data provide insight into the training environment of the otolaryngologic trainees set to graduate residency for the first time this year.","Maksimoski, Matthew; Mutchnick, Sean; Racette, Samuel; Yu, Karina J; Micco, Alan G","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",828,31

We present a multivariate analysis of 5-year survival in 309 patients (198 male, aged 64 (24-92)) treated at 617 sessions. Our standard protocol used internally cooled electrodes introduced percutaneously under combined US and CT guidance/monitoring. The number and size of liver metastases, the presence and location of extrahepatic disease, primary resection, clinical, chemotherapy and follow-up data were recorded. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.10. On multivariate analysis, significant survival factors were the presence of extrahepatic disease (p < 0.001) and liver tumour volume (p = 0.001). For 123 patients with five or less metastases of 5 cm or less maximum diameter and no extrahepatic disease median survival was 46 and 36 months from liver metastasis diagnosis and ablation, respectively; corresponding 3- and 5-year survival rates were 63%, 34% and 49%, 24%. Sixty-nine patients had three or less tumours of below 3.5 cm in diameter and their 5-year survival from ablation was 33%. There were 23/617(3.7%) local complications requiring intervention. Five-year survival of 24-33% post ablation in selected patients is superior to any published chemotherapy data and approaches the results of liver resection.","Gillams, A R; Lees, W R",European radiology,828,16

The development of automated methods for quantifying COVID-19 abnormalities in these CT images is invaluable to clinicians. The hallmark of COVID-19 in chest CT images is the presence of ground-glass opacities in the lung region, which are tedious to segment manually. We propose anamorphic depth embedding-based lightweight CNN, called Anam-Net, to segment anomalies in COVID-19 chest CT images. The proposed Anam-Net has 7.8 times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art UNet (or its variants), making it lightweight capable of providing inferences in mobile or resource constraint (point-of-care) platforms. The results from chest CT images (test cases) across different experiments showed that the proposed method could provide good Dice similarity scores for abnormal and normal regions in the lung. We have benchmarked Anam-Net with other state-of-the-art architectures, such as ENet, LEDNet, UNet++, SegNet, Attention UNet, and DeepLabV3+. The proposed Anam-Net was also deployed on embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, and mobile-based Android application (CovSeg) embedded with Anam-Net to demonstrate its suitability for point-of-care platforms.

ET-1 acts on endothelin receptors on vascular endothelial cells, sensitizes release of ATP, which then acts on P2X3 receptors on nociceptors and results in mechanical hyperalgesia. Both endothelin receptors and P2X3 receptors are present in primary sensory neuron, where it remains unclear whether there is an interaction between them. Herein, we reported that ET-1 potentiated the electrophysiological activity of P2X3 receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. ET-1 concentration-dependently increased α,β-methylene-ATP (α,β-meATP)-evoked inward currents, which were mediated by P2X3 receptors. ET-1 shifted the α,β-meATP concentration-response curve upwards, with an increase of 34.38 ± 4.72% in the maximal current response to α,β-meATP in the presence of ET-1. ET-1 potentiation of α,β-meATP-evoked currents was voltage-independent. ET-1 potentiated P2X3 receptor-mediated currents through endothelin-A receptors (ETAR), but not endothelin-B receptors (ETBR). ET-1 potentiation was supressed by blockade of intracellular G-protein or protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Moreover, there is a synergistic effect on mechanical allodynia induced by intraplantar injection of ET-1 and α,β-meATP in rats. Pharmacological blockade of P2X3 receptors also alleviated ET-1-induced mechanical allodynia. These results suggested that ET-1 sensitized P2X3 receptors in primary sensory neurons via an ETAR and PKC signaling pathway. Our data provide evidence that cutaneous ET-1 induced mechanical allodynia not only by increasing the release of ATP from vascular endothelial cells, but also by sensitizing P2X3 receptors on nociceptive DRG neurons.","Jin, Ying; Qiu, Chun-Yu; Wei, Shuang; Han, Lu; Liu, Ting-Ting; Hu, Wang-Ping",Neuropharmacology,828,1

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 116 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever. The patients were divided by the techniques adopted, the combined technique (proximal balloon guiding catheter and large bore distal access catheter) group (n=57, 49.1%) and the conventional (guiding catheter with stent retriever) technique group (n=59, 50.9%). We evaluated baseline characteristics (epidemiologic data, clinical and imaging characteristics) and procedure details (the number of retrieval attempts, procedure time), as well as angiographic (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score, distal thrombus migration) and clinical outcome (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] at 3 months) of them. RESULTS The number of retrieval attempts was lower (p=0.002) and the first-pass successful reperfusion rate was higher (56.1% vs. 28.8%; p=0.003) in the combined technique group. And the rate of final result of TICI score 3 was higher (68.4% vs. 28.8%; p<0.01) and distal thrombus migration rate was also lower (15.8% vs. 40.7%; p=0.021) in the combined technique group. Early strong neurologic improvement (improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥11 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤1 at discharge) rate (57.9% vs. 36.2%; p=0.02) and favorable clinical outcome (mRS at 3 months ≤2) rate (59.6% vs. 33.9%; p=0.005) were also better in the combined technique group. CONCLUSION The combined technique needs lesser attempts, decreases distal migration, increases TICI 3 reperfusion and achieves better clinical outcomes.","Kim, Sang Hwa; Choi, Jae Hyung; Kang, Myung Jin; Cha, Jae Kwan; Kim, Dae Hyun; Nah, Hyun Wook; Park, Hyun Seok; Kim, Sang Hyun; Huh, Jae Taeck",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,828,1

Less invasive vein harvest has been performed for this procedure with good results, but this procedure remains rarely used. METHODS We began to perform videoscopic-assisted BB-AVF creation in selected patients at our institution in 2006. Vein harvesting from the antecubital fossa to the level of the axilla is performed by an experienced surgical technician under the guidance of the dialysis access surgeon. Perioperative data and postoperative outcomes were retrospectively reviewed with institutional review board approval. RESULTS From 2006 to 2010, we performed videoscopic-assisted BB-AVF in 21 patients. Median age was 59 years and median body mass index was 30; women comprised 52% of the cohort. Previous vascular access procedures had been performed on 81% of patients. Of the 21 attempts with the video-assisted approach, only 1 required conversion to a standard open procedure. Of the remaining cases, there were no significant intraoperative or postoperative surgical complications with a median operative time of 159 minutes and maximum length of stay of 1 night. Maturation of the fistula sufficient for cannulation and use occurred in 80% of patients, with the median time to first access in patients who matured being 60 days. At 3 years follow-up, 47% of fistulas that matured were still functional, with 33% lost to death or successful renal transplantation. CONCLUSION Videoscopic-assisted transposition of the basilic vein is a reasonable option for BB-AVF placement. The procedure can be performed in an acceptable expeditious fashion with near elimination of infection, wound breakdown, lymph drainage, nerve injury, and satisfactory maturation (80%) and patency rates. Technicians experienced in lower extremity vein harvest can perform this procedure successfully under the supervision of an experienced access surgeon.","Leone, John P; Glaser, Alexander D; Hufstetler, Rick; Illig, Karl A",Vascular and endovascular surgery,828,28

These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries including developing ones had little, or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries like Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest x-ray and CT as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. Ultrasound (US) is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality which has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and in this way is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the ICU. This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit which keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This paper presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of ultrasound for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing ultrasound technologies which are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3D systems.","Qian, Xuejun; Wodnicki, Robert; Kang, Haochen; Zhang, Junhang; Tchelepi, Hisham; Zhou, Qifa","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",828,7

We, therefore, designed a nationwide survey to determine the main features of BC recipients and obtain a picture of the clinical use of BC for the first time in Italy, in order to understand BC demands better and identify specific fields in which to apply Patient Blood Management (PBM). MATERIAL AND METHODS A nationwide survey of all Italian Blood Establishments working as Hospital Blood Banks (HBB) was performed. Data were collected through an online report form recording information on the number and geographic area of the responding HBB, year of birth and sex of the BC recipients, and clinical indications for every unit of RBC, platelets and plasma transfused in a 24-hour period. RESULTS On the survey date, 153/237 (64.5%) of the HBB returned 4,356 forms, reporting 7,523 transfusions. The median and mean ages of the recipients were 73 (range, 0-106) and 67.5 years, respectively; 33.0% were >80 years old and 64.9% >65 years old, with no relevant differences between males and females. Overall, 6,309 RBC units were transfused to 3,850 recipients, 66.7% of them for a medical indication and 32.4% for a surgical indication. The commonest medical indication was acquired, non-cancer-related anaemia and more than 30% of the transfusions occurred in the Emergency Department. Five hundred and sixty platelet transfusions were given to 520 recipients, 62.7% of them for prophylaxis and 28.6% for bleeding before or during an invasive procedure or surgery or for thrombocytopenia.

A further tertiary analysis was conducted by dividing the studies into closed reduction techniques, open reduction internal fixation and 'other studies' and a narrative synthesis was performed. The study found a higher rate of complications and arthritis in the closed reduction group compared to open reduction internal fixation, suggesting that operative management should be considered for acute PIP joint fracture-dislocations.

The aims of this study were to describe the transport of pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to review the operational challenges that our transport system encountered. METHODS A retrospective descriptive study was performed to review all COVID-19 pediatric transport performed over a 6-month period during the initial pandemic surge in 2020. Pediatric patients with a known positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test at the time of transport were included. Patients' hospital records, including their transport record, were reviewed for demographics, diagnoses, transport interventions and complications, and admission disposition. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the patient cohort. RESULTS Of the 883 transports performed between April and October 2020, 146 (16%) tested positive for COVID-19 during the initial surge in our geographical area. Patient acuity was diverse with 40% of children having a chronic complex medical condition. More than 25% of children required aerosol-generating procedures during transport. The most common medical diagnosis was respiratory compromise, and the most common surgical diagnosis was appendicitis. No adverse events occurred during transports, and no transport team members contracted COVID-19 because of workplace exposure. Transport program operational challenges ranged from rapidly changing system logistics/policies to educational and utilization of proper personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS Children with COVID-19 can be transported safely with adaption of transport program procedures. Change management and team stress should be anticipated and can be addressed with repeated education and messaging.","McPherson, Mona L; Krennerich, Emily C; Arrington, Amy S; Sitler, S Garry; Graf, Jeanine M",Pediatric emergency care,828,11

The ongoing DAPASALT mechanistic clinical study will evaluate natriuretic, diuretic, plasma/extracellular volume and blood pressure responses to dapagliflozin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with normal or impaired renal function (D-NRF and D-IRF, respectively), and in normoglycemic individuals with renal impairment (N-IRF). In this study, a mathematical model of renal physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology was used to prospectively predict changes in sodium excretion, blood and interstitial fluid volume (IFV), blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria in DAPASALT. After validating the model with previous diabetic nephropathy trials, virtual patients were matched to DAPASALT inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the DAPASALT protocol was simulated. Predicted changes in glycosuria, blood pressure, GFR, and albuminuria were consistent with other recent studies in similar populations. Predicted albuminuria reductions were 46% in D-NRF, 34.8% in D-IRF, and 14.2% in N-IRF. The model predicts similarly large IFV reduction between D-NRF and D-IRF, and less but still substantial IFV reduction in N-IRF, even though glycosuria attenuated in groups with impaired renal function. When DAPASALT results become available, comparison with these simulations will provide a basis for evaluating how well we understand the cardiorenal mechanism(s) of SGLT2i. Meanwhile, these simulations link dapagliflozin's renal mechanisms to changes in IFV and renal biomarkers, suggesting these benefits may extend to those with impaired renal function and nondiabetics. Significance Statement Mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors' cardiorenal benefits remain incompletely understood. We used a mathematical model of renal physiology/pharmacology to prospectively predict responses to dapagliflozin in the ongoing DAPASALT study. Key predictions include similarly large interstitial fluid volume (IFV) reductions between subjects with normal and impaired renal function, and less but still substantial IFV reduction in non-diabetics, even though glycosuria is attenuated in these groups. Comparing prospective simulations and study results will assess how well we understand the cardiorenal mechanism(s) of SGLT2i.","Hallow, Karen Melissa; Boulton, David; Penland, Robert C; Helmlinger, Gabriel; Nieves, Emily; van Raalte, Daniel H; Heerspink, Hiddo L; Greasley, Peter J",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,828,6

One of the most debated issues is the resection distance from the pylorus. We conducted this study to elucidate any potential differences in the short-term outcomes between 2 and 6 cm distance from the pylorus in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study in a selected cohort of 96 patients was conducted from January 2018 to March 2019 in morbidly obese patients who had laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy performed at Suez Canal University Hospital. Outcome was expressed by excess weight loss percentage, resolution of comorbidities, improvement of quality of life, and incidence of complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The morbidly obese patients (body mass index [BMI] > 40 kg/m2 or > 35 kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities) in the study were divided into two equal groups: (1) Group 1 (48 patients) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a 2 cm distance from the pylorus resection distance and (2) Group 2 (48 patients) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a 6 cm distance from the pylorus resection distance. Body weight, BMI, bariatric quality of life, lipid profile, and comorbidities were evaluated pre- and post-operatively for a duration of 12 months. RESULTS Statistically, no significant differences between the two study groups regarding the excess weight loss percentage, comorbidity resolution throughout the postoperative follow-up, enhancement of the quality of life score throughout the postoperative follow-up, or incidence of complications (25% in Group 1 versus 25% in Group 2, p > 0.05) were found. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was an effective and safe management for morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities with significant short-term weight loss; it also improved weight-related quality of life and had an acceptable complication rate. The distance from the pylorus resection distance did not affect the short-term effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy regarding excess weight loss percentage, resolution of comorbidities, change in quality of life, or occurrence of complications.","Hussein, Ahmed H; Khaled, Islam; Faisal, Mohammed",Patient safety in surgery,828,16

Aggregating knowledge about these entities across a broader range of domains and languages is critical for information extraction (IE) applications. In order to facilitate text mining methods for analysis and comparison of patient's health conditions and adverse drug reactions reported on the Internet with traditional sources such as drug labels, we present a new corpus of Russian language health reviews. RESULTS The Russian Drug Reaction Corpus (RuDReC) is a new partially annotated corpus of consumer reviews in Russian about pharmaceutical products for the detection of health-related named entities and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. The corpus itself consists of two parts, the raw one and the labelled one. The raw part includes 1.4 million health-related user-generated texts collected from various Internet sources, including social media. The labelled part contains 500 consumer reviews about drug therapy with drug- and disease-related information. Labels for sentences include health-related issues or their absence. The sentences with one are additionally labelled at the expression level for identification of fine-grained subtypes such as drug classes and drug forms, drug indications, and drug reactions. Further, we present a baseline model for named entity recognition (NER) and multi-label sentence classification tasks on this corpus. The macro F1 score of 74.85% in the NER task was achieved by our RuDR-BERT model. For the sentence classification task, our model achieves the macro F1 score of 68.82% gaining 7.47% over the score of BERT model trained on Russian data.

Physicians still worry, however, about the range of its application and possible complications such as infection of the retained cuff and breakage. We, therefore, applied this technique in patients and enriched its administration for removing PD catheters. Altogether, 24 PD catheter removals in 24 patients were reviewed during the period from July 2018 to October 2019 in our hospital. Using the pull technique, the PD catheter's superficial cuff was dissected using an electronic knife, and the deep cuff was retained. All patients' catheters were successfully removed with no breakage. No incision or retained cuff was infected during the follow-up period (1.1-15.6 months). The appropriate peak force of pull traction was approximately 12-13 pounds, not very different from the mean maximum tensile force of 21.48 pounds for silicone tube breakage. The use of intermittent (rather than sustained) traction may reduce the breakage risk of the silicone tube. This method is a safe, practical, minimally invasive method for removing PD catheters, and it is suitable for application on special patients with peritonitis or who are on an immunosuppressant.","Wang, Jian; Li, Xiao-Sheng; Zhang, Feng-Xia; Wang, Run-Xiu; Cao, Feng; Tang, Xian-Hu; Chen, Xiao-Qing; Hong, Bo",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,828,24

As expression of metabolite transporters is a rate-limiting step in nutrient utilization, cell surface transporter levels generally reflect the cell's metabolic state. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is upregulated on actively dividing thymocytes, identifying thymocytes with an increased metabolism. However, it is not clear whether transporters of essential elements such as phosphate are modulated during thymocyte differentiation. While PiT1 and PiT2 are both phosphate transporters in the SLC20 family, we show here that they exhibit distinct expression profiles on both murine and human thymocytes. PiT2 expression distinguishes thymocytes with high metabolic activity, identifying immature murine double negative (CD4-CD8-) DN3b and DN4 thymocyte blasts as well as immature single positive (ISP) CD8 thymocytes. Notably, the absence of PiT2 expression on RAG2-deficient thymocytes, blocked at the DN3a stage, strongly suggests that high PiT2 expression is restricted to thymocytes having undergone a productive TCRβ rearrangement at the DN3a/DN3b transition. Similarly, in the human thymus, PiT2 was upregulated on early post-β selection CD4+ISP and TCRαβ-CD4hiDP thymocytes co-expressing the CD71 transferrin receptor, a marker of metabolic activity. In marked contrast, expression of the PiT1 phosphate importer was detected on mature CD3+ murine and human thymocytes. Notably, PiT1 expression on CD3+DN thymocytes was identified as a biomarker of an aging thymus, increasing from 8.4 ± 1.5% to 42.4 ± 9.4% by 1 year of age (p < 0.0001). We identified these cells as TCRγδ and, most significantly, NKT, representing 77 ± 9% of PiT1+DN thymocytes by 1 year of age (p < 0.001). Thus, metabolic activity and thymic aging are associated with distinct expression profiles of the PiT1 and PiT2 phosphate transporters.","Machado, Alice; Pouzolles, Marie; Gailhac, Sarah; Fritz, Vanessa; Craveiro, Marco; López-Sánchez, Uriel; Kondo, Taisuke; Pala, Francesca; Bosticardo, Marita; Notarangelo, Luigi D; Petit, Vincent; Taylor, Naomi; Zimmermann, Valérie S",Frontiers in immunology,828,26

The suggested models are verified with the example of epitaxial growth of α-, γ- and β-FeSi2 silicide thin films on silicon substrates. The density of near-coincidence sites is shown to have a decisive role in the determination of epitaxial thin film orientation and explains the superior quality of β-FeSi2 thin grown on Si(111) over Si(001) substrates despite larger lattice misfits. Ideal conjunctions for interfaces between the silicide phases are predicted and this allows for utilization of a thin buffer α-FeSi2 layer for oriented growth of β-FeSi2 nanostructures on Si(001). The thermal expansion coefficients are obtained within quasi-harmonic approximation from the DFT calculations to study the influence of temperature on the lattice strains in the derived interfaces. Faster decrease of misfits at the α-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) interface compared to γ-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) elucidates the origins of temperature-driven change of the phase growing on silicon substrates. The proposed approach guides from bulk phase unit cells to the construction of the interface atomic structures and appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of interfaces between arbitrary phases for subsequent theoretical investigation and epitaxial film synthesis.","Visotin, Maxim A; Tarasov, I A; Fedorov, A S; Varnakov, S N; Ovchinnikov, S G","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",828,19

METHODS This cross-sectional study collected data from travelers to Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, in winter 2008, via a health questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS Forms were returned by 15 976 (68%) travelers. Of these, 17% reported at least 1 influenza symptom, with runny or blocked nose (10%) and cough (8%) most common. Respiratory specimens were obtained from 3769 travelers. Estimated prevalence of influenza was 1.1% (4% among symptomatic, 0.2% among asymptomatic). The sensitivity of screening criteria ranged from 84% for ""any symptom"" to 3% for a fever of 37.8 °C or greater. The positive predictive value was low for all criteria. CONCLUSIONS Border screening using self-reported symptoms and temperature testing has limitations for preventing pandemic influenza from entering a country.

This paper examines challenges faced by socially excluded populations, with an emphasis on Indigenous peoples, to receive UHC in Latin America. We argue that social exclusion can have negative effects on health systems and can undermine progress towards UHC. We examine two case studies, one in Guatemala and one in Peru, involving citizen-led accountability initiatives that aim to identify and address problems with health care services for socially excluded groups. The case studies reveal how social exclusion can affect equity in UHC. METHODS In-depth analysis was conducted of all peer reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2019 on the two cases (11 in total), and two non-peer reviewed reports published over the same period. In addition, two of the three authors contributed their first-hand knowledge gathered through practitioner involvement with the citizen-led initiatives examined in the two cases. The analysis sought to identify and compare challenges faced by socially excluded Indigenous populations to receive UHC in the two cases. RESULTS Citizen-led accountability initiatives in Guatemala and Peru reveal very similar patterns of serious deficiencies that undermine efforts towards the realization of Universal Health Coverage in both countries. In each case, the socially excluded populations are served by a dysfunctional publicly provided health system marked by gaps and often invisible barriers. The cases suggest that, while funding and social rights to coverage have expanded, marginalized populations in Guatemala and Peru still do not receive either the health care services or the protection against financial hardship promised by health systems in each country. In both cases, the dysfunctional character of the system remains in place, undermining progress towards UHC. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that efforts to promote UHC cannot stop at increasing health systems financing. In addition, these efforts need to contend with the deeper challenges of democratizing state institutions, including health systems, involved in marginalizing and excluding certain population groups. This includes stronger accountability systems within public institutions. More inclusive accountability mechanisms are an important step in promoting equitable progress towards UHC.","Samuel, Jeannie; Flores, Walter; Frisancho, Ariel",International journal for equity in health,828,16

We aimed to investigate whether high anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] trough levels [TLs] were associated with toxicity and impaired quality of life [QoL]. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study in IBD patients in clinical and biochemical remission on IFX or ADA maintenance therapy. Trough serum concentrations and antidrug antibodies were measured in addition to biochemical markers of inflammation in serum and stool to confirm quiescent disease. QoL was assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and 36-item short form]. Side effects such as fatigue and arthralgia were measured with a visual analogue score [VAS]. Skin toxicity was reported with a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-derived score. RESULTS In all, 252 IBD patients on maintenance anti-TNF therapy were screened, of whom 95 [73 with Crohn's disease, 22 with ulcerative colitis; 72 on IFX, 23 on ADA] were in clinical and biochemical remission and were included. Median TLs were 5.5 µg/ml and 6.6 µg/ml for IFX and ADA, respectively. Patients with anti-TNF TLs above median had lower IBDQ scores than patients with lower TLs [IBDQ 176 vs 187, p = 0.02], particularly regarding systemic symptoms and emotional status. A trend towards lower SF-36 and higher fatigue scores was observed in the higher anti-TNF TL group. Skin and arthralgia scores were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS IBD patients with higher anti-TNF serum concentrations had significantly lower disease-specific QoL. Fatigue, arthralgia, and skin lesions do not occur more often in these patients. These data are reassuring that high serum concentrations of anti-TNF antibodies are not toxic.","Brandse, Johannan F; Vos, Laura M C; Jansen, Jeroen; Schakel, Toos; Ponsioen, Cyriel I J; van den Brink, Gijs R; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,828,16

These recommendations are developed and regularly updated by the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO), an independent advisory group at the Robert Koch Institute. Dermatological patients on immunosuppressive treatment should ideally receive all vaccinations included in the standard immunization schedule. Additionally, it is recommended that they also undergo vaccination against the seasonal flu, pneumococci, and herpes zoster (inactivated herpes zoster subunit vaccine for patients ≥ 50 years). Additional immunizations against Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B and meningococci may be indicated depending on individual comorbidities and exposure risk. Limitations of use, specific contraindications and intervals to be observed between vaccination and immunosuppression depend on the immunosuppressive agent used and its dosing. Only under certain conditions may live-attenuated vaccines be administered in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Given its strong suppressive effect on the humoral immune response, no vaccines - except for flu shots - should be given within six months after rituximab therapy.

The Chinese National Health and Medical Commission recently recommended the use of inhaled H2 in addition to O2 therapy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, and its effects extend to anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. SUMMARY In this review, we highlight key findings from preclinical research and recent clinical studies demonstrating that H2 reduces the organ damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion. We outline the critical role this effect plays in a variety of medical emergencies, including myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic shock, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as in organ transplantation. H2 is compared with established treatments such as targeted temperature management, and we discuss its possible mechanisms of action, including the recently identified suppression of TNF-α-mediated endothelial glycocalyx degradation by inhaled H2 . In addition, we describe our new method that enables H2 gas to be easily transported to emergency settings and quickly injected into an organ preservation solution at the site of donor organ procurement. CONCLUSION H2 is an easily administered, inexpensive, and well-tolerated agent that is highly effective for a wide range of conditions in emergency medicine, as well as for preserving donated organs.","Sano, Motoaki; Tamura, Tomoyoshi",Current pharmaceutical design,828,19

Modern medicine has revealed some connections between the lung and large intestine in tissue origin and mucosal immunity, and preliminarily illuminated the material basis and possible regulatory mechanism of the theory. Recently, this theory has been applied to guide the treatment of refractory lung and intestine diseases such as COVID-19 and ulcerative colitis and has obtained reliable efficacy. Existing research results show that the anatomical homogeneity of lung and large intestine promotes the correlation between lung-bowel mucosal immunity, and mucosal immunity and migration and homing of innate lymphocytes are one of the physiological and pathological mechanisms for lung and large intestine to share. Under the guidance of this theory, Chinese medicines with heat-clearing and detoxifying or tonic effects are commonly used in the treatment of the lung and intestinal diseases by regulating lung-bowel mucosal immunity and they can be candidate drugs to treat lung/intestinal diseases simultaneously. However, the existing studies on immune regulation are mainly focused on the expression levels of sIgA and cytokines, as well as the changes in the number of immune cells such as innate lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. While the following aspects need further investigation: the airway/intestinal mucous hypersecretion, the functional changes of pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barrier immune cells, the dynamic process of lung/intestinal mucosal immune interaction, the intervention effect of local pulmonary/intestinal microecology, the correlation and biological basis between the heat-clearing and detoxifying effect and the tonic effect, and its regulation of pulmonary/intestinal mucosal immunity. In this paper, we try to analyze the internal relationship between lung and intestine related diseases from the point of view of the common mucosal immune system of lung and intestine, and summarize the characteristics and rules of traditional Chinese medicine compound and its active ingredients, which have regulatory effect on lung and intestine mucosal immune system, so as to further explain the theoretical connotation of ""lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related"" and provide reference for the research and development of drugs for related diseases.","Lou, Zhaohuan; Zhao, Huajun; Lyu, Guiyuan",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

For wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), also obnoxious facilities, upgrading and expanding the capacity of existing WWTP, are more important than the construction of new plants, in some regions. This study analyzes and compares the social acceptance of different types of WWTP upgrades and capacity expansion projects. Contingent valuation method is used to elicit South Korean households' willingness to pay (WTP) for preventing the expansion of a WWTP. The aggregated WTP is interpreted from the perspective of social conflict costs. The results show that the annual mean WTP of South Korean households to prevent WWTP expansion ranges from KRW 32,058 (US $27.61) to KRW 45,793 (US $39.44) depending on spatial location, which implies that the social conflict costs for the WWTP expansion in South Korea are considerable. It is also found that an underground WWTP at current site is a best alternative to lower the social conflict costs; it is even better than relocation an existing WWTP to another area. Several related policy implications are provided based on the analysis results.","Huh, Sung-Yoon; Shin, Jungwoo; Ryu, Jaena",Environmental science and pollution research international,828,1

METHODS Patients with acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms treated with LVIS stent-assisted coiling (LVIS stent group) and laser-cut stent-assisted coiling (laser-cut stent group) were retrospectively reviewed from January 2014 to December 2017. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for potential differences in age, sex, aneurysm location, aneurysm size, neck width, Hunt-Hess grade, and modified Fisher grade. Perioperative procedure-related complications and clinical and angiographic follow-up outcomes were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the associations between procedure-related complications and potential risk factors. RESULTS A total of 142 patients who underwent LVIS stent-assisted coiling and 93 patients who underwent laser-cut stent-assisted coiling were enrolled after 1:2 propensity score matching. The angiographic follow-up outcomes showed that the LVIS stent group had a slightly higher complete occlusion rate and lower recurrence rate than the laser-cut stent group (92.7% vs 80.6%; 3.7% vs 9.7%, P = 0.078). The clinical outcomes at discharge and follow-up between the two groups demonstrated no significant differences (P = 0.495 and P = 0.875, respectively). The rates of intraprocedural thrombosis, postprocedural thrombosis, postoperative early rebleeding, and procedure-related death were 0.7% (1/142), 1.4% (2/142), 2.8% (4/142), and 2.1% (3/142) in the LVIS stent group, respectively, and 4.3% (4/93), 2.2% (2/93), 1.1% (1/93), and 3.2% (3/93) in the laser-cut stent group, respectively (P = 0.082, 0.649, 0.651, and 0.683). Nevertheless, the rates of overall procedure-related complications and intraprocedural rupture in the LVIS stent group were significantly lower than those in the laser-cut stent group (5.6% vs 14.0%, P = 0.028; 0.7% vs 6.5%, P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that laser-cut stent-assisted coiling was an independent predictor for overall procedure-related complications (OR = 2.727, P = 0.037); a history of diabetes (OR = 7.275, P = 0.027) and other cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 8.083, P = 0.022) were independent predictors for ischemic complications, whereas none of the factors were predictors for hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSIONS Compared with laser-cut stent-assisted coiling, LVIS stent-assisted coiling for the treatment of acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms could reduce the rates of overall procedure-related complications and intraprocedural rupture.","Xue, Gaici; Zuo, Qiao; Zhang, Xiaoxi; Tang, Haishuang; Zhao, Rui; Li, Qiang; Fang, Yibin; Yang, Pengfei; Hong, Bo; Xu, Yi; Huang, Qinghai; Liu, Jianmin",Chinese neurosurgical journal,828,23

The experimental results showed that ASA had the highest removal efficiency (54.70%) under conventional dosage, while PAM achieved the best removal effect (91.45%) at high dosage. Mechanism of coagulation was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results illustrated that when only PAC existed or the dosage of coagulant aids was low, double layer compression was the main principle. The increase of coagulant aids dosage improved the effect of adsorption and sweep flocculation significantly. Moreover, jar tests carried in different conditions demonstrated that the current coagulation systems were highly adaptable.","Zhang, Yujian; Zhou, Guanyu; Yue, Jiapeng; Xing, Xinyi; Yang, Zhiwei; Wang, Xinyu; Wang, Qingguo; Zhang, Jing",The Science of the total environment,828,5

These systems allow easy and repetitive puncture without causing much damage to the vessels. However, the body foreign surface of CVPS induces an inflammatory response with varying intensity (depending on the implant materials) that leads to formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the implant. This study was designed to investigate the influence of bacterial infection on the tissue reaction induced by implanted CVPS in adult patients. 20 patients (9 women, 11 men, 58 ± 14 yrs of age) were included in this study. These patients received explantation of a polysulfone based CVPS (ChemoSite™, Covidien, Mansfield, USA) due to port related infections (patients with bacterial infections at the implantation site: group A, 5 men, 1 women) or to other reasons such as termination of treatment, thrombosis, or CVPS dysfunction (patients without bacterial infections, group B, 6 men, 8 women) 299.9 ± 261.2 days after CVPS implantation. A sample of the encapsulating tissue covering the CVPS together with surrounding tissue (at least 1 × 1 cm2) was placed in a small container with fixing agent, a buffered neutral 4% formalin solution (pH 7). Histological sections of the samples were prepared for light microscopic analysis after paraffin embedding. Sections of 3 μm were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Weigert's elastic stain, and Heidenhain's azan stain. There was no difference in thickness, collagen and elastin content, or cell and capillary density of the fibrous capsule between both groups. Due to the wound healing reaction involving angiogenesis and fibroblast activation cell density and number of capillaries in the capsule tissue of all patients showed a positive correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). However, the study demonstrated that at the end of the foreign body reaction the artificial tissue layer which covers the CVPS after implantation due to foreign body reaction shows only low reactivity towards infections.","Hiebl, B; Hopperdietzel, C; Hünigen, H; Dietze, K; Jung, F; Niehues, S M",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,828,1

In this study, the relation between liver volume and function in ALPPS was studied using a multimodal assessment. METHODS Nine patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and operated with ALPPS were studied with hepatobiliary scintigraphy, computed tomography, indocyanine green clearance test, and serum liver function tests. A comparison between liver volume and function was conducted. RESULTS The preoperative FLR volume of 19.5% underestimated the preoperative FLR function of 25.3% (p = 0.011). The increase in FLR volume exceeded the increase in function at day 6 after stage 1 (FLR volume increase 56.7% versus FLR function increase 28.2%, p = 0.021), meaning that the increase in function was 50% of the increase in volume. After stage 2, functional increase exceeded the volume increase, resulting in similar values 28 days after stage 2. CONCLUSIONS In the inter-stage period of ALPPS, the high volume increase is not paralleled by a corresponding functional increase. This may in part explain the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with ALPPS.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results following this approach, in particular the hernia recurrence rate and the impact of repair on quality of life (QoL). METHODS Patients were identified from a prospective database. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess symptoms and a barium swallow radiograph was performed to determine anatomy. A validated QoL measure, Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was also applied to all patients. RESULTS Of the 69 eligible patients, clinical follow-up was available for 54 patients (78.3%). Follow-up ranged from 72 to 185 (median: 114) months. Post-operative heartburn and dysphagia were significantly improved, with 45 patients (83%) reporting a good or excellent result. Contrast radiology in 35 patients (65%) revealed recurrence in 12 patients (34%). Fifty-four patients answered the GIQLI questionnaire. The mean GIQLI score was 117 (61-136).

We have identified the genes for putative seryl-tRNA synthetase homologs widespread in bacterial genomes and characterized three of them biochemically and structurally. The proteins encoded are homologous to the catalytic domain of highly diverged, atypical seryl-tRNA synthetases (aSerRSs) found only in methanogenic archaea and are deprived of the tRNA-binding domain. Remarkably, in comparison to SerRSs, aSerRS homologs display different and relaxed amino acid specificity. aSerRS homologs lack canonical tRNA aminoacylating activity and instead transfer activated amino acid to phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of putative carrier proteins, whose genes were identified in the genomic surroundings of aSerRS homologs. Detailed kinetic analysis confirmed that aSerRS homologs aminoacylate these carrier proteins efficiently and specifically. Accordingly, aSerRS homologs were renamed amino acid:[carrier protein] ligases (AMP forming). The enzymatic activity of aSerRS homologs is reminiscent of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthesis, and thus they represent an intriguing link between programmable ribosomal protein biosynthesis and template-independent nonribosomal peptide synthesis.","Mocibob, Marko; Ivic, Nives; Bilokapic, Silvija; Maier, Timm; Luic, Marija; Ban, Nenad; Weygand-Durasevic, Ivana",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,828,12

Although the early studies in China have illustrated that the representative symptoms of COVID-19 include (dry) cough, fever, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, dyspnea, and muscle pain, there is increasing evidence to suggest that olfactory and taste disorder are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conduct this study to review the present literature about the correlation between anosmia or dysgeusia and COVID-19. METHODS A comprehensive literature search in 2020 of the electronic journal databases, mainly PubMed or Web of Science, was performed using the key words COVID-19 or respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with hyposmia, anosmia, dysgeusia, olfactory disorder or olfactory dysfunction. The country, study period, case number, inpatient or outpatient medical visit, evaluation method (subjective complaints of dysfunction or objective evaluation), and occurrence rate of olfactory or gustatory function were reviewed. RESULTS Many studies reported that the recoverable olfactory or gustatory dysfunction may play an important role as the early clinical symptom of COVID-19. It is associated with better prognosis, although further investigation and validation should be carried out. CONCLUSION Studies have shown that smell and taste disturbances may represent an early symptom of COVID-19 and healthcare professionals must be very vigilant when managing patients with these symptoms. In the pandemic era, this implies testing for COVID-19 by healthcare workers with full personal protective equipment.","Chang, Chin-Chuan; Yang, Ming-Hui; Chang, Shu-Min; Hsieh, Ya-Ju; Lee, Che-Hsin; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Yuan, Cheng-Hui; Chen, Yi-Ling; Ho, Sheng-Yow; Tyan, Yu-Chang",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,828,32

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800mg day on D1 followed by 600mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION Our results were clear indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need.

Clinicians must be aware of the way various diagnostic and treatment choices can affect the mother and fetus. Most clinically necessary radiographic tests can be safely performed and fall under the maternal radiation exposure limit of less than 0.05 Gray (Gy). Careful attention must be paid to acid-base status, oxygenation, and ventilation when faced with respiratory failure necessitating intubation.

Recent developments regarding laparoscopic surgery have been directed toward reducing the size or number of ports to achieve the goal of minimally invasive surgery, by minilaparoscopy, natural orifice access, and the transumbilical approach. The aim of this article is to describe our laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy technique using conventional laparoscopic instruments and ports. METHODS The Veress needle was placed through the umbilicus, which allowed carbon dioxide inflow. A 5-mm trocar was placed in the periumbilical site for the laparoscope followed by the placement of 2 additional 5-mm periumbilical trocars. The entire procedure was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments. At the end of the surgery, trocars were removed, and all 3 periumbilical skin incisions were united for specimen retrieval. RESULTS Five transumbilical cholecystectomies were performed following this technique. The mean BMI was 26.6 kg/m(2). The mean operative time and blood loss were 46.2 minutes and 55 mL, respectively. No intraoperative complications occurred. Analgesia was performed using dipyrone (1g IV q6h) and ketoprofen (100 mg IV q12 h). Time to first oral intake was 8 hours. Mean hospital stay was 19.2 hours. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic transumbilical cholecystectomy seems to be feasible even using conventional laparoscopic instruments and can be considered a potential alternative for traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","de George, Marco Aurélio; Rangel, Marlon; Noda, Rafael William; Kondo, William",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,828,16

We captured 266 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, China, during 2013 to 2015. CoV RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA-positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which we denote Wénchéng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to genes of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.IMPORTANCE The subfamily Coronavirinae contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in the viruses residing in bats. Here, we describe a novel alphacoronavirus (Wénchéng shrew virus [WESV]) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from those of all known coronaviruses. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to those of any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are important and longstanding hosts for coronaviruses that merit additional research and surveillance.","Wang, Wen; Lin, Xian-Dan; Liao, Yong; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Guo, Wen-Ping; Xing, Jian-Guang; Holmes, Edward C; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Journal of virology,828,24

Thirty-two articles were selected. RESULTS Cardiac surgery patients have an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 and require vital finite resources such as intensive care beds, also required by COVID-19 patients. Thus reducing their admission and potential hospital-acquired infection with COVID-19 is paramount. During the peak, only emergencies such as acute aortic dissections were treated, triaging patients according to surgical priority and cancelling all elective procedures. Screening and 2-week quarantine prior to admission were essential changes, alongside additional levels of PPE. Focus was on reducing length of stay and switching to day-cases to reduce post-operative transmission risk, whilst several hospitals adopted 'hot' and 'cold' operating theatres for covid-confirmed and covid-negative patients.

Recent evidence shows that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to inflammatory and fibrotic processes in diabetic kidneys. In this study we investigated whether polydatin attenuated renal fibrosis by regulating Nox4 in vitro and in vivo. In high glucose-treated rat glomerular mesangial cells, polydatin significantly decreased the protein levels of Nox4 by promoting its K48-linked polyubiquitination, thus inhibited the production of ROS, and eventually decreasing the expression of fibronectin (FN) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the main factors that exacerbate diabetic renal fibrosis. Overexpression of Nox4 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on FN and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, the expression of Connexin32 (Cx32) was significantly decreased, which was restored by polydatin treatment. Cx32 interacted with Nox4 and reduced its protein levels. Knockdown of Cx32 abolished the inhibitory effects of polydatin on the expression of FN and ICAM-1. In the kidneys of streptozocin-induced diabetic mice, administration of polydatin (100 mg·kg-1·d-1, ig, 6 days a week for 12 weeks) increased Cx32 expression and reduced Nox4 expression, decreased renal oxidative stress levels and the expression of fibrotic factors, eventually attenuating renal injury and fibrosis. In conclusion, polydatin promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Nox4 by restoring Cx32 expression, thereby decreasing renal oxidative stress levels and ultimately ameliorating the pathological progress of diabetic renal fibrosis. Thus, polydatin reduces renal oxidative stress levels and attenuates diabetic renal fibrosis through regulating the Cx32-Nox4 signaling pathway.","Chen, Zhi-Quan; Sun, Xiao-Hong; Li, Xue-Juan; Xu, Zhan-Chi; Yang, Yan; Lin, Ze-Yuan; Xiao, Hai-Ming; Zhang, Meng; Quan, Shi-Jian; Huang, He-Qing",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,828,29

TSL have been combined with various heating modalities, but there is no consensus on required hyperthermia duration or ideal timing of heating relative to TSL administration. The goal of this study was to determine changes in drug uptake when heating duration and timing are varied when combining TSL with radiofrequency ablation (RF) heating. METHODS We used computer models to simulate both RF tissue heating and TSL drug delivery, to calculate spatial drug concentration maps. We simulated heating for 5, 12 and 30 min for a single RF electrode, as well as three sequential 12 min ablations for 3 electrodes placed in a triangular array. To support simulation results, we performed porcine in vivo studies in normal liver, where TSL filled with doxorubicin (TSL-Dox) at a dose of 30 mg was infused over 30 min. Following infusion, RF heating was performed in separate liver locations for either 5 min (n = 2) or 12 min (n = 2). After ablation, the animal was euthanized, and liver extracted and frozen. Liver samples were cut orthogonal to the electrode axis, and fluorescence imaging was used to visualize tissue doxorubicin distribution. RESULTS Both in vivo studies and computer models demonstrate a ring-shaped drug deposition within ~1 cm of the visibly coagulated tissue. Drug uptake directly correlated with heating duration. In computer simulations, drug concentration increased by a factor of 2.2x and 4.3x when heating duration was extended from 5 to either 12, or 30 minutes, respectively. In vivo, drug concentration was by a factor of 2.4x higher at 12 vs 5 min heating duration (7.1 μg/g to 3.0 μg/g). The computer models suggest that heating should be timed to maximize area under the curve of systemic plasma concentration of encapsulated drug. CONCLUSIONS Both computer models and in vivo study demonstrate that tissue drug uptake directly correlates with heating duration for TSL based delivery. Computational models were able to predict the spatial drug delivery profile, and may serve as a valuable tool in understanding and optimizing drug delivery systems.","Rossmann, Christian; McCrackin, M A; Armeson, Kent E; Haemmerich, Dieter",PloS one,828,16

This study evaluated the clinical features, surgical and antibiotics treatment strategies, and treatment outcomes in patients with endophthalmitis caused by liver abscess. METHODS Between April 2014 and April 2019, the clinical data of 16 patients (19 eyes) with endophthalmitis associated with liver abscess who underwent surgery at Shengjing Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, we evaluated the final visual outcomes in the patients to determine the efficacy of surgery. RESULTS Fifteen patients (18 eyes) underwent intravitreal injection followed by vitrectomy after admission. One patient (1 eye) only underwent intravitreal injection. Of the 16 patients, 3 patients (3 eyes) had recurrent intraocular inflammation and eventually underwent evisceration. Systemic antibiotics were administered for all patients based on the results of vitreous humor culture, blood culture, and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Outpatient follow-ups were performed until the patients were stable (6 months). Of the 19 eyes, 1 eye (5%) had visual acuity restored to 20/200, 6 eyes (31%) had visual acuity restored to counting fingers (CF), 2 eyes (11%) had visual acuity restored to hand motion (HM), 4 eyes (22%) showed only light perception (LP), and the remaining 6 eyes (31%) showed no light perception (NLP). Drug susceptibility tests suggested that the carbapenems exhibited significant effects in the inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSION Endogenous endophthalmitis caused by liver abscess is a very serious condition, and the final visual outcome is poor.

Such inhibition may operate on the whole-language and/or item-specific level. In this study, we examined these two levels of control in parallel, by introducing a novel element into the traditional cued language switching paradigm: half of the stimuli were univalent (each required naming in the same language every time it appeared), and the other half were bivalent (each required naming in different languages on different trials). Contrasting switch and stay trials provided an index for whole-language inhibition, while contrasting bivalent and univalent stimuli provided an index for item-specific inhibition. We then investigated the involvement of domain-general brain mechanisms in these two levels of language control. Neuroimaging studies report activation of the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a key region in the executive control brain network, during language switching tasks. However, it is unclear whether or not the pre-SMA plays a causal role in language control, and at which level it exerts control.

For this, the clinical data from 84 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tianjin Haihe Hospital (Tianjin, China) between January and February 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the following groups: The common COVID-19 group (n=61) and severe COVID-19 group (n=23). In addition, 30 healthy subjects were included as a control group. The results demonstrated that the percentage of neutrophils (NEU%) was significantly increased, while the absolute number of white blood cells, LYM and the percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%) were significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, in the severe group, the absolute number of red blood cells in female patients, the NEU%, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were markedly elevated, while those of LYM and LYM% were significantly decreased (all P<0.05). In addition, in the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis for the combination of LYM + CK, the area under the curve values were 0.96 and 1.00, with a sensitivity of 95.08 and 100%, specificity of 86.67 and 100% and cut-off values of 0.42 and 0.50 for the common and severe COVID-19 group, respectively.

Methods We used data from the Japan-Prediction of Neurological Outcomes in Patients Post-Cardiac Arrest Registry. This registry included consecutive comatose patients after OHCA who were transferred to 15 hospitals in Japan from 2011 to 2013. Our primary end-point was a good neurological outcome (cerebral performance categories 1 or 2) at 90 days after OHCA. Results Among the enrolled patients, 121 (6.3%) received ECPR. Eleven (9.1%) had a good neurological outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed the optimal cut-off value as >16%. Good neurological outcomes were observed in 19.6% (9/46) and 2.7% (2/74) of patients with rSO2 >16% and rSO2 ≤16%, respectively. Conclusion The neurological outcome of ECPR patients differed according to their rSO2 values. When considering ECPR, the rSO2 value could be important in addition to other criteria. Further studies that focus on ECPR patients and serial rSO2 values are needed.","Joo, Woo Jin; Ide, Kazuki; Nishiyama, Kei; Seki, Tomotsugu; Tanaka, Hiroyuki; Tsuchiya, Jumpei; Ito, Noritoshi; Yoshida, Kosuke; Kawakami, Koji",Acute medicine & surgery,828,1

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with acute intracranial arterial occlusion who underwent high-resolution contrast-enhanced VW-MRI within days of stroke presentation. For each patient, we categorized arterial wall thickening and enhancement as definite, possible, or none using contralateral arteries as a reference standard. We performed χ(2) tests to compare the effects of medical therapy and mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Sixteen patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Median time from symptom onset to VW-MRI was 3 days (interquartile range, 2 days). Among 6 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever, VW-MRI demonstrated definite arterial wall thickening in 5 (83%) and possible thickening in 1 (17%); there was definite wall enhancement in 4 (67%) and possible enhancement in 2 (33%). Among 10 patients treated with medical therapy alone, VW-MRI demonstrated definite arterial wall thickening in 3 (30%) and possible thickening in 2 (20%); there was definite wall enhancement in 2 (20%) and possible enhancement in 2 (20%). Arterial wall thickening and enhancement were more common in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy than with medical therapy alone (P=0.037 and P=0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Mechanical thrombectomy results in intracranial arterial wall thickening and enhancement, potentially mimicking the VW-MRI appearance of primary arteritis. This arterial wall abnormality is less common in patients with arterial occlusion who have been treated with medical therapy alone.","Power, Sarah; Matouk, Charles; Casaubon, Leanne K; Silver, Frank L; Krings, Timo; Mikulis, David J; Mandell, Daniel M",Stroke,828,0

While most essential nutrition interventions are delivered through the health system, nutrition-sensitive interventions from other sectors are critical. OBJECTIVE We modeled the potential impact that Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) interventions delivered by the health system would have on reaching World Health Assembly (WHA) stunting targets. We also included results for targets 2, 3, and 5. METHODS Using all available countries enrolled in the SUN movement, we identified nutrition interventions that are delivered by the health system available in the Lives Saved Tool. We then scaled these interventions linearly from 2012 up to nearly universal coverage (90%) in 2025 and estimated the potential impact that this increase would have with regard to the WHA targets. RESULTS Our results show that only 16 countries out of 56 would reach the 40% reduction in the number of stunted children by 2025, with a combined total reduction of 32% across all countries. Similarly, only 2 countries would achieve the 50% reduction in anemia for women of reproductive age, 41 countries would reach at least 50% exclusive breastfeeding in children under 6 months of age, and 0 countries would reach the 30% reduction in low birth weight. CONCLUSIONS While the health system has an important role to play in the delivery of health interventions, focusing investments and efforts on the health system alone will not allow countries to reach the WHA targets by 2025. Concerted efforts across multiple sectors are necessary.","Sawadogo-Lewis, Talata; King, Shannon E; Aung, Tricia; Roberton, Timothy",Food and nutrition bulletin,828,1

Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV) was first isolated from the heart blood of a fruit bat (Pteropus poliocephalus) in 1968. While the pathogenesis of NBV remains unknown, other related members of this group have caused acute respiratory disease in humans. Thus the potential for NBV to impact human health appears plausible. Here, to increase our knowledge of NBV, we examined the replication and infectivity of NBV using different mammalian cell lines derived from bat, human, mouse and monkey. All cell lines supported the replication of NBV; however, L929 cells showed a greater than 2 log reduction in virus titre compared with the other cell lines. Furthermore, NBV did not induce major cytopathic effects in the L929 cells, as was observed in other cell lines. Interestingly, the related Pteropine orthoreoviruses, Pulau virus (PulV) and Melaka virus (MelV) were able to replicate to high titres in L929 cells but infection resulted in reduced cytopathic effect. Our study demonstrates a unique virus-host interaction between NBV and L929 cells, where cells effectively control viral infection/replication and limit the formation of syncytia. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control this unique relationship, important insights will be made into the biology of this fusogenic virus.","Mok, Lawrence; Wynne, James W; Grimley, Samantha; Shiell, Brian; Green, Diane; Monaghan, Paul; Pallister, Jackie; Bacic, Antony; Michalski, Wojtek P",The Journal of general virology,828,30

Management of Parkinson's disease with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) modifies initiation and inhibition, with prior work suggesting that these effects may be mediated via the connectivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the frontal cortex. Here, we employed high-resolution structural neuroimaging to investigate the variability in initiation, inhibition and strategy use in a cohort of twenty-five (ten females, mean age 62.5, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5) participants undertaking subthalamic DBS for Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychological assessment of initiation and inhibition was performed preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. We first reconstructed the preoperative connectivity of the STN with a frontal network of anterior and superior medial cortical regions. We then modelled the postoperative site of subthalamic stimulation and reconstructed the connectivity of the stimulation field within this same network. We found that, at both pre- and postoperative intervals, inter-individual variability in inhibition and initiation were strongly associated with structural network connectivity. Measures of subcortical atrophy and local stimulation effects did not play a significant role. Preoperatively, we replicated prior work, including a role for the right inferior frontal gyrus in inhibition and strategy use, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus in tasks requiring selection under conditions of maintained inhibition. Postoperatively, greater connectivity of the stimulation field with right anterior cortical regions was associated with greater rule violations and suppression errors, supporting prior work implicating right-hemispheric STN stimulation in disinhibition. Our findings suggest that, in Parkinson's disease, connectivity of the frontal cortex with the STN is an important mediator of individual variability in initiation and inhibition,. Personalised information on brain network architecture could guide individualised brain circuit manipulation to minimise neuropsychological disruption after STN-DBS.","Mosley, Philip E; Robinson, Katherine; Coyne, Terry; Silburn, Peter; Barker, Megan S; Breakspear, Michael; Robinson, Gail A; Perry, Alistair",NeuroImage,828,27

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the assistance of the SG in a porcine acute model. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 36 gastric ESDs were performed in 12 swine (3 ESDs/pig), at the antrum, greater curvature of the gastric body, and cardia. Pigs were randomly assigned to the SG group (n = 6) or to the control group (n = 6). ESD steps included the following: scoring the area, submucosal injection, and precut and submucosal dissection with or without SG assistance. Outcomes measured were as follows: dissection time, dissection speed, size of specimen, completeness of dissection (all marks included in the specimen), en bloc dissection, and complications. RESULTS Overall mean dissection time was 18.6 ± 7.56 versus 29 ± 18.14 minutes (P = .032), and mean dissection speed was 94.74 ± 39.74 mm(2)/min versus 65.41 ± 39.5 mm(2)/min (P = .033) in the SG and control groups, respectively. Mean size of the specimen was 1451.4 ± 549.2 mm(2) in the SG group and 1615.3 ± 605.9 in the control group. Complete and en bloc dissections were achieved in all cases. One deep muscular injury occurred in the control group (gastric body).

METHODS Data from three similar 14-week studies (an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase) of aripiprazole augmentation were pooled for this post hoc analysis. Two age groups were defined: younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (aged 50-67 years). The older patient group was further divided into three subgroups: 50-55, 56-60, and 61-67 years. The efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from end of the prospective phase (Week 8) to endpoint (Week 14, last observation carried forward (LOCF)). Remission was defined as MADRS total score ≤10 at endpoint. RESULTS Four hundred and nine older patients (placebo, n = 198; aripiprazole, n = 211) and 679 younger patients (placebo, n = 341; aripiprazole, n = 338) were included in this analysis. Older patients receiving aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score versus placebo at Week 14 (-10.0 vs. -6.4; p < 0.001; LOCF), similar to the improvement seen in younger patients. Remission rates were significantly higher with aripiprazole versus placebo in older (32.5% vs. 17.1%; p < 0.001) and younger (26.9% vs. 16.4%; p < 0.001) patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS In this study, 1464 inversely-planned treatments using Pinnacle or Raystation treatment planning software (TPS) were delivered using Elekta Versa HD, and Varian Truebeam and Truebeam STx linear accelerators between June 2018 and November 2019. For each plan, an independent dose calculation was performed using M3D and an absolute dose measurement was taken using a Pinpoint ion chamber inside the Mobius phantom. The point dose differences between the TPS and M3D calculation, and between TPS and IC measurement were calculated. Agreement between the TPS and IC was used to define the ground truth plan failure. In order to reduce the on-site personnel during the pandemic, two methods ROC analysis (n=1464) and machine learning (n=603) were used to identify patient plans that would require physical dose measurements. RESULTS In the ROC analysis, a pre-delivery M3D difference threshold of 3% identifies plans that fail an IC measurement at a 4% threshold with 100% sensitivity and 76.3% specificity. This indicates that fewer than 25% of plans would require a physical dose measurement. A threshold of 1% on a machine learning model is able to identify plans that fail an IC measurement at a 3% threshold with 100% sensitivity and 54.3% specificity, leading to fewer than 50% of plans that require a physical dose measurement. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to identify plans that are more likely to fail IC patient-specific quality assurance (QA) measurements prior to delivery. This possibly allows for a reduction of physical measurements taken, freeing up significant clinical resources and reducing the required amount of on-site personnel while maintaining patient safety.","Hasse, K; Scholey, J; Ziemer, B P; Natsuaki, Y; Morin, O; Solberg, T D; Hirata, E; Valdes, G; Witztum, A","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",828,1

With recent improvement of techniques and accumulation of experiences, LLR in PS segments is feasible, but studies investigating the result after the modifications are lacking. METHODS In this single-center, retrospective study, 149 patients who underwent LLR for HCC located in PS segments from September 2003 to December 2016 were analyzed. The patients were divided into Group 1 (n=43) and Group 2 (n=106) who underwent LLR before and after 2012, respectively, when advanced techniques including use of intercostal trocars, Pringle maneuver, and semi-lateral position of patient were introduced. Also, these patients were compared with those who underwent open liver resection (OLR; n=124) for HCC in PS segments during the same period.

Patients were stratified into three groups according to their levels of serum uric acid (SUA). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between SUA and central body fat distribution. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk factors for hyperuricemia (HUA). Mediation analysis was applied to assess the overall, direct, and indirect mediators of SUA levels. Results Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SUA levels were significantly positively correlated with waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), Android fat mass, Gynoid fat mass, fasting c-peptide (F-CP), and area under the curve of C-peptide (P < 0.05 for all). VAT [odds ratio (OR), 2.367; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.078-5.197; P < 0.001)], WC (OR, 1.041; 95% CI, 1.011-1.072; P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein (OR, 0.274; 95% CI, 0.104-0.727; P < 0.001), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.959-0.973; P < 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for T2DM patients with HUA. After mediation analysis, BMI and central obesity were found to have different partial effects on the association between SUA and F-CP (P < 0.001). Conclusion In patients with T2DM, HUA was positively correlated with F-CP and central body fat distribution, especially VAT. These results suggest that central obesity may play a role in the positive correlation between HUA and insulin resistance (IR).","Zong, Jing; Sun, Yi; Zhang, Yiqian; Yuan, Jin; Wang, Xinlei; Zhang, Rongping; Zhao, Xiaoqin; Zhao, Xuying; Gu, Yunjuan","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",828,5

The major clinical manifestations of EDS include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized conjunctive tissue fragility. This research aims to explore their perceptions and experiences about the phycological and social spheres. (2) Methods: Semistructured interviews were carried out. Participants were encouraged to talk about issues related to their disease by asking open-ended questions in one to one interview. The interview guide included questions to identify the syndrome's influence on the social and psychological life of patients All interviews were audio recorded, fully transcribed, and analyzed using the phenomenological theoretical framework. The method of analysis was the thematic interpreting of perspectives and approaches. (3) Results: 31 individuals were proposed to participate in this study. Five patients refused to participate, so a total of 26 interviews were performed. Six themes ((1) Pain and its consequences on a daily basis; (2) The need to name the problem: the diagnosis; (3) Restructuring leisure and social relationships; (4) Limitations due to economic conditions; (5) Psychological impact of the disease situation; (6) Professional limitations) and four subthemes ((1) The value of partner support; (2) The weather influence on social plans; (3) Physical exercise and illness; (4) Support groups) emerged from the data. (4) Conclusions: This study revealed the impact of the syndrome on the social and daily life of patients, and not only in a physical level, but also in a psychological and social approach. These findings allow healthcare providers to know more about this disease in order to support and give advice to patients about the changes they will have to make.","Palomo-Toucedo, Inmaculada C; Leon-Larios, Fatima; Reina-Bueno, María; Vázquez-Bautista, María Del Carmen; Munuera-Martínez, Pedro V; Domínguez-Maldonado, Gabriel",International journal of environmental research and public health,828,16

It was the first comprehensive exhibition focusing on the relationship of urbanization and cultural landscape in the Pearl River Delta and presented on an international platform. Since the open-door policy in 1979, the Pearl River Delta played a pioneering role in China's economic reform and urbanization throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This was resulted with unprecedent transformation of the cityscape and inhabitants' lifestyle. More importantly, it defined the artistic context and character of the southern region uniquely from other parts of China, providing an opportunity for an alternative narrative in the discourse of contemporary Chinese art. Taking Canton Express as a case to reflect the uncanny observations and immediate responses among the fourteen participating artists and collectives on the new reality brought by urbanization and economic development which may, however, conflicted with the socialist-communist political ideology. And such tension nevertheless triggered a collective consciousness in the artistic community and their traits of flexibility, openness and self-autonomy to seek for an artistic identity independent from the existing narrative of contemporary Chinese art legitimized by the officials for biennales held inside and outside China. On this note, the essay will point out Canton Express proposed an interdisciplinary curatorial methodology for positioning 'urbanism' in the discourse. It will also provide examples of how it was instituted into the official system, expanding the multiplicity of contemporary Chinese art other than the market and political symbols, and shifted attention to art productions from a local perspective with global resonance. Through Canton Express and curatorial projects held afterwards, this essay attempts to prompt future research and discussion on qualities and conditions for artistic production and circulation of Chinese art in a world emerging from the COVID-19.","Tam, I.",Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art,828,9

PURPOSE Members of the Certified Wound and Ostomy Nurse, Nurse Practitioners staff were charged with developing recommendations within 48 hours to help prevent and manage facial skin issues using available products that would not compromise the seal of the respirators. METHOD With the assistance of a health care safety specialist from the Environmental Health and Safety Department of the hospital, an ambient particle counting device was used to measure the N95 fit factor following application of a liquid skin barrier, transparent film dressing, light silicone-based adhesive dressing, or an extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing on the bridge of the nose and the cheekbones underneath an N95 respirator of 2 hospital staff members who volunteered to test the dressings. RESULTS All thin dressings tested showed a fit factor over 100, reflecting an effective seal. The highest fit factors were seen with the liquid skin barrier in the 2 volunteers (200 and 198, respectively). Thin dressing usage information was included in the hospital guidelines for N95 respirators and shared with staff. Subsequent feedback suggests that the light silicone-based adhesive dressing and the extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing were preferred. CONCLUSION Thin dressing use may help reduce skin complications among hospital staff during periods of extended N95 respirator wear time. Because use of the dressings did not result in failure of the quantitative fit test, they were permitted for use by health care staff under their N95 respirators. Studies are needed to help health care facilities optimize N95 respirator use to protect staff from coronavirus disease-19 and respirator-related skin complications while supply shortages remain.","Guschel, Susan; Chmiel, Karen; Rosenstein, Jennifer",Wound management & prevention,828,33

This study also aimed to see CT changes with clinical recovery or progression of disease. Materials and methods In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken in 80 hospitalized patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through RT-PCR at tertiary care center in Jaipur. Initially all patients were evaluated for their clinical parameters and then correlated with HRCT chest after hospitalization. CT findings correlated with duration of disease to assess progress or recovery. Results A total of 80 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adults in the fifth and sixth decade of age group with mean age of 50.40 years. There was a male preponderance (59% male and 41% female). Out of total analyzed patients, 39 patients (48.75%) were symptomatic, among them fever (79.47%), cough (74.35%), shortness of breath (36%) and sore throat (17.94%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations. A few patients (12.82%) also had other symptoms like headache, chest pain, pain abdomen, altered sensorium etc. 54% patients had some underlying co morbid disease in sample population. The most prevalent comorbidities were Diabetes mellitus (56%), Hypertension (48.83%), COPD/K-chest (12%), CAD (9.32%) and others (11.62%) like hypothyroidism, anemia, CVA etc. The lung pathological changes were evaluated by HRCT imaging and by assigning CT severity score. We found Typical COVID findings in 50% patients, Indeterminate in 11%, Atypical in 11% and 28% patients had Negative CT chest for COVID. The clinical status of patients correlated with the CT severity score, with mild cases showing score <15/25 in 45.83% patients and severe cases showing CT severity score >15/25 in 87.50% patients. The CT features varied with duration and course of disease. Proportional GGO was higher (59.37%) in early phase and it was lower (12.5%) in later stage of disease. Conclusion The varied spectra of COVID-19 presentation included fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat etc. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD/K-Chest and CAD were found as major comorbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease, especially if multiple. HRCT chest in COVID-19 patients had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance as positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic patients and co-morbid patients. Clinical symptoms of patients directly correlated with CT severity index. CT imaging was found to be useful in predicting clinical recovery of patients or progression of disease.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Rankawat, Govind; Bagarhatta, Meenu; Singh, Ajeet; Singh, Aparna; Gupta, Vishal; Sharma, Shrikant; Sharma, Raman",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,828,1

During the last 50 years, extensive data have been gathered enabling a study of time trends in the prevalence of common diseases in this age group. OBJECTIVES To examine the current prevalence of common diseases, compare the results with those of previous cohorts, and assess the influence of the massive immigration during the 1990s. METHODS The health examination at the recruitment centers includes a medical history, complete physical examination, and review of medical documentation provided by the family physician. If needed, additional tests and referral to specialists are ordered. The prevalence of selected diseases and severity was drawn from the computerized database of the classification board. Two cohorts, 1992-94 and 2003-04, were examined and compared with three previous cohort studies in 1957-61, 1977-78 and 1982-84. Data were stratified according to origin and country of birth. RESULTS The prevalence of asthma increased dramatically during the years from 10.2 per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 111.6 per 1000 examinees in 2003-04. The prevalence of tuberculosis declined and then increased from 0.6 per 1000 adolescents in 1982-84 to 2.4 per 1000 adolescents in 2003-04. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus increased from 0.2 cases per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 0.8 cases in 1977-78 and 1982-84 and 0.9 cases per 1000 examinees in 2003-04. The prevalence of severe heart defects and severe epilepsy declined in the last 20 years (1.4 and 1.7 cases per 1000 examinees in the 1982-84 cohort to 0.4 and 0.3 cases per 1000 examinees in the 2003-4 cohort respectively). The patterns of disease prevalence were different for immigrants: tuberculosis was more common while asthma and allergic rhinitis were less prevalent. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of common diseases among adolescents in Israel has changed over the last 50 years. There is a different pattern for immigrants and for those born in Israel.","Farfel, Alon; Green, Manfred S; Shochat, Tzipora; Noyman, Iris; Levy, Yeheskel; Afek, Arnon",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,828,27

The highly dynamic and rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19 has made it difficult to access accurate, on-demand information regarding the disease. Online communities, forums, and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant questions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members. However, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of relevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are rarely answered immediately. With the advancements in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of language models, it has become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer questions. However, such models are rarely applied and evaluated in the healthcare domain, to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date healthcare data. In this paper, we propose to apply a language model for automatically answering questions related to COVID-19 and qualitatively evaluate the generated responses. We utilized the GPT-2 language model and applied transfer learning to retrain it on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) corpus. In order to improve the quality of the generated responses, we applied 4 different approaches, namely tf-idf, BERT, BioBERT, and USE to filter and retain relevant sentences in the responses. In the performance evaluation step, we asked two medical experts to rate the responses. We found that BERT and BioBERT, on average, outperform both tf-idf and USE in relevance-based sentence filtering tasks. Additionally, based on the chatbot, we created a user-friendly interactive web application to be hosted online.","Oniani, David; Wang, Yanshan",ArXiv,828,1

Activation of viral glycoprotein (GP) by protease also has been reported for influenza virus. The most distinctive difference between influenza virus and SARS-CoV is the stage during virus replication in which viral glycoproteins are cleaved by proteases. In influenza virus, the protease makes a simple cut in the GP during maturation. In contrast, SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by the protease following receptor-induced conformational changes. The protease cleavage site in S protein is thought to be exposed only after receptor binding. In support of this model, we reported that the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2), which is highly similar to the S protein of SARS-CoV, requires two-step conformational changes mediated by sequential receptor binding and proteolysis to be activated for membrane fusion. Such a mechanism allows for tight temporal control over fusion by protecting the activating cleavage site from premature proteolysis yet allowing efficient cleavage upon binding to the receptor on target cells.","Matsuyama, Shutoku",Uirusu,828,1

We have recently reported that an original neuropathogenic LDV isolate, LDV-C-BR, contained a low level of a coexisting non-neuropathogenic LDV which, in a mixed infection of mice, rapidly outcompeted the former resulting in apparent loss of neuropathogenicity of the reisolated LDV. This correlated with an impaired ability of the neuropathogenic LDV to establish a viremic persistent infection. In the present study we identified the presence of three different quasispecies in another original neuropathogenic LDV by sequence analysis of cDNA clones of ORF 5 (encoding the primary envelope glycoprotein VP-3P) obtained from the isolate. Successful development of differential reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays allowed us to biologically clone all three quasispecies through repeated end point dilutions. Only one of the quasispecies (LDV-v) was neuropathogenic. The other two, LDV-vP (probably the same as LDV-P) and LDV-vx (a novel LDV quasispecies that had not been previously identified), were non-neuropathogenic and found to be the common LDV quasispecies associated with almost all LDVs originally isolated from mice carrying various other transplantable tumors. The neuropathogenic LDV-v became selectively amplified in the spinal cords of paralyzed mice, but possessed an impaired ability to establish a persistent viremic infection and was rapidly out-competed by LDV-vP and LDV-vx in mixed infections, just as reported previously for LDV-C-BR. The results further support our hypothesis that neuropathogenicity and impaired capability for viremic persistence of LDV are determined by the same molecular feature. The only consistent and biologically relevant molecular difference we have observed between neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic LDVs is the number of polylactosaminoglycan chains associated with the ectodomain of VP-3P.","Chen, Z; Li, K; Rowland, R R; Anderson, G W; Plagemann, P G",Journal of neurovirology,828,1

Many elective operations involving EES needed to be postponed, resulting in accumulated cases. Throughout one year during COVID-19, Hospital Sultan Ismail, Johor, Malaysia continued to perform various EES procedures. Although EES is an aerosol-generating procedure, it has become evidence that this minimallyinvasive surgical approach offers lesser bony drilling and shorter operative time as compared to open mastoidectomy. Thus, this reduced the risk of viral transmission to the surgeons and operating staffs.","Tengku Kamalden, T M I; Misron, K",The Medical journal of Malaysia,828,30

A real health and planetary crisis has appeared, much more substantial than that linked to SARS-CoV-1 in 2002-2004 and to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in 2012. In addition to respiratory damage that can be dramatic, this pathology is complicated by the frequency of cardiovascular, renal and coagulation diseases. Health care systems have had to adapt urgently, in the absence of hindsight from the pathology, and without effective therapeutic weapons. Through this review of the literature, we detail our local practices for the overall management of patients hospitalized in Intensive care.","Marchetta, S; Lambermont, B; Massion, P; Rousseau, A F; Layios, N; Robinet, S; Canivet, J L; Kisoka, G; Ledoux, D; Morimont, P; Piret, S; Wiesen, P; Misset, B",Revue medicale de Liege,828,17

The goal of the present study was to examine the role of vascular smooth muscle membrane Na+-K+-ATPase enzyme activity as well as nitric oxide synthase inhibition on the contractile responses induced by sickle erythrocyte constituents. 2 mm ring segments of rabbit carotid arterial ring preparations were placed in 20 ml organ baths containing physiological salt solution (PSS) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, at 37oC and pH 7.4 and isometric contractions recorded, under an initial load of 2g. Arterial rings were exposed to 50 µl of each erythrocyte constituent at an adjusted haematocrit of 0.6. The magnitude of K+-induced relaxation of 10-7 M phenylephrine (PE)-precontracted rings exposed for 30 minutes to K+-free PSS (which inhibits Na+-K+ pump) was estimated in the absence (control) or presence of RBC constituents (ghosts, erythrocytes or haemoglobin solution) from Hb SS subjects. Secondly, the influence of 20-minute exposure of the rings to SS GHOSTS on acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation of 10-7 M PE phenylephrine-precontraction (in the absence or presence of L-NAME) was evaluated. Our results show that K+-induced relaxation was significantly and differentially attenuated by erythrocyte constituents (p<0.05) in the order: SS GHOST > SS HBS > SS RBC. NO synthase inhibition with L-NAME further potentiated the enhanced PE contractions induced by SS GHOSTS and caused a greater attenuation of Ach-induced relaxation (compared with SS GHOSTS alone). The results suggest that SS erythrocyte GHOSTS induce enhancement of vascular smooth muscle tone via impairment of vascular Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity as well as attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation. These functional changes in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial function may contribute to the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease.","Azubuike-Osu, Sharon; Uche, Ogechukwu K; Ajayi, Ifedayo O; Ebeigbe, Anthony B",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,828,1

Motivated by a real-life case study, this paper focuses on developing a simulation algorithm that assists same-day package delivery companies to serve customers instantly. The proposed recommender system provides the best solution with respect to three criteria: cost, time, and sustainability, considering the variation in travel time and cost parameters. The decision support tool provides recommendations on the best alternative for transporting products based on factors, such as source and destination locations, time of the day, package weight, and volume. Besides considering existing new technologies like electric-assisted cargo bikes, we also analyze the impact of emerging methods of deliveries, such as robots and air taxis. Finally, this paper also considers the best delivery alternative during the presence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19. For the purpose of illustrating our approach, we consider the delivery options in New York City. We believe that the proposed tool is the first to provide solutions to courier companies considering evolving modes of transportation and under logistics disruptions due to pandemic.

At the mitigation stage of the epidemics in which several countries are now, the use of mobile apps that are able to trace contacts is of utmost importance in order to control new infected cases and contain further propagation. Here we present a theoretical approach using both percolation and message--passing techniques, to the role of contact tracing, in mitigating an epidemic wave. We show how the increase of the app adoption level raises the value of the epidemic threshold, which is eventually maximized when high-degree nodes are preferentially targeted. Analytical results are compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations showing good agreement for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. These results are important to quantify the level of adoption needed for contact-tracing apps to be effective in mitigating an epidemic.","Bianconi, Ginestra; Sun, Hanlin; Rapisardi, Giacomo; Arenas, Alex",,828,7
604370,604370,604370,Excess mortality from COVID and non-COVID causes in minority populations.,6.8471327,6.1665697,2021-09-28,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children, with viral pathogens being the most common etiologies. However, due to limited and inconsistent clinical diagnostic viral testing in the outpatient (OP) setting compared to the inpatient (IP) setting, the actual burden and distribution of viral pathogens across these clinical settings remain largely underreported. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of common respiratory viruses in medically attended ARI in infants. METHODS: We conducted a prospective viral surveillance study in Davidson County, TN. Eligible infants under one year presenting with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from OP, emergency department (ED), or IP settings. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for common viral pathogens using Luminex® NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel and for SARS-CoV-2 using Luminex® NxTAG CoV extended panel. RESULTS: From 12/16/2019 to 4/30/2020, 364 infants were enrolled, and 361 (99%) had nasal swabs collected and tested. Of those, 295 (82%) had at least one virus detected; rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) [124 (42%)], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [101 (32%)], and influenza (flu) [44 (15%)] were the three most common pathogens detected. No samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the mean age was 6.1 months, 50% were male, 45% White and 27% Hispanic. Figure 1 shows the total number of PCR viral testing results by month. RSV was the most frequent virus detected in the IP (63%) and ED (37%) settings, while RV/EV was the most common in the OP setting (Figure 2). Figure 3 displays viral seasonality by clinical setting, showing an abrupt decrease in virus-positive cases following the implementation of a stay-at-home order on March 23, 2020 in Nashville, TN. [Image: see text] Distribution of Respiratory Viruses in Different Settings [Image: see text] Distribution of Respiratory Viruses in Different Settings by Season [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most medical encounters in infants are due to viral pathogens, with RSV, RV/EV, and flu being the most common. However, distributions differed by clinical setting, with RSV being the most frequently detected in the IP and ED settings, and second to RV/EV in the OP setting. Continued active viral ARI surveillance in various clinical settings is warranted. Preventative measures such as vaccines and infection control measures deserve study to reduce viral ARI burden.
