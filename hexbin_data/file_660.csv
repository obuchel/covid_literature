METHODS: After 8 min of ventricular fibrillation and 2 min of basic life support, 24 pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=8), which were given intravenous bolus injections of SFI (1.0 mL/kg), epinephrine (EP, 0.02 mg/kg) and normal saline (SA), respectively. The animals were sacrificed at 24 h after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and serum interleuking-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mRNAs and proteins were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the EP and the SA groups, the ultrastructure of myocardial cells were slightly damaged and the systolic function of the left ventricle was markedly improved in the SFI group at 24 h after ROSC (P<0.05). In addition, compared with the EP and SA groups, the SFI group also showed significantly reduced levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-α, protein and mRNA levels of myocardial NF- κB and TLR4 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Activation of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the pathological mechanisms of post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. SFI may block NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response by reducing the activity of NF- κB and the level of TNF-α, thus playing a protective role in post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction.","Gu, Wei; Hou, Xiao-min; Li, Chun-sheng",Chin J Integr Med,660,18
204287,204287,204287,The Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 Fear and the Moderator Effects of Individuals' Underlying Illness and Witnessing Infected Friends and Family,23.93446,2.6837337,2021,"We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of Android handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people sitting in a pair of seats can cause variations of ±10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance.","Leith, Douglas J; Farrell, Stephen",PLoS One,660,16

It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers' likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.

In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated.

274687,274687,274687,The Utility of Virtual Patient Simulations for Clinical Reasoning Education,23.879156,2.9425268,2020,"BACKGROUND: Self-help organizations act in a self-determined manner, but can be strengthened by conducive framework conditions such as advanced training programs. The Austrian Competence and Service Agency for Self-help ÖKUSS was created as part of the framework of the concept for public promotion of self-help. It developed an advanced training program for the systematic support of nationwide self-help organizations (NSHO). The article describes the conceptual development of an advanced training program and discusses how to deal with ambivalences arising in the process. METHOD: Three training tracks were derived from the objectives of the concept for the public promotion of self-help (promoting the visibility of self-help organizations, strengthening self-help organizations in their activities, and patient participation). To determine the contents, the advanced training needs of NSHO were identified on the basis of process-produced data (including feedback forms), relevant literature, and the results of workshops with self-help representatives. An Internet search was conducted to build on existing offerings. The ÖKUSS concept was developed in several workshops with representatives of self-help organizations and its contents and framework conditions were discussed. RESULTS: Training Track 1 ""Strengthening self-help activities"" aims to strengthen the self-image of NSHO as a self-help organization and to support the implementation of activities with introductory seminars and additional workshops. Training Track 2 ""Promoting cooperation"" supports the meeting and dialogue between NSHO representatives and experts with expert dialogues and annual projects. Training Track 3 ""Strengthening collective patient participation"" prepares NSHO representatives for participation in health policy decision-making processes in a modular course. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: During the development process, ambivalences in a social, factual, time and space dimension were dealt with: On the social dimension, the aim was to take decisions regarding the objectives, form and content of the continuing education program as closely as possible to the participants and to offer low-threshold participation. On the factual level, the focus was on the competence of those affected and/or the transfer of competence for implementing activities. In terms of time, a balance had to be struck between the time resources available to the NSHO representatives and the time required to develop competence. In terms of space, on-site events were preferred to online events (before COVID-19). Finally, a different approach was chosen for each training track. For the further development of the advanced training program, a piloting and a participatory development with NSHO representatives is recommended.","Rojatz, Daniela",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,660,21

However, in view of Germany's continuously high attractiveness in this regard, these demands appear to be inappropriate, even in an international context. To ensure this attractiveness in the long term, it seems to be more important to focus on investments in digitisation, the digital infrastructure, and electromobility. Even in times of economic problems, e.g., the COVID19 pandemic, lowering the nominal tax burdens on companies is not necessarily the answer. Instead, temporary tax breaks for companies that invest during this phase of economic weakness may be more appropriate.","Eichfelder, Sebastian; Hoke, Jonathan",Wirtschaftsdienst,660,6

We present three examples of recent successful education, outreach, and communication activities that demonstrate how we leverage efforts and sustain connections to produce engaging results. First we describe our participation in the PolarTREC program, which pairs researchers with educators to provide deployments in the Antarctic, and how we have sustained relationships with these educators to produce high-quality experiences to reach target audiences even during a pandemic. We then focus on three activities from the past year: a summer enrichment program for high school students that was also modified for a 10-week IceCube after school program, a virtual visit to the South Pole for the ScienceWriters 2020 conference, and a series of short videos in English and Spanish suitable for all ages that explain traveling, living, and working at the South Pole.","O'Keefe, Madeleine; Bechtol, Ellen; Madsen, Jim; Argueta, Jocelyn; Shirey, Katherine",,660,16

This article describes an unsupervised CT scan image segmentation approach. This approach begins by performing a morphological reconstruction operation that is useful to remove the effect of the external disturbances on the infected regions and to locate different regions of interest precisely. The optimal size of the structuring element is selected using the Edge Content-based contrast matrix approach. After performing the opening by using the morphological reconstruction operation, further noise is eliminated using the closing-based morphological reconstruction operation. The original pixel space is restored and the obtained image is divided into some non-overlapping smaller blocks and the mean intensity value for each block is computed that is used as the local threshold value for the binarization purpose. It is preferable to manually determine the range of the infected region. If a region is greater than the upper bound then that region will be considered as an exceptional region and processed separately. Three standard metrics MSE, PSNR, and SSIM are used to quantify the outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons prove the efficiency and real-life adaptability of this approach. The proposed approach is evaluated with the help of 400 different images and on average, the proposed approach achieves MSE 307.1888625, PSNR 23.7246505, and SSIM 0.831718459. Moreover, the comparative study shows that the proposed approach outperforms some of the standard methods and obtained results are encouraging to support the battle against the COVID-19.","Chakraborty, Shouvik; Mali, Kalyani",Biomed Signal Process Control,660,20

The frequently used psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity test appears to have lower validity than previously described, but other quick, simple and high throughput tests are currently unavailable. NEW METHOD: In the context of modeling the behavioral facets of mania, we previously suggested that the sweet solution preference test (SSP) in naive mice might have predictive validity for screening anti-manic effects. The current study further examined this proposal by testing the effects of lithium, valproate and imipramine on SSP in three strains of mice (male mice from the black Swiss, ICR and C57bl/6 strains) and an exploratory test in females (black Swiss strain). RESULTS: Data demonstrate that lithium and valproate at appropriate dosing schedules significantly and reliably reduce SSP in all three strains (including in females) but that the antidepressant imipramine has no effects. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The results support the utilization of the SSP as mice screening model for anti-manic effects of drugs with stronger predictive validity compared with other methods. CONCLUSIONS: The SSP is not a comprehensive model for bipolar disorder but it has good predictive validity and strong practical value that can be applied towards simple and fast screening of large numbers of animals, without the need for specialized equipment or complicated/prolonged procedures. We therefore propose that the SSP is an advantageous screening assay for testing novel mood stabilizing drugs for anti-manic properties.","Kara, Nirit; Flaisher-Grinberg, Shlomit; Einat, Haim",J Neurosci Methods,660,1

Invasive mechanical ventilation is recommended for the management of patients with COVID-19 who have severe respiratory symptoms. However, various complications can develop after its use. The efficient and appropriate management of patients requires the identification of factors associated with an aggravation of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms to a degree where invasive mechanical ventilation becomes necessary, thereby enabling clinicians to prevent such ventilation. This retrospective study included 138 inpatients with COVID-19 at a tertiary hospital. We evaluated the differences in the demographic and clinical data between 27 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and 111 patients who did not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the duration of fever, national early warning score (NEWS), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission were significantly associated with invasive mechanical ventilation in this cohort. The optimal cut-off values were: fever duration &#8805;1âday (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 54.95%), NEWS &#8805;7 (sensitivity 72.73%, specificity 92.52%), and LDH >810âmg/dL (sensitivity 56.0%, specificity 90.29%). These findings can assist in the early identification of patients who will require invasive mechanical ventilation. Further studies in larger patient populations are recommended to validate our findings.","Chang, Min Cheol; Kim, Tae Uk; Park, Donghwi",Medicine (Baltimore),660,23

We present the case of a 25-year-old man with adjustment disorder who developed dyspnoea. He was concerned about COVID-19, but his test result was negative. After excluding COVID-19, the physician concluded that his symptoms were related to his psychiatric condition. However, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism by another physician. To avoid missing a diagnosis, physicians must practice zero-based thinking, regardless of COVID-19 concerns, and not be distracted from the patient's core problems. LEARNING POINTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant diagnostic errors can occur because physicians are so concerned about COVID-19 that they may ignore other diagnoses.To avoid missing a life-threatening condition during the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians must consider zero-based thinking, regardless of COVID-19 concerns, and not be distracted from the patient's core problems.Measuring vital signs after a short walk can be helpful for investigating suspected pulmonary thromboembolism.","Harada, Yukinori; Shimizu, Taro",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,660,30

However, concerning the latter, questions remain about their diagnostic and prognostic value and it is not clear whether all patients develop detectable antibodies. We examined sera from 347 Spanish COVID-19 patients, collected during the peak of the epidemic outbreak in Spain, for the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated possible associations with age, sex and disease severity (as measured by duration of hospitalization, kind of respiratory support, treatment in ICU and death). The presence and to some degree the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depended mainly on the amount of time between onset of symptoms and the collection of serum. A subgroup of patients did not develop antibodies at the time of sample collection. Compared to the patients that did, no differences were found. The presence and level of antibodies was not associated with age, sex, duration of hospitalization, treatment in the ICU or death. The case-fatality rate increased exponentially with older age. Neither the presence, nor the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies served as prognostic markers in our cohort. This is discussed as a possible consequence of the timing of the sample collection. Age is the most important risk factor for an adverse outcome in our cohort. Some patients appear not to develop antibodies within a reasonable time frame. It is unclear, however, why that is, as these patients differ in no respect examined by us from those who developed antibodies.","Markewitz, Robert; Torge, Antje; Wandinger, Klaus-Peter; Pauli, Daniela; Franke, Andre; Bujanda, Luis; Marimón, José Maria; Banales, Jesus M; Gutierrez-Stampa, María A; Nafría, Beatriz; Junker, Ralf",Sci Rep,660,24

METHODS: Cross-sectional, multi-centre study analysing self-reported adequacy of PPE and IPC training and correlation to a modified pandemic anxiety scale. Participants were current medical students and FiY1 doctors in the UK. Data were collected by an online survey. RESULTS: Participants reported that they received insufficient PPE information (43%) and IPC training (56%). Significantly, fewer participants identifying as women or BAME/mixed ethnicity reported receiving sufficient PPE information, compared with those identifying as men and White British/White Other, respectively. COVID-19-related anxiety was significantly higher in those without sufficient reported PPE or IPC training, in women compared with men, and in FiY1 doctors compared with medical students. CONCLUSIONS: With medical students currently volunteering in and imminently returning to hospitals in an educational capacity, levels of self-reported PPE and IPC training are sub-optimal.
