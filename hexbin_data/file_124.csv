251,Development of TaqMan(® )MGB fluorescent real-time PCR assay for the detection of anatid herpesvirus 1,2009-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with latent infection and mortality in ducks and geese and is currently affecting the world-wide waterfowl production severely. Here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 1 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 2 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and reproducibility of the AHV-1 fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of AHV-1 etiologically related application.","Guo, Yufei; Cheng, Anchun; Wang, Mingshu; Shen, Chanjuan; Jia, Renyong; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Na",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696427/,124
537,Vaccine Potential of Nipah Virus-Like Particles,2011-04-06,"Nipah virus (NiV) was first recognized in 1998 in a zoonotic disease outbreak associated with highly lethal febrile encephalitis in humans and a predominantly respiratory disease in pigs. Periodic deadly outbreaks, documentation of person-to-person transmission, and the potential of this virus as an agent of agroterror reinforce the need for effective means of therapy and prevention. In this report, we describe the vaccine potential of NiV virus-like particles (NiV VLPs) composed of three NiV proteins G, F and M. Co-expression of these proteins under optimized conditions resulted in quantifiable amounts of VLPs with many virus-like/vaccine desirable properties including some not previously described for VLPs of any paramyxovirus: The particles were fusogenic, inducing syncytia formation; PCR array analysis showed NiV VLP-induced activation of innate immune defense pathways; the surface structure of NiV VLPs imaged by cryoelectron microscopy was dense, ordered, and repetitive, and consistent with similarly derived structure of paramyxovirus measles virus. The VLPs were composed of all the three viral proteins as designed, and their intracellular processing also appeared similar to NiV virions. The size, morphology and surface composition of the VLPs were consistent with the parental virus, and importantly, they retained their antigenic potential. Finally, these particles, formulated without adjuvant, were able to induce neutralizing antibody response in Balb/c mice. These findings indicate vaccine potential of these particles and will be the basis for undertaking future protective efficacy studies in animal models of NiV disease.","Walpita, Pramila; Barr, Jennifer; Sherman, Michael; Basler, Christopher F.; Wang, Linfa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071823/,124
943,Functional Studies of ssDNA Binding Ability of MarR Family Protein TcaR from Staphylococcus epidermidis,2012-09-21,"The negative transcription regulator of the ica locus, TcaR, regulates proteins involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG). Absence of TcaR increases PNAG production and promotes biofilm formation in Staphylococci. Previously, the 3D structure of TcaR in its apo form and its complex structure with several antibiotics have been analyzed. However, the detailed mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family proteins such as TcaR is unclear and only restricted on the binding ability of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). Here we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), electron microscopy (EM), circular dichroism (CD), and Biacore analysis that TcaR can interact strongly with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), thereby identifying a new role in MarR family proteins. Moreover, we show that TcaR preferentially binds 33-mer ssDNA over double-stranded DNA and inhibits viral ssDNA replication. In contrast, such ssDNA binding properties were not observed for other MarR family protein and TetR family protein, suggesting that the results from our studies are not an artifact due to simple charge interactions between TcaR and ssDNA. Overall, these results suggest a novel role for TcaR in regulation of DNA replication. We anticipate that the results of this work will extend our understanding of MarR family protein and broaden the development of new therapeutic strategies for Staphylococci.","Chang, Yu-Ming; Chen, Cammy K. -M.; Chang, Yuan-Chih; Jeng, Wen-Yih; Hou, Ming-Hon; Wang, Andrew H. -J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448645/,124
1300,Quantification of Hantaan Virus with a SYBR Green Ⅰ-Based One-Step qRT-PCR Assay,2013-11-21,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a major zoonotic pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia, especially in China. Shaanxi province, which is located in northwest of China, is one of the areas in China most severely afflicted with HFRS epidemics annually. This study aims to establish a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay to detect HTNV both in cell culture and clinical serum samples. We established a SYBR Green Ⅰ-based one-step qRT-PCR assay that targets the S segment of the HTNV genome for rapid detection and quantification. The HTNV cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription, and the copy numbers of the HTNV cRNA were quantified. Standard curve was generated by determining the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values versus 10-fold serial dilutions of the HTNV cRNA over a range of 1×10(8) to 1×10(3) copies/μl. The standard curve had a reaction efficiency of 102.1%, a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.998, and a slope of -3.273. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the intra- and inter-assays ranged from 0.68% to 3.00% and from 0.86% to 3.21%, respectively. The cycle intervals of the qRT-PCR assay between each dilution ranged from 2.9 to 3.8 cycles, and the lowest detection limit of the qRT-PCR assay was 10 copies/μl. The assay exhibited high specificity that was confirmed by melting curve analysis, and no cross reaction with the Seoul virus (SEOV) and other viruses (HBV, HCV and HIV) was observed. HTNV RNA was also detected in the 27 serum samples of clinical HFRS patients using the assay, and the HTNV RNA viral load ranged from 2.06×10(1) to 1.95×10(5) copies/μl. The SYBR Green Ⅰ-based one-step qRT-PCR assay is a sensitive, specific, reproducible, and simple method for detecting and quantifying HTNV in cell culture and clinical samples.","Jiang, Wei; Yu, Hai-tao; Zhao, Ke; Zhang, Ye; Du, Hong; Wang, Ping-zhong; Bai, Xue-fan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836762/,124
1393,"Detection of Bovine Group A Rotavirus Using Rapid Antigen Detection Kits, RT-PCR and Next-Generation DNA Sequencing",2013-08-02,"We investigated the sensitivity of human rotavirus rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits, RT-PCR and next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) for detection of bovine group A rotavirus (RVA). The Dipstick ‘Eiken’ Rota (Dipstick) showed the highest sensitivity out of the seven RAD kits against all selected strains in limited dilution analyses, which was consistent with the results for equine rotavirus previously reported. RT-PCR had 10(0)–10(3)-fold higher sensitivity than the Dipstick. NGS using thirteen RT-PCR-negative fecal samples revealed that all samples yielded RVA reads and especially that two of them covered all 11 genome segments. Moreover, mapping reads to reference sequences allowed genotyping. The NGS would be sensitive and useful for analysis of less dependent on specific primers and screening of genotypes.","MINAMI-FUKUDA, Fujiko; NAGAI, Makoto; TAKAI, Hikaru; MURAKAMI, Toshiaki; OZAWA, Tadashi; TSUCHIAKA, Shinobu; OKAZAKI, Sachiko; KATAYAMA, Yukie; OBA, Mami; NISHIURA, Naomi; SASSA, Yukiko; OMATSU, Tsutomu; FURUYA, Tetsuya; KOYAMA, Satoshi; SHIRAI, Junsuke; TSUNEMITSU, Hiroshi; FUJII, Yoshiki; KATAYAMA, Kazuhiko; MIZUTANI, Tetsuya",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942952/,124
1454,A Vaccine of L2 Epitope Repeats Fused with a Modified IgG1 Fc Induced Cross-Neutralizing Antibodies and Protective Immunity against Divergent Human Papillomavirus Types,2014-05-06,"Current human papillomavirus (HPV) major capsid protein L1 virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccines in clinic induce strong HPV type-specific neutralizing antibody responses. To develop pan-HPV vaccines, here, we show that the fusion protein E3R4 consisting of three repeats of HPV16 L2 aa 17–36 epitope (E3) and a modified human IgG1 Fc scaffold (R4) induces cross-neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against divergent HPV types. E3R4 was expressed as a secreted protein in baculovirus expression system and could be simply purified by one step Protein A affinity chromatography with the purity above 90%. Vaccination of E3R4 formulated with Freunds adjuvant not only induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV pseudovirus types 16, 18, 45, 52, 58, 6, 11 and 5 in mice, but also protected mice against vaginal challenges with HPV pseudovirus types 16, 45, 52, 58, 11 and 5 for at least eleven months after the first immunization. Moreover, vaccination of E3R4 formulated with FDA approved adjuvant alum plus monophosphoryl lipid A also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV types 16, 18 and 6 in rabbits. Thus, our results demonstrate that delivery of L2 antigen as a modified Fc-fusion protein may facilitate pan-HPV vaccine development.","Chen, Xue; Liu, Hongyang; Zhang, Ting; Liu, Yanchun; Xie, Xixiu; Wang, Zhirong; Xu, Xuemei",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011685/,124
2398,Sustained live poultry market surveillance contributes to early warnings for human infection with avian influenza viruses,2016-08-03,"Sporadic human infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N6) virus have been reported in different provinces in China since April 2014. From June 2015 to January 2016, routine live poultry market (LPM) surveillance was conducted in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. H5N6 viruses were not detected until November 2015. The H5N6 virus-positive rate increased markedly beginning in December 2015, and viruses were detected in LPMs in all districts of the city. Coincidently, two human cases with histories of poultry exposure developed symptoms and were diagnosed as H5N6-positive in Shenzhen during late December 2015 and early January 2016. Similar viruses were identified in environmental samples collected in the LPMs and the patients. In contrast to previously reported H5N6 viruses, viruses with six internal genes derived from the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses were detected in the present study. The increased H5N6 virus-positive rate in the LPMs and the subsequent human infections demonstrated that sustained LPM surveillance for avian influenza viruses provides an early warning for human infections. Interventions, such as LPM closures, should be immediately implemented to reduce the risk of human infection with the H5N6 virus when the virus is widely detected during LPM surveillance.","Fang, Shisong; Bai, Tian; Yang, Lei; Wang, Xin; Peng, Bo; Liu, Hui; Geng, Yijie; Zhang, Renli; Ma, Hanwu; Zhu, Wenfei; Wang, Dayan; Cheng, Jinquan; Shu, Yuelong",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034097/,124
2536,"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay—A Simple, Fast and Cost-Effective Alternative to Real Time PCR for Specific Detection of Feline Herpesvirus-1",2017-01-03,"Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped dsDNA virus, is one of the major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection but is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for field tests. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39°C and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10(2) copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.","Wang, Jianchang; Liu, Libing; Wang, Jinfeng; Sun, Xiaoxia; Yuan, Wanzhe",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207716/,124
2846,Secretome of Intestinal Bacilli: A Natural Guard against Pathologies,2017-09-01,"Current studies of human gut microbiome usually do not consider the special functional role of transient microbiota, although some of its members remain in the host for a long time and produce broad spectrum of biologically active substances. Getting into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) with food, water and probiotic preparations, two representatives of Bacilli class, genera Bacillus and Lactobacillus, colonize epithelium blurring the boundaries between resident and transient microbiota. Despite their minor proportion in the microbiome composition, these bacteria can significantly affect both the intestinal microbiota and the entire body thanks to a wide range of secreted compounds. Recently, insufficiency and limitations of pure genome-based analysis of gut microbiota became known. Thus, the need for intense functional studies is evident. This review aims to characterize the Bacillus and Lactobacillus in GIT, as well as the functional roles of the components released by these members of microbial intestinal community. Complex of their secreted compounds is referred by us as the “bacillary secretome.” The composition of the bacillary secretome, its biological effects in GIT and role in counteraction to infectious diseases and oncological pathologies in human organism is the subject of the review.","Ilinskaya, Olga N.; Ulyanova, Vera V.; Yarullina, Dina R.; Gataullin, Ilgiz G.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5586196/,124
3444,"A comprehensive in silico analysis for identification of therapeutic epitopes in HPV16, 18, 31 and 45 oncoproteins",2018-10-24,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of circular double-stranded DNA viruses, showing severe tropism to mucosal tissues. A subset of HPVs, especially HPV16 and 18, are the primary etiological cause for several epithelial cell malignancies, causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide. Due to the high prevalence and mortality, HPV-associated cancers have remained as a significant health problem in human society, making an urgent need to develop an effective therapeutic vaccine against them. Achieving this goal is primarily dependent on the identification of efficient tumor-associated epitopes, inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response. Previous information has shown that E5, E6, and E7 early proteins are responsible for the induction and maintenance of HPV-associated cancers. Therefore, the prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I T cell epitopes of HPV16, 18, 31 and 45 oncoproteins was targeted in this study. For this purpose, a two-step plan was designed to identify the most probable CD8+ T cell epitopes. In the first step, MHC-I and II binding, MHC-I processing, MHC-I population coverage and MHC-I immunogenicity prediction analyses, and in the second step, MHC-I and II protein-peptide docking, epitope conservation, and cross-reactivity with host antigens’ analyses were carried out successively by different tools. Finally, we introduced five probable CD8+ T cell epitopes for each oncoprotein of the HPV genotypes (60 epitopes in total), which obtained better scores by an integrated approach. These predicted epitopes are valuable candidates for in vitro or in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies against the HPV-associated cancers. Additionally, this two-step plan that each step includes several analyses to find appropriate epitopes provides a rational basis for DNA- or peptide-based vaccine development.","Panahi, Heidar Ali; Bolhassani, Azam; Javadi, Gholamreza; Noormohammadi, Zahra",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6200245/,124
4172,Applying a Linear Amplification Strategy to Recombinase Polymerase Amplification for Uniform DNA Library Amplification,2019-11-12,"[Image: see text] Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification method with broad applications as a point-of-care test and in molecular biology techniques. Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the size-variable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.","Lee, Jeewon; Heo, Sunghoon; Bang, Duhee",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882106/,124
4329,A Single and Un-Adjuvanted Dose of a Chimpanzee Adenovirus-Vectored Vaccine against Chikungunya Virus Fully Protects Mice from Lethal Disease,2019-11-12,"The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has become a major global health problem. Upon infection, chikungunya fever (CHIKF) can result in long-term joint pain and arthritis, and despite intense research, no licensed vaccine for CHIKV is available. We have developed two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1) that induce swift and robust anti-CHIKV immune responses with a single dose, without the need for adjuvants or booster vaccines. Here, we report the vaccines’ protective efficacies against CHIKV infection in a lethal A129 mouse model. Our results indicate that a single, un-adjuvanted ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ΔCap dose provided complete protection against a lethal virus challenge and prevented CHIKV-associated severe inflammation. These candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 CHIKV reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects, such as weight loss. Vaccination with either ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ΔCap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection, indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested. We conclude that both replication-deficient ChAdOx1 Chik vaccines are safe even when used in A129 mice and afford complete protection from a lethal challenge.","Campos, Rafael Kroon; Preciado-Llanes, Lorena; Azar, Sasha R.; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Rossi, Shannan L.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963200/,124
4974,Detection of equine arteritis virus (EAV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and differentiation of EAV strains by restriction enzyme analysis of PCR products,1995,"We have used Western blotting to examine the accumulation of feline calicivirus proteins within the infected cell. Experiments using elevated growth temperature to block post-translational cleavage have demonstrated two additional high molecular weight protein bands 125 kd and 123 kd respectively which may be precursor polyproteins. Inhibition of proteolytic processing withp-fluorophenylalanine led to the accumulation of several additional protein species which may represent intermediates in the protein processing pathway. None of these proteins were related to the 62 kd major capsid protein (cP 62) of the virus as judged by reaction with monoclonal antibodies. The production of a 76 kd capsid precursor protein (cpP 76) was demonstrated for the first time in FCV-infected cells. The pathway by which calicivirus polypeptides are made thus appears highly complex and may involve temporal regulation of protein synthesis as well as protein processing. Tentative identification of primary, intermediate and mature forms of virus proteins is discussed.","Carter, M. J.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087142/,124
5558,Development of a Quantitative Real-Time Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification Assay with an Internal Control Using Molecular Beacon Probes for Selective and Sensitive Detection of Human Rhinovirus Serotypes,2011-07-05,"Baxter has developed a new recombinant factor IX (rFIX) drug product (BAX326) for treating patients with hemophilia B, or congenital FIX deficiency. An extensive preclinical program evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of BAX326 in different species. The efficacy of BAX326 was tested in three mouse models of primary pharmacodynamics: tail-tip bleeding, carotid occlusion, and thrombelastography. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated after a single intravenous bolus injection in mice, rats, and macaques. Toxicity was assessed in rats and macaques, safety pharmacology in rabbits and macaques, and immunogenicity in mice. BAX326 was shown to be efficacious in all three primary pharmacodynamic studies (P ≤ 0.0076). Hemostatic efficacy was dose related and similar for the three lots tested. Pharmacokinetic results showed that rFIX activity and rFIX antigen concentrations declined in a bi-phasic manner, similar to a previously licensed rFIX product. BAX326 was well tolerated in rabbits and macaques at all dose levels; no thrombogenic events and no adverse clinical, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects occurred. BAX326 was also shown to have a similar immunogenicity profile to the comparator rFIX product in mice. These results demonstrate that BAX326 has a favorable preclinical safety and efficacy profile, predictive of a comparable effect to that of the previously licensed rFIX in humans.

7416,Validation of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Reference Genes for Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Normalization,2007-05-11,"Upper respiratory tract infections are common and important. Although rarely fatal, they are a source of significant morbidity and carry a considerable economic burden. Numerous therapies for the common cold have no effect on symptoms or outcome. Complications such as cough are not improved by over-the-counter preparations, while labelling cough alone as a symptom of asthma may result in unnecessary use of inhaled steroid treatment. Clinical presentation of sore throat does not accurately predict whether the infection is viral or bacterial, while throat culture and rapid antigen tests do not significantly change prescribing practice. Antibiotics have only a limited place in the management of recurrent sore throat due to group A β-haemolytic streptococcal infection. Routine use of antibiotics in upper respiratory infection enhances parent belief in their effectiveness and increases the likelihood of future consultation in primary care for minor self-limiting illness. Respiratory viruses play a major role in the aetiology of acute otitis media (AOM); prevention includes the use of influenza or RSV vaccination, in addition to reducing other risk factors such as early exposure to respiratory viruses in day-care settings and to environmental tobacco smoke. The use of ventilation tubes (grommets) in secretory otitis media (SOM) remains controversial with conflicting data on developmental outcome and quality of life in young children.

9871,Morphologic study of virus‐like particles in a case of acute leukemia,2006-06-28,"Members of four different groups of animal viruses are known to cause cancer in animals. (Only two of them, the leukoviruses and herpesviruses, cause cancer in nonlaboratory situations.) All the members of these groups of viruses form integrated viral DNA in infected cells. However, the efficiencies with which they cause cancer vary by over a dozen orders of magnitude. These differences in efficiency are a result of differences in efficiency of formation and expression of the genes for neoplastic transformation. Four models of mechanisms for formation of the genes for neoplastic transformation are presented. Two involve the formation of new DNA sequences. No efficient human cancer‐causing viruses are known. Therefore, it is proposed that human cancer is a result of formation of the genes for neoplastic transformation by misevolution of a normal cellular information transferring process. This misevolution is caused by chemicals, physical agents, or viruses.","Temin, Howard M.",Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162371/,124
10053,Development and evaluation of a real‐time nucleic acid sequence based amplification assay for rapid detection of influenza A,2004-10-13,"Recently, considerable attention has been focused on thymus‐derived CD4(+) regulatory T cells that constitutively express CD25 and have a contact‐dependent, cytokine‐independent mechanism in vitro. However, peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells can also be induced to become regulatory T cells. Here we review our studies using the combination of IL‐2 and transforming growth factor β (TGF‐β) to generate regulatory T cell subsets ex vivo, and the work of others using IL‐10 to induce suppressive activity. Under certain conditions, the autocrine effects of TGF‐β and IL‐10 induce peripheral T cells to produce immunosuppressive levels of each of these cytokines. This effect of TGF‐β is IL‐2 dependent. Under other conditions IL‐2 and TGF‐β can induce CD4(+) cells to develop potent contact‐dependent, cytokine‐independent regulatory activity. At present, there is considerable confusion concerning the mechanism of action of CD4(+) CD25(+) cells because cytokine‐producing regulatory T cells generated in the periphery can express CD25 and other markers displayed by naturally occurring, thymus‐derived regulatory T cells. We, therefore, propose a nomenclature that identifies thymus‐derived and peripheral regulatory cells, and that also differentiates T regulatory cells from T helper cells. Because T regulatory cells broadly control T helper cell reactivity, the mechanisms that control regulatory cell function are also reviewed. Finally, the potential use of regulatory T cells generated ex vivo as an adoptive immunotherapy for certain autoimmune diseases, to prevent organ graft rejection, or to prevent pathologic host responses to infectious agents is discussed.","Horwitz, David A.; Zheng, Song Guo; Gray, J.

Nevertheless, various barriers restrict the efficacy and/or prevent the widespread use of CAR T cell therapies in these patients as well as in those with other cancers, particularly solid tumours. Key challenges relating to CAR T cells include severe toxicities, restricted trafficking to, infiltration into and activation within tumours, suboptimal persistence in vivo, antigen escape and heterogeneity, and manufacturing issues. The evolution of CAR designs beyond the conventional structures will be necessary to address these limitations and to expand the use of CAR T cells to a wider range of malignancies. Investigators are addressing the current obstacles with a wide range of engineering strategies in order to improve the safety, efficacy and applicability of this therapeutic modality. In this Review, we discuss the innovative designs of novel CAR T cell products that are being developed to increase and expand the clinical benefits of these treatments in patients with diverse cancers.","Rafiq, Sarwish; Hackett, Christopher S.; Brentjens, Renier J.",Nat Rev Clin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223338/,124

The architecture is organized on four-layer and it integrates the latest concepts related to fog and edge computing. These concepts are activated through the use of fog/edge/gateway nodes, where the processing of data acquired from things is performed and it is the place where things interact with each other in the virtual environment. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal and description of a complete IIoT software architecture, the use of a unified address space, and the use of the computing platform based on SoC (System on Chip) with specialized co-processors in order to be able to execute in real-time certain time-critical operations specific to the industrial environment.","Ungurean, Ioan; Gaitan, Nicoleta Cristina",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583771/,124
13954,"The ChinaMAP analytics of deep whole genome sequences in 10,588 individuals",2020-04-30,"PURPOSE: We aimed to show the outcome of very early endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (VE-EDCR) in a routine pool of patients with acute dacryocystitis (AD) and abscess formation compared with the standard late external dacryocystorhinostomy L-ExDCR. METHODS: This was a prospective nonrandomized comparative study conducted from June 2013 to March 2016. Patients with AD and abscess formation were referred to our oculo-facial clinic in a university-based hospital. All patients received systemic antibiotics and were assigned to either of treatment groups. Patients in group 1 underwent late external transcutaneous DCR (L-ExDCR) and group 2 underwent EDCR within 3 days after first visit, named VE-EDCR. Primary outcome measure was success of surgery. RESULTS: Forty-one eyes of 41 patients with acute suppurative AD, were included from June 2013 to March 2016. Twenty-two patients underwent VE-EDCR and 19 underwent L-ExDCR. Mean age of patients was 43.41 (SD = 19.84, range 14–98) years. Mean follow-up was 14 (SD = 2.4) months. Anatomic, functional, and overall success in L-ExDCR and VE-EDCR groups were (89.5 and 86.4%, p = 0.99) (89.5% and 86.4%, p = 0.99) (89.5% and 81.8%, p = 0.66) respectively. Mean duration of cellulitis in VE-EDCR and L-ExDCR were 8.00 (SD = 4.63) and 16.11 (SD = 11.58) days, respectively (p = 0.027). No remarkable adverse event was found. CONCLUSIONS: Success of very early endonasal endoscopic DCR is comparable with the traditional late external DCR. Duration of cellulitis is shorter in VE-EDCR. This therapeutic approach can be considered in patients with acute suppurative dacryocystitis.","Pakdel, Farzad; Soleimani, Mohammad; Kasaei, Abolfazl; Ameli, Kambiz; Pirmarzdashti, Niloofar; Tari, Ali Sadeghi; Ghasempour, Mehrbod; Banafsheafshan, Ali",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609300/,124
14968,Development of Three-Dimensional Human Intestinal Organoids as a Physiologically Relevant Model for Characterizing the Viral Replication Kinetics and Antiviral Susceptibility of Enteroviruses,2021-01-18,"Low adherence in vaginal microbicide clinical trials for HIV prevention has impeded interpretation of trial results and hindered evaluation of potentially efficacious HIV prevention gels. Understanding the underlying reasons why women join trials and their barriers to product use can support identification of ways to improve adherence and its reporting. Eight focus group discussion workshops were conducted with 46 former microbicide trial participants in Durban, South Africa and Mwanza, Tanzania. Participants provided feedback on why women join trials, the barriers to using study gel and reporting adherence accurately, and how clinical trial design can be improved to support better adherence and its reporting. Women join microbicide trials for a number of important reasons such as healthcare and financial reimbursement. Fear of adverse effects from the investigational product was the most important reason why participants reported not using the gel. The key reason for inaccurate reporting of gel use was fear of removal from the trial. Participants made concrete suggestions for improving microbicide trial design such as applicator use testing and real time feedback, improving education to participants about how trials answer their research questions, and improving transparency and clarity about study procedures. Participants also gave feedback on an innovative trial design with a non-randomised arm. Identifying HIV prevention products for women requires better understanding of the lives of women asked to join these trials, and application of that understanding to microbicide trial design. This study has demonstrated that participants and research teams can work collaboratively to design clinical trials that meet needs of both the research and of participants.","Miller, Lori; Morar, Neetha; Kapiga, Saidi; Ramjee, Gita; Hayes, Richard",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7790400/,124
15100,"Computational target-based drug repurposing of elbasvir, an antiviral drug predicted to bind multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins",2020-04-08,"This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of Technology Lipido-Colloid with Nano Oligo Saccharide Factor (TLC-NOSF) wound dressings versus neutral dressings in the management of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) from a French collective perspective. We used a Markov microsimulation cohort model to simulate the DFU monthly progression over the lifetime horizon. Our study employed a mixed method design with model inputs including data from interventional and observational studies, French databases and expert opinion. The demographic characteristics of the simulated population and clinical efficacy were based on the EXPLORER double-blind randomized controlled trial. Health-related quality of life, costs, and resource use inputs were taken from the literature relevant to the French context. The main outcomes included life-years without DFU (LYs(w/DFU)), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), amputations, and lifetime costs. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on the wound duration at treatment initiation were performed. Treatment with the TLC-NOSF dressing led to total cost savings per patient of EUR 35,489, associated with gains of 0.50 LY(w/DFU) and 0.16 QALY. TLC-NOSF dressings were established as the dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the model revealed that, for every 100 patients treated with TLC-NOSF dressings, two amputations could be avoided. According to the subgroup analysis results, the sooner the TLC-NOSF treatment was initiated, the better were the outcomes, with the highest benefits for ulcers with a duration of two months or less (+0.65 LY(w/DFU), +0.23 QALY, and cost savings of EUR 55,710). The results from the French perspective are consistent with the ones from the German and British perspectives. TLC-NOSF dressings are cost-saving compared to neutral dressings, leading to an increase in patients’ health benefits and a decrease in the associated treatment costs. These results can thus be used to guide healthcare decisionmakers. The potential savings could represent EUR 3,345 per treated patient per year and even reach EUR 4,771 when TLC-NOSF dressings are used as first line treatment. The EXPLORER trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01717183.","Maunoury, Franck; Oury, Anaïs; Fortin, Sophie; Thomassin, Laetitia; Bohbot, Serge",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7822547/,124

To address this gap, we present the results of an experimental vignette study that includes antecedents from the privacy, robotics, technology adoption, and trust literature. Using linear regression analysis, with the privacy-invasiveness of a fictional but realistic robot as the key manipulation, we show that privacy concerns affect use intention significantly and negatively. Compared with earlier work done through a survey, where we found a robot privacy paradox, the experimental vignette approach allows for a more realistic and tangible assessment of respondents' concerns and behavioral intentions, showing how potential robot users take into account privacy as consideration for future behavior. We contextualize our findings within broader debates on privacy and data protection with smart technologies.","Lutz, Christoph; Tamò-Larrieux, Aurelia",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110194/,124
18828,Use of a demonstration project to evaluate viral survival in feed: Proof of concept,2020-06-26,"Since the professionalization of US‐based forensic anthropology in the 1970s, ancestry estimation has been included as a standard part of the biological profile, because practitioners have assumed it necessary to achieve identifications in medicolegal contexts. Simultaneously, forensic anthropologists have not fully considered the racist context of the criminal justice system in the United States related to the treatment of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color; nor have we considered that ancestry estimation might actually hinder identification efforts because of entrenched racial biases. Despite ongoing criticisms from mainstream biological anthropology that ancestry estimation perpetuates race science, forensic anthropologists have continued the practice. Recent years have seen the prolific development of retooled typological approaches with 21st century statistical prowess to include methods for estimating ancestry from cranial morphoscopic traits, despite no evidence that these traits reflect microevolutionary processes or are suitable genetic proxies for population structure; and such approaches have failed to critically evaluate the societal consequences for perpetuating the biological race concept. Around the country, these methods are enculturated in every aspect of the discipline ranging from university classrooms, to the board‐certification examination marking the culmination of training, to standard operating procedures adopted by forensic anthropology laboratories. Here, we use critical race theory to interrogate the approaches utilized to estimate ancestry to include a critique of the continued use of morphoscopic traits, and we assert that the practice of ancestry estimation contributes to white supremacy. Based on the lack of scientific support that these traits reflect evolutionary history, and the inability to disentangle skeletal‐based ancestry estimates from supporting the biological validity of race, we urge all forensic anthropologists to abolish the practice of ancestry estimation.","DiGangi, Elizabeth A.; Bethard, Jonathan D.",Am J Phys Anthropol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248240/,124

However, the extent to which they have been externally tested, and how well they generally perform has not been broadly evaluated. METHODS: A SCOPUS citation search was run on March 22, 2017 to identify external validations of cardiovascular CPMs in the Tufts Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness CPM Registry. We assessed the extent of external validation, performance heterogeneity across databases, and explored factors associated with model performance, including a global assessment of the clinical relatedness between the derivation and validation data. RESULTS: We identified 2030 external validations of 1382 CPMs. Eight hundred seven (58%) of the CPMs in the Registry have never been externally validated. On average, there were 1.5 validations per CPM (range, 0–94). The median external validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73 (25th–75th percentile [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.66–0.79), representing a median percent decrease in discrimination of −11.1% (IQR, −32.4% to +2.7%) compared with performance on derivation data. 81% (n=1333) of validations reporting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed discrimination below that reported in the derivation dataset. 53% (n=983) of the validations report some measure of CPM calibration. For CPMs evaluated more than once, there was typically a large range of performance. Of 1702 validations classified by relatedness, the percent change in discrimination was −3.7% (IQR, −13.2 to 3.1) for closely related validations (n=123), −9.0 (IQR, −27.6 to 3.9) for related validations (n=862), and −17.2% (IQR, −42.3 to 0) for distantly related validations (n=717; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Many published cardiovascular CPMs have never been externally validated, and for those that have, apparent performance during development is often overly optimistic. A single external validation appears insufficient to broadly understand the performance heterogeneity across different settings.","Wessler, Benjamin S.; Nelson, Jason; Park, Jinny G.; McGinnes, Hannah; Gulati, Gaurav; Brazil, Riley; Van Calster, Ben; van Klaveren, David; Venema, Esmee; Steyerberg, Ewout; Paulus, Jessica K.; Kent, David M.",Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366535/,124

Despite the technological advances in diagnostic testing and imaging modalities, obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis remains difficult and often not possible until autopsy. Major diagnostic discrepancies between clinical premortem diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings have been reported in these patients. The most common missed diagnoses are due to opportunistic infections and cardiopulmonary complications. These findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance, monitoring and treatment of infections and cardiopulmonary disorders in these patients.

26663,Disease management strategies in SARS,2005,"Background One of the main limitations of traditional surveillance systems for disease detection is their inability to detect epidemics in real-time. In addition to syndromic surveillance, a number of informal digital resources have been developed. These systems are based on data collected through media sources such as news reports on the Internet, mailing lists, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. The role of such systems at all stages of the epidemic remains unclear. Methods A literature review was carried out on informal digital resources for infectious disease surveillance. We examined the source of information, the manner in which they process and disseminate the information, their role in each phase of disease outbreaks, and whether and to what extent these systems are capable of early detection and management of infectious disease epidemics. Results Informal digital resources use similar sources of data for surveillance. However, they use different algorithms to create their output, and cover different geographic areas. In this regard, they complement each other with respect to information completeness. There is evidence in the literature on the systems’ usefulness in communicating information to public health professionals, as well as to the general public during and after previous epidemics. Retrospective studies of some systems have shown a theoretical decrease in the time of epidemic detection compared to conventional surveillance. However, there is no evidence of the ability for real-time detection. Conclusions Currently, there is little prospective evidence that existing informal systems are capable of real-time early detection of disease outbreaks. Most systems accumulate large amounts of information on a wide variety of diseases, making it difficult to extract critical information. Presenting critical information clearly and precisely remains a challenge.","Magid, Avi; Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Green, Manfred S.",Defence Against Bioterrorism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123634/,124

Methods: Ethical analysis is carried out by examining arguments that can be made in favor or against such a mandatory measure and by seeking a reasonably balanced position between them. Arguments under consideration are based on the duties of health professionals and public health authorities, the consequences of their actions and on other ethical principles. The importance of relevant empirical data is stressed without any attempt to review or analyze them systematically. Results: Mandatory vaccination of some health care professionals during a serious pandemic of influenza can be justified, but only under certain limited conditions. Conclusions: In the throes of an influenza pandemic, health care professionals (and to a variable degree, other health care workers) have an ethical obligation to accept influenza vaccination if it is reasonably safe and effective. The ethical responsibility of public health authorities is to limit the impact of a pandemic on the population by all reasonable means, which clearly includes the appropriate use of vaccine. Consequently, the vaccination of health care staff can be made mandatory under certain conditions. However, a critical objection to this conclusion, which upholds that a voluntary vaccination program (an ethically much less problematic intervention) is just as effective, needs to be addressed.","Kotalik, Jaro",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161670/,124

31624,Signaling Pathways of SARS-CoV In Vitro and In Vivo,2009-07-22,"Viruses replicate only within living cells. Some viruses are restricted in the kinds of cells in which they replicate, and a few have not yet been cultivated at all under laboratory conditions. However, most viruses are grown in cultured cells, embryonated hen's eggs, or laboratory animals. In veterinary virology, the natural host animal is used for the cultivation of viruses; indeed the earliest viral assay has been carried out with foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle. The natural host is still useful for the studies of pathogenesis and immunology, experiments in chemotherapy, and occasionally for diaglostic purposes. However, the in vitro cultivation of viruses in cell cultures is essential for the study of their mode of replication and for diagnostic virology. Cells may be grown in vitro as explants of tissue, such as respiratory or intestinal epithelium, or as cell cultures. Explant cultures are occasionally used for research purposes or for the cultivation of certain viruses, but almost all diagnostic and research work involving viral cultivation is carried out in cell cultures—usually in monolayers, occasionally as suspension cultures. To produce cell monolayers, tissue is cut into small pieces and placed in a medium containing a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin. After the cells have dispersed into a single-cell suspension, they are washed, counted, and diluted in a growth medium and permitted to settle on the flat surface of a glass or plastic container. Most types of cells adhere quickly and under optimal conditions, they divide about once a day until the surface is covered with a confluent monolayer.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Vitamin D may play an important role in inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D deficiency is related to several lung problems, including respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar inflammation, epithelial damage, and hypoxia. Few studies have evaluated the benefits of vitamin D in preventing inflammation in alveolar cells. MATERIAL/METHODS: We developed a cell inflammation model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The effects of vitamin D on LPS-induced inflammation in A549 cells were examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and the anti-inflammatory mechanism of vitamin D was evaluated using western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our results indicated that vitamin D promoted A549 cell survival following LPS-induced inflammation by downregulating nuclear factor nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-12.

This study hopes to determine whether there is a difference in risk of cases presenting at night, and overall outcome. METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained using local notes archival software to obtain predicted and observed mortality, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade and length of stay of emergency laparotomies conducted between August 2019 and March 2020. Day cases were defined as knife to skin time (KTS) between 08:00 and 19:59, whilst night cases were defined as KTS between 20:00 and 07:59. RESULTS: In all, 81 emergency laparotomies were performed during day-time hours over the 8‑month period; 32 were performed overnight. Median ASA grade was 3 for both. Median length of stay was similar: 11 day, 12 overnight. Median P-POSSUM (Portsmouth Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity) morbidity score of day cases was 52% compared to 53.2% at night. Median mortality score of day cases was 5.6%, whilst at night was 2.7% (p = 0.27). Observed mortality after day cases was 13.5%, and overnight was 9.3%. Observed morbidity was 46.9% after day cases and 50% overnight. CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference between predicted or observed morbidity and mortality between emergency laparotomies conducted during the day and those conducted overnight.","Livingstone, James; Buksh, Md Mahfooz; Kostalas, Marcos; Ratnasingham, Kumaran",Eur Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513547/,124

64407,Identification of a Novel Small Molecule Inhibitor Against SARS Coronavirus Helicase.,2015,"BACKGROUND The burden of cirrhosis hospitalizations is increasing. Admission MELD-lactate was recently demonstrated to be a superior predictor of in-hospital mortality as compared to MELD in limited cohorts. We aimed to identify specific classes of hospitalizations where MELD-lactate may be especially useful, and to evaluate the predictive role of lactate clearance. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 1,036 cirrhosis hospitalizations for gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or other portal hypertension-related indications in the Veterans Health Administration where MELD-lactate was measured upon admission. Performance characteristics for in-hospital mortality were compared between MELD-lactate and MELD/MELD-Na, with stratified analyses of MELD categories (≤15, 15-25, ≥25) and reason for admission. We also incorporated day 3 lactate levels into modeling, and tested for an interaction between day 1 MELD-lactate and day 3 lactate clearance. RESULTS MELD-lactate had superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality as compared to MELD or MELD-Na (area under the curve [AUC] 0.789 vs. 0.776 vs. 0.760, p<0.001), and superior calibration. MELD-lactate had higher discrimination among hospitalizations with MELD ≤15 (AUC 0.763 vs. 0.608 for MELD, global p=0.01) and hospitalizations for infection (AUC 0.791 vs. 0.674 for MELD, global p<0.001). We found a significant interaction between day 1 MELD-lactate and day 3 lactate clearance; heat maps were created as clinical tools to risk stratify patients based on these clinical data. CONCLUSION In comparison to MELD or MELD-Na, MELD-lactate has significantly superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for infection and/or with MELD ≤15. Incorporating day 3 lactate clearance may further improve prognostication.","Mahmud, Nadim; Asrani, Sumeet K; Kaplan, David E; Ogola, Gerald O; Taddei, Tamar H; Kamath, Patrick S; Serper, Marina",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025731/,124

At present, percutaneous ablation is considered first-line therapy for very early and early hepatocellular carcinoma and second-line therapy for colorectal carcinoma liver metastasis. Because thermal ablation is a treatment option for other primary and secondary liver tumors, an understanding of the underlying tumor biology is important when weighing the potential benefits of ablation. This article reviews ablation modalities, indications, patient selection, and imaging surveillance, and emphasizes technique-specific considerations for the performance of percutaneous ablation.","Wells, Shane A; Hinshaw, J Louis; Lubner, Meghan G; Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Brace, Christopher L; Lee, Fred T",Radiologic clinics of North America,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcl.2015.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26321447/,124

76645,Interaction of small G protein signaling modulator 3 with connexin 43 contributes to myocardial infarction in rat hearts.,2017,"BACKGROUND The best evidence-enhanced recovery care pathway is yet to be defined for patients undergoing spinal surgery. Minimally invasive surgery, multimodal analgesia, early mobilization, and early postoperative nutrition have been considered as critical components of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery (ERSS). The objective of this study will be to synthesize the evidence underpinning individual components of a proposed multidisciplinary enhanced recovery pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. METHODS This is the study protocol for a systematic review of complex interventions. Our team identified 22 individual care components of a proposed pathway based on clinical practice guidelines and published reviews. We will include systematic reviews and meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in adults or pediatric patients evaluating any one of the pre-determined care components. Our primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, morbidity outcomes (e.g., pulmonary, cardiac, renal, surgical complications), patient-reported outcomes and experiences (e.g., pain, quality of care experience), and health services outcomes (e.g., length of stay and costs). We will search the following databases (1990 onwards) MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The risk of bias for individual studies will be appraised using appropriate tools. A narrative synthesis will be provided with the information presented in the text and tables to summarize and explain the characteristics and findings of the included studies. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we do not anticipate to conduct meta-analyses. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each component of care will be classified according to the GRADE system. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence underpinning individual components of a pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. The formation of an evidence-based pathway will allow for the standardization of clinical care delivery within the context of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery.

87569,"Development of a rapid, sensitive TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of Rose rosette virus using multiple gene targets.",2016,"BACKGROUND Cognitive-behavioural therapy aims to increase quality of life by changing cognitive and behavioural factors that maintain problematic symptoms. A previous overview of cognitive-behavioural therapy systematic reviews suggested that cognitive-behavioural therapy was effective for many conditions. However, few of the included reviews synthesised randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVES This project was undertaken to map the quality and gaps in the cognitive-behavioural therapy systematic review of randomised controlled trial evidence base. Panoramic meta-analyses were also conducted to identify any across-condition general effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy. DATA SOURCES The overview was designed with cognitive-behavioural therapy patients, clinicians and researchers. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Child Development & Adolescent Studies, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and OpenGrey databases were searched from 1992 to January 2019. REVIEW METHODS Study inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) fulfil the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination criteria; (2) intervention reported as cognitive-behavioural therapy or including one cognitive and one behavioural element; (3) include a synthesis of cognitive-behavioural therapy trials; (4) include either health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety or pain outcome; and (5) available in English. Review quality was assessed with A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)-2. Reviews were quality assessed and data were extracted in duplicate by two independent researchers, and then mapped according to condition, population, context and quality. The effects from high-quality reviews were pooled within condition groups, using a random-effect panoramic meta-analysis. If the across-condition heterogeneity was I 2 < 75%, we pooled across conditions. Subgroup analyses were conducted for age, delivery format, comparator type and length of follow-up, and a sensitivity analysis was performed for quality. RESULTS A total of 494 reviews were mapped, representing 68% (27/40) of the categories of the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision, Mortality and Morbidity Statistics. Most reviews (71%, 351/494) were of lower quality. Research on older adults, using cognitive-behavioural therapy preventatively, ethnic minorities and people living outside Europe, North America or Australasia was limited. Out of 494 reviews, 71 were included in the primary panoramic meta-analyses. A modest effect was found in favour of cognitive-behavioural therapy for health-related quality of life (standardised mean difference 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.41, prediction interval -0.05 to 0.50, I 2 = 32%), anxiety (standardised mean difference 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.43, prediction interval -0.28 to 0.88, I 2 = 62%) and pain (standardised mean difference 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.41, prediction interval -0.28 to 0.74, I 2 = 64%) outcomes. All condition, subgroup and sensitivity effect estimates remained consistent with the general effect. A statistically significant interaction effect was evident between the active and non-active comparator groups for the health-related quality-of-life outcome. A general effect for depression outcomes was not produced as a result of considerable heterogeneity across reviews and conditions. LIMITATIONS Data extraction and analysis were conducted at the review level, rather than returning to the individual trial data. This meant that the risk of bias of the individual trials could not be accounted for, but only the quality of the systematic reviews that synthesised them. CONCLUSION Owing to the consistency and homogeneity of the highest-quality evidence, it is proposed that cognitive-behavioural therapy can produce a modest general, across-condition benefit in health-related quality-of-life, anxiety and pain outcomes. FUTURE WORK Future research should focus on how the modest effect sizes seen with cognitive-behavioural therapy can be increased, for example identifying alternative delivery formats to increase adherence and reduce dropout, and pursuing novel methods to assess intervention fidelity and quality.

94150,A consensus real-time RT-PCR for detection of all genotypic variants of yellow head virus of penaeid shrimp.,2010,"Tensional homeostasis is widely recognized to exist at the length scales of organs and tissues, but the cellular length scale mechanism for tension regulation is not known. In this study, we explored whether tensional homeostasis emerges from the behavior of the individual focal adhesion (FA), which is the subcellular structure that transmits cell stress to the surrounding extracellular matrix. Past studies have suggested that cell contractility builds up until a certain displacement is achieved, and we thus hypothesized that tensional homeostasis may require a threshold level of substrate displacement. Micropattern traction microscopy was used to study a wide range of FA traction forces generated by bovine vascular smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on substrates of stiffness of 3.6, 6.7, 13.6, and 30 kPa. The most striking feature of FA dynamics observed here is that the substrate displacement resulting from FA traction forces is a unifying feature that determines FA tensional stability. Beyond approximately 1 μm of substrate displacement, FAs, regardless of cell type or substrate stiffness, exhibit a precipitous drop in temporal fluctuations of traction forces. These findings lead us to the conclusion that traction force dynamics collectively determine whether cells or cell ensembles develop tensional homeostasis, and this insight is necessary to fully understand how matrix stiffness impacts cellular behavior in healthy conditions and, more important, in pathological conditions such as cancer or vascular aging, where environmental stiffness is altered.","Xu, Han; Donegan, Stephanie; Dreher, Jordan M; Stark, Alicia J; Canović, Elizabeth P; Stamenović, Dimitrije; Smith, Michael L",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.06.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634483/,124

As the COVID19 outbreak unfolds, more and more pregnant women are infected with SARS-CoV-2, concerns have been raised about its clinical manifestations in pregnancy and the potential risk of vertical transmission from mother to fetus in pregnant women. Hence, in this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women with COVID-19, and discuss the clinical manifestations, treatments, maternal and perinatal outcomes, and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of such virus. Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other populations, and that there is no evidence of vertical transmission from mother to child. In the meantime, considering the good prognosis of most of the infected mothers and infants and absence of serious obstetric complications in pregnant women with COVID-19, it is not recommended to give birth as soon as possible, and it is necessary to extend the gestational period reasonably.","Li, Wei; Yu, Nan; Kang, Qingling; Zeng, Wanjiang; Deng, Dongrui; Chen, Suhua; Feng, Ling; Wu, Jianli",American journal of reproductive immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894803/,124

In this analysis, records from the Cattle Tracing System database were used to investigate the frequency and characteristics of replacement breeding cattle trade in Great Britain. During the 2006 calendar year, an estimated 48.7 per cent of beef herds and 47.8 per cent of dairy herds purchased at least one replacement breeding animal. Open beef herds purchased an average of 7.2 replacement animals (median: 4, range: 1-819) from 3.6 source herds (median: 2, range: 1-114), while open dairy herds purchased an average of 13.7 replacement animals (median: 7, range: 1-827) from 5.2 source herds (median: 3, range: 1-146). The most common animal types purchased by beef and dairy herds were open heifers and open lactating cows, respectively. Although the movements of purchased replacement breeding cattle accounted for only 13 per cent of individual movements in the between-herd contact network, they had a disproportionately strong influence on the risk of disease spreading through the industry as evidenced by their high betweenness centrality scores. These results emphasise the importance of ensuring that good biosecurity programmes are in place to prevent disease transmission.","Gates, M C",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.102351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795164/,124

There is limited data on the feasibility and safety of routinely performing a single-step conversion. We assessed the efficacy of this revisional approach in a large cohort of patients operated in a high-volume bariatric institution. METHODS Between October 2004 and December 2015, a total of 885 patients who underwent LAGB removal with RYGB were identified from a prospectively collected database. In all cases, a single-stage conversion procedure was planned. The feasibility of this approach and peri-operative outcomes of these patients were evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS A single-step approach was successfully achieved in 738 (83.4%) of the 885 patients. During the study period, there was a significant increase in performing the conversion from LAGB to RYGB single-staged. No mortality or anastomotic leakage was observed in both groups. Only 45 patients (5.1%) had a 30-d complication: most commonly hemorrhage (N = 20/45), with no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION Converting a LAGB to RYGB can be performed with a very low morbidity and zero-mortality in a high-volume revisional bariatric center. With increasing experience and full standardization of the conversion, the vast majority of operations can be performed as a single-stage procedure. Only a migrated band remains a formal contraindication for a one-step approach.","Debergh, Isabelle; Defoort, Barbara; De Visschere, Marieke; Flahou, Silke; Van Cauwenberge, Sebastiaan; Mulier, Jan P; Dillemans, Bruno",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015458.2016.1255005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903129/,124

Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.","Anestis, Michael D; Bryan, Craig J",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338733/,124

Twelve multiparous and 4 primiparous lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. The diets contained (DM basis) 34.8% corn silage, 15.2% grass-legume silage, 5.9% roasted soybean, 2.4% mineral-vitamin premix, 2.0% alfalfa pellets, and either (1) 36% ground corn, 2.4% soybean meal, and 1.3% urea (UR), (2) 29.7% ground corn, 9.8% soybean meal, 0.13% ruminally protected (RP) Lys, and 0.07% RP-Met (CSBAA), (3) 25% ground field peas, 12.3% ground corn, and 2.4% soybean meal (FP), or (4) FP supplemented with 0.15% RP-Lys and 0.05% RP-Met (FPAA). Our objective was to test the effects of FP versus UR, FPAA versus CSBAA, and FPAA versus FP on milk yield and composition, N utilization, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation profile, and plasma concentration of AA. Milk yield did not differ across diets. Compared with cows fed UR, those fed FP had greater DM intake, concentration and yield of milk true protein, apparent total-tract digestibility of fiber, urinary excretion of purine derivatives, and concentrations of total volatile fatty acids in the rumen and Lys in plasma, and less milk urea N and ruminal NH3-N. The concentration of milk urea N, as well as the concentration and yield of milk fat increased in cows fed FPAA versus CSBAA. Moreover, cows fed FPAA had greater ruminal concentration of total volatile fatty acids, increased proportions of acetate and isobutyrate, and decreased proportions of propionate and valerate than those fed CSBAA. The plasma concentrations of His, Leu, and Phe decreased, whereas plasma Met increased and plasma Lys tended to increase in cows fed FPAA versus CSBAA. Concentration of milk true protein, but not yield, was increased in cows fed FPAA versus FP. However, cows fed FPAA showed decreased concentrations of His and Leu in plasma compared with those fed FP. Overall, compared with the CSBAA diet, feeding FPAA did not negatively affect milk yield and milk protein synthesis. Furthermore, RP-Lys and RP-Met supplementation of the FP diet did not improve milk yield or milk protein synthesis, but decreased urinary urea N excretion.","Pereira, A B D; Whitehouse, N L; Aragona, K M; Schwab, C S; Reis, S F; Brito, A F",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-12140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601445/,124

Although having very low oral potency, maitotoxins (MTXs) are very toxic following intraperitoneal injection and feeding studies have shown they may accumulate in fish muscle. To date, six MTX congeners have been described but two congeners (MTX2 and MTX4) have not yet been structurally elucidated. The aim of the present study was to further characterize MTX4. METHODS Chemical analysis was performed using Liquid Chromatography coupled to a Diode Array Detector (DAD) and positive ionization mode High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC/HRMS) on partially purified extracts of G. excentricus (strain VGO792). HRMS/MS studies were also carried out to tentatively explain the fragmentation pathways of MTX and MTX4. RESULTS The comparison of UV and HRMS (ESI+ ) spectra between MTX and MTX4 led us to propose the elemental formula of MTX4 (C157 H241 NO68 S2 , as unsalted molecule). The comparison of the theoretical and measured m/z values of the doubly charged ions of the isotopic profile in ESI+ were coherent with the proposed elemental formula of MTX4. The study of HRMS/MS spectra on the tri-ammoniated adduct ([M-H+3NH4 ]2+ ) of both molecules gave additional information about structural features. The cleavage observed, probably located at C99 -C100 in both MTX and MTX4, highlighted the same A-side product ion shared by the two molecules.

120886,Targeted Disassembling of SARS-CoV-2 as It Gets Ready for Cell Penetration.,2020-11-12,"Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) has been applied in the last 15 years in an increasing field of applications. Although many contraindications have been put into perspective, some precautions still have to be considered. Known stenosis of the gastrointestinal tract is a clear contraindication for VCE unless surgery is already scheduled or at least has been considered as an optional treatment modality. In patients with a higher incidence of stenosis, as in an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, clinical signs of obstruction, prior radiation or surgical small bowel resection, a preceding test with the self-dissolving patency capsule can override this contraindication. Endoscopic placement of the capsule should be considered in patients with swallowing disorders to avoid aspiration. Esophageal or gastric motility disorders may require endoscopic capsule transport or application of prokinetics if the real-time viewer proofs delayed transit. In pregnant women, VCE should be restricted to urgent cases where diagnosis cannot be postponed after delivery, as data on safety are missing. There is theoretical and clinical evidence that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as a pacemaker, cardioverters or left heart assist devices, can safely undergo VCE in spite of still existing contraindication by manufacturers. Children from the age of 2 years have safely undergone VCE. Although video capsules are not proven safe with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), first single cases of patients incidentally undergoing MRI with an incorporated capsule have been reported, showing susceptibility artifacts but no signs of clinical harm.","Bandorski, Dirk; Kurniawan, Niehls; Baltes, Peter; Hoeltgen, Reinhard; Hecker, Matthias; Stunder, Dominik; Keuchel, Martin",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v22.i45.9898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28018097/,124

DESIGN A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. METHODS The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations. RESULTS Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""' adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.","Dellinger, R Phillip; Levy, Mitchell M; Rhodes, Andrew; Annane, Djillali; Gerlach, Herwig; Opal, Steven M; Sevransky, Jonathan E; Sprung, Charles L; Douglas, Ivor S; Jaeschke, Roman; Osborn, Tiffany M; Nunnally, Mark E; Townsend, Sean R; Reinhart, Konrad; Kleinpell, Ruth M; Angus, Derek C; Deutschman, Clifford S; Machado, Flavia R; Rubenfeld, Gordon D; Webb, Steven A; Beale, Richard J; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Moreno, Rui",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e31827e83af; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23353941/,124

Method: The mental health status of the first-line medical staff was investigated by Self-rating Anxiety Acale (SAS) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Self-rating Scale(PTSD-SS). From February 7 to 14, 2020, 246 medical staff were investigated who participated in the treatment of COVID-19 using cluster sampling , and received 230 responses, with a recovery rate of 93.5%. Results: The incidence of anxiety in medical staff was 23.04% (53/230), and the score of SAS was (42.91 ± 10.89). Among them, the incidence of severe anxiety, moderate anxiety and mild anxiety were 2.17% (5/230), 4.78% (11/230) and 16.09% (37/230), respectively. The incidence of anxiety in female medical staff was higher than that in male [25.67% (48/187) vs 11.63% (5/43), Z=-2.008, P=0.045], the score of SAS in female medical staff was higher than that in male [(43.78±11.12) vs (39.14 ± 9.01), t =-2.548, P=0.012]. The incidence of anxiety in nurses was higher than that in doctors [26.88% (43/160) vs 14.29% (10/70), Z=-2.066, P=0.039], and the score of SAS in nurses was higher than that in doctors [(44.84±10.42) vs (38.50±10.72), t =-4.207, P<0.001]. The incidence of stress disorder in medical staff was 27.39% (63/230), and the score of PTSD-SS was (42.92 ± 17.88). The score of PTSD-SS in female medical staff was higher than that of male [(44.30±18.42) vs(36.91 ± 13.95), t=-2.472, P=0.014]. Conclusions: In COVID-19 epidemic, the incidence of anxiety and stress disorder is high among medical staff. Medical institutions should strengthen the training of psychological skills of medical staff. Special attention should be paid to the mental health of female nurses.","Huang, J Z; Han, M F; Luo, T D; Ren, A K; Zhou, X P",Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200219-00063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131151/,124

It also has the potential to kill very large numbers of people as occurred in the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918. Options for antiviral therapy are limited because of the paucity of available drugs and the rapid mutation rate of the virus leading to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.

126333,Application of real time RT-PCR for the genetic homogeneity and stability tests of the seed candidates for live attenuated influenza vaccine production.,2014,"Live attenuated cold-adapted (ca) H5N1, H7N3, H6N1, and H9N2 influenza vaccine viruses replicated in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets, and 2 doses of vaccines were immunogenic and protected these animals from challenge infection with homologous and heterologous wild-type (wt) viruses of the corresponding subtypes. However, when these vaccine candidates were evaluated in phase I clinical trials, there were inconsistencies between the observations in animal models and in humans. The vaccine viruses did not replicate well and immune responses were variable in humans, even though the study subjects were seronegative with respect to the vaccine viruses before vaccination. Therefore, we sought a model that would better reflect the findings in humans and evaluated African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate model. The distribution of sialic acid (SA) receptors in the respiratory tract of AGMs was similar to that in humans. We evaluated the replication of wt and ca viruses of avian influenza (AI) virus subtypes H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 in the respiratory tract of AGMs. All of the wt viruses replicated efficiently, while replication of the ca vaccine viruses was restricted to the upper respiratory tract. Interestingly, the patterns and sites of virus replication differed among the different subtypes. We also evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 ca vaccines. Protection from wt virus challenge correlated well with the level of serum neutralizing antibodies. Immune responses were slightly better when vaccine was delivered by both intranasal and intratracheal delivery than when it was delivered intranasally by sprayer. We conclude that live attenuated pandemic influenza virus vaccines replicate similarly in AGMs and human subjects and that AGMs may be a useful model to evaluate the replication of ca vaccine candidates. Importance: Ferrets and mice are commonly used for preclinical evaluation of influenza vaccines. However, we observed significant inconsistencies between observations in humans and in these animal models. We used African green monkeys (AGMs) as a nonhuman primate (NHP) model for a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of pairs of wild-type and pandemic live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (pLAIV) representing four subtypes of avian influenza viruses and found that pLAIVs replicate similarly in AGMs and humans and that AGMs can be useful for evaluation of the protective efficacy of pLAIV.","Matsuoka, Yumiko; Suguitan, Amorsolo; Orandle, Marlene; Paskel, Myeisha; Boonnak, Kobporn; Gardner, Donald J; Feldmann, Friederike; Feldmann, Heinz; Marino, Michael; Jin, Hong; Kemble, George; Subbarao, Kanta",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00425-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807726/,124

In addition to the defining motor symptoms of PD, multiple non-motor symptoms occur; among them, cognitive impairment is common and can potentially occur at any disease stage. Cognitive decline is usually slow and insidious, but rapid in some cases. Recently, the focus has been on the early cognitive changes, where executive and visuospatial impairments are typical and can be accompanied by memory impairment, increasing the risk for early progression to dementia. Other risk factors for early progression to dementia include visual hallucinations, older age and biomarker changes such as cortical atrophy, as well as Alzheimer-type changes on functional imaging and in cerebrospinal fluid, and slowing and frequency variation on EEG. However, the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in PD remain largely unclear. Cortical involvement of Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies are key features, but multiple mechanisms are likely involved. Cholinesterase inhibition is the only high-level evidence-based treatment available, but other pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are being tested. Challenges include the identification of disease-modifying therapies as well as finding biomarkers to better predict cognitive decline and identify patients at high risk for early and rapid cognitive impairment.","Aarsland, Dag; Batzu, Lucia; Halliday, Glenda M; Geurtsen, Gert J; Ballard, Clive; Ray Chaudhuri, K; Weintraub, Daniel",Nature reviews.

Because of differences in bioreactor expansion efficiency between mouse (m) and human (h) PSCs, we investigated if conversion of hPSCs, from the conventional ""primed"" pluripotent state towards the ""naïve"" state prevalent in mPSCs, could be used to enhance hPSC production. Through transcriptomic enrichment of mechano-sensing signaling, the expression of epigenetic regulators, metabolomics, and cell-surface protein marker analyses, we show that the stirred suspension bioreactor environment helps maintain a naïve-like pluripotent state. Our research corroborates that converting hPSCs towards a naïve state enhances hPSC manufacturing and indicates a potentially important role for the stirred suspension bioreactor's mechanical environment in maintaining naïve-like pluripotency.","Rohani, Leili; Borys, Breanna S; Razian, Golsa; Naghsh, Pooyan; Liu, Shiying; Johnson, Adiv A; Machiraju, Pranav; Holland, Heidrun; Lewis, Ian A; Groves, Ryan A; Toms, Derek; Gordon, Paul M K; Li, Joyce W; So, Tania; Dang, Tiffany; Kallos, Michael S; Rancourt, Derrick E",Communications biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01218-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895477/,124

In this paper, we investigated an anti-NF155 CIDP patient via clinical, electrophysiological, and neuropathological tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patient was a 15-year-old Chinese boy affected by distal limb weakness and tremor for a 6-month period. The patient was positive for serum anti-NF155 antibodies, high cerebrospinal fluid protein levels and symmetric hypertrophy of lumbosacral roots in MRI. Elongation of distal and F-wave latencies and decrease of compound muscle action potentials in motor nerves were recorded. Sensory nerve action potentials were absent. He accepted sural nerve biopsy. RESULTS Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated the typical pathological change of loss of transverse bands with mild detachment of terminal myelin loop from axon at the paranode. Some thin myelinated fibers and axonal degeneration were recorded. Besides, we found some myelin balloon formations with compressed axons.

METHODS Patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and initially had more than 2 FI episodes per week, were offered SNS therapy. Patients with 50% or higher reduction in FI during a 2-week test period were implanted with a neurostimulator (InterStim; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). Assessments were completed by patients at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after implant, and annually thereafter. The present report includes data from the 4-year postimplant follow-up. RESULTS A total of 133 patients underwent test stimulation with a 90% success rate, and as a result, 120 (110 females) with a mean age of 60.5 years and a mean duration of FI of 6.8 years received long-term implantation. Of them, 78 patients completed all or part of the 4-year follow-up assessment. Fecal incontinence episodes decreased from a mean of 9.4 per week at baseline to 1.9 per week at 48 months (P < 0.001). The 4-year analyses showed that SNS had a positive and sustained impact on all 4 scales of the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (P < 0.001), Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores improved from a mean of 39.9 to 28 (P < 0.001), and self-rated bowel health scores improved from a mean of 3.5 to 6.9 (P < 0.001).

However, stabilization and optimal shaping of microcatheters are sometimes difficult. Our aim was to introduce ""tailor-made"" microcatheter shapes for coil embolization using three-dimensional (3D) printed vessel models. METHOD Since August 2014, we have been investigating the use of 3D printed models of intracranial arterial aneurysms to produce optimally shaped microcatheters for endovascular coil embolization. Using Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine data obtained from preoperative cerebral angiography, a vessel model was produced with a 3D printer using acrylic resin. Preoperative planning of microcatheter navigation and shaping were performed using the 3D vessel models. Before the procedure, microcatheter mandrels were bent manually to the intended angle, referring to the vessel model, and then sterilized. The 3D vessel models were also sterilized with plasma and used during the procedure. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (27 aneurysms) were treated using a total of 48 microcatheters shaped while referring to the 3D printed vessel model. Of the 48 catheters, only 9 (19%) required modification of the initial shape due to inappropriate positioning of the catheter. Only 29% of the catheter placements required repositioning due to catheter kick back. There were no procedure-related complications, including aneurysm rupture. The responses from assistants to a questionnaire administered after the embolizations on the usefulness of the technique were favorable. CONCLUSIONS Tailor-made shaping of microcatheters may facilitate easier and safer procedures in coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm.","Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Takao, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Takashi; Yuki, Ichiro; Kaku, Shogo; Kan, Issei; Nishimura, Kengo; Suzuki, Tomoaki; Watanabe, Mitsuyosi; Karagiozov, Kostadin; Murayama, Yuichi",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521515/,124

Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using machine learning, video titles/descriptions about home exercise ordered by relevance populated on YouTube between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 were examined. RESULTS Using the search terms, ""home exercise,"" ""home-based exercise,"" ""exercise no equipment,"" ""workout no equipment,"" ""exercise at home,"" or ""at-home exercise,"" 700 videos ordered by relevance included 28 (4%) that were inclusive of participants with disabilities. Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD. The global pause the pandemic has induced may be the right moment to construct a comprehensive, indexed digital library of home-based fitness video content for the disabled. There is a further need for more nuanced understandings of accessibility as technological advancements continue. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is incredibly important to the quality of life and health of all people. Physical activity levels, however, remain lower among persons with disabilities. Access to disability-friendly resources remains a challenge and worsened by the circumstances of COVID-19 due to an apparent lack of digital fitness resources for persons with disabilities.

Recent genome-wide approaches, such as those employing small interfering RNA (siRNA) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) or those using small molecule chemical inhibitors targeting the cellular ""kinome,"" have been used successfully to identify cellular factors that can support virus replication. Since some of these cellular factors are critical for virus replication, but are dispensable for the host, they can serve as novel targets for antiviral drug development. In addition, potentiation of immune responses, regulation of cytokine storms, and modulation of epigenetic changes upon virus infections are also feasible approaches to control infections. Because it is less likely that viruses will mutate to replace missing cellular functions, the chance of generating drug-resistant mutants with host-targeted inhibitor approaches is minimized. However, drug resistance against some host-directed agents can, in fact, occur under certain circumstances, such as long-term selection pressure of a host-directed antiviral agent that can allow the virus the opportunity to adapt to use an alternate host factor or to alter its affinity toward the target that confers resistance. This review describes novel approaches for antiviral drug development with a focus on host-directed therapies and the potential mechanisms that may account for the acquisition of antiviral drug resistance against host-directed agents.","Kumar, Naveen; Sharma, Shalini; Kumar, Ram; Tripathi, Bhupendra N; Barua, Sanjay; Ly, Hinh; Rouse, Barry T",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00168-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404434/,124

Its hyphenation with mass spectrometry, however, has some drawbacks such as ion-suppression in electrospray ionization. To overcome this problem, we present in this work a multiple heart-cutting (MHC) two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) method with ultra-violet (UV) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) detection. A reversed-phase/weak anion-exchange (RP/WAX) stationary phase in the first dimension (1D) provides the selectivity for separation of structurally closely related oligonucleotide sequences and deletions (shortmers), respectively, using a mixed pH/triethylammonium phosphate buffer gradient at constant organic modifier content. Heart cuts of the oligonucleotide peaks are transferred to the second dimension (2D) via a multiple heart-cutting valve which is equipped with two loop decks. The 2D RP column is used for desalting via a diverter valve. Active solvent modulation enables to refocus the oligonucleotide peak into a sharp zone by 2D RP entirely free of non-volatile buffer components and ion-pair agents. Oligonucleotides can thus be sensitively detected by ESI-QTOF-MS under MS-compatible conditions.","Li, Feiyang; Su, Xiaoli; Bäurer, Stefanie; Lämmerhofer, Michael",Journal of chromatography.

RECENT FINDINGS MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome that occurs approximately 4-5 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. It is associated with symptoms such as fever, shock, abdominal pain, rash, and conjunctivitis along with laboratory abnormalities such as elevated inflammatory markers, coagulation factors, and cytokines. Patients fall into the following three subcategories: first, classic or incomplete Kawasaki; second, cardiogenic or distributive shock; or third, an inflammatory response that does not initially meet criteria of the other subcategories. Immediate treatment largely focuses on supportive care through fluid resuscitation and pressor support; however, inpatient management may also include intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, anticoagulation and at times anti-inflammatory biologics. SUMMARY Overall fatality rate remains low and short-term research has demonstrated self-limited sequelae. Pediatricians should focus on the timely diagnosis and identification of this inflammatory disease via clinical findings and laboratory evidence to best treat these patients.","Patel, Roshni; Patel, Katie J; Rocker, Joshua",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000001020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928912/,124

METHODS The authors developed consensus statements in 2 sections. The first was ""How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?"" The second was ""What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis? Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating. Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised. RESULTS After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above. The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication. We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with epilepsy and health providers. CONCLUSION These recommendation may help healthcare professionals provide optimal care to people with epilepsy during the coronavirus pandemic.","French, Jacqueline A; Brodie, Martin J; Caraballo, Roberto; Devinsky, Orrin; Ding, Ding; Jehi, Lara; Jette, Nathalie; Kanner, Andres; Modi, Avani C; Newton, Charles R; Patel, Archana A; Pennell, Page B; Perucca, Emilio; Sander, Josemir W; Scheffer, Ingrid E; Singh, Gagandeep; Williams, Emma; Wilmshurst, Jo; Cross, J Helen",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327490/,124

Most of the startups have experienced a downturn in demand and supply due to COVID-19 led disturbances in sourcing networks. This paper aims to identify, analyze and categorize the significant risks influencing sourcing operations in startups during the COVID-19 era in India, using the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) approach. Design/methodology/approach: Eight enablers were identified through literature review and expert opinions from various startups in India. This study adopted the TISM approach to analyze the inter-relationships between the enablers. Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to rank the sourcing risk enablers and classify them as autonomous, independent, linkage and dependent enablers. Findings: The results indicate “insufficient fund” as the most critical enabler. Network issues and employee flexibility risk were among the other critical enablers that have a high driving power. Supplier risk, quality risk and demand risk were found to have highly dependent on other enablers for implementation. Research limitations/implications: This study mainly focuses on the sourcing risks in startup operations in India. This study can be extended to many other countries. Practical implications: This study will help startup industry managers and practitioners understand the interactions of enablers and identify critical enablers to mitigate risks in startup sourcing operations in the COVID-19 era. Originality/value: The present study identifies the sourcing risk enablers in the COVID-19 era. It is the first attempt to analyze the interrelationship among sourcing risks in startups using the TISM approach. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Sreenivasan, A.; Suresh, M.",Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,https://doi.org/10.1108/jgoss-12-2020-0070,124
165472,Double-Coffee Ring Nanoplasmonic Effects with Convolutional Neural Learning for Sars-Cov-2 Detection,2021,"The crisis ignited by COVID-19 has transformed the volume and composition of waste generation and requires a dynamic response from policy makers. This study selected Bangkok as a case study to semi-quantitatively examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on consumer-generated food and plastic waste by examining changes in lifestyles and consumption behaviour through a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Travel bans and diminished economic activity due to COVID-19 have led to a dramatic reduction in waste from the business sector and in the total amount of municipal waste generated. However, the results of the survey showed that both food and plastic waste generated by households in Bangkok increased during COVID-19. The shift from eating out to online food delivery services led to an increase in plastic bags, hot-and-cold food bags, plastic food containers, and food waste. Reasons for the increase in household food waste during COVID-19 varied, with respondents citing excessive amounts of food and unappetising taste, followed by exceeding the expiration date and rotting/foul odours. These reasons may be the result of the inability to predict quantity and quality when ordering online, and inadequate food planning and management by consumers. To achieve more effective food and plastic waste management, home delivery services, consumer food planning and management, and the formation of a circular economy based on localised supply chains may be considered as important intervention points.","Liu, Chen Bunditsakulchai Pongsun Zhuo Qiannan",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168988,124

There is a need for research in automated diagnosis for speeding up the process while maintaining accuracy and reducing computational requirements. In this work, an IoT and edge computing based framework is proposed to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from CT scans of the patients using Deep Learning techniques. The proposed method requires less computational power and uses ensemble learning to increase the models' overall predictive performance. In the simulation, it was found that each model performs better in some areas than the other. The proposed scheme uses ensemble learning to take advantage of such an occurrence and achieved an accuracy of 86.2% and an AUC score of 89.8% on the COVIDCT-Dataset. This accuracy is achieved keeping the hardware accessibility in mind by training the models using a labeled dataset of CT-scans of the patients. Unlike other works, we were able to train models on a single enterprise-level GPU. It can easily be provided on the edge of the network, which reduces communication overhead and latency.

Compared to transductive models, FANG is scalable in training as it does not have to maintain all nodes, and it is efficient at inference time, without the need to re-process the entire graph. Our experimental results show that FANG is better at capturing the social context into a high fidelity representation, compared to recent graphical and non-graphical models. In particular, FANG yields significant improvements for the task of fake news detection, and it is robust in the case of limited training data. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by FANG generalize to related tasks, such as predicting the factuality of reporting of a news medium.","Nguyen, Van-Hoang; Sugiyama, Kazunari; Nakov, Preslav; Kan, Min-Yen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07939v1.pdf,124

The perspectives of the sending countries are not analysed frequently enough, and thus the second part of the paper focuses on this issue in the case of Hungary, by asking to what extent the serious labour shortages, ensuing from the outflow of Hungarians, could be compensated by the recent increase of immigration of third country nationals. Using OECD data, the paper quantifies the balance of labour gains and losses for Hungary and compares this with Czechia, Poland, and Slovakia. The analysis concludes that despite the substantial recent inflow of third country nationals into Hungary, it remains to be seen whether this has a real substitution effect for the lost domestic labour force.","Fóti, Klára Takács Tibor",Society and Economy,https://doi.org/10.1556/204.2020.00012,124

Drawing on the self-determination theory and the theory of situation interaction, this study proposes hedonic and eudaimonic well-being as dual mediators, to explain the positive effect of job characteristics on millennial employees’ creative performance. Further, the study proposes that inclusive leadership and achieving styles could separately moderate these two mediation paths.Design/methodology/approachThe data comprises information on 288 millennial employees in China.FindingsThe results show that both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being mediate the positive effect of job characteristics on millennial employees’ creative performance. The positive effect of job characteristics on millennial employees’ hedonic well-being is stronger when inclusive leadership is stronger;and the positive effect of millennial employees’ hedonic well-being on creative performance is stronger when direct achieving style and instrumental achieving style are stronger. There was no significant moderating effect of inclusive leadership on the relationship between job characteristics and millennial employees’ eudaimonic well-being, and no significant moderating effect of achieving style on the relationship between millennial employees’ eudaimonic well-being and creative performance. Job characteristics exerted a positive indirect effect on employees’ creative performance through employees’ hedonic well-being and that this cascading effect was moderated by inclusive leadership, direct achieving style and instrumental achieving style.Practical implicationsThe findings have important implications for both job design practices and employee performance research. Organizations should pay more attention to improving the creative performance of millennials employees through innovative job design or other organizational level motivational drivers. At the same time, the findings in this study align with the findings in Sheldon et al. (2018) study where extrinsic values rather than toward intrinsic values will bring improved hedonic well-being to the individual in the short term. One further practical implication is that if organizations need a short-term boost of creative performance from their millennial employees, organizations can provide more extrinsic motivators. When organizations want to see more long-term creative performance results, intrinsic motivators should be established.Originality/valueAs part of a series of research on Chinese millennial employee management, this paper extends existing research results. First, the authors verify the main effect relationship between job characteristics and employee creative performance. Second, based on the self-determination theory, this study constructs a dual mediation model and tests the mediating effect of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being between job characteristics and employee creative performance. Third, considering the situational characteristics of the study, the authors propose the boundary conditions of the relationship between job characteristics and creative performance from two levels of individual characteristics and leadership types, namely, inclusive leadership and achieving style.","Zhang, Min Zhao Yixuan",Chinese Management Studies,https://doi.org/10.1108/cms-07-2020-0317,124

During early embryonic cell divisions, cell size changes rapidly in C. elegans and zebrafish embryos. Notably, mitotic centrosome area scales closely with changing cell size compared to changes in spindle length for both organisms. One interesting difference between the two is that mitotic centrosomes are asymmetric in size across embryonic zebrafish spindles, with the larger mitotic centrosome being 2.14±0.13-fold larger in size than the smaller.

The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a “down” (closed) to an “up” (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states. In contrast, we observed that the up conformation is favored without glycans. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state. We also identify roles for glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path. We find that the epitope of the BD-368-2 antibody remains exposed irrespective of the S-protein conformation, explaining the high efficacy of this antibody.

To provide mechanistic insight into these clinical outcomes, we sought to determine if acute sleep deprivation blunts skeletal muscle protein synthesis and promotes a catabolic environment. Healthy young adults (N=13; 7 male, 6 female) were subjected to one night of total sleep deprivation (DEP) and normal sleep (CON) in a randomized cross-over design. Anabolic and catabolic hormonal profiles, skeletal muscle fractional synthesis rate and markers of muscle protein degradation were assessed across the following day. Acute sleep deprivation reduced muscle protein synthesis by 18% (CON: 0.072 ± 0.015 vs. DEP: 0.059 ± 0.014 %•h-1, p=0.040). In addition, it increased plasma cortisol by 21% (p=0.030) and decreased plasma testosterone, but not IGF-1, by 22% (p=0.029). A single night of total sleep deprivation is sufficient to induce anabolic resistance and a pro-catabolic environment. These acute changes may represent mechanistic precursors driving the metabolic dysfunction and body composition changes associated with chronic sleep deprivation.","Lamon, Séverine; Morabito, Aimee; Arentson-Lantz, Emily; Knowles, Olivia; Vincent, Grace Elizabeth; Condo, Dominique; Alexander, Sarah; Garnham, Andrew; Paddon-Jones, Douglas; Aisbett, Brad",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.984666,124

Since face-to-face classes are still prohibited with no end in sight, it is important to assess the experience of teachers handling distance learning education in terms of the support they have received, and the challenges encountered. This study examines the support provided by the schools, the challenges encountered by the teachers, and the support they need to thrive in distance learning education. By applying a quantitative approach through an online survey, 151 teachers - including 108 women, 41 men, and 2 respondents who did not mention their gender - served as the respondents of this study. The study derived promising results in that the majority of the respondents received adequate support from their respective schools in terms of capacity building, technical and data privacy matters, systems of information dissemination, and online learning management. Financial and emotional support mechanisms are two areas for improvement. The common problems encountered include motivating the students, using ICT, managing the time allotted for online sessions, and evaluating the learners' knowledge. The teachers were also looking for more free resources and tools, webinars to share ideas and challenges, and professional development. Overall, the respondents were confident handling remote classes during the pandemic. The Department of Education (DepEd) and the schools may devise targeted programs, training, and support mechanisms to ensure that no one in the education sector is left behind. © 2021 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

Herein we report trends and demographic disparities in utilization of telehealth and secure messaging (SM;i.e., email via portal/app), before and during the pandemic, at a large integrated healthcare system. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study examines utilization of various patient-provider visit types (office, video, telephone) and SM from 1/1/2019- 9/30/2020 at 22 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Hematology and Oncology practices. We explored changes associated with the pandemic (i.e., since 03/2020, when stay home orders were introduced) as well as demographic differences, using Chi-square for categorical and the Mann-Whitney U Test for nonparametric comparisons. Results: During the study period, there were 334,666 visits and 1,161,239 SM sent between patients and providers. Since the pandemic, total monthly average of visits declined only slightly by 4.1%, but monthly average office visits decreased by 80% from 11,001 to 2,170, monthly average video visits increased from 40 to 4,666, and monthly average telephone visits increased by 69% from 5,114 to 8,663. The monthly average SM increased by 26% from 50,788 to 64,315. The trend of increasing telehealth utilization was sustained and stabilized between 07-09/2020. New consultations initially decreased from a mean of 1,995 per month (12.4% of all visits) in 2019, to a minimum of 1,179 (8.6%) by 05/2020, returning to 1,619 (11.7%) by 09/2020. Pandemic era video visits were a significantly higher fraction of all visits (p &lt; 0.01) in: (1) younger patients (Gen Z 48%, Gen Y/Millennials 46%;Gen X 40%;Baby Boomers 34.4%;Pre-Boomers 24.5%);(2) patients with commercial insurance (39%) compared to those with Medicaid (32.7%) or Medicare (28.1%);(3) Primary English speakers (33.7%) compared to those who require an interpreter (24.5%);(4) Asians (35%) and non-Hispanic Whites (33.7%) compared to Blacks (30.1%) and Hispanic Whites (27.5%);(5) married/ domestic partner patients (35%) compared to single/divorced/widowed patients (29.9%);(6) patients with a Charlson comorbidity index ≤3 (36.2%) compared to &gt; 3 (31.3%);and (7) males (34.6%) compared to females (32.3%). Similar statistically significant SM utilization patterns were also seen. Conclusions: In the pandemic era, utilization of telehealth and SM rapidly increased in all demographic categories, shifting the landscape and resource allocation of hematology/oncology practices in a manner that is feasible and sustained. New consultations decreased early in pandemic with return to pre-pandemic levels by 09/2020. Utilization of video visits and SM significantly differ between various demographic populations with disparities seen by age, insurance plan, English proficiency, race/ethnicity, marital status, comorbidities, and gender.","Neeman, E.; Lyon, L.; Sun, H.; Conell, C.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of 16 types of single-stranded DNA-fluorophore-quencher (ssDNA-FQ) reporters for use with CRISPR/Cas12a based visual colorimetric assays. Among them, 9 ssDNA-FQ reporters were found to be suitable for direct visual colorimetric detection, with especially very strong performance using ROX-labeled reporters. We optimized the reaction concentrations of these ssDNA-FQ reporters for naked-eye read-out of assay results (no transducing component required for visualization). Subsequently, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm standardize and to automate the analytical colorimetric assessment of images and integrated this into the MagicEye mobile phone software. A field-deployable assay platform named RApid VIsual CRISPR (RAVI-CRISPR) based on a ROX-labeled reporter with isothermal amplification and CRISPR/Cas12a targeting was established. We deployed RAVI-CRISPR in a single tube towards an instrument-less colorimetric POCT format that requires only a portable rechargeable hand warmer for incubation. The RAVI-CRISPR was successfully used for the single-copy detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and African swine fever virus (ASFV).

Methods: We used multivariate matching to pair schools in the intervention district in Oakland, CA with schools in West Contra Costa County, CA, a comparison district. We estimated difference-in-differences (DIDs) in caregiver-reported influenza vaccination coverage and laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization incidence. Results: Differences in influenza vaccination coverage in the intervention vs. comparison site were larger among White and Latino students than Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Black, and multiracial students. Concerns about vaccine effectiveness or safety were more common among Black and multiracial caregivers; logistical barriers to vaccination were more common among White, API, and Latinos. In both sites, hospitalization in 2017-18 was higher in Blacks vs. other races/ethnicities. All-age influenza hospitalization incidence was lower in the intervention site vs. comparison site among White/API individuals in 2016-17 and 2017-18 and Black older adults in 2017-18, but not in other groups. Conclusions: SLIV was associated with higher vaccination coverage and lower influenza hospitalization, but associations varied by race/ethnicity.

The properties of different lightweight materials are jointly utilised to achieve the product performance. In this study, dissimilar materials such as complex phase steel and aluminium alloy are joined using a high power fiber coupled diode laser. Laser processing parameters (laser power and scanning speed) are optimized such that the thickness of the intermetallics is minimum, so as to obtain maximum mechanical strength. The intermetallics formed at the weld interface are mostly aluminium rich, which are brittle in nature and deteriorate the strength of the joint. The microstructural characterization results showed that the depth of penetration of the weld increased with increase in laser power or decrease in scanning speed. The maximum depth achieved was 1200 µm at a laser condition of power 3 kW and 8 mm/s scanning speed. However, due to increased depth of penetration the intermetallic thickness also increased to 17 µm. Maximum mechanical resistance of 254 N/mm was achieved at a laser power of 4 kW and scanning speed of 12 mm/s, when the intermetallics thickness was in the range of 11 µm.","R, Indhu; Tak, Manish; L, Vijayaraghavan; S, Soundarapandian",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314980; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314980,124

When the secretion phenotype of the corresponding proteins was analysed, all surface proteins with rearranged preS domains were found to be at least partially retained. This held true, in particular, for two variant proteins lacking preS1 amino acids 1 to 19 (ayw), the preS1 myristylated N terminus and a putative retention domain, and for another variant lacking the entire preS1 domain plus the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1 to 12) of the preS2 domain. All the retained variants underwent intracellular dimerization/oligomerization via disulphide bonds to a degree comparable to that observed in well exported natural proteins. Our results show that retention can take place in the absence of L N-terminal sequences and does not imply inhibition of covalent oligomerization.","Gallina, A; De Koning, A; Rossi, F; Milanesi, G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8113770/,124

The PCR products were cloned and sequenced and their nucleic acid structure and similarity to the published sequences of IBV were analyzed. Gene 5 containing two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 5a and 5b, was localized between M and N genes of TCV. The overall nucleotide sequences of the amplified regions from TCV isolates shared 88.4% to 91.8% similarity to the corresponding region of IBV strains. The consensus transcription-associated sequence of IBV, CTTAACAA, was highly conserved in the TCV genome with regard to nucleotide sequence and location in terms of the initiation codons of the genes 5 and N. The similarities between the predicted amino acid sequences of ORFs 5a and 5b of TCV isolates and the homologous genes of IBV strains were 85.4% to 94.0%.

It is unlikely that all these groups of skin lesions are distinctive of an infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Adolescence is a time when individuals observe physical changes in their bodies, experience new interests and desires, and find themselves with greater freedom, independence and responsibility; although variably defined, adolescence is generally believed to begin with the onset of puberty and end with assuming social roles as adults (Dahl 2004, Spear 2000). Among the changes that the adolescent has to face are: accepting one's body, acquiring a social role, female or male, establishing new relationships with peers of both sexes, achieving emotional independence from parents and other adults, acquiring social behavior responsible, learn a system of values and an ethical conscience as a guide to one's behavior, develop intellectual skills and prepare for a profession, achieve independence (Juli 2020). All this is not always easy and, many times young people find themselves facing a tortuous path that can give rise to the onset of some mental pathologies; if we then take into account the pandemic period we are experiencing, all this can get complicated.

METHOD A retrospective, descriptive study of prospectively collected data in the Midland Trauma Registry in New Zealand. RESULTS Overall there was a reduction of 43% in all injury-related admissions with significant reductions seen in major injury (50% reduction), males (50% reduction) and children aged 0-14 years (48% reduction). Results for ethnicity and persons aged over 14 years were within 3% deviation of this overall 43% reduction. Injuries at home, particularly falls, predominate. CONCLUSION Despite the significant reduction in admissions during level 4 lockdown, hospitals should continue to provide full services until resource limitations are unavoidable. Immediate messaging is recommended to reduce rates of injury on the farm and at home, specifically falls prevention. Ongoing attention of road users to road safety is essential to reduce the incidence of preventable major injury.

193020,Investigating the human protein-host protein interactome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine.,2020,"Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy is an autoimmune peripheral-nerve and/or nerve-root disorder known to usually respond to intravenous immunoglobulin-G treatment. Benefit can involve any combination of motor-nerve fibers and large and small sensory-nerve fibers responsible for a progressively crippling, unbalancing, discomforting or painful disorder. ""Diabetic neuropathy"" is commonly considered untreatable. However, 81% of my 48 recently-summarized type-2 diabetes patients with polyneuropathy, adequately-treated with intravenous immunoglobulin-G, off-label, were relieved, sometimes completely, of various motor and sensory symptoms, including pain, thereby resembling Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy. Spinal fluid protein in them is often elevated, higher values seeming to auger a better intravenous immunoglobulin-G response. Continuing the improvement requires continuing the intravenous immunoglobulin-G treatment, indicating both intravenous immunoglobulin-G responsiveness and dependency. The intravenous immunoglobulin-G responsive type-2 diabetes polyneuropathy usually is dysschwannian, sometimes mainly dysneuronal intravenous immunoglobulin-G, the most beneficial and safest treatment, is costly, but if intravenous immunoglobulin-G-treatability of a dysimmune component of type-2 diabetes neuropathy is overlooked, dismissed or rejected, as commonly happens, other costs are high regarding the patient's worsening morbidity and disability, and resultant need for increased medical care. A novel intravenous immunoglobulin-G regimen effective for fragile patients is Two Non-Consecutive-Days Every Week, using 0.4 gm/kg body wt/day. Possible molecular mechanisms of intravenous immunoglobulin-G benefit are discussed. I propose that a) there is a higher incidence of Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy-like neuropathy in type-2 diabetes patients and in patients with a strong family history of type-2 diabetes, and b) the intravenous immunoglobulin-G-treatable neuropathy in type-2 diabetes can be brought on by the genetico-diabetoid-2 state. The genetic-metabolic milieu (but not necessarily glucose dysmetabolism per se.) of type-2 diabetes putatively predisposes to the presumably-dysimmune intravenous immunoglobulin-G-responsive polyneuropathy. In some of our patients, especially ones having a strong type-2 diabetes genetic background, the intravenous immunoglobulin-G-responsive neuropathy preceded the diagnosis of type-2 diabetes by 5-10 years. Accordingly, Chronic Immune Dysschwannian/Dysneuronal Polyneuropathy patients having a strong type-2 diabetes genetic background are designated ""genetico-diabetoid-2 neuropathy"" prior to their manifesting type-2 diabetes. Intravenous immunoglobulin-G is herein suggested as a treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a recent, and feared-repetitive, pandemic with many fatalities caused by a highly-contagious mutant coronavirus, for which there is no definitive treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin-G might: a) combat a dysimmune component of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, including the reactive cytokine-chemokine storm against respiratory tissues; b) contain some antibodies effective against the coronavirus non-specific components of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; c) block host-cell receptors for the virus; and d) counteract secondary infections.","Engel, W K",Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15088499/,124

194823,"Development, characterization, and diagnostic applications of monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus.",2000,"Dear Editor, The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (Çakıroğlu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004; Dinan et al., 2004; Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a 'Scientific Committee'' and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas; and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working. Only two patients reported consulting emergency services for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the patients did not report consulting a healthcare facility for suspecting Covid-19 symptoms or Table 1. Data on the demographic, clinical and social features of the schizophrenia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic n=76 Mean SD Gender (F/M) 27 (35.5%) / 49 (64.5%) Age 44.54 12.21 Disease duration 16.62 9.96 Patients living /with Alone 3 (3.9%) Parent(s) 43 (56.6%) Spouse/children 25 (32.9%) Sibling (s) 1 (1.3%) Relative(s) 2 (2.6%) Friend(s) 2 (2.6%) Yes No Need to see a psychiatrist 23 (30.3%) 53 (69.7%) Subjective psychiatric complaints 32 (42.1%) 44 (57.9%) Consultation with an emergency service 2 (2.6%) 74 (97.4%) Planning to go to the hospital in the post-quarantine period 58 (76.3%) 18 (23.7%) Wearing a mask in community 67 (88.2%) 4 (5.3%) Keeping social distancing 68 (89.5%) 3 (3.9%) Expressed feeling Loneliness 26 (34.2%) 49 (64.5%) Depressed 31 (40.8%) 44 (57.9%) Despaired 22 (28.9%) 52 (68.4%) Anxious 25 (32.9%) 49 (64.5%) Difficulty of going to the hospital in the quarantine period 53 (69.7%) 23 (30.3%) hospital admission for Covid-19 infection or psychotic attack or incidences of Covid-19 related hallucination or delusions. During this 2-month period, 4 patients had experienced fatigue, 2 had episodes of dry cough and 7 had experienced shortness of breath, which can be associated with the nature of schizophrenia, the sedentary life style.and cigarette smoking. Medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist for 10 patients and by a family doctor for 16 patients or supplied directly by pharmacies for 45 patients on the basis of prescriptions with 1-year validity issued by the hospital* (Table 1). Much as it had been aimed to contact all patients with cancelled appointments, this objective was not attainable The patients who were not reached are likely to include those with low awareness and difficulty of adapting to infection prevention strategies. On the other hand, regardless of the level of awareness of the pandemic and compliance with the rules, phone use by these patients might have been limited by economic and environmental reasons, as well as the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. In conclusion, it is possible to say that most of the patients with schizophrenia were aware of the risk of COVID-19 infection, and understood and mostly obeyed the general health rules and advices of healthcare professionals even if they had difficulty in doing so. This could also have resulted from the nature of schizophrenia with preference for social isolation even if this can worsen the prognosis. On the other hand, patients need to be in contact with a mental healthcare professional in extraordinary situations of a pandemic. This survey did not find a remarkable increase in positive symptom severity in association with COVID-19 as most patients included in the survey had not seen a psychiatrist or mental healthcare professional for two months with 53 patients stating that they did not have to need. However, 58 patients also stated that despite planning to make a consultation after normalization of the quarantine measures, the anxiety of contagion outweighed the option of visiting outpatient clinics. This anxiety over Covid-19 infection, however, may make it difficult for patients to understand the level of the need to see a psychiatrist and may be associated with the assumption that the pandemic would be taken under control in the normalization process with a decrease in the risk of contagion. On the results of this survey, it may be concluded that strategies for prevention of COVID-19 spread were effective among schizophrenia patients and that there is need to develop a system that reaches all patients and keeps them socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. *In Turkey, prescription reports with 1-year validity are issued for patients with chronic disorders. The medications can only be prescribed by a specialist, and in the case of pyshchiatric disorders, by a consultant psychiatrist. When the report is confirmed by a hospital committee of specialists, a family doctor is able to issue prescriptions. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health, patients who have medication prescription reports valid for one year would be able to get their medicines directly from pharmacies without having to consult a psychiatrist or family doctor during the pandemic.

A multi-determined disorder such as major depressive disorder (MDD) does not fit a simple cause and effect model, but is similar to other complex occupational illnesses such as low back pain. Currently, a knowledge gap exists between mental health professionals and employers regarding symptom-based models of illness and function-based models of work performance. As a result, psychiatric disorders affecting workers are under-identified and under-treated and likely result in unmitigated impairment and disability. The authors examine several conceptual models for workplace mental illness across medical and psychological disciplines and propose a unifying construct. The utility of the existing screening methods for common workplace illnesses and their potential application are reviewed. The challenges of diagnosis and effective treatment of workplace mental illness are highlighted within an ""occupational mental health system"" with suggestions for future research directions.","Bender, Ash; Kennedy, Sidney",HealthcarePapers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15829776/,124

The expressed S protein was shown to be glycosylated and expressed on the cell surface, and to be similar in size and antigenic properties to the S protein produced in mouse cells infected by JHMV. However, no proteolytic cleavage was detected in insect cells. The sera from rats immunised with S protein derived from insect cells reacted in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence with the S protein produced in JHMV-infected mouse cells. However, the antisera failed to neutralize the infectivity of JHMV. The studies on two proteins expressed by recombinant baculoviruses, corresponding to the cleavage products S1 and S2, and a panel of monoclonal antibodies suggest that the majority of epitopes which elicit the neutralizing antibodies are present in the N terminal half of the S protein.","Taguchi, F; Yoden, S; Siddell, S; Kikuchi, T",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1966405/,124

METHODS A SARS-associated coronavirus isolate named ZJ01 was obtained from throat swab samples taken from a patient in Hangzhou, Zhejing province. The complete genome sequence of ZJ01 consisted of 29,715 bp (GenBank accession: AY297028, version: gi: 30910859). Seventeen SARS-associated coronavirus genome sequences in GenBank were compared to analyze the common sequence variations and the probability of co-occurrence of multiple polymorphisms or mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of those sequences was done. RESULTS By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the 5 loci nucleotides at ZJ01 genome were found being T, T, G, T and T, respectively. Compared with other SARS-associated coronavirus genomes in the GenBank database, an A/G mutation was detected besides the other 4 mutation loci (C:G:C:C/T:T:T:T) involved in this genetic signature. Therefore a new definition was put forward according to the 5 mutation loci. SARS-associated coronavirus strains would be grouped into two genotypes (C:G:A:C:C/T:T:G:T:T), and abbreviated as SARS coronavirus C genotype and T genotype. On the basis of this new definition, the ZJ01 isolate belongs to SARS-associated coronavirus T genotype, first discovered and reported in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein gene fragments of these SARS-associated coronavirus strains showed that the GZ01 isolate was phylogenetically distinct from other isolates, and compared with groups F1 and F2 of the T genotype, the isolates of BJ01 and CUHK-W1 were more closely related to the GZ01 isolate. It was interesting to find that two (A/G and C/T) of the five mutation loci occurred in the spike protein gene, which caused changes of Asp to Gly and Thr to Ile in the protein, respectively. CONCLUSION Attention should be paid to whether these genotype and mutation patterns are related to the virus's biological activities,epidemic characteristics and host clinical symptoms.","Li, Lanjuan; Wang, Zhigang; Lu, Yiyu; Bao, Qiyu; Chen, Suhong; Wu, Nanping; Cheng, Suyun; Weng, Jingqing; Zhang, Yanjun; Yan, Juying; Mei, Lingling; Wang, Xiaomeng; Zhu, Hanping; Yu, Yingpu; Zhang, Minli; Li, Minhong; Yao, Jun; Lu, Qunying; Yao, Pingping; Bo, Xiaochen; Wo, Jianer; Wang, Shengqi; Hu, Songnian",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527350/,124

204229,Contribution of Syndecans to the Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Considering that female sexual hormones may modulate the inflammatory response and also exhibit direct effects on the cells of the immune system, herein, we intend to discuss the sex differences and the role of estradiol in modulating the lung and systemic inflammatory response, focusing on its possible application as a treatment modality for SARS-CoV-2 patients. COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.","Breithaupt-Faloppa, Ana Cristina; Correia, Cristiano de Jesus; Prado, Carla Máximo; Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes; Moreira, Luiz Felipe Pinho",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,124
204527,Multiscale Feedback Loops in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Evolution,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has limited traditional consultation and minimized health care access. Teledermatology (TD) has come to the rescue in this situation by extending consultation for nonessential conditions to the comfort of patient's homes. This limits the risk of exposure of both doctors and patients to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). And while there is a reported increase in teleconsultations during the ongoing pandemic, there are some demerits that avert the shift to virtualized health care. The authors conducted an online survey to further understand the hesitancy, limitations, merits, and the demographic of dermatologists who were conducive to TD and these data were analyzed and presented in this article. While TD might never replace physical consultation, it definitely serves an adjunctive role in the post-COVID era, provided adequate regulatory measures are in place.","Sharma, Aseem; Jindal, Veenu; Singla, Palvi; Goldust, Mohamad; Mhatre, Madhulika",Dermatol Ther,,124

205573,Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social distancing guidelines, our pediatric diabetes team rapidly changed the format of conducting diabetes clinic from in person to telehealth. We compared the actual number and rate of completed, canceled, and no-show visits between an 8-week period in 2019, when we exclusively conducted visits in person and the same 8-week period in 2020, during the COVID-19 quarantine, when we exclusively conducted visits via telehealth. METHODS: We used electronic health record data for all patients, as well as Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring data collected for a subset of youths during the COVID-19 quarantine and the immediate pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Although there was a difference in the absolute number of in-person versus telehealth visits canceled during these two time periods, there was no difference in the rates of completed, canceled, and no-show visits completed in person or via telehealth. This finding suggests that, despite a rapid shift to a completely new health care delivery model, our providers completed a similar rate of patient care via telehealth during the COVID-19 quarantine and that telehealth may be a feasible method for providing diabetes care. However, our results also suggested that youths' glucose management was less optimal during the quarantine period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presented an opportunity to adopt and test the feasibility of using a telehealth delivery model for routine diabetes care. Yet, to make telehealth a viable treatment delivery alternative will likely involve the uptake of new clinic procedures, investment in institutional infrastructure, and team-based flexibility.","Pierce, J.

The World Health Organization has estimated the impact of reductions in the performance of global tuberculosis (TB) detection and care on TB deaths. However, the actual impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB deaths in China remains unclear. What is added by this report? The stringent public interventions to fight COVID-19 including lockdown led to more than 20% decrease of TB detection in China. It was predicted that the reduction of TB detection might result in 11,700 excess deaths based on assumption of no detection rebound. Based on the prediction the total deaths will be 51,100 in 2020 which might surpass the deaths in 2011. What are the implications for public health practice? Rapid restoration of TB diagnosis and care services is critical for minimizing the potential effects on TBrelated deaths and bringing TB burden back to control. It is urgent to ramp up case detection including active case finding and to provide an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured treatment and care for TB cases in postCOVID-19 outbreak.","Xu, C.

210503,Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive antibodies are a structural category of natural antibodies,2021,"Gut microbiota takes part in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical research has found that probiotics have a beneficial effect on active ulcerative colitis, but to date, significant efficacy has rarely been found in the use of probiotics in the remission phase of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. More studies are needed to assess the utilization of probiotics in IBD remission. In this study, we assessed the administration of Bacillus subtilis in remission and its possible mechanism in mice with IBD. Oral administration of B. subtilis was implemented for 6 weeks (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-P6w group), 2 weeks (DSS-P2w group) or 0 weeks (DSS-control(CT) group) in the remission phase in rodents with (DSS)-induced IBD. The body weight, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded, and colon H&E staining was performed. The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) mRNA and epithelium proliferation-related Ki67 was detected. Gut microbiota were tested by 16S rRNA sequencing. Administration of B. subtilis in remission effectively increased the body weight and colon length and decreased DAI in the DSS-P6w group compared with the DSS-CT group, but there is no significant difference between the DSS-P2w and DSS-CT groups. The epithelial integrity was improved, and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin increased due to administration of B. subtilis in remission, which was more evident in the DSS-P6w group. The expression of Ki67 increased in the DSS-CT group compared with that in the CT group. The administration of B. subtilis effectively down-regulated the expression of Ki67 in the DSS-P6w and DSS-P2w groups compared with the DSS-CT group. Furthermore, gut microbial structure was improved, with significantly decreased Escherichia/Shigella and Enterococcus, and increased Akkermansia and corresponding microbial function in the DSS-P6w group. Short-term administration of B. subtilis in the remission phase showed no significant improvement in mice with IBD. Long-term and continuous supplementation of B. subtilis in remission could effectively maintain the remission by protecting epithelial integrity, regulating proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, and improving gut microbiota and the corresponding microbial function.","Liu, Yongqiang; Yin, Fang; Huang, Linsheng; Teng, Hongfei; Shen, Tongyi; Qin, Huanlong",Food funct,,124

Up till now, there is no fully approved pharmacological treatment or a vaccine. In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission.

METHODS: Women were recruited during their ultrasound screening in gestational week (gwk) 12. The final study sample consisted of 2,899 pregnant women. Questionnaires (including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were completed at three measurement points (gwk 14, 24 and 34). Prenatal depressive symptoms were defined as Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score &#8805; 13. Parental divorce and other stressful life events in childhood were assessed at gwk 14. Parental divorce was defined as separation of parents who were married or cohabiting. Questionnaire data was supplemented with data from Statistics Finland and the Finnish Medical Birth Register. RESULTS: Parental divorce in childhood increased the risk for depressive symptoms during pregnancy (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.02-2.13), but the connection was no longer significant after adjusting for socioeconomic status, family conflicts and witnessing domestic violence in the childhood family (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.54-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: Parental divorce alone does not predict depressive symptoms during pregnancy.","Porthan, Elviira; Lindberg, Matti; Ekholm, Eeva; Scheinin, Noora M; Karlsson, Linnea; Karlsson, Hasse; Härkönen, Juho",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,124

While developing novel drugs and vaccines is long, repurposing existing drugs against COVID-19 can yield treatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter clinical trials. In this study, we present a novel network-based drug repurposing platform to identify candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of the initial outbreak, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 was lacking, but based on its similarity with other viruses, we sought to identify repurposing candidates to be tested rapidly at the clinical or preclinical levels. We first analyzed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed SARS as the closest virus by genome similarity, followed by MERS and other human coronaviruses. Using text mining and database searches, we obtained 34 COVID-19-related genes to seed the construction of a molecular network where our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules, and 78 drugs to repurpose. Based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potentially repurposable drugs against COVID-19 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide). Our work shows how in silico repurposing analyses can yield testable candidates to accelerate the response to novel disease outbreaks.","Li, Xu; Yu, Jinchao; Zhang, Zhiming; Ren, Jing; Peluffo, Alex E; Zhang, Wen; Zhao, Yujie; Wu, Jiawei; Yan, Kaijing; Cohen, Daniel; Wang, Wenjia",Med Drug Discov,,124

The phenomenon suggest an implication on how we can co-create social environments that could catalyze societal level change. Howsoever, SRE phenomenon's research findings in virtual medium is relatively unexplored. Hence this paper aim to study the impact of SRE and virtual wellness programme on sustainability of self-development among middle-aged individuals. Comprehensive qualitative methods of thematic analysis and Ripple Effect Mapping were used on the collected verbatim responses and naturalistic observational remarks of heterogenous random sample (n=80). 4 social determinant variables were taken in to account ;i.e., Sense of community, Social support, Intra-participant ripple and Ripple effect on personal networks. Results resonated with studied social factors and SRE was found to have significant effect on sustainability of self-development in context of virtual wellness programme. Study also suggested social determinants that assisted in catalyzing the preliminary individual change helped to capitulate social hindrances caused due to the program's virtual nature. In consideration with the imposed Covid-19 social distancing protocols, this study's proposed framework for optimized virtual social functioning can be found as a fruitful proposition to carry on similar virtual programms effectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Basheer, F.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study, conducted in two tertiary referral hospitals, Riyadh KSA from February 2015 to February 2016. A total random sample of 305 hospital visitors consented to participate. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire consisting of questions regarding awareness and practice of measures to prevent the spread of infection. RESULTS: Study shows that Participants have a fair knowledge regarding the cause of MERS, (N=228, 74.8%). Nearly half of them (47%) stated that camels are the source of the spread of MERS. About 70% of the participants preferred both sanitization and wearing facemasks as preventive measures for MERS. However, only 3.95% practiced not eating camel products like milk and meat. CONCLUSION: Although Hospital visitors showed some knowledge and positive awareness in several aspects of MERS awareness. There are weak areas where knowledge and awareness were not up-to recommended guidelines. Continued educational programs are needed, to improve awareness and knowledge of all the public towards MERS-CoV infection.

229232,A Benchmark of Popular Free Energy Approaches Revealing the Inhibitors Binding to SARS-CoV2 Mpro (preprint),2020,"RATIONALE: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading global viral pandemic with a high-risk of mortality in selected populations (i.e. elderly, immunocompromised, cardiopulmonary diseases). A hyperinflammatory state caused by excessive inflammatory cytokine production (i.e. TNFα, IL-1β, IL6, IL-8) has been attributed to the pathobiology of COVID-19-mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome, worsened lung fibrosis and increased mortality. Inflammation and inflammatory disorders signal primarily through the MAPK pathway. Activation of p38α is important for regulating inflammation, and aberrant p38α activation is associated in the pathobiology of diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tissue fibrosis. The downstream target of p38α is the protein MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and is responsible for transcriptional production of pro-inflammatory cytokines also elevated in COVID-19 inflammation. Further evidence in other severe viral illnesses (i.e. Dengue, Influenza, CMV) show activation of p38-MK2 signaling axis for mediating inflammation. Potentially, COVID-19 mediated inflammatory cytokine production may signal through p38α-MK2 axis and MK2 pathway blockade may suppress unwanted inflammation. However, it remains unknown whether reducing the inflammatory state can improve COVID-19 outcomes particularly in those with pre-existing conditions. We hypothesized that blockading this pathway would reduce inflammatory cytokine burden and improve respiratory failure-free survival in moderate-severe COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: We designed an investigator-initiated trial (IND#:149790;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04481685) using an oral MK2 inhibitor (ATI-450, Aclaris Pharmaceuticals) in COVID-19. This single-center trial is a Phase IIa, doubleblinded, randomized placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study. COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients with pulmonary signs and symptoms of moderate-severe hypoxic respiratory distress were randomized to ATI-450 or placebo twice-daily for up to 14 days. Results: Study enrollment is completed (n=20 subjects;n=11 male;median age 63 years old). The primary endpoint of this trial is respiratory failure-free survival at 14 days. Secondary endpoints include: changes in WHO-Ordinal scale, additional respiratory and survival outcomes, biochemical assays of circulating cytokines, and safety endpoints. Given the incomplete knowledge of MK2 pathway blockade effects on immune cell function, this study will further explore immune cell characterization in COVID-19 patients treated with ATI-450 via immunophenotyping and 10X Genomics single-cell gene expression analysis. We surmise that myeloid cell activation following COVID-19 infection contributes to localized and systemic tissue injury and will examine the effect of MK2 pathway blockade on eliciting myeloid cell inflammatory activation-suppression. Conclusion: Analyses of the safety, efficacy, and biology of MK2 inhibition, via ATI-450, in treating moderate-severe COVID-19 will be presented.","Polineni, D.; Jandali, M.; Streiler, C.; Nazir, U.; Postigo Jasahui, M.; Morgan, D.; Smith, H.; Holets-Bondar, L.; Markiewicz, M.; He, J.; Fruhauf, E.; Godwin, A.; Soper, S.; Koestler, D.; Gordon, D.; Castro, M.; Gan, G.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,124

We identify properties of the system's equilibria, namely the healthy states. We show that the set of healthy states is asymptotically stable, and that the value of the equilibria becomes equal across all sub-populations as a result of the network flow model. Furthermore, we explore closed-loop feedback control of the system by limiting flow between sub-populations as a function of the current infected states. These results are illustrated via simulation based on flight traffic between major airports in the United States. We find that a flow restriction strategy combined with a vaccine roll-out significantly reduces the total number of infections over the course of an epidemic, given that the initial flow restriction response is not delayed.","Butler, Brooks; Zhang, Ciyuan; Walter, Ian; Nair, Nishant; Stern, Raphael; Par'e, Philip E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07600v1.pdf,124

Main body: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic highly infectious disease which is first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and then had its outbreak leads to a global public health emergency. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of viral nucleic acid is considered as the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis; however, recent studies showed the importance of CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 with high sensitivity. The CT hallmarks of COVID-19 were bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities, consolidation with the advance of the disease more consolidation is there with linear opacities and crazy-paving pattern as well as halo and reverse halo sign. Conclusion: Early identification of COVID-19 cases is vital. The radiologist should be familiar with the possible findings. Further future studies with pathological correlation will help for more understanding of the imaging findings and its value in assessing of prognosis.","Ali, Tamer F.; Tawab, Mohamed A.; ElHariri, Mona A",Egypt.

245894,Synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Transmembrane Domains Using Solid Phase Peptide Chemistry and Analysis of Their Oligomerization for Novel Drug Design,2021,"Expressive Flamenco© theory and praxis is presented by Sánchez through this art-based personal reflection paper, which explores the applications of flamenco for its inherent psycho-somatic therapeutic capacities. She asserts the applied practice of flamenco (in its broadest definition), when combined with other expressive arts practices, can have therapeutic benefits; including (but not limited to) psycho-social, spiritual, and aesthetic connection to the individual's unconscious. During these experiences of arts based emotional expression, one can transcend the self into divine connection with their authentic self, what the author understands as the ""duende"". By allowing one's authentic truth to be expressed through Expressive Flamenco©, a spirit of evocation, born from within the self, appears when the self-connects with and is in creative conversation with its unconscious. The main hypothesis asserts the emergence of the ""duende"" facilitates an epistemological process of self-knowledge and an emotional process of catharsis, suggesting that when this art form is utilized as 'Expressive Flamenco' it helps facilitate holistic healing. This paper aims to stretch flamenco into new applied therapeutic practice territories, specifically in the arts therapies. Practical applications of Expressive Flamenco in the expressive therapies, including expressive arts therapy and dance/movement therapy, is presented along with the preliminary results of a virtual telehealth group facilitated during Covid-19. Professor Pinna-Perez's critical reflections on Expressive Flamenco© and its importance to the field is presented in response to this emerging expressive arts practice.","Sánchez García, Laura; Pinna-Perez, Angelica",Am J Dance Ther,,124

248566,Slaying SARS-CoV-2 One (Single-domain) Antibody at a Time,2021,"Infectious or contagious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through social contact networks. In today's interconnected global society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority.","Dasgupta, Anirban; Sengupta, Srijan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14820v1.pdf,124

The conserved sequence is believed to contribute to its unique antibacterial activities. To design novel drugs based on hBD-3, predicting the binding free energy contribution of each residue on hBD-3 with bacterial membrane is important. Firstly, the stable binding structure of hBD-3 dimer in analog form bound on POPG lipid bilayer was predicted using NAMD simulations, which was confirmed by RMSD, buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, distance map, and insertion depth map calculations. Then, free energy perturbation (FEP) method was applied to calculate the binding free energy of each residue by mutating it into Alanine. It was found that the positively charged residues on the tail region of hBD-3 contribute significantly to its binding with membrane. The result emphasized the importance of electrostatic interactions to hBD-3's binding with bacterial membrane.","Brewer, Ann; Zhang, Liqun",Biophys Chem,,124

These types of studies in regular female gym-goers are of particular interest. METHODS: The objective was to analyse the relationship between the risk of EDs and the use of social networks in 337 women between the ages of 15 and 30 who had been regularly going to the gym in the city of Medellín for four months or more. The type of study was quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional. RESULTS: A total of 143 (47.5%) cases with a risk of EDs were identified. Statistically significant associations were found between the risk of eating disorders and some aspects of the use of social networks. DISCUSSION: The possible association between ED, the use of social networks and certain personality characteristics and sociocultural beauty stereotypes are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to an association between the use of social networks as a way to achieve self-image approval, abnormal eating attitudes and body satisfaction. This behaviour, added to other vulnerability factors, may increase the risk for the initiation or maintenance of an ED, particularly in the population using gyms and physical conditioning centres.","Restrepo, Jorge Emiro; Castañeda Quirama, Tatiana",Rev Colomb Psiquiatr,,124

Taking advantage of the cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in the prefusion conformation, we performed a virtual screening simulation with the aim to identify novel molecules that could be used as fusion inhibitors. The spike glycoprotein structure has been completed using modeling techniques and its inner cavity, needful for the postfusion transition of the trimer, has been scanned for the identification of strongly interacting available drugs. Finally, the stability of the protein-drug top complexes has been tested using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of interaction of the molecules to the spike protein has been evaluated through the MM/GBSA method and per-residue decomposition analysis. Results have been critically discussed considering previous scientific knowledge concerning the selected compounds and sequence alignments have been carried out to evaluate the spike glycoprotein similarity among the betacoronavirus family members. Finally, a cocktail of drugs that may be used as SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors has been suggested.","Romeo, Alice; Iacovelli, Federico; Falconi, Mattia",Virus Res,,124
256864,Induction of Exaggerated Cytokine Production in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells by a Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein S1 and Its Inhibition by Dexamethasone,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a national health care emergency in the United States and exposed resource shortages, particularly of health care providers trained to provide critical or intensive care. This article describes how digital health technologies are being or could be used for COVID-19 mitigation. It then proposes the National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN), which would combine digital health technologies to address this and future crises. Methods: Subject matter experts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center examined the peer-reviewed literature and science/technology news to see what digital health technologies have already been or could be implemented to (1) support patients while limiting COVID-19 transmission, (2) increase health care providers' capability and capacity, and (3) predict/prevent future outbreaks. Results: Major technologies identified included telemedicine and mobile care (for COVID-19 as well as routine care), tiered telementoring, telecritical care, robotics, and artificial intelligence for monitoring. Several of these could be assimilated to form an interoperable scalable NETCCN. NETCCN would assist health care providers, wherever they are located, by obtaining real-time patient and supplies data and disseminating critical care expertise. NETCCN capabilities should be maintained between disasters and regularly tested to ensure continual readiness. Conclusions: COVID-19 has demonstrated the impact of a large-scale health emergency on the existing infrastructures. Short term, an approach to meeting this challenge is to adopt existing digital health technologies. Long term, developing a NETCCN may ensure that the necessary ecosystem is available to respond to future emergencies.","Scott, Benjamin K; Miller, Geoffrey T; Fonda, Stephanie J; Yeaw, Ronald E; Gaudaen, James C; Pavliscsak, Holly H; Quinn, Matthew T; Pamplin, Jeremy C",Telemed J E Health,,124

The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. LIMITATIONS: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. CONCLUSION: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, Md Saiful; Ferdous, Most Zannatul; Potenza, Marc N",J Affect Disord,,124

This defining moment in our lives has created wide-ranging discussions in many segments of our societies, both politically and socially. Over time, the pandemic has been associated with many social and political topics, as well as sentiments and emotions. Twitter offers a platform to understand these effects. The primary objective of this study is to capture the awareness and sentiment about COVID-19-related issues and to find how they relate to the number of cases and deaths in a representative region of the United States. The study uses a unique dataset consisting of over 46 million tweets from over 91,000 users in 88 counties of the state of Ohio, a state-of-the-art deep learning model to measure and detect awareness and emotions. The data collected is analyzed using OLS regression and System-GMM dynamic panel. Findings indicate that the pandemic has drastically changed the perception of the Republican party in the society. Individual motivations are strongly influenced by ideological choices and this ultimately affects individual pandemic-related outcomes. The paper contributes to the literature by expanding the knowledge on COVID-19 (i), offering a representative result for the United States by focusing on an ""average"" state like Ohio (ii), and incorporating the sentiment and emotions into the calculation of awareness (iii).","Caliskan, Cantay",J Comput Soc Sci,,124

Their concentrations are of tens to thousands µg g-1, respectively. Concentrations of the other elements are in the range of a few ng g-1 to few hundreds µg g-1. In order to constrain the dispersion of particles in the environment and to understand how chemical elements can be scavenged from or released to seawater, the size distribution of particles composing the concretions has been measured by settling rate experiments and, for each size class of particles, their chemical composition has been determined. For example, As and V are mainly associated to particles with mean diameters between 15.6 and 63 µm and settling rates around 96 m d-1.

Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted from March 24, 2020 through May 28, 2020 at the emergency department (ED) of an urban, academic trauma center. We enrolled patients consecutively admitted to the ED with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 submitted to endotracheal intubation. No patients were excluded. The primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success, defined as successful endotracheal tube placement with the first device passed (endotracheal tube) during the first laryngoscope insertion confirmed with capnography. Secondary outcomes included the following complications: hypotension, hypoxemia, aspiration, and esophageal intubation. Results: A total of 112 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were enrolled. Median age was 61 years and 61 patients (54%) were men. The primary outcome, first-attempt intubation success, was achieved in 82% of patients. Among the 20 patients who were not intubated on the first attempt, 75% were intubated on the second attempt and 20% on the third attempt; cricothyrotomy was performed in 1 patient.

They could no longer rely on previous assumptions about their customers, including their buying patterns e.g.;when the selling curve will go up, what are the seasonal patterns, what product mix make them buy etc. In no days, brick & mortar stores closed due to panic, e-commerce sales gradient rising, and customer center interactions exploded. Meanwhile, the new normal defines the new consumption pattern of media as more people started working from home, spending more time online and watching TV, and virtual interaction is all time high rather than contacting in person. Rapid change is obvious in this crisis period, and more than ever, organizations need to make decisions quickly that are however anchored in data. Yet, even as organizations bury themselves in data, they are getting an incomplete picture of performance and their customers and almost all the time this is data related [10]. This creates the classic dichotomy;you rely on data to make the decision and you are not sure whether data has the proper quality or not. Data is an important factor, for any strategy the leadership team of any organization is willing to take. In Telecom industry, managing data effectively and efficiently is one of the toughest challenges. Often, different functional departments and sub-functional departments create their own version of data and applications which can help their day to day activities. This kind of fit-for-application and their own set of data elements create the silos within the organization, duplicate the effort and make it nearly impossible to manage the data democratically. Different departments having different versions of the truth leads to plentiful issues including poor operational, predictive & regulatory reporting. In a big telecom organization, it is common that the same enterprise, network and product data gets replicated, processed and managed multiple times throughout the company. Transitioning a telecom organization to a truly data driven organization where data is 'managed' is not only difficult but need to overcome numerous common challenges. A successful data-operating model across the organization is the answer to that [1]. A successful data operating model helps to disrupt the technical silos existing in an organization. It builds upon the business model clearly indicates the value created out of it with a long-term goal alignment and addresses the way, data is going to be handled across the newly defined organizational processes;all the way from upstream data collection, cleansing and enrichment to the referencing and the downstream use of raw or transformed data [11]. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

266417,In silico veritas? Potential limitations for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development based on T-cell epitope prediction,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected residents and staff at long-term care (LTC) and other residential facilities in the United States. The high morbidity and mortality at these facilities has been attributed to a combination of a particularly vulnerable population and a lack of resources to mitigate the risk. During the first wave of the pandemic, the federal and state governments received urgent calls for help from LTC and residential care facilities; between March and early June of 2020, policymakers responded with dozens of regulatory and policy changes. In this article, we provide an overview of these responses by first summarizing federal regulatory changes and then reviewing state-level executive orders. The policy and regulatory changes implemented at the federal and state levels can be categorized into the following 4 classes: (1) preventing virus transmission, which includes policies relating to visitation restrictions, personal protective equipment guidance, and testing requirements; (2) expanding facilities' capacities, which includes both the expansion of physical space for isolation purposes and the expansion of workforce to combat COVID-19; (3) relaxing administrative requirements, which includes measures enacted to shift the attention of caretakers and administrators from administrative requirements to residents' care; and (4) reporting COVID-19 data, which includes the reporting of cases and deaths to residents, families, and administrative bodies (such as state health departments). These policies represent a snapshot of the initial efforts to mitigate damage inflicted by the pandemic. Looking ahead, empirical evaluation of the consequences of these policies-including potential unintended effects-is urgently needed. The recent availability of publicly reported COVID-19 LTC data can be used to inform the development of evidence-based regulations, though there are concerns of reporting inaccuracies. Importantly, these data should also be used to systematically identify hot spots and help direct resources to struggling facilities.","Chen, Angela T; Ryskina, Kira L; Jung, Hye-Young",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,124

271561,Immunogenicity of prime-boost protein subunit vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and macaques,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) expresses a multifunctional papain-like proteinase (PLpro), which mediates the processing of the viral replicase polyprotein. Inhibition of PLpro has been shown to suppress the viral replication. This study aimed to explore new anti-PLpro candidates by applying virtual screening based on GRL0617, a known PLpro inhibitor of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The three-dimensional (3D) structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was built by homology modeling, using SARS-CoV PLpro as the template. The model was refined and studied through molecular dynamic simulation. AutoDock Vina was then used to perform virtual screening where 50 chemicals with at least 65% similarity to GRL0617 were docked with the optimized SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. In this screening, 5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide outperformed GRL0617 in terms of binding affinity (-9.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, 2-(4-fluorobenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione (previously introduced as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2), 3-nitro-N-[(1r)-1-phenylethyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (inhibitor against Mycobacterium tuberculosis), as well as the recently introduced SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitor 5-acetamido-2-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide showed promising affinity for the viral proteinase. All of the identified compounds demonstrated an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile. In conclusion, our findings represent rediscovery of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, or antiviral drugs as promising pharmaceutical candidates against the ongoing coronavirus.","Jamalan, Mostafa; Barzegari, Ebrahim; Gholami-Borujeni, Fathollah",J Proteome Res,,124
271562,Immunogenicity of prime-boost protein subunit vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and macaques,2021,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHODS: The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Santé study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4·8% (95% CI 2·4-8·0, n=341). The estimate increased to 8·5% (5·9-11·4, n=469) in the second week, to 10·9% (7·9-14·4, n=577) in the third week, 6·6% (4·3-9·4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10·8% (8·2-13·9, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5-9 years (relative risk [RR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·11-0·63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0·50 [0·28-0·78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20-49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2·5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5-9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10-64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

275020,Anti-HIV drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of human interaction, causing global changes in financial, health care, and social environments for the foreseeable future. More than 1.3 million of the 4 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed globally as of May 2020 have been identified in the United States, testing the capacity and resilience of our hospitals and health care workers. The impacts of the ongoing pandemic, caused by a novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have far-reaching implications for the future of our health care system and how we deliver routine care to patients. The adoption of social distancing during this pandemic has demonstrated efficacy in controlling the spread of this virus and has been the only proven means of infection control thus far. Social distancing has prompted hospital closures and the reduction of all non-COVID clinical visits, causing widespread financial despair to many outpatient centers. However, the need to treat patients for non-COVID problems remains important despite this pandemic, as care must continue to be delivered to patients despite their ability or desire to report to outpatient centers for their general care. Our national health care system has realized this need and has incentivized providers to adopt distance-based care in the form of telemedicine and video medicine visits. Many institutions have since incorporated these into their practices without financial penalty because of Medicare's 1135 waiver, which currently reimburses telemedicine at the same rate as evaluation and management codes (E/M Codes). Although the financial burden has been alleviated by this policy, the practitioner remains accountable for providing proper assessment with this new modality of health care delivery. This is a challenge for most physicians, so our team of national experts has created a reference guide for musculoskeletal and neurologic examination selection to retrofit into the telemedicine experience. OBJECTIVES: To describe and illustrate musculoskeletal and neurologic examination techniques that can be used effectively in telemedicine. STUDY DESIGN: Consensus-based multispecialty guidelines. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: Literature review of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, lumbar, hip, and knee physical examinations were performed. A multidisciplinary team comprised of physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedics, rheumatology, neurology, and anesthesia experts evaluated each examination and provided consensus opinion to select the examinations most appropriate for telemedicine evaluation. The team also provided consensus opinion on how to modify some examinations to incorporate into a nonhealth care office setting. RESULTS: Sixty-nine examinations were selected by the consensus team. Household objects were identified that modified standard and validated examinations, which could facilitate the examinations.The consensus review team did not believe that the modified tests altered the validity of the standardized tests. LIMITATIONS: Examinations selected are not validated for telemedicine. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were not performed. CONCLUSIONS: The physical examination is an essential component for sound clinical judgment and patient care planning. The physical examinations described in this manuscript provide a comprehensive framework for the musculoskeletal and neurologic examination, which has been vetted by a committee of national experts for incorporation into the telemedicine evaluation.","Wahezi, Sayed E; Duarte, Rui V; Yerra, Sandeep; Thomas, Mark A; Pujar, Beendu; Sehgal, Nalini; Argoff, Charles; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Gonzalez, David; Jain, Ruchi; Kim, Chong H; Hossack, Michael; Senthelal, Shayan; Jain, Ankush; Leo, Nathaniel; Shaparin, Naum; Wong, Daniel; Wong, Ashley; Nguyen, Kim; Singh, Jaspal R; Grieco, Giacinto; Patel, Arpan; Kinon, Merritt D; Kaye, Alan D",Pain Physician,,124

On 14 March 2020, the Commission adopted “Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/402 of 14 March 2020 making the exportation of certain products subject to the production of an export authorisation”, 2temporarily restricting exports of “personal protective equipment” to destinations outside of the EU.

As the greater implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on trade are still difficult to assess, the emergency measures taken by affected countries already require legal scrutiny. At the same time, it must be noted that, as noted above for the EU measures, measures around the world are subject to change dynamically in view of the evolution of the pandemic.","Carreño, Ignacio; Dolle, Tobias; Medina, Lourdes; Brandenburger, Moritz",Eur.

295139,Class A G Protein-Coupled Receptor Antagonist Famotidine as a Therapeutic Alternative Against SARS-CoV2: An In Silico Analysis,2020,"Background: Restricting human mobility is an effective strategy used to control disease spread. However, whether mobility restriction is a proportional response to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. We aimed to develop a model that can quantify the potential effects of various intracity mobility restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. Methods: In this modelling study, we used anonymous and aggregated mobile phone sightings data to build a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered transmission model for COVID-19 based on the city of Shenzhen, China. We simulated how disease spread changed when we varied the type and magnitude of mobility restrictions in different transmission scenarios, with variables such as the basic reproductive number (R 0), length of infectious period, and the number of initial cases. Findings: 331 COVID-19 cases distributed across the ten regions of Shenzhen were reported on Feb 7, 2020. In our basic scenario (R 0of 2·68), mobility reduction of 20–60% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33% (95% UI 21–42) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20% restriction, 66% (48–75) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40% restriction, and 91% (79–95) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60% restriction. The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25% or 50% in transmissibility of the virus. In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down. The simulation results were also affected by various transmission parameters. Interpretation: Our model shows the effects of various types and magnitudes of mobility restrictions on controlling COVID-19 outbreaks at the city level in Shenzhen, China. The model could help policy makers to establish the optimal combinations of mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction on public health in view of the potential negative economic and societal effects.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Single-center cohort study of 198 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (38%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). At time of data collection, 16 (8%) were still hospitalized and 19% had died. During a median follow-up of 7 days (IQR, 3-13), 39 patients (20%) were diagnosed with VTE of whom 25 (13%) had symptomatic VTE, despite routine thrombosis prophylaxis. The cumulative incidences of VTE at 7, 14 and 21 days were 16% (95% CI, 10-22), 33% (95% CI, 23-43) and 42% (95% CI 30-54) respectively.

METHODS: Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to different durations of PX-UV. RESULTS: For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 log10, >4.54 log10, and >4.12 log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 log10 reduction in viral load. PX-UV significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. CONCLUSION: With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology to reduce environmental and personal protective equipment bioburden and to enhance both healthcare worker and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Simmons, Sarah E; Carrion, Ricardo; Alfson, Kendra J; Staples, Hilary M; Jinadatha, Chetan; Jarvis, William R; Sampathkumar, Priya; Chemaly, Roy F; Khawaja, Fareed; Povroznik, Mark; Jackson, Stephanie; Kaye, Keith S; Rodriguez, Robert M; Stibich, Mark A",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,124

We discuss a selection of theoretical and experimental key results of weakest-link games and interpret them in the light of the corona-pandemic. First, we highlight that experimental evidence does not support the assumption that coordination can be trivially solved, even among symmetric players. Second, we argue that for asymmetric countries the weakest-link game does not only pose a problem of coordination, but also a problem of cooperation. Third, we show how and under which conditions self-enforcing treaties can foster coordination and cooperation. We account for the possibility that countries make mistakes when choosing their actions. Our discussion shows that North–South cooperation is relevant and likely to be self-enforcing and that regional cooperation, e.g., within the EU, will also be important.","Caparrós, Alejandro; Finus, Michael",Environ.

300958,Synonymous mutations and the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 origins,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and often devastating impact on global healthcare systems. Healthcare systems have had to repurpose programs and staff as part of COVID-19 relief efforts. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have infrastructure and skilled personnel that have been utilized in new ways as part of COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. A critical focus of ASPs both before and during the pandemic is limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance. Fortunately, existing data indicate that rates of bacterial co-infection are relatively low and ASPs should continue aggressive efforts to limit unnecessary antimicrobial use. ASPs have taken a lead role in COVID-19 focused guideline creation and curation as well as in helping to steward access to potential novel therapeutic agents. Disparities in ASP program resources and personnel exist, and ASP activities focused on COVID-19 response should be tailored to individual settings. There is an urgent need for research to help inform ASP best practices within pandemic response efforts that takes into account local resources. Investment in infrastructure and personnel is urgently needed both in the context of current relief efforts and to prepare for future pandemics.","Pierce, Jacob Stevens Michael P.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,,124

The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and by physical contact from contaminated surfaces to the mucosa. Its route of transmission has caused a significant challenge in medical and dental healthcare. Infected children have no or milder COVID-19 symptoms and are potential vectors in spreading the disease. Routine dental treatment is suspended in many countries because of the increased risk of cross-infection in dental practices. Only emergency dental care is provided for urgent conditions. It is necessary for us to gradually reinstate regular dental care to paediatric patients and maintain their good oral health. Robust infection control guidelines should be implemented in dental clinics to minimise the risk of infection and to ensure the safety of patients and staff during the pandemic. Three levels of preventive care should be practised to prevent oral diseases and improve children's oral health in this era. Treatment should be prioritized to patients in urgent needs and aerosol-generating procedures should be minimized. This article aims to review the literature and information available on the provision of paediatric dental treatment during and post-pandemic and to provide specific recommendations on the safe provision of paediatric dental care.,"Luo, Weijia; Lee, Gillian Hm; Nalabothu, Prasad; Kumar, Harleen",,,124

A total of 62 European cardiologists as authors and 29 further experts as reviewers have contributed to this 119-page document. The emphasis of the guidelines is on a cautious strategy in dealing with a pandemic, which is still characterized by many unknown factors. It is consciously limited to cardiovascular diseases. In the last update from 10 June 2020 many practical instructions for cardiovascular diagnostics and treatment under the conditions of a pandemic are given. These recommendations largely depend on the already well-known guidelines of the ESC. To recapitulate them might be helpful but much is redundant. The sections on the pathophysiology and pathomechanisms by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could specifically affect the cardiovascular system, are informative but sometimes in need of supplementation. It is counterproductive to recommend that pathohistological and molecular investigations of tissues from affected and deceased patients should be avoided. This document of guidance is an ambitious attempt of a learning recommendation that needs some further improvement. It needs an early update if it intends to do justice to the ambitions.","Maisch, Bernhard",Herz,,124

Our objective was to test a fully automated closed-loop control (CLC) system in the absence of announcement of carbohydrate ingestion among adolescents with T1D, who are known to commonly omit meal announcement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen adolescents with T1D (age 15.6 ± 1.7 years; HbA1c 7.4 ± 1.5%; 9 females/9 males) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing our legacy hybrid CLC system (Unified Safety System Virginia [USS]-Virginia) with a novel fully automated CLC system (RocketAP) during two 46-h supervised admissions (each with one announced and one unannounced dinner), following 2 weeks of data collection. Primary outcome was the percentage time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) following the unannounced meal, with secondary outcomes related to additional continuous glucose monitoring-based metrics. RESULTS: Both TIR and time-in-tight-range 70-140 mg/dL (TTR) were significantly higher using RocketAP than using USS-Virginia during the 6 h following the unannounced meal (83% [interquartile range 64-93] vs. 53% [40-71]; P = 0.004 and 49% [41-59] vs. 27% [22-36]; P = 0.002, respectively), primarily driven by reduced time-above-range (TAR >180 mg/dL: 17% [1.3-34] vs. 47% [28-60]), with no increase in time-below-range (TBR <70 mg/dL: 0% median for both). RocketAP also improved control following the announced meal (mean difference TBR: -0.7%, TIR: +7%, TTR: +6%), overall (TIR: +5%, TAR: -5%, TTR: +8%), and overnight (TIR: +7%, TTR: +19%, TAR: -5%). RocketAP delivered less insulin overall (78 ± 23 units vs. 85 ± 20 units, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A new fully automated CLC system with automatic prandial dosing was proven to be safe and feasible and outperformed our legacy USS-Virginia in an adolescent population with and without meal announcement.","Garcia-Tirado, Jose; Diaz, Jenny L; Esquivel-Zuniga, Rebeca; Koravi, Chaitanya L K; Corbett, John P; Dawson, Martha; Wakeman, Christian; Barnett, Charlotte L; Oliveri, Mary C; Myers, Helen; Krauthause, Katie; Breton, Marc D; DeBoer, Mark D",Diabetes care,,124
311360,Simultaneous detection of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins from SARS-CoV-2 based on ultrasensitive single molecule assays,2021,"Coronavirus spread is more serious in urban metropolitan cities compared to rural areas. It is observed from the data on the infection rate available in the various sources that the cold and dry conditions accelerate the spread of coronavirus. In the present work, the existing theory of respiratory droplet drying is used to propose the mechanism of virus spread under various climates and the indoor environment conditions which plays a greater role in the virus spread. This concept is assessed using four major parameters such as population density, climate severity, the volume of indoor spaces, and air-conditioning usage which affect the infection spread and mortality using the data available for various states of India. Further, it is analysed using the data from various states in India along with the respective climatic conditions. It is found that under some indoor scenarios, the coronaviruses present in the respiratory droplets become active due to size reduction that occurs both in sessile and airborne droplet nuclei causing an increase in the spread. Understanding this mechanism will be very useful to take the necessary steps to reduce the rate of transmission by initiating corrective measures and maintaining the required conditions in the indoor built environment.","V, Antony Aroul Raj; R, Velraj; Haghighat, Fariborz",Sustainable Cities Soc.,,124

Double mutants of nkd1 and nkd2 (nkd1,2) show multiple aleurone (AL) cell layers with disrupted AL cell differentiation, whereas mutants of thk1 cause multiple cell layers of fully differentiated AL cells. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of nkd1,2 and thk1 mutant endosperm transcriptomes to study how these factors regulate gene networks to control AL layer specification and cell differentiation. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was incorporated with published laser capture microdissected transcriptome datasets to identify a coexpression module associated with AL development. In this module, both Nkd1,2+ and Thk1+ appear to regulate cell cycle and division, whereas Nkd1,2+, but not Thk1+, regulate auxin signaling. Further investigation of nkd1,2 differentially expressed genes combined with published putative targets of auxin response factors (ARFs) identified 61 AL-preferential genes that may be directly activated by NKD-modulated ARFs. All 61 genes were upregulated in nkd1,2 mutant and the enriched Gene Ontology terms suggested that they are associated with hormone crosstalk, lipid metabolism, and developmental growth. Expression of a transgenic DR5-red fluorescent protein auxin reporter was significantly higher in nkd1,2 mutant endosperm than in wild type, supporting the prediction that Nkd1,2+ negatively regulate auxin signaling in developing AL. Overall, these results suggest that Nkd1,2+ and Thk1+ may normally restrict AL development to a single cell layer by limiting cell division, and that Nkd1,2+ restrict auxin signaling in the AL to maintain normal cell patterning and differentiation processes.","Wu, Hao; Becraft, Philip W",Plant Genome,,124

Compliance with social distancing policies, strict return-to-play protocols, and COVID-19 specific training has, perhaps, forever changed the way that children and young people engage in organised sport. Within this context, and while many children and families seek to re-engage with community sport, we (researchers and sport practitioners) have an obligation to ask questions about how the pandemic has impacted youth sport, understand the short- and long-term consequences, and explore what (if any) opportunities can be seized to assist and improve future participation and retention. The aim of this paper was to present an in-depth exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on youth sport in South Australia. METHODS: Within an interpretive descriptive methodology, this qualitative investigation draws on rich, individual interview and focus group data with 39 youth (ages 15-18), parents, coaches, and sport administrators. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken, leading to the development of four substantive themes. RESULTS: We conceptualised the '4 Rs' to advance theoretical understandings about the pandemic's impact on youth sport, including the themes 'recognising struggle', 'reconnection', 're-engaging after restrictions, and 'reimagining sport'. The themes captured insights about a decline in mental wellbeing and physical activity, an increase in family connectedness, the challenge for sports to attract volunteers and participants back into sport, and the opportunities to reset values and philosophies underpinning the provision of youth sport. CONCLUSION: The findings provide valuable insight into the youth sport setting as a result of the global pandemic and suggest that families, sporting clubs and sporting organisations require additional resources and tools (for example, support for parents to facilitate their children's training at home during lockdown) to aid recovery efforts and to ensure the survival and prosperity of youth sport into the future.","Elliott, Sam; Drummond, M J; Prichard, I; Eime, R; Drummond, C; Mason, R",BMC Public Health,,124

As dental core trainees (DCT) working in hospitals, we have been at the forefront of the crisis and one of the first in line for redeployment. Therefore, we decided to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the redeployment of DCTs across the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this study was collected and shared between three project researchers. All researchers were undergoing dental core training in Oral Surgery and Restorative dentistry at Guy's Hospital, London. An online survey was sent out via email and online social media platforms to reach as many DCTs as possible in the United Kingdom. Implied consent was obtained by respondents on submission of the survey.The survey consisted of five sections and was branched, with respondents answering different sections depending on their redeployment status. No qualitative data was collected, as all questions included in the survey were dichotomous or multiple-choice questions. The last two questions were in the form of a 5-point Likert scale, inviting respondents to rate five statements from strongly agree to strongly disagree. RESULTS: A total of 150 participants responded, of which 34% had been redeployed due to the pandemic. The majority of DCTs were redeployed to an intensive care unit or similar setting, and over 75% of those redeployed were working with either COVID-19 positive/suspect patients. Additionally, 23.8% of respondents had stopped patient contact due to their medical status. CONCLUSION: Many DCTs have been deployed to departments outside of their specialty and expressed some anxiety as a result. Inevitably, this has resulted in disruption to their training program and education over the last few months. The response across the United Kingdom has been understandably variable due to the differing demands of the hospital trusts within which the DCTs work.","Patel, Misha; Menhadji, Payvand; Mayor, Serena",European journal of dentistry,,124

Methods: This study is a case report presenting a retrospective review of the patient's medical chart. Plasma complement C3 and C4 levels, immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses were determined by nephelometry, the complement pathways' activity (CH50, AP50, MBL) using WIESLAB® Complement System assays. Human complement factor H levels, anti-complement factor H auto-antibodies were analyzed by ELISA, using HRP-labeled secondary antibodies specific for human IgG, IgG4, and IgA, respectively. Genetic analyses were performed by exome sequencing of 14 gens implicated in complement disorders, as well as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification looking specifically for CFH, CFHR1-2-3, and 5. Results: Our brief report presents the first case of IgG4-RD with complement-mediated TMA originating from both pathogenic CFHR 1 and CFHR 4 genes deletions, and inhibitory anti-complement factor H autoantibodies of the IgG4 subclass. Remission was achieved with plasmaphereses, corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide. Following remission, the patient was diagnosed with lymphocytic meningitis and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with an uneventful recovery. Conclusion: IgG4-RD can be associated with pathogenic IgG4 autoantibodies. Genetic predisposition such as CFHR1 and CFHR4 gene deletions enhance the susceptibility to the formation of inhibitory anti-Factor H IgG4 antibodies.","Breville, Gautier; Zamberg, Ido; Sadallah, Salima; Stephan, Caroline; Ponte, Belen; Seebach, Jörg D",Front Immunol,,124
328511,Hepatitis C virus drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease synergize with remdesivir to suppress viral replication in cell culture,2021,"Background: With at least 94 countries undergoing or exiting lockdowns for contact suppression to control the COVID-19 outbreak, sustainable and public health-driven exit strategies are required. Here we explore the impact of lockdown and exit strategies in Singapore for immediate planning. Methods: We use an agent-based model to examine the impacts of epidemic control over 480 days. A limited control baseline of case isolation and household member quarantining is used. We measure the impact of lockdown duration and start date on final infection attack sizes. We then apply a 3-month gradual exit strategy, immediately re-opening schools and easing workplace distancing measures, and compare this to long-term social distancing measures. Findings: At baseline, we estimated 815 400 total infections (21.6% of the population). Early lockdown at 5 weeks with no exit strategy averted 18 500 (2.27% of baseline averted), 21 300 (2.61%) and 22 400 (2.75%) infections for 6, 8 and 9-week lockdown durations. Using the exit strategy averted a corresponding 114 700, 121 700 and 126 000 total cases, representing 12.07-13.06% of the total epidemic size under baseline. This diminishes to 9 900-11 300 for a late 8-week start time. Long-term social distancing at 6 and 8-week durations are viable but less effective. Interpretation: Gradual release exit strategies are critical to maintain epidemic suppression under a new normal. We present final infection attack sizes assuming the ongoing importation of cases, which require preparation for a potential second epidemic wave due to ongoing epidemics elsewhere.

This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations for living systematic reviews and against research waste. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides statistical methodology for a meta-analysis that can be updated at any time -- reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error guarantees, live -- no need to prespecify the looks, and leading -- in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information. We illustrate the method for time-to-event data, showing how synthesizing data at interim stages of studies can increase efficiency when studies are slow in themselves to provide the necessary number of events for completion. The meta-analysis can be performed on interim data, but does not have to. The analysis design requires no information about the number of patients in trials or the number of trials eventually included. So it can breathe life into living systematic reviews, through better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication.","Schure, Judith ter; Grunwald, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12141v1.pdf,124

From 14 March to 26 April 2020 underage Spaniards were not allowed to leave their homes, except for reasons of force majeure. This could have consequences on their mental health in both the short and the long term. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the consequences of confinement on the mental health of Spanish children and teenagers, at the time when minors had been locked down in their homes between 8 and 10 days. The sample was composed of 590 confined Spanish children and teenagers between 8 and 18 years old. The scales of Depression, Self-esteem, Anxiety, Problems with Emotional Regulation, Rage Control Problems, Integration and Social Competence, Somatic Complaints, Rebellious Behaviour, as well as Awareness of the Problems of the Assessment System for Children and Adolescents (SENA) were used. The results revealed that, during confinement, children and adolescents showed emotional and behavioural alterations.

The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of variation in COVID-19 outcomes between National Health Service (NHS) hospital trusts and regions in England using data from March–July 2020. Methods This was a retrospective observational study using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 during a hospital stay in England that was completed between March 1st and July 31st, 2020 were included. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome of interest. In secondary analysis, critical care admission, length of stay and mortality within 30 days of discharge were also investigated. Multilevel logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. Findings There were 86,356 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 included in the study, of whom 22,944 (26.6%) died in hospital with COVID-19 as the primary cause of death. After adjusting for covariates, the extent of the variation in-hospital mortality rates between hospital trusts and regions was relatively modest. Trusts with the largest baseline number of beds and a greater proportion of patients admitted to critical care had the lowest in-hospital mortality rates. Interpretation There is little evidence of clustering of deaths within hospital trusts. There may be opportunities to learn from the experience of individual trusts to help prepare hospitals for future case-surges.","Gray, William K.; Navaratnam, Annakan V.; Day, Jamie Babu Pratusha Mackinnon Shona Adelaja Ini Bartlett-Pestell Sam Moulton Chris Mann Cliff Batchelor Anna Swart Michael Snowden Chris Dyer Philip Jones Michael Allen Martin Hopper Adrian Rayman Gerry Kar Partha Wheeler Andrew Eve-Jones Sue Fong Kevin J.; Machin, John T.; Wendon, Julia Briggs Tim W.

Methods: Serology assays from Roche, Abbott, Diasorin, BioMerieux, Beckman-Coulter, Siemens, and Mt.-Sinai ELISA were included. Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population, and 698 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, collected between March and May 2020, were analyzed. Findings: Immunoassays sensitivities between 81.5%-89.4% and specificities between 97.7%-100% resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in low (<15%) prevalence scenarios. No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults. A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers, and no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed. We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies. Interpretation: wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit significant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios. The low false-positivity rate in under 20's suggests that cross-reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children. Finding no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks is in contrast to some reports of short half-life for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The ~5% who were seronegative non-responders, using multiple assays in a population-wide manner, represents the proportion of patients that may be at risk for re-infection.

The objectives were; to investigate the current knowledge on COVID-19 among the DHCW's; and to conduct quasi-experiment among the DHCW's who were unaware of the disseminated COVID-19 information. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional study targeting dental interns, auxiliaries, and specialists with a two-staged cluster sampling technique was performed. A 17-item questionnaire was subjected to reliability and validity tests before being administered. The participants for quasi-experiment were separated from the original sample after their initial response. Chi-square test assessed responses to knowledge statements between the participants. Difference in mean knowledge scores between the categories of DHCW's and sources of COVID-19 information was assessed using ANOVA. Data from the quasi experiment (pre vs post knowledge intervention) was subjected to paired t-test. Percentage of DHCWs providing correct or wrong responses to each knowledge statement at baseline and after 7 days were compared using McNemar test. RESULTS: The overall sample consisted of 706 (N) participants, and the DHCW's with no prior knowledge on COVID-19 (N=206) were part of the quasi experiment. Findings from cross-sectional study revealed that knowledge was significantly (p<0.05) related to the qualification level (interns vs auxiliaries vs specialists). However, the difference in the source of information (WHO/CDC vs Journal articles vs MoH) did not demonstrate any effect. Number of participants with correct responses to knowledge questions had significantly (p<0.05) increased after intervention. Also, the overall mean knowledge score (10.74±2.32 vs 12.47±1.68; p<0.001) had increased significantly after the intervention.

Methods An ambidirectional population-based cohort study including all confirmed Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital during 1/03-31/05 and those living in home healthcare settings identified through a regional registry and evaluated through medical records, including WHO Clinical Progression Scale (CPS). All patients discharged from hospital were followed-up by structured telephone interview at 4 months post-discharge. Respondents indicated any new or aggravated persisting problems in any of 25 body functions and 12 activity/participation items and rated them for impact on daily life. Findings Out of 734 hospitalised patients, 149 were excluded, 125 died, and 460 were alive at 4-month follow-up of whom 433 (94.1%) were interviewed. In total, 40% reported impairments and activity/participation limitations affecting daily life and warranted further multi-professional rehabilitation assessment, predominantly those with severe disease and a considerable proportion of those with moderate disease. Cognitive and affective impairments were equally common in all groups and were reported by 20-40% of cases. Limb weakness was reported by 31%, with CPS 7-9 being four times more likely to report this problem as compared to CPS 4-5. 26% of those working or studying reported difficulties returning to these activities, this being 3.5 times more likely in CPS 7-9 as compared to CPS 4-5. 25% reported problems walking &gt;1 km, with CPS 7-9 over three times more likely to report this as compared to the other two sub-groups. 90-day mortality rate of Covid-19 associated deaths was 15.1%.

The aim of this research was to assess the efficacy of CCP as an adjunctive treatment in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and MedRix were searched for potentially relevant articles. All included papers were assessed for the quality using modified Jadad scale and Newcastle-Ottawa scale for randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non - RCT, respectively. We used a Q test and Egger test to assess the heterogeneity and publication bias among studies, respectively. Mortality rates between patients treated with standard treatment and standard treatment with CCP were compared using a Z test. Results: A total of 12 papers consisting of three cross-sectional studies, one prospective study, five retrospective studies, and three RCT studies were included in our analysis. Of them, a total of 1,937 patients treated with CCP and 3,405 patients without CCP were included. The risk of mortality was 1.92-fold higher in patients without CCP compared to patients treated with CCP (OR: 1.92;95%CI: 1.33, 2.77;p=0.0005). In severe COVID-19 sub-group analysis, we found that patients without CCP had a 1.32 times higher risk of mortality than those treated with CCP (OR: 1.32;95%CI: 1.09, 1.60;p=0.0040). Conclusions: CCP, as adjunctive therapy, could reduce the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.","Wardhani, S. O.; Fajar, J.

Using risk theory techniques, we determine the probability of a household falling under the poverty line. Microinsurance is then introduced to analyse its impact as an insurance solution for the lower income class. Our results validate those previously obtained with this type of model, showing that microinsurance alone is not sufficient to reduce the probability of falling into the area of poverty for specific groups of people, since premium payments constrain households' capital growth. This indicates the need for additional aid particularly from the government. As such, we propose several premium subsidy strategies and discuss the role of government in subsidising microinsurance to help reduce poverty.","Contr'o, Jos'e Miguel Flores; Henshaw, Kira; Loke, Sooie-Hoe; Arnold, S'everine; Constantinescu, Corina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.17255v1.pdf,124
357747,Rapid electrochemical detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has had a greater burden, as measured by rate of infection, in poorer communities within cities. For example, 55% of Mumbai slums residents had antibodies to COVID-19, 3.2 times the seroprevalence in non-slum areas of the city according to a sero-survey done in July 2020. One explanation is that government suppression was less severe in poorer communities, either because the poor were more likely to be exempt or unable to comply. Another explanation is that effective suppression itself accelerated the epidemic in poor neighborhoods because households are more crowded and residents share toilet and water facilities. We show there is little evidence for the first hypothesis in the context of Mumbai. Using location data from smart phones, we find that slum residents had nominally but not significantly (economically or statistically) higher mobility than non-slums prior to the sero-survey. We also find little evidence that mobility in non-slums was lower than in slums during lockdown, a subset of the period before the survey.","Sheng, Jaymee Malani Anup Goel Ashish Botla Purushotham",Journal of Urban Economics,,124

361433,Genetic variability in the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry factors across populations,2020,"The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the demand for air transport. One passenger segment that has received relatively little attention is ageing passengers (defined as aged 65+), in spite of the fact that this group has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and in recent years has been viewed as a potential growth market. Therefore, the aim of this brief paper is to analyse the attitudes of ageing passengers by assessing air travel plans in the next 12 months, examining the factors influencing future flying decisions, and investigating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on perceived risks and experiences associated with flying. The findings show that over 60% of ageing passengers are planning to travel by air in the next 12 months, although the nature of their trips may change. Factors such as flexible ticket booking and quarantine rules do not appear to be key drivers affecting travel decisions and within the different stages of the air journey, getting to/from the airport is perceived as the safest stage. The findings suggest that there are various COVID-19 implications for airlines and airports serving this market segment, ranging from the use of self-service technology, the generation of commercial/ancillary revenues and the design of surface access policies.","Graham, Anne; Kremarik, Frances; Kruse, Willy",J.

Although current efforts seek to target the issues of burnout and stress for radiologists, the impact of their physical workspace is often overlooked. By combining evidence-based design, human factors, and the architectural concept of the Eudaimonia Machine, we have developed a redesign of the radiology reading room that aims to create an optimal workspace for the radiologist. Informed by classical principles of well-being and contemporary work theory, Eudaimonia integrates concerns for individual wellness and efficiency to create an environment that fosters productivity. This layout arranges a work environment into purposeful spaces, each hosting tasks of varying degrees of intensity. The improved design addresses the radiologist's work requirements while also alleviating cognitive and physical stress, fatigue, and burnout. This new layout organizes the reading room into separate areas, each with a distinct purpose intended to support the range of radiologists' work, from consultation with other health care providers to reading images without interruption. The scientific principles that undergird evidence-based design and human factors considerations ensure that the Eudaimonia Radiology Machine is best suited to support the work of the radiologists and the entire radiology department.","Larsen, Ethan P; Hailu, Tigist; Sheldon, Lydia; Ginader, Abigail; Bodo, Nicole; Dewane, David; Degnan, Andrew J; Finley, John; Sze, Raymond W",J.

However, data on the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with kidney disease is limited, and the utility of an LFIA to test for antibodies in these patients has not been assessed. Study Design: Observational study. Setting & Participants: 60 patients (40 hemodialysis and 20 kidney transplant recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and 88 historic negative-control samples (collected before September 2019). Test: A commercially available LFIA to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with infection confirmed by viral RT-PCR testing. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG in dialysis patients and transplant recipients. Results: 56/58 (96.6%) patients (38/39 hemodialysis and 18/19 transplant recipients) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 5/7 (71.4%) patients who were negative on preliminary testing had detectable IgG when retested more than 21 days postdiagnosis. Median times to first and second tests after diagnosis were 17 (interquartile range, 15-20) and 35 (interquartile range, 30-39) days, respectively. Calculation of test characteristics gave sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI, 88.3%-99.4%) and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 92.0-99.6%). Limitations: Possible exposure to other beta-coronaviruses that may cross-react with the antigen used in the LFIA cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Symptomatic dialysis patients and transplant recipients commonly develop an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be detected using an LFIA. Used diligently, an LFIA could be used to help screen the dialysis populations or confirm exposure on a patient level, especially in facilities in which laboratory resources are limited.","Prendecki, Maria; Clarke, Candice; McKinnon, Tom; Lightstone, Liz; Pickering, Matthew C; Thomas, David C; McAdoo, Stephen P; Willicombe, Michelle",,,124

Adolescence is an important period to promote preconception health, but education resources need to be age- and culturally-appropriate. Few studies have addressed preconception awareness and knowledge among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, and few culturally appropriate resources exist. METHODS: A mixed methods, co-design process engaging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth and an Indigenous Reference Group (IRG). Additionally, a survey was carried out to identify preconception health awareness and interest among a broader youth audience. RESULTS: Several main themes emerged from consultation meetings with youth reflecting an awareness of preconception health, but limited understanding. Youth revealed an interest in fertility, and a need for more information on lifestyle factors associated with infertility. Preconception information related to the opposite sex was seen as important as well as information incorporating current local knowledge and world views. Among the survey respondents, 46% (11/24) had a pre-existing understanding of pre-conception health. Optimising lifestyle behaviours prior to pregnancy was perceived as important for women (21/24; 88%), but less so for men (16/24; 67%), highlighting a gap in knowledge regarding the importance of preconception health for men. CONCLUSION: The co-designed resource 'Getting healthy before pregnancy' is available in print and electronically, with illustrations and synchronised audio overlay in Aboriginal English or East-side Kriol. The resource includes information on preconception health and behavioural risk factors.

The novel coronavirus affects the respiratory system, producing symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. The association between COVID-19 and coagulation has been previously reported. Due to several inflammatory changes that occur in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections such as alterations in the levels of clotting factors, platelet activation leads to thrombus formation in coronary and cerebral vessels, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, respectively. Unfortunately, the progression of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is rapid in patients with and without comorbidities. Hence, the proper monitoring of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 is essential to avoid further complications. The implementation of guidelines for antithrombotic treatments based on the presentation of the disease is recommended.

We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients, hospitalized with COVID-19. Serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL was considered VDD. Patients were classified as having mild and severe disease on basis of the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI). Of the 410 patients recruited, patients with VDD (197,48.2%) were significantly younger and had lesser comorbidities. The levels of PTH were significantly higher in the VDD group (63.5 ± 54.4 vs. 47.5 ± 42.9 pg/mL). The proportion of severe cases (13.2% vs.14.6%), mortality (2% vs. 5.2%), oxygen requirement (34.5% vs.43.4%), ICU admission (14.7% vs.19.8%) was not significantly different between patients with or without VDD. There was no significant correlation between serum 25-OHD levels and inflammatory markers studied. Serum parathormone levels correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010), and LDH (r 0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with oral cholecalciferol (median dose of 60,000 IU). The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, serum 25-OHD levels at admission did not correlate with inflammatory markers, clinical outcomes, or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of VDD with cholecalciferol did not make any difference to the outcomes.","Jevalikar, Ganesh; Mithal, Ambrish; Singh, Anshu; Sharma, Rutuja; Farooqui, Khalid J; Mahendru, Shama; Dewan, Arun; Budhiraja, Sandeep",Sci Rep,,124

We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5-6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015-2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population.

This article summarizes the efforts, successes, and challenges experienced by ISU-CVM clinical faculty during this transition. Numerous data sources were reviewed, including college records and announcements, faculty survey results, and student rotation evaluations. Data were explored using quantitative and qualitative methods. Between March and July 2020, 36 faculty from 15 different clinical services invested approximately 5,000 hours in delivering virtual content to 165 VM4 students from ISU-CVM and Caribbean veterinary schools. With departmental, college, and university assistance, faculty effectively used educational technologies (Zoom, Canvas, Echo360) and developed adaptive and innovative methods for virtual content delivery. Virtual VM4 rotations were collectively well received and appreciated by students, and student evaluation scores were statistically equivalent or higher for virtual rotations than for the corresponding in-person rotations in the preceding year. Although certain hands-on skills could not be adequately acquired in a virtual environment, students gained theoretical knowledge and case-based problem-solving skills in the online format. Faculty reported satisfaction with their adaptability and resilience in these challenging circumstances. These findings demonstrate that ISU-CVM clinical faculty invested substantial time and effort to transition in-person clinical rotations to virtual format during the early COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly noteworthy given that many of these same faculty simultaneously served as essential personnel managing clinical cases in the university's teaching hospital.","Ward, Jessica L; Mulherin, Brenda L; Vengrin, Courtney A",J Vet Med Educ,,124

Despite the reduction of primary emissions during the lockdown period, heavy haze pollution was observed unexpectedly in megacities in North and East China. In this study, we conducted online measurements of organic aerosol in a background site before and during the lockdown in Guanzhong basin, Northwest China. The oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) increased from 24% of total OA (3.2 ± 1.6 µg m-3) before lockdown to 54% of total OA (4.5 ± 1.3 µg m-3) during lockdown, likely due to substantial decrease of NOx emissions during lockdown which resulted in large increase of O3 and thus atmospheric oxidizing capacity. OOA showed higher mass concentrations and fractional contributions during lockdown than before lockdown, and increased with the increase of Ox in both periods. In comparison, aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) showed high mass concentrations and fractional contributions in both polluted periods before and during lockdown with the increase of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). The increase of aqSOA under high ALWC conditions is very likely the reason of pollution events during lockdown. Combined with trajectory analysis, the absence of Guanzhong cluster in polluted period during lockdown may play a key role in the OA variations between two polluted periods. In addition, when comparing the clusters from the same transmission directions between before lockdown and during lockdown, the OA fractions showed similar variations during lockdown in all clusters, suggesting the OA variations are widespread in northwest China.","Zhong, Haobin; Huang, Ru-Jin; Chang, Yunhua; Duan, Jing; Lin, Chunshui; Chen, Yang",Sci Total Environ,,124

In our previous study, we have found that lipid-related constituents in the host cellular membrane are associated with the BmCPV life cycle. It is important to note that the lipids not only affect the cellular biological processes, they also impact the virus life cycle. However, the intracellular lipid homeostasis in BmN cells after BmCPV infection remains unclear. Here, the lipid metabolism in BmCPV-infected BmN cells was studied by lipidomics analysis. Our results revealed that the intracellular lipid homeostasis was disturbed in BmN cells upon BmCPV infection. Major lipids constituents in cellular membrane were found to be significantly induced upon BmCPV infection, which included triglycerides, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, phospholipids, glucoside ceramide, monoetherphosphatidylcholin, ceramide, ceramide phosphoethanolamine and cardiolipin. Further analysis of the pathways related to these altered lipids (such as PE and PC) showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism was one of the most enriched pathways. These results suggested that BmCPV may manipulate the lipid metabolism of cells for their own interest. The findings may facilitate a better understanding of the roles of lipid metabolic changes during virus infection in future studies.","Zhang, Xing; Zhang, Yunshan; Shi, Xiu; Dai, Kun; Liang, Zi; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Ziyao; Shen, Zeen; Pan, Jun; Wang, Chonglong; Hu, Xiaolong; Gong, Chengliang",Dev Comp Immunol,,124

A hospital-based training programme was rapidly arranged to prepare staff for the imminent threat. Objective: We developed a hospital-wide multidisciplinary infection control training programme on endotracheal intubation for healthcare workers to minimise nosocomial spread of COVID-19 during this high-stress and time-sensitive risky procedure. Methodology: Major stakeholders (Quality & Safety Department, Infection Control Team, Central Nursing Division, high-risk clinical departments and hospital training centre) formed a training programme task group. This group was tasked with developing high-fidelity scenario-based simulation training curriculum for COVID-19 endotracheal intubation with standard workflow and infection control practice. This group then implemented and evaluated the training programme for its effectiveness. Results: 101 training classes of 2-hour session were conducted from 5 February to 18 March 2020, involving 1415 hospital staff (∼81% of target participants with training needs) either inside the hospital training centre or as in situ simulation training (intensive care unit or accident and emergency department). Learners' satisfaction was reflected by overall positive response percentage at 90%. Opinions of participating staff were incorporated into the standard airway management and infection control practice for endotracheal intubation of adult patients with COVID-19. Thirty-five patients with COVID-19 were intubated with the current workflow and guideline without any nosocomial transmission. Conclusion: An early planned and well-structured multidisciplinary hospital-wide simulation training programme was organised expeditiously to provide extensive staff coverage.

The results, based on the application of a Boosted Regression Tree algorithm method, show that average temperature and average relative humidity explain significant variations in COVID-19 transmission across temperate and subtropical regions, whereas in the tropical region, the average diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality significantly predict the infection outbreak. The number of positive cases showed a decrease sharply above an average temperature of 10°C in the cities of France, Turkey, the US, the UK, and Germany. Among the tropical countries, COVID-19 in Indian cities is most affected by mean diurnal temperature, and those in Brazil by temperature seasonality. The findings have implications on public health interventions, and contribute to the ongoing scientific and policy discourse on the complex interplay of climatic factors determining the risks of COVID-19 transmission.","Pramanik, Malay; Chowdhury, Koushik; Rana, Md Juel; Bisht, Praffulit; Pal, Raghunath; Szabo, Sylvia; Pal, Indrajit; Behera, Bhagirath; Liang, Qiuhua; Padmadas, Sabu S; Udmale, Parmeshwar",Int J Environ Health Res,,124

Here, a vaccine non-specialist suggests how this might be done. I propose two alternative options and compare the primary alternative option with current practice. The basis of comparison is feasibility in achieving what we need: a safe, mass-produced, emerging virus-targeted vaccine on 2–4 week notice. The primary option is the following. (1) Start with a platform based on live viruses that infect bacteria, but not humans (bacteriophages, or phages). (2) Isolate phages (to be called pathogen homologs) that resemble and provide antigenic context for membrane-covered, pathogenic RNA viruses; coronavirus-phage homologs will probably be found if the search is correctly done. (3) Upon isolating a viral pathogen, evolve its phage homolog to bind antibodies neutralizing for the viral pathogen. Vaccinate with the evolved phage homolog by generating a local, non-hazardous infection with the phage host and then curing the infection by propagating the phage in the artificially infecting bacterial host. I discuss how this alternative option has the potential to provide what is needed after appropriate platforms are built.","Serwer, Philip",Antibiotics,,124

Initially, the increase of the people?s interests to shop online was to buy masks and hand sanitizers for protection against the disease. Then, there was an increase of interest to buy stationery (as there is the trend of working and studying from home) and also medical equipment. Yet, in its application, there are many cases of where the customers experienced loss due to the use of this type of business transaction. There are legal protections on electronic transaction which have been violated during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a efetividade do uso de coleiras impregnadas com deltametrina a 4% na prevenção e controle da LV canina (LVC) no município de Juatuba, Minas Gerais, Brasil nos anos de 2014 e 2015. Foi realizado um estudo epidemiológico de intervenção do tipo ensaio comunitário em cães por meio da comparação de indicadores epidemiológicos para a ocorrência de LVC em duas áreas: com e sem intervenção, denominadas área experimental (AE) e área controle (AC). Em ambas as áreas realizou-se coleta sanguínea para exame de LVC, sendo que os cães da AE receberam também coleiras impregnadas com deltametrina a 4%. Os exames sorológicos realizados foram o teste rápido (TR-DPP) como triagem e imunoenzimático (ELISA) como confirmatório, como preconizado pelo Ministério da Saúde do Brasil. Após intervalo de seis meses realizou-se novamente exame nos animais para determinar a incidência pessoa-tempo da LVC, o risco relativo, e a efetividade da ação proposta. Na primeira coleta foram examinados 1020 cães oriundos da AE e 589 cães da AC. A prevalência encontrada foi de 4,41% (IC95% 3,27-5,91) na AE, e 7,13% (IC95% 5,25-9,59) na AC. A odds de infecção encontrada, 1,6636 (IC95% 1,08- 2,57; p = 0,027), indicou que a chance de um cão se infectar com a doença na AC era naturalmente maior do que na AE. Na segunda coleta foram examinados 454 cães da AE e 292 cães da AC. No cálculo da incidência corrigida para as perdas no meio do período, encontrou-se 3,51% (IC95% 1,30-7,48) na AE e 5,82% (IC95% 3,43-9,16) na AC. Devido à diferença encontrada na odds de infecção, foi realizada uma parametrização do número de casos incidentes da AC, com manutenção de 11,81% (CI95% 7,03-18,23) de incidência (17 casos). A diferença entre as incidências calculadas para as áreas se mostrou estatisticamente significante (p=0,009). O cálculo do risco relativo apresentou um valor de 0,2972 (IC95% 0,1204-0,7339; p=0,009), e a efetividade do encoleiramento foi estimada em 70,27%. Nessa etapa do trabalho, observou-se que um elevado percentual de cães 40,96% (186/454) não estava portando a coleira no momento da visita. No entanto, apesar da perda, o encoleiramento protegeu 3,36 vezes mais os cães da AE de se tornarem soropositivos para LVC. A partir dos resultados obtidos, pode-se concluir que o uso da coleira repelente é uma alternativa a ser considerada no combate à LVC.","SILVA, SARA CLEMENTE PAULINO FERREIRA E",,,124

402262,Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus-induced infection (COVID-19) can be associated with a coagulopathy mainly responsible for pulmonary microvasculature thrombosis and systemic thromboembolic manifestations. The pathophysiology and management of the COVID-19 coagulopathy are likely more complex in patients with inherited bleeding diseases such as haemophilia. These individuals might indeed present with both bleeding and thrombotic complications and require simultaneous antithrombotic and haemostatic treatments. OBJECTIVE: We propose practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 coagulopathy in persons with haemophilia. RESULTS: Continuation of regular haemostatic treatment is recommended for ambulatory patients. For patients requiring hospital admission and on replacement therapy with factors VIII or IX concentrates, prophylaxis with concentrates should be intensified according to the risk of bleeding complications and associated with prophylactic doses of LMWH. For patients on nonreplacement therapy, emicizumab should be continued and possibly combined with factor VIII and prophylactic doses of LMWH depending on the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Dose escalation of LMWH tailored to the risk of thrombosis can be employed but not supported by evidence. CONCLUSIONS: These practical recommendations are based on the current literature on COVID-19 with its impact on haemostasis, indications and modalities for thromboprophylaxis mainly in nonhaemophilic patients and how that is likely to affect persons with haemophilia in different circumstances. They will need to be tailored to each patient's clinical status and validated in future studies.","Pipe, Steven W; Kaczmarek, Radoslaw; Srivastava, Alok; Pierce, Glenn F; Makris, Mike; Hermans, Cedric",Haemophilia,,124

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, also plays a key role in lung adenocarcinoma. To study the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung adenocarcinoma patients, mRNA and microRNA profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus followed by bioinformatics analysis. A network which regards angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the center was structured. In addition, via immunological analysis to explore the essential mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in lung adenocarcinoma. Compared with normal tissue, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was increased in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, a total of 7 correlated differently expressed mRNAs (ACE2, CXCL9, MMP12, IL6, AZU1, FCN3, HYAL1 and IRAK3) and 5 correlated differently expressed microRNAs (miR-125b-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-130b-5p, miR-381-3p and miR-421) were screened. Interestingly, the most frequent toll-like receptor signaling pathway was enriched by mRNA (interlukin 6) and miRNA (miR-125b-5p) sets simultaneously. In conclusion, it was assumed that miR-125b-5p-ACE2-IL6 axis could alter the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung adenocarcinoma patients.","Chen, Long; Liu, Yue; Wu, Jiamin; Deng, Chao; Tan, Jianjun; Liu, Huawen; Zhong, Li",Aging (Albany NY),,124

Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients seem to be more common and have different clinical characteristics. Here we report 9 patients who had pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum during their stay in the ICU. Patients who were admitted to ICU between March 2020 and December 2020, were reviewed for presence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema during their ICU stay. Demographic characteristics, mechanical ventilation settings, documented ventilation parameters, outcomes were studied. A total of 161 patients were admitted to ICU during the study period, 96 were invasively ventilated. Nine patients had developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and/or subcutaneous emphysema during their admission. Five of them were men and median age was 66.6 years. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients were managed conservatively. One patient was discharged from ICU, the others were lost due to other complications related to COVID-19. Upon detection of pneumothorax and/or mediastinum all patients were managed conservatively by limiting their PEEP and maximum inspiratory pressures and were followed by daily chest X-rays (CXR) for detection of any progress. None of the patients showed increase in size of their pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum. Hemodynamically instability due to pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum was not observed in any of the patients. Tension pneumothorax was not observed in any of the patients. Most common reason for death was sepsis due to secondary bacterial infections. Acute deterioration with rapid oxygen desaturation or palpation of crepitation over thorax and neck in a COVID-19 patient should prompt a search for pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Conservative management may be an option as long as the patients are stable.","Talan, Leyla; Sasal Solmaz, F Gonca; Ercan, Ugur; Akdemir Kalkan, Irem; Yenigün, Bülent Mustafa; Yüksel, Cabir; Altintas, N Defne",Tuberk Toraks,,124

By focally dampening cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve disease outcomes through immunomodulation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or until hospital discharge, and compared with age- and comorbidity-matched controls meeting identical disease severity criteria. Eligible patients were hospitalized, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) positive, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen but had not rapidly declined on admission or before drug therapy or LD-RT. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, and biomarker response. RESULTS: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared with 10 control patients blindly matched by age and comorbidity. Six controls received COVID-19 drug therapies. Median time to clinical recovery was 12 days in the control cohort compared with 3 days in the LD-RT cohort (hazard ratio 2.9, P = .05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 vs 12 days, P = .19) and intubation rates (40% vs 10%, P = .12) in the control and LD-RT cohorts were compared. Median time from admission to recovery was 10 versus 13 days (P = .13). Hospital duration average was 19 versus 22.6 days (P = .53). Average hospital days on supplemental oxygen of any duration was 13.1 versus 14.7 days (P = .69). Average days with a documented fever was 1 versus 4.3 days (P = .12). Twenty-eight-day overall survival was 90% for both cohorts. The LD-RT cohort trended toward superior rates of improved radiographs (P = .12) and delirium (P < .01). Statistically significant reductions were observed in numerous hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: A prospective cohort of predominantly elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia were recovered to room air quicker than age- and comorbidity-matched controls, with trending or significant improvements in delirium, radiographs, and biomarkers, and no significant acute toxicity. Low-dose, whole-lung radiation for patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia appears safe and may be an effective immunomodulatory treatment. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to define the efficacy of LD-RT for COVID-19.","Hess, Clayton B; Nasti, Tahseen H; Dhere, Vishal R; Kleber, Troy J; Switchenko, Jeffrey M; Buchwald, Zachary S; Stokes, William A; Weinberg, Brent D; Rouphael, Nadine; Steinberg, James P; Godette, Karen D; Murphy, David J; Ahmed, Rafi; Curran, Walter J; Khan, Mohammad K",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,,124
422010,Recent trends in analytical and digital techniques for the detection of the SARS-Cov-2,2021,"Here we report a recombinant baculoviral vector-based DNA vaccine system against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2). A non-replicating recombinant baculovirus expressing the human endogenous retrovirus envelope gene (AcHERV) was constructed as a DNA vaccine vector for gene delivery into human cells. For MERS-CoV vaccine construction, DNA encoding MERS-CoV S-full, S1 subunit, or receptor-binding domain (RBD) was inserted into the genome of AcHERV. For COVID19 vaccine construction, DNA encoding SARS-CoV2 S-full or S1 or a MERS-CoV NTD domain-fused SARS-CoV2 RBD was inserted into the genome of AcHERV. AcHERV-DNA vaccines induce high humoral and cell-mediated immunity in animal models. In challenge tests, twice immunized AcHERV-MERS-S1 and AcHERV-COVID19-S showed complete protection against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, respectively. Unlike AcHERV-MERS vaccines, AcHERV-COVID19-S provided the greatest protection against SARS-CoV2 challenge. These results support the feasibility of AcHERV-MERS or AcHERV-COVID19 vaccines in preventing pandemic spreads of viral infections.","Cho, Hansam; Jang, Yuyeon; Park, Ki-Hoon; Choi, Hanul; Nowakowska, Aleksandra; Lee, Hee-Jung; Kim, Minjee; Kang, Min-Hee; Kim, Jin-Hoi; Shin, Ha Youn; Oh, Yu-Kyoung; Kim, Young Bong",NPJ Vaccines,,124

422635,Construction of SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particles by Mammalian Expression System,2020,"In the care of patients with operable breast cancer, there has been a shift toward increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy. There are benefits to neoadjuvant therapy, such as monitoring for response, as well as an increased rate of breast conservation and reduction of potential morbidity associated with breast surgery, including axillary management. Among patients with highly proliferative tumors, such as HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, those with residual disease are at higher risk of recurrence, which informs the recommended systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting. For instance, in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, there is a role for adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine for those with residual disease at the time of surgery. The same holds true regarding the role of adjuvant capecitabine in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With the added complexities of treating patients in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak, additional considerations are critical, including initiation of surgery within an appropriate time from completion of neoadjuvant therapy. National consensus guidelines on time to surgery must be developed to improve measurement and comparison across systems. In addition, there is emerging radiation treatment management research addressing a number of factors, including hypofractionation, role of proton beam therapy, safe omission of radiotherapy, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without drug combination. In this article, the multidisciplinary approach of treating patients with operable breast cancer is highlighted, with updates and future considerations described.","Obeng-Gyasi, Samilia; Coles, Charlotte E; Jones, Jade; Sacks, Ruth; Lightowlers, Sara; Bliss, Judith M; Brunt, A Murray; Haviland, Joanne S; Kirby, Anna M; Kalinsky, Kevin",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,,124
422662,Retraction Note to: SARS-CoV-2 infects T lymphocytes through its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2020, Public Health England with NHS Test and Trace initiated a pilot study in which close contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 were given the option to carryout lateral flow device antigen tests at home, as an alternative to self-isolation for 10-14 days. In this study, we evaluated engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results. METHODS: We conducted a service evaluation of the pilot study, examining survey responses from a subset of those who responded to an evaluation questionnaire. We used an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who consented to daily testing. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and instead self-isolated. RESULTS: Acceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of testing and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging. Future research should examine attitudes and behaviour in a context where infection levels are lower, testing is more familiar, and restrictions on activity have been reduced.","Martin, Alex F; Denford, Sarah; Love, Nicola; Ready, Derren; Oliver, Isabel; Amlôt, Richard; Rubin, G James; Yardley, Lucy",BMC Public Health,,124

To make matters worse, an upcoming and alarming trend that is increasingly being noticed as a post-COVID sequel is that of pulmonary fibrosis. Given the scale of the pandemic, the magnitude of this problem is likely to be high. Extrapolated conclusions from previous studies discussing the beneficial role of antifibrotics in progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases provide some hope that these medicines might have a potentially useful role in COVID-19 related lung fibrosis as well. Increased serum levels of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators in COVID-19 patients, similar cytokine profiles in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, and broad anti-fibrotic activity of approved antifibrotics irrespective of the underlying etiology, are some of the proposed mechanisms favoring the argument. However, no studies currently support or refute the use of antifibrotics in patients developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In view of such uncertainties, it is critically important for lung fibrosis networks to conduct well-designed prospective clinical trials addressing this issue to find conclusive answers.","Mishra, Mayank; Sindhwani, Girish",Adv Respir Med,,124

Different guidelines for the above are introduced; however, there is no general consensus on any neither the type of anticoagulant nor for the dosage and duration of prescription. In our medical center, adopted internal guideline was considered for patients COVID-19. We consulted patients with COVID-19 who suffered from concurrent hematoma. Appropriate surgical approach was considered. Finally autopsy study was performed for patients. In this article, we presented a series of seven SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases faced with bleeding complication following initiation of anticoagulation protocol. The rectus sheath hematoma with extension to pelvic and/or retroperitoneal space, even involving bowel mesentery was seen most commonly. Despite receiving appropriate surgical care, all seven cases died. Finally, in all cases, autopsy studies revealed no evidence for confirmation of DIC/SIC or organ failure as the reason of death although pulmonary involvement with SARS-CoV-2 and bleeding phenomena were approved. The nature of the COVID-19 syndrome makes patients vulnerable to hemorrhagic events following anticoagulant administration which relatively causes or accelerates patient's expiration.","Hajian, Abbas",Indian J Surg,,124
442357,Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals features important for vaccine design,2020,"The role of school-based contacts in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is incompletely understood. We use an age-structured transmission model fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admission data to assess the effects of school-based measures at different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Our analyses suggest that the impact of measures reducing school-based contacts depends on the remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce the effective reproduction number (Re) with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among older school children. As two examples, we demonstrate that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays in 2020, in the absence of other measures, would not have prevented the second pandemic wave in autumn 2020 but closing schools in November 2020 could have reduced Re below 1, with unchanged non-school-based contacts.","Rozhnova, Ganna; van Dorp, Christiaan H; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia; Bootsma, Martin C J; van de Wijgert, Janneke H H M; Bonten, Marc J M; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E",Nat Commun,,124

We investigated the impact on unmet needs and psychosocial well-being. METHODS: One hundred and forty four participants (77% female), including people with cancer and their support networks, were recruited. The most prevalent diagnosis was breast cancer. Forty-one participants recruited pre-pandemic were compared with 103 participants recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured participants' unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life. RESULTS: Half of our patient respondents reported unexpected changes to treatment following pandemic onset, with widespread confusion about their longer-term consequences. Although overall need levels have not increased, specific needs have changed in prominence. People with cancer reported significantly reduced anxiety (p = 0.049) and improved quality of life (p = 0.032) following pandemic onset, but support network participants reported reduced quality of life (p = 0.009), and non-significantly elevated anxiety, stress and depression. CONCLUSION: Psychological well-being of people with cancer has not been detrimentally affected by pandemic onset. Reliance on home-based support to compensate for the lost availability of structured healthcare pathways may, however, explain significant and detrimental effects on the well-being and quality of life of people in their support and informal care networks.","Hulbert-Williams, Nicholas J; Leslie, Monica; Hulbert-Williams, Lee; Smith, Eilidh; Howells, Lesley; Pinato, David J",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),,124

447800,Potent Antiviral Activity against HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 by Antimicrobial Peptoids,2021,"Backgroud: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been the workers most likely to contract the disease. Intensive focus is therefore needed on hospital strategies that minimize exposure and diffusion, confer protection and facilitate early detection and isolation of infected personnel. METHODS: To evaluate the early impact of a structured risk-management for exposed COVID-19 HCWs and describe how their characteristics contributed to infection and diffusion. Socio-demographic and clinical data, aspects of the event-exposure (date, place, length and distance of exposure, use of PPE) and details of the contact person were collected. RESULTS: The 2411 HCWs reported 2924 COVID-19 contacts. Among 830 HCWs who were at 'high or medium risk', 80 tested positive (9.6%). Physicians (OR=2.03), and non-medical services -resulted in an increased risk (OR=4.23). Patient care did not increase the risk but sharing the work environment did (OR=2.63). There was a significant time reduction between exposure and warning, exposure and test, and warning and test since protocol implementation. HCWs with management postitions were the main source of infection due to the high number of interactions. DISCUSSION: A proactive system that includes prompt detection of contagious staff and identification of sources of exposure helps to lower the intra-hospital spread of infection. A speedier return to work of staff who would otherwise have had to self-isolate as a precautionary measure improves staff morale and patient care by reducing the stress imposed by excessive workloads arising from staff shortages.","Garzaro, Giacomo; Clari, Marco; Ciocan, Catalina; Grillo, Eugenio; Mansour, Ihab; Godono, Alessandro; Borgna, Lorenza Giuditta; Sciannameo, Veronica; Costa, Giuseppe; Raciti, Ida Marina; Bert, Fabrizio; Berchialla, Paola; Coggiola, Maurizio; Pira, Enrico",Med Lav,,124

Few empirical studies have sought to define useful practices for engaging in social media for academic use in the health professions. Given the increasing importance of these platforms, we sought to define good practices and potential pitfalls with help of those respected for their work in this new field. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study, guided by constructivist grounded theory principles, of 17 emerging experts in the field of academic social media. We engaged in a snowball sampling technique and conducted a series of semi-structured interviews. The analytic team consisted of a diverse group of researchers with a range of experience in social media. RESULTS: Understanding the strengths of various platforms was deemed to be of critical importance across all the participants. Key to building online engagement were the following: 1) Culture-building strategies; 2) Tailoring the message; 3) Responsiveness; and 4) Heeding rules of online engagement. Several points of caution were noted within our participants' interviews. These were grouped into caveat emptor and the need for critical appraisal, and common pitfalls when broadcasting one's self. DISCUSSION: Our participants were able to share a number of key practices that are central to developing and sharing educational content via social media. The findings from the study may guide future practitioners seeking to enter the space.

With the public health effort to flatten the curve, many clinics have moved to virtual care for select populations of patients while triaging and postponing others. As genetic services are asked to gradually resume, a roadmap is needed to ensure clinical care decisions for at-risk patients are transparent and equitable, that postponed care is resumed and that patients with or waiting for a genetic diagnosis are not disproportionately affected or abandoned.The purpose of this document is to highlight the guiding ethical principles and stakeholder considerations in resuming genetic services to help guide the competing needs going forward of both limiting exposures while maintaining high-quality care. Considerations highlighted are (1) environment of practice, (2) nature of consult, (3) patient factors, (4) provider factors, and (5) laboratory factors. The intended users are those providing genetic care in a Canadian context with the recognition that there are clinic-specific and regional variations that will influence decision-making.

No information is currently available on the preservation of apheresis PLT in vitro quality parameters when PLTs are held at room temperature early in the storage period prior to transfer to cold storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Double units of platelets suspended in 35% plasma/65% PAS-III were collected from normal consenting research donors and rested at room temperature for 1-2 hours. One of the units was then stored at 1-6°C while the other unit was placed on an agitator at 20-24°C. Eight hours after collection, the unit stored at room temperature was transferred to 1-6°C storage without agitation. Units were sampled for an array of PLT in vitro parameters on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21. RESULTS: As expected, PLTs held for 8 hours at 20-24°C prior to 1-6°C storage had greater lactate levels and reduced glucose levels and pH compared to PLTs subjected to a 1-2-hour room temperature hold prior to cold storage (P < .05). Unexpectedly, platelets held for 8 hours at room temperature had less aggregation response to collagen, ADP, and TRAP compared to PLTs held 1-2 hours at room temperature prior to cold storage (P < .05, n = 8). CONCLUSION: Decline of aggregation response should be considered when evaluating longer than necessary room temperature holds prior to cold storage of platelets.","Wagner, Stephen J; Getz, Todd M; Thompson-Montgomery, Dedeene; Turgeon, Annette",Transfusion,,124

In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of the patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza Glabra) is a competitive inhibitor of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11ß-HSD1) enzyme and has been traditionally reported as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, anti-thirst, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic agent. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of participants with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. The study was performed using diabetic patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters were measured using standard diagnostic tools. Fourteen patients were divided into two groups by simple randomization, Licorice group (treated with 750 mg licorice/day for three weeks), and placebo group (treated with 750 mg placebo/day for three weeks). Investigations were repeated at the end of three weeks. Licorice showed a significant reduction in serum insulin levels (p = 0.03). There was no significant change in any other clinical parameters either by licorice or placebo. Conclusively, licorice moderately improves serum insulin levels in patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. From our pilot study, the safety of licorice is confirmed at a dose of 750 mg/day. However, the study can be repeated at a higher dose to show its effectiveness and safety.","Devang, Nayana; Adhikari, Prabha; Nandini, M; Satyamoorthy, Kapaettu; Rai, Padmalatha S",,,124

METHODS: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google scholar were systematically searched to identify studies related to COVID-19 and the 2009 influenza pandemic. The pooled incidence rates of clinical features were estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. RESULTS: The incidence rates of fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia/muscle pain, or vomiting were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. The incidence rates of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease/hypertension and diabetes, were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. In contrast, comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza compared with COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the estimated rates of intensive care unit admission, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, treatment with antibiotics, and fatality were comparable between hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively estimated the differences and similarities of the clinical features and burdens of hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients.

457156,Activation and evasion of type I interferon responses by SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Legionellosis is a serious bacterial infection characterized by atypical pneumonia primarily due to infection with L. pneumophila, and bathing can be a potential cause of this infection. Legionellosis was first identified in 1977, and it is caused by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Legionella. Legionellosis remains an important public health threat, particularly in Japan, where the population is rapidly aging, thereby becoming more at risk for developing severe disease and accompanying life-threatening pneumonia. The bacteria are most commonly transmitted via the inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced and broadcast via water sprays, jets or mists. Infection can also occur via the aspiration of contaminated water or ice, or through inhalation of contaminated dust. Because the signs and symptoms of LD, as well as radiographic imaging are similar to pneumonia caused by other pathogens, a specific diagnostic test is required, such as a urine antigen detection test. Six clinical and laboratory parameters, a high body temperature, a non-productive cough, low serum sodium and platelet counts, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and c-reactive protein concentrations can be used to reliably predict the likelihood of LD. The first choices for chemotherapy are fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotic drugs. The main goals of LD prevention measures are 1) the prevention of microbial growth and biofilm formation, 2) the removal of all biofilm formed on equipment and in facilities, 3) minimizing aerosol splash and spread, and 4) minimizing bacterial contamination from external sources. It is apparent that, in Japan, where hot spring (onsen) bathing is common among aged people, strict regulations need to be in place - and enforced - to ensure that all Japanese onsens and spas provide a safe environment and undertake regular, effective infection control practices.","Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Takahashi, Kenzo; Crump, Andy",Intern. med.

The first reports of a new coronavirus came from China in December last year (in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province), where an outbreak of an infectious disease proceeded which was caused by a previously unknown virus. It turned out that the new virus is slightly different from other strains of coronaviruses, which are seasonal and year-round present in the structure of acute respiratory viral infections and cause damage to the upper respiratory tract of mild to moderate severity. The genetic sequence of COVID-19 is similar to the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV by 70%. People of all age categories are susceptible to this infection. The virus also spreads by airborne droplets as well as by contact with eyes, nose or mouth. The incubation period lasts from 2 to 14 days. An infected person can be contagious even during the incubation period. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the worldwide spread of COVID-19 coronavirus infection “can be described as a pandemic. Today, the number of countries (as well as autonomous territories) in which coronavirus is detected has reached 210.","Matnazarova, Gulbahor; Mirtazaev, Omonturdi; Bryantseva, Elena; Abdukakharova, Muattar; Nematova, Nigora; Khamzaeva, Nilufar",Int.

The mandatory remote working and the constant use of technology for employees raised different implications related to technostress and psycho-physical disorders. This study aimed to detect, in such a period of crisis and changes, the role of organizational communication considering the mediating role of both technostress and self-efficacy, with psycho-physical disorders as outcome. The research involved 530 workers working from home. A Structural Equations Model was estimated, revealing that organizational communication is positively associated with self-efficacy and negatively with technostress and psycho-physical disorders. As mediators, technostress is positively associated with psycho-physical disorders, whereas self-efficacy is negatively associated. As regards mediated effects, results showed negative associations between organizational communication and psycho-physical disorders through both technostress and self-efficacy. This study highlighted the potential protective role of organizational communication that could buffer the effect of technostress and enhance a personal resource, self-efficacy, which is functional to the reduction of psycho-physical disorders. This study contributed to literature underlying the role of communication in the current crisis and consequent reorganization of the working processes.","Zito, M.; Ingusci, E.; Cortese, C.

465883,Design of an epitope-based peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2: a vaccine-informatics approach,2020,"In 2019, COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, evolved into a pandemic which is still going on. The basic clinical symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are: fever, dry cough, fatigue, muscle pain, respiratory problems, and the loss of smell or taste. Other symptoms, including those related to hearing and balance organs (hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness), are reported less frequently by patients. They are especially rarely reported as the first symptoms of this infection. In order to answer the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause hearing and balance damage, the authors reviewed the literature sources from 2019-2020 included in EMBASE and PubMed, entering the following words: ""hearing loss,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""sensorineural hearing loss,"" ""vertigo,"" and ""dizziness."" Ultimately, 9 studies on the possible relationship between hearing impairment and SARS-CoV-2, and 4 studies on the possible relationship between damage to the balance and SARS-CoV-2, were qualified for the study. The results of the analysis suggest a possible relationship between COVID-19 and hearing loss, with no evidence of a similar relationship between this virus and the balance system. The possible existence of such a relationship should be especially remembered by hospital emergency room doctors, otolaryngologists and audiologists, especially as regards the possibility of a sudden sensironeural hearing loss as the first symptom of COVID-19. This also applies to doctors of other specialties. The authors indicate the need for further, intensive and multifaceted research on this issue.

Concerted leadership from administration provided a framework for this interaction to occur while faculty worked off-campus to address the many issues identified by the agricultural community, the industry sector, and other state agencies. During the onset period, much of our work was reactive; our efforts to address worker safety and health involved three primary areas within: 1) production agricultural workers, 2) produce growers and direct marketing enterprises, and 3) meat supply chain workers. Communication to target audiences relied upon our ability to convert face-to-face programming into virtual webinars, social media, and digital publications. A Food System Task Force mobilized specialists to address emerging issues, with one specific topic related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As we continue to face new seasons in agriculture production, and pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks within our state, we will continue to address the dynamic needs of our food supply systems. There are implications for how we will teach the agricultural workforce within a virtual platform, including the evaluation of the effectiveness of those training programs. There are renewed opportunities to integrate health and safety content into other Extension teams who conventionally focused on production practices and farm management topics.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: According to the specially designed form, a retrospective analysis of primary accounting documents was carried out (f. No. 103/o) in 158 patients with COVID-19. The research was carried out in specialized inpatient infectious diseases wards of health institutions of the Sumy region during the period from April to September 2020. The study used a systemic approach, bibliosemantic, comparative and statistical analyses, logical generalization methods. RESULTS: Results: Among the study group of patients, namely 158 people, a bigger number of women (56.33+/-3.95%) than men (43.67+/-3.95%) were recorded. Patients of working age (from 18 to 64 years old) took 70.89+/-3.61% of all patients, and people aged 65 years and older - 29.11+/-3.61%. The time from the beginning of symptoms to hospitalization in each second patient (49.37+/-3.98%) lasted 5-7 days. In most cases, the patient's stay in the hospital equaled 13-15 bed-days - 32.28+/-3.72%. The index of patients with severe and critical state was 20.89+/-3.23% (33 patients). In 8.23+/-2.19% (13 people) of treated cases of hospital stay ended in death. A large index of patients with a severe course of the disease, the treatment of which ended in discharge, were in hospital for more than 13 bed days - 12.03+/-2.59% (19 people). All of these patients were older, had CNCDs (chronic non-communicable diseases), half of them were hospitalized on day 7 and later from the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: In older people, the disease progresses faster and complications are developing more often. Also, the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pattern and the length of staying in the hospital are affected by the time starting the onset of symptoms till hospitalization and the presence of CNCDs. The hereinafter data allows to increase knowledge about spreading of COVID-19, to improve the quality of organizational and preventive events in the provision of medical care, and reducing mortality.","Dryha, N.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize the evidence on prevalence, incidence and mortality of delirium in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Pubmed and Embase from inception to December 1, 2020. Three independent reviewers evaluated study eligibility and data extraction, and assessed study quality. Outcomes were analyzed as proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also compared mortality differences in COVID-19 patients using odds ratio. RESULTS: In total, we identified 48 studies with 11,553 COVID-19 patients from 13 countries. Pooled prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 24.3% (95% CI: 19.4-29.6%), 32.4% (95% CI: 20.8-45.2%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 36.1-53.0%), respectively. For patients aged over 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 28.2% (95% CI: 23.5-33.1%), 25.2% (95% CI: 16.0-35.6%) and 48.4% (95% CI: 40.6-56.1%), respectively. For patients under 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 15.7% (95% CI: 9.2-23.6%), 71.4% (95% CI: 58.5-82.7%) and 21.2% (95% CI: 15.4-27.6%), respectively. Overall, COVID-19 patients with delirium suffered higher risk of mortality, compared to those without delirium (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.1-4.8). CONCLUSION: Delirium developed in almost 1 out of 3 COVID-19 patients, and was associated with 3-fold overall mortality. Our findings suggest that first-line healthcare providers should systematically assess delirium and monitor related symptoms among COVID-19 patients.","Shao, Shih-Chieh; Lai, Chien-Cheng; Chen, Yi-Hung; Chen, Yung-Chang; Hung, Ming-Jui; Liao, Shu-Chen",Age ageing,,124

Times of crisis can introduce novel dynamics that alter popular support for protective institutions, particularly among those who do not benefit from those protections. We explore this possibility in the context of Title IX's gender equality requirements and infrastructure to address sexual harassment in college sports. We conduct a large survey of college student-athletes to study their attitudes on these issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant financial challenges affecting college sports. We find that male student-athletes and those with sexist attitudes exhibit alarmingly low levels of support for ensuring the maintenance of equality and sexual harassment policy under Title IX during the COVID-19 crisis and eventual recovery.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to estimate VTE incidence in hospitalized patients and to analyze characteristic factors in the VTE cohort. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar using specified title search terms ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"" and ""venous thromboembolism"" and ""anticoagulation"" among others to identify peer-reviewed journal articles published between June 22, 2019, and June 22, 2020. Data were systematically extracted and synthesized using Microsoft Excel for analysis. The main outcome was VTE incidence, and measures included patient characteristics, anticoagulation, and clinical outcomes with assessment for associations. RESULTS: In total, 14 studies were included comprising 1677 patients. Most patients (n=1306, 82.4%) received anticoagulation (either VTE prophylaxis or treatment). VTE incidence was 26.9% (SE 3.1; 95% CI 20.8-33.1) and was correlated with systematic screening (r2=0.34, P=.03) and study duration (r2=-0.33, P=.03). D-dimer was higher for the VTE cohort (5.62 [SD 0.9] vs 1.43 [SD 0.6]; P<.001). Odds of VTE were higher at the intensive care unit (odds ratio [OR] 6.38, 95% CI 3.67-11.11; P<.001) but lower with anticoagulation (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.92; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the utilization of background anticoagulation, VTE incidence was historically high. Future studies are needed to provide additional data to guide optimal VTE prophylaxis and diagnostic strategies.","Birkeland, Kade; Zimmer, Raymond; Kimchi, Asher; Kedan, Ilan",Interact J Med Res,,124
485287,The Novel Insight of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Options,2020,"PURPOSE: With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, institutions were tasked with developing individualized pre-procedural testing strategies that allowed for re-initiation of elective procedures within national and state guidelines. This report describes the experience of a single US children's hospital (Children's Wisconsin, CW) in developing a universal pre-procedural COVID-19 testing protocol and reports early outcomes. METHODS: The CW pre-procedural COVID-19 response began with the creation of a multi-disciplinary taskforce that sought to develop a strategy for universal pre-procedural COVID-19 testing which (1) maximized patient safety, (2) prevented in-hospital viral transmission, (3) conserved resources, and (4) allowed for resumption of procedural care within institutional capacity. RESULTS: Of 11,209 general anesthetics performed at CW from March 16, 2020 to October 31, 2020, 11,150 patients (99.5%) underwent pre-procedural COVID-19 testing. Overall, 1.4% of pre-procedural patients tested positive for COVID-19. By June 2020, CW was operating at near-normal procedural volume and there were no documented cases of in-hospital viral transmission. Only 0.5% of procedures were performed under augmented COVID-19 precautions (negative pressure environment and highest-level personal protective equipment). CONCLUSION: CW successfully developed a multi-disciplinary pre-procedural COVID-19 testing protocol that enabled resumption of near-normal procedural volume within three months while limiting in-hospital viral transmission and resource use.","Bence, Christina M; Jarzembowski, Jason A; Belter, Lukas; Berens, Richard J; Henrickson, Kelly J; Hoffman, George M; Jackson, Felicia; Kehl, Karen Sue; Oldham, Keith T; Scott, John P; Tassone, J Channing; Woger, Nancy; Yale, Erin; Gourlay, David M",Pediatr Surg Int,,124

Objective: Our aim is to describe the results of the CancerMPact (CMP) survey performed in 2019 about the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma. Methods: CMP is a data source from Kantar, Health Division, containing data on cancer epidemiology and treatment. Once a year, Kantar performs a series of surveys with specialists in the field of interest in the United States of America (USA), Western Europe (WE), Japan, and China. The results of the survey reported in this work comprise the answers from 94 USA and 99 WE physicians about the treatment of melanoma. Results: In the first-line for the BRAF wild-type population, immuno-oncology (IO) drugs including nivolumab, ipilimumab or pembrolizumab (alone or in combination) were used in 80.1% of the cases in the USA and 70.6% in WE. Conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments were used in 16.4% of the USA patients and 28.2% in WE. In the second-line in the USA, 45.8% of BRAF wild-type patients received IO drugs, while 45.0% of patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments. The majority of patients with BRAF mutant advanced/metastatic melanoma were treated in the first-line with BRAF-targeted therapy (61.3% USA, 71.9% WE), and few patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments (11.9% USA, 12.4% WE); the most commonly used BRAF-targeted therapy was the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib. In the second-line, BRAF mutant patients received IO drugs (45.1% USA, 53.7% WE), targeted therapy (37.6% USA, 32% WE) or conventional chemotherapy/cytokine-based treatments (14.4% USA, 11.7% WE). Conclusion: The use of IO or targeted therapy for patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma is the preferred treatment strategy by physicians in the USA and WE based on BRAF mutation status. Many patients still receive conventional chemotherapies or cytokines with unsubstantial benefit, especially in recurrent patients of BRAF wild type.","Hawthorne, Stephanie; Zhao, Linda; Hanson, Madelyn; Kanas, Gena; Davis, Christine; Robinson, David; Turnure, Matthew; Clark, Otavio",Cancer Manag Res,,124

The aim of this work is to identify FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drugs with the potential for binding to the spike structural glycoprotein at the hinge site, receptor binding motif (RBM), and fusion peptide (FP) using molecular docking simulations. Drugs that bind to amino acids are crucial for conformational changes, receptor recognition, and fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane. The results revealed some drugs that bind to hinge site amino acids (varenicline, or steroids such as betamethasone while other drugs bind to crucial amino acids in the RBM (naldemedine, atovaquone, cefotetan) or FP (azilsartan, maraviroc, and difluprednate); saquinavir binds both the RBM and the FP. Therefore, these drugs could inhibit spike glycoprotein and prevent viral entry as possible anti-COVID-19 drugs. Several drugs are in clinical studies; by focusing on other pharmacological agents (candesartan, atovaquone, losartan, maviroc and ritonavir) in this work we propose an additional target: the spike glycoprotein.

Due to the time-consuming process of drug discovery, physicians have used readily available drugs and therapies for treatment of infections to minimize the death toll. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a snapshot analysis of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 Pakistani patients during the period from May to July 2020, when the first wave of COVID-19 peaked in Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to provide an overview of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the four major tertiary-care hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country (May-July 2020). RESULTS: Antibiotics were the most common choice out of all the therapies employed, and they were used as first line of treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin was the most prescribed drug for treatment. No monthly trend was observed in the choice of antibiotics, and these drugs appeared to be a random but favored choice throughout the months of the study. It was also noted that even antibiotics used for multidrug resistant infections were prescribed irrespective of the severity or progression of the infection. The results of the analysis are alarming, as this approach may lead to antibiotic resistance and complications in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. A total of 1562 patients (1064 male, 68.1%, and 498 female, 31.9%) with a mean age of 47.35 years (SD 17.03) were included in the study.

503215,Shortlisting SARS-CoV-2 Peptides for Targeted Studies from Experimental Data-Dependent Acquisition Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data,2020,"Attaining low resistivity AlGaN layers is the keystone to improve the efficiency of light emitting devices in the ultraviolet spectral range. Here, we present a microstructural analysis of Ge-doped AlGaN samples with Al mole fraction from x=0 to 1, and nominal doping level in the range of 1E20 cm-3, together with the measurement of Ge concentration and its spatial distribution down to the nm scale. AlGaN:Ge samples with x smaller or equal to 0.2 do not present any sign of inhomogeneity. However, samples with x>0.4 display micrometer-size Ge crystallites at the surface. Ge segregation is not restricted to the surface: Ge-rich regions with a size of tens of nanometers are observed inside the AlGaN:Ge layers, generally associated with Ga-rich regions around structural defects. With this local exceptions, the AlGaN:Ge matrix present an homogenous Ge composition which can be significantly lower than the nominal doping level. Precise measurements of Ge in the matrix provide a view of the solubility diagram of Ge in AlGaN as a function of the Al mole fraction. The solubility of Ge in AlN is extremely low. Between AlN and GaN, the solubility increases linearly with the Ga mole fraction in the ternary alloy, which suggests that the Ge incorporation takes place by substitution of Ga atoms only. The maximum percentage of Ga sites occupied by Ge saturates around 1%. The solubility issues and Ge segregation phenomena at different length scales likely play a role in the efficiency of Ge as n-type AlGaN dopant, even at Al concentrations where Ge DX centers are not expected to manifest. Therefore, this information can have direct impact in the performance of Ge-doped AlGaN light emitting diodes, particularly in the spectral range for disinfection (around 260 nm), which requires heavily-doped alloys with high Al mole fraction.","Bougerol, C.; Robin, E.; Russo, E.

A total of 2509 people participated in a two-phase study: 1424 participants in the first phase (March 12-21) and 1085 participants in the second phase (April 23 to May 5). Age was categorized into 4 groups: age 18 to 30, age 31 to 40, age 41 to 50, and age 51 and over. In the first and second phase, compliance with health guidelines was highest among participants over the age of 50. Knowledge was significantly higher in the second phase than in the first among participants over age 50 and those between the ages of 40 and 50. In the second phase, knowledge did not differ by age group. Negative emotional reactions were significantly higher in the first phase than in the second. Moreover, negative emotional reactions were higher among participants up to age 30 than among all other participants. Perceived susceptibility did not differ by phase or by age group. The paper underscores the impact of age during the COVID-19 epidemic and points to the necessity of taking the needs of different age groups into consideration.","Levkovich, Inbar",J Prim Care Community Health,,124

In this paper, we review current and potential approaches to this critical role of the FDA. The FDA has established pathways to accelerate vaccine availability prior to approval, such as emergency use authorization, and to channel resources to high-priority products and allow more flexibility in the evidence required for approval, including accelerated approval based on surrogate markers of effectiveness. Among the 35 new vaccines approved in the US from 2006-2020, about two-thirds of their pivotal trials used the surrogate outcome of immune system response, and just one-third evaluated actual disease incidence. Post-approval safety surveillance of new vaccines-particularly vaccines receiving expedited approval-is crucial. Currently this is accomplished through such mechanisms as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the CDC Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project. Adverse events detected in this way may lead to changes in a vaccine's recommended use or its withdrawal from the market. Regulatory oversight of new vaccines will have to balance speed with rigor and decisiveness to effectively address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Besides the common video and audio sensors, the system also includes a thermal infrared camera, which is shown to be a feasible solution to the drone detection task. Even with slightly lower resolution, the performance is just as good as a camera in visible range. The detector performance as a function of the sensor-to-target distance is also investigated. In addition, using sensor fusion, the system is made more robust than the individual sensors, helping to reduce false detections. To counteract the lack of public datasets, a novel video dataset containing 650 annotated infrared and visible videos of drones, birds, airplanes and helicopters is also presented. The database is complemented with an audio dataset of the classes drones, helicopters and background noise.","Svanstrom, Fredrik; Englund, Cristofer; Alonso-Fernandez, Fernando",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07396v1.pdf,124

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p < 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p < 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","Yin, Xi; Min, Xiangde; Nan, Yan; Feng, Zhaoyan; Li, Basen; Cai, Wei; Xi, Xiaoqing; Wang, Liang",Korean J Radiol,,124

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-induced liver injury must not be ignored, as it is observed in one fifth of infected patients.

590307,Antiviral Activity of Metabolites from Peruvian Plants against SARS-CoV-2: An In Silico Approach,2021-06-25,"Background Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently have hematologic derangements prompting specialty consultation. Management of such derangements remain complicated by a nascent evidence base. Our primary objective was to identify the main reasons for hematology consultation in patients with COVID-19 at a university medical center in New York City during the initial peak of the pandemic in 2020. We sought to determine the hematologic parameters that may affect patient outcomes and to provide recommendations to improve clinical practice. Methods We completed an observational study of consecutive hematology consultations requested between March 16 and April 27, 2020, for adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to a university medical center. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. Using the electronic medical record, we collected demographic information, reasons for consultation, laboratory parameters relevant to hematology, diagnoses, recommendations, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for data analysis. Results A total of 74 hematology consultations for unique patients were completed during the 6-week study period. The most frequent reason for consultation was for anticoagulation recommendations in the setting of suspected or confirmed acute thrombosis (46%), followed by requests for management advice regarding cytopenias (24%) and other laboratory abnormalities including elevated D-dimer and thrombocytosis (22%). As shown in Table 1, the observed rate of acute thrombosis (35 events in 31 patients, 41% of study population) did not fully account for the observed rate of therapeutic anticoagulation use (55 patients, 74% of study population). Only 5 of 25 patients without diagnosed thrombosis who received therapeutic anticoagulation during admission had a confirmed prior indication for anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Objectively documented VTE (15 events in 15 patients) was the most common type of thrombosis, followed by thrombotic occlusion of continuous renal replacement (CRRT) circuits (14 events in 14 patients). Two cases of cutaneous thrombosis were also observed, identified on biopsies of retiform purpuric lesions. Unfractionated heparin was the most frequently utilized parenteral agent for therapeutic anticoagulation. Interestingly, a significant number of patients received argatroban (22 patients), despite a comparably low rate of evaluation for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (10 patients tested). Occluded CRRT circuits accounted for the majority of argatroban use (12 patients), followed by thrombocytopenia (10 patients), including 3 of the 4 patients without thrombosis who received argatroban. Patients objectively diagnosed with acute thromboses had higher levels of D-dimer (median 1166 ng/mL) and ferritin (1420 ng/mL) at initial admission relative to patients without thromboses (median 792 ng/mL and 918 ng/mL, respectively). Notable differences in peak D-dimer (median 7756 ng/mL vs 3399 ng/mL) and fibrinogen nadir (258 mg/dL vs 454 mg/dL) were also observed. Statistical analysis via Wilcoxon rank sum test (p-values reported) corroborated the presence of differences in the distribution of laboratory values between the two groups. Acute thrombosis was also associated with a lower rate of hospital discharge and a higher rate of mortality during the study period (Table 1). Conclusions Hematologic consultation patterns during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City were characterized by frequent requests for assistance with anticoagulation management, further corroborated by a high incidence of acute thrombotic events. The early suspicion of thrombosis and laboratory derangements on hospital admission appeared to drive widespread use of empiric anticoagulation. Atypical events like CRRT circuit occlusions and concurrent hematologic abnormalities like thrombocytopenia likely underlie the notable use of argatroban in this cohort. These observations underscore the importance of prospective randomized controlled studies to address anticoagulation strategies and routine hematologic laboratory monitoring in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

We analysed information on the cases of infection to infer whether airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, had occurred between cabins. We infer from our analysis that most infections in passengers started on 28 January and were completed by 6 February, except in those who shared a cabin with another infected passenger. The distribution of the infected cabins was random, and no spatial cluster of the infected can be identified. We infer that the ship's central air-conditioning system for passenger's cabins did not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, i.e. airborne transmission did not occur between cabins during the outbreak, suggesting that the sufficient ventilation was provided. We also infer that the ship's cabin drainage system did not play a role. Most transmission appears to have occurred in the public areas of the cruise ship, likely due to crowding and insufficient ventilation in some of these areas.","Xu, Pengcheng; Jia, Wei; Qian, Hua; Xiao, Shenglan; Miao, Te; Yen, Hui-Ling; Tan, Hongwei; Kang, Min; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Li, Yuguo",Build Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132321002456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107839; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321002456?v=s5,124
590511,Exploring the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins for multi-epitope vaccine development: an in-silico approach,2020-09-09,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus classified into four serotypes (DENV-1-4) that causes Dengue fever (DF), Dengue hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue shock syndrome (DSS). An estimated 390 million people are at risk for infection with DENV and there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We utilized RNA chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with DENV-2 RNA. We identified ERI3 (also PRNPIP and PINT1), a putative 3′–5′ RNA exonuclease, which preferentially associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA via interactions with dumbbell structures in the 3′ UTR. ERI3 is required for accumulation of DENV-2 genomic RNA and production of infectious particles. Furthermore, the mosquito homologue of ERI3 is required for DENV-2 replication in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitos implying that the requirement for ERI3 is conserved in both DENV hosts. In human cells ERI3 localizes to the Golgi in uninfected cells, but relocalizes near sites of DENV-2 replication in infected cells. ERI3 is not required for maintaining DENV-2 RNA stability or translation of the viral polyprotein, but is required for viral RNA synthesis. Our results define a specific role for ERI3 and highlight the importance of Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication.","Ward, Alex Michael; Calvert, Meredith E.

SARS-CoV-2 exhibited efficient person-to-person transmission of what became labeled as COVID-19. It has spread worldwide with over 83,000,000 infected cases and more than 1,800,000 deaths to date (December 31, 2020). This research proposes a statistical monitoring scheme in which an optimized np control chart is utilized by sentinel metropolitan airports worldwide for early detection of coronavirus and other respiratory virus outbreaks. The sample size of this chart is optimized to ensure the best overall performance for detecting a wide range of shifts in the infection rate, based on the available resources, such as the inspection rate and the allowable false alarm rate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimized np chart is compared with that of the traditional np chart with a predetermined sample size under both sampling inspection and 100% inspection. For a variety of scenarios including a real case, the optimized np control chart is found to substantially outperform its traditional counterpart in terms of the average number of infections. Therefore, this control chart has potential to be an effective tool for early detection of respiratory virus outbreaks, promoting early outbreak investigation and mitigation.","Haridy, Salah; Maged, Ahmed; Baker, Arthur W.; Shamsuzzaman, Mohammad; Bashir, Hamdi; Xie, Min",Comput Ind Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33746343/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036083522100139X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2021.107235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036083522100139X?v=s5,124
591406,SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated at high temperature,2021-02-03,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Different species can harbor coronavirus, including domestic and wild animals. The Coroviridae family is composed of four genera, including Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Some domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in natural and experimental infections. The infection of animals is generally a consequence of close contact with COVID-19 patients. Among domestic animals, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in respiratory ex vivo organ cultures of domestic ruminants. In this context, there is no information about the role sheep can play in the spread of the infection. This study tested the antibody response in 90 serum samples from sheep from the pre-pandemic period and 336 serum samples from sheep from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed were seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first serosurvey in sheep to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Future investigations should analyze the epidemiological role of sheep in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the prevalence of infection. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the zoonotic causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a pandemic situation with millions of infected humans worldwide. Among domestic animals, there have been limited studies regarding the transmissibility and exposure to the infection in natural conditions. Some animals are exposed and/or susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cats, ferrets and dogs. By contrast, there is no information about the susceptibility of ruminants to SARS-CoV-2. This study tested the antibody response in 90 ovine pre-pandemic serum samples and 336 sheep serum samples from the pandemic period (June 2020 to March 2021). In both cases, the animals were in close contact with a veterinary student community composed of more than 700 members. None of the serum samples analyzed was seroreactive based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. In this sense, no statistical difference was observed compared to the pre-pandemic sheep.

Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (dWS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The dWS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 °C and overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate and reliable digital quantification of SARS-CoV-2. By targeting SARS-CoV-2's nucleoprotein gene, the dWS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/μl SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples. Moreover, it has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without RNA extraction. Thus, the dWS-CRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection toward digitized quantification.","Ding, Xiong; Yin, Kun; Li, Ziyue; Sfeir, Maroun M.; Liu, Changchun",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878591/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566321002554; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113218; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566321002554,124

Methods Retrospective cohort study that included 179 consecutive inpatients with COVID-19 who underwent clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiography at 10 sites in the Mayo Clinic Health System between March 10 and August 5, 2020. Echocardiography was performed at bedside by cardiac sonographers according to an abbreviated protocol. Echocardiographic results, demographics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were analysed. Results Of the 179 patients, age 59.8± 16.9 years and 108 (60%) men, events within 30 days occurred in 70 (39%) patients including prolonged hospitalization in 43 (24%) and death in 27 (15%). Echocardiographic abnormalities included left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% in 29 (16%), regional wall motion abnormalities in 26 (15%), and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) >35 mm Hg in 44 (25%). Myocardial injury, defined as the presence of significant troponin elevation accompanied by new ventricular dysfunction or electrocardiographic abnormalities, was present in 13 (7%). Prior echocardiography was available in 36 (20%) and pre-existing abnormalities were seen in 28 (78%) of these. In a multivariable age-adjusted model, AUC 0.81, prior cardiovascular disease, troponin, D-dimer, and RVSP were related to events at 30 days. Conclusion Bedside Doppler assessment of RVSP appears promising for short-term risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing clinically indicated echocardiography. Pre-existing echocardiographic abnormalities were common; caution should be exercised in attributing such abnormalities to the COVID-19 infection in this comorbid patient population.","Krishna, Hema; Ryu, Alexander J.; Scott, Christopher G.; Mandale, Deepa R.; Naqvi, Tasneem Z.; Pellikka, Patricia A.",Mayo Clin Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619621000422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714597/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619621000422?v=s5,124

The results were assessed and compared with those of conventionally processed samples. A variety of infectious agents, some with a potential for bioterrorism, and liver biopsies serving as an example for routine histopathology samples were studied. The samples represented virus-producing cell cultures (such as SARS-coronavirus, West Nile virus, Orthopox virus), bacteria suspensions (cultures of Escherichia coli and genetically knockout apathogenic Bacillus anthracis), suspensions of parasites (malaria Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, Microsporidia cuniculi, Caenorhabditis elegans), and whole Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with microsporidia. Fresh liver samples and infected flies were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative by microwaving (20 min), all other samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde or Karnovsky-fixative overnight or longer. Subsequently, all samples were divided to evaluate alternative processing protocols: one part of the sample was OsO(4)-postfixed, ethanol-dehydrated, Epon-infiltrated (overnight) in an automated tissue processor (LYNX, Leica), and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h; in parallel the other part was microwave-assisted processed in the bench microwave device (REM, Milestone), including post-osmication and the resin block polymerization. The microwave-assisted processing protocol required at minimum 3 h 20 min: the respective epon resin blocks were uniformly polymerized allowing an easy sectioning of semi- and ultrathin sections. Sections collected on non-coated 200 mesh grids were stable in the electron beam and showed an excellent preservation of the ultrastructure and high contrast, thus allowing an easy, unequivocal and rapid assessment of specimens. Compared with conventional routine methods, microwave technology facilitates a significant reduction in sample processing time from days to hours without any loss in ultrastructural details. Microwave-assisted processing could, therefore, be a substantial benefit for the routine electron microscopic diagnostic workload. Due to its speed and robust performance it could be applied wherever a rapid electron microscopy diagnosis is required, e.g., if bioterrorism or emerging agents are suspected. Combining microwave technology with digital image acquisition, the 1-day diagnosis based on ultrathin section electron microscopy will become possible, with crucial or interesting findings being consulted or shared worldwide with experts using modern telemicroscopy tools via Internet.","Schroeder, Josef A.; Gelderblom, Hans R.; Hauroeder, Baerbel; Schmetz, Christel; Milios, Jim; Hofstaedter, Ferdinand",Micron,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968432805002015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968432805002015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16843832/,124

594655,An electrochemical biosensor for sensitive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA,2021-08-15,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over half a billion people worldwide. Series report that up to 75% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receive broad-spectrum antibiotics;however, the incidence of bacterial coinfection is consistently reported to be low. The diagnosis of bacterial superinfection of the lungs (BSL) is clinical, which presents the possibility of overdiagnosis and overutilization of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of patients who were treated for a bacterial superinfection of the lungs (BSL) compared to those who were not. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized at our center. We defined BSL as a documented episode of pneumonia treated with antibiotics. We collected information on demographics, comorbidities, and microbiological markers. We compared patients with and without a diagnosis of BSL in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, intubation, length on mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay (LOS) and 7-day and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-two patients had a diagnosis of COVID-19, of which 105 had BSL. Patients with BSL were older compared to those without BSL (mean age 74 vs 70 years) and more likely to be male (57% vs 47%), but they were similar in proportion of White patients (64 vs 63.6) and Charlson comorbidity index (5 vs 4). Patients with BSL had a higher likelihood of admission to the ICU (63% vs 19%) and higher intubation rates (31% vs 9%). BSL patients had longer mechanical ventilation (9 vs 3 days) and greater length of stay (13 vs 7). Only 17 BSL patients had sputum cultures, of which 10 were positive. None of the BSL patients had a positive Legionella urinary antigen or Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen, and only 6/57 (10.5%) had a positive MRSA nasal screen. Seven-day and 30-day mortality were not statistically different between BSL and non-BSL patients (p=0.18, p=0.65 respectively). Interestingly, Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, CCI and ICU stay yielded a significantly reduced mortality at 7 and 30-day among BSL patients (HR=0.2 CI [.1-0.7], p=.0106, HR=0.5 [CI.3-0.8], p=0.0101, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BSL received more intense supportive care, and had a longer ICU stay, yet did not have a greater mortality. When adjusting for age, sex, race, CCI and ICU, there was a significant reduction in mortality. It is tempting to interpret these finding as an effect of antibiotics;however, we did not record COVID-19-specific treatments such as steroids, tocilizumab and remdesivir. It is likely that the BSL patients received more steroids, which have been associated with reduced mortality. In our population, microbiological testing was performed in a minority of patients, and it was therefore not a reliable marker of true infection. It is possible that many patients in the BSL group did not truly have a bacterial infection. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Patients with a diagnosis of BSL were sicker, but we observed no difference in unadjusted mortality. Studies on the outcomes of the BSL among COVID-19 patients should account for the effect of concurrent COVID-19 specific therapy.

We studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in healthcare workers (HCW) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and compared to them to antibody responses of HCW who were IgG negative to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. HCW with prior COVID-19 showed clear secondary antibody responses to vaccination with IgG spike binding titers rapidly increasing by 7 days and peaking by days 10 and 14 post-vaccination. At all time points tested, HCW with prior COVID-19 infection showed statistically significant higher antibody titers of binding and functional antibody compared to HCW without prior COVID-19 infection (p<.0001for each of the time points tested). In times of vaccine shortage, and until correlates of protection are identified, our findings preliminarily suggest the following strategy as more evidence-based: a) a single dose of vaccine for patients already having had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; and b) patients who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 can be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.","Saadat, S.; Rikhtegaran-Tehrani, Z.; Logue, J.; Newman, M.; Frieman, M.

Methods: We identified the 250 most-viewed videos from 1 January 2020 to 12 May 2020 on YouTube using keyword ‘COVID 19’. Two independent reviewers analyzed the English-language videos as useful, misleading, or news updates. Result: After excluding non-English and irrelevant videos, 100 videos were analyzed. Forty-four videos were classified as useful, 33 videos were classified as news updates, and 23 videos were classified as misleading. Independent users had five times increased odds of posting misleading videos (40% vs. 12%, OR = 5.05, 95% CI = 1.84–13.9, P = 0.001), whereas news agencies have 2.8 greater odds of posting useful or update videos (87% vs 44%, OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 0.959–8.45, P = 0.087).

Physical distancing, social isolation, and school closures create challenges for adolescents as they navigate increasing independence from caregivers and more intimate relationships with peers. The challenges related to the ongoing pandemic are exacerbated for queer and trans youth as they negotiate their sexuality and gender identit(ies) in addition to typical developmental activities. Simultaneously, social work practices that provide critical and lifesaving support for queer and trans youth have been hindered by the closures and other pandemic-related changes to schools and community programs. We present this reflexive essay to deconstruct the notion of a shared experience during this pandemic and elevate the voices of queer and trans youth during this unprecedented moment in time. Through engagement with a small, local group of queer and trans youth, we share the challenges they are facing–particularly the consequences of social isolation and lack of identity-affirming support caused by physical distancing measures. We end by sharing their ideas for social work practice and how they can best be supported during this time.

In the current review, scientific literature including original research articles, clinical studies, epidemiological reports, and review-type articles concerning human intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the possible consequences on the microbiota were reviewed. Moreover, the following aspects pertaining to COVID-19 have also been discussed: transmission, resistance in the human body, the impact of nutritional status in relation to the intestinal microbiota, and the impact of comorbid metabolic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), obesity, and type two diabetes (T2D). The articles investigated show that health, age, and nutritional status are associated with specific communities of bacterial species in the gut, which could influence the clinical course of COVID-19 infection. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Patients suffering from metabolic and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are thought to be at a moderate-to-high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating the direct implication of gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 severity.

As pathogens and pollutants have been found in surgical smoke, we examined the potential for aerosol escape during transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) which may be particularly important given the presence of faecal contamination in the operative workspace and the specifics of its access platforms. METHODS: Both qualitative (thermographic imaging) and quantificative (particle counting) methods were used to assess for aerosol release during TAMIS in comparison to laparoscopic operations of similar duration and equipment both at times of surgical dissection and without. TAMIS was performed using a Gelport Path Device (Applied Medical) and Airseal insufflation with valveless trocar (ConMed). RESULTS: Significant carbon dioxide (CO(2)) escapes during TAMIS carrying with it considerable numbers of particles. In general, particle counts were low prior to tissue dissection phases of the operation but increased substantially (25 × 10(6)/m(3) or over 40× background counts) during hook cautery dissection. The majority of particles were in the 0.3–0.5 micron range (where counts were increased relative to background between 42× and 65) with the highest relative increase versus background in the 0.5–1.0 micron range. Particle counts < 5 were substantially greater during the TAMIS procedure versus laparoscopic procedures (a laparoscopic-assisted parastomal hernia repair and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) employing similar tools. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable amounts of particle-rich aerosols escape during TAMIS procedures. Although pathogens are not proven to definitely spread to healthcare staff by such material nebulisation, N95/FFP2 masks, at a minimum, seem prudent while other methods evolve to eliminate this risk.

Clinical data shows a disturbed type I interferon (IFN) response during the virus infection. In this study, we discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in the inhibition of interferon beta (IFN-β) production. N protein repressed IFN-β production induced by poly(I:C) or upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection. We noted that N protein also suppressed IFN-β production, induced by several signaling molecules downstream of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, which is the crucial pattern recognition receptor (PRR) responsible for identifying RNA viruses. Moreover, our data demonstrated that N protein interacted with the RIG-I protein through the DExD/H domain, which has ATPase activity and plays an important role in the binding of immunostimulatory RNAs. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 N protein suppresses the IFN-β response through targeting the initial step, potentially the cellular PRR–RNA-recognition step in the innate immune pathway. Therefore, we propose that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein represses IFN-β production by interfering with RIG-I.","Chen, Keli; Xiao, Feng; Hu, Dingwen; Ge, Weiwei; Tian, Mingfu; Wang, Wenbiao; Pan, Pan; Wu, Kailang; Wu, Jianguo",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13010047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33396605/,124

The study surveyed health workers (physicians, pharmacists and nurses) who worked during peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Serbia in June and November 2020. The Maslach Burnout Survey for Medical Personnel addresses three scales: (a) emotional exhaustion (EE) measures feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one’s work; (b) depersonalization (DP) measures an unfeeling and impersonal response toward recipients of one’s service, care treatment, or instruction; and (c) personal accomplishment (PA) measures feelings of competence and successful achievement in one’s work. Linear regression and the chi-square test were used to test a relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). We can conclude that most health workers had a high degree of emotional exhaustion, but also a low degree of depersonalization and a high degree of sense of personal achievement.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of the first cohort of patients with COVID-19 symptoms in a virtual clinic. The main end points of this study were visit volume, wait times, visit duration, patient diagnosis, prescriptions received, and satisfaction. Of the 1139 total virtual visits, 212 (24.6%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms. The average wait time (SD) for all visits was 75.5 (121.6) minutes. The average visit duration for visits was 10.5 (4.9) minutes. The highest volume of virtual visits was on Saturdays (39), and the lowest volume was on Friday (19). Patients experienced shorter wait times (SD) on the weekdays 67.1 (106.8) minutes compared to 90.3 (142.6) minutes on the weekends. The most common diagnoses for patients with COVID-19 symptoms were upper respiratory infection. Patient wait times for a telehealth visit varied depending on the time and day of appointment.

Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted among 874 HCWs from nine hospitals. Demographics, health information, and blood samples were obtained at baseline (first wave—April–May 2020) and at follow-up (n = 373) (second wave—September–November 2020). Sero-positivity was determined based on the detection of total antibodies to the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2, using electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Results: The sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.1% [95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.6–2.1] at baseline and 8.3% (95% CI 5.9–11.6) at follow-up. The sero-conversion of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody was 6.9% (95% CI 4.7–9.9) during the study period. The increase in SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence paralleled the rise in PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among the HCWs across the country. The likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was higher in males vs. females [odds ratio (OR) 2.52 (95% CI 1.05–6.06)] and in nurses vs. physicians [OR 4.26 (95% CI 1.08–16.77)] and was associated with being quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19 patients [OR 3.54 (95% CI 1.58–7.89)] and having a positive PCR result [OR 109.5 (95% CI 23.88–502.12)]. Conclusions: A significant increase in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found among HCWs between the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Israel. Nonetheless, the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remains low, similar to the general population. Our findings reinforce the rigorous infection control policy, including quarantine, and utilization of personal protective equipment that should be continued together with COVID-19 immunization in HCWs and the general population.","Muhsen, Khitam; Schwaber, Mitchell J.; Bishara, Jihad; Kassem, Eias; Atamna, Alaa; Na'amnih, Wasef; Goren, Sophy; Bialik, Anya; Mohsen, Jameel; Zaide, Yona; Hazan, Nimrod; Ariel-Cohen, Ortal; Cohen, Regev; Shitrit, Pnina; Marchaim, Dror; Benenson, Shmuel; Ben-David, Debby; Rubinovitch, Bina; Gotessman, Tamar; Nutman, Amir; Wiener-Well, Yonit; Maor, Yasmin; Carmeli, Yehuda; Cohen, Dani",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.689994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249979/,124
600581,Characterization of monoclonal antibody against SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid antigen and development of an antigen capture ELISA,2005-04-19,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from previous virus epidemics has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size ≥30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25–51), 38% (95% CI = 24–52), and 48% (95% CI = 11–85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance. Additionally, the quality of included studies to date has been variable, and ongoing surveillance is essential.","Liu, Chaomeng; Pan, Weigang; Li, Li; Li, Bing; Ren, Yanping; Ma, Xin",J Psychosom Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399921001616?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110516; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399921001616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023580/,124

This protein has been shown to play an important role for several viruses. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through plasma membrane fusion and/or endosomal entry upon availability of proteases. However, the whole process is not fully understood yet and additional viral/host factors might be required for viral fusion and subsequent viral replication. Here, we report a novel interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) and the cholesterol transporter NPC1. Furthermore, we have found that some compounds reported to interact with NPC1, carbazole SC816 and sulfides SC198 and SC073, were able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection with a good selectivity index in human cell infection models. These findings suggest the importance of NPC1 for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and a new possible potential therapeutic target to fight against COVID-19.","García-Dorival, Isabel; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Galindo, Inmaculada; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Urquiza, Jesús; Puerto, Ana del; Campillo, Nuria E.; Martínez, Ana; Gastaminza, Pablo; Gil, Carmen; Alonso, Covadonga",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354221001571?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450201/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354221001571,124

The purpose of this study was to compare the number of postoperative visits in WC to non-WC patients after common upper extremity surgical procedures. Methodology All patients who underwent one of four common surgical procedures (carpal tunnel release, De Quervain’s release, cubital tunnel release, and trigger finger release) between 2016 and 2019 were identified. A total of 64 surgeries billed under WC were randomly selected and matched 1:1 to surgeries billed outside of WC based on the primary CPT code. Results The most common procedure was carpal tunnel release (42 patients), followed by trigger finger release (30 patients), cubital tunnel release (28 patients), and De Quervain’s release (16 patients). The average number of postoperative visits was 2.3 (median = 2, range: 1-9) and was significantly higher in the WC group (mean/median = 3.0/3 versus 1.5/1, p < 0.001). Within the 90-day global postoperative billing period, the mean number of visits was 2.2 (median = 2, range: 1-4) in the WC group and 1.4 (median = 1, range: 1-3) in the non-WC group (p < 0.001). The average time to clinical discharge in the WC group was 101 days (range: 10-446 days), and in the non-WC group was 40 days (range: 7-474 days) (p < 0.001). Five patients (7.8%) in the WC group and four patients (6.3%) in the non-WC group were seen for unplanned visits after clinical discharge. Conclusions WC status conferred more postoperative visits after common upper extremity surgical procedures, both within and beyond the global billing period.

Objective To examine phenotypes of symptomatology and their relationship with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses. Methods An observational study was performed of adults (≥18 years) from 5 US states. Participants completed an electronic survey and underwent testing to anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein IgG antibody between May-July 2020. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify characteristic symptom clusters. Results Overall, 9,507 adults (mean±SD age: 39.6±15.0 years) completed the survey; 6,665 (70.1%) underwent antibody testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were associated with self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab (bivariable logistic regression; OR [CI95]: 5.98 [4.83, 7.41]), household with ≥6 members (1.27 [1.14, 1.41]) and sick contact (3.65 [3.19, 4.17]), and older age (50-69 years: 1.55 [1.37, 1.76]); ≥70 years: 1.52 [1.16, 1.99]), but inversely associated with female sex (0.61 [0.55, 0.68]). Latent class analysis revealed 8 latent classes of symptoms. Latent classes-1 (all symptoms) and 4 (fever, cough, muscle ache, anosmia, dysgeusia, and headache) were associated with the highest proportion (62.0% and 57.4%) of positive antibodies, whereas classes-6 (fever, cough, muscle ache, headache) and 8 (anosmia, dysgeusia) had intermediate proportions (48.2% and 40.5%), and classes-3 (headache, diarrhea, stomach pain) and 7 (no symptoms) had the lowest proportion (7.8% and 8.5%) of positive antibodies.

We made the following findings: 1) LPC increases nuclear localization of procaspase-1 in HAECs. 2) Nuclear pro-caspase-1 exports back to the cytosol, which is facilitated by a leptomycin B-inhibited mechanism. 3) Increased nuclear localization of pro-caspase-1 by a new NES peptide inhibitor upregulates inflammatory genes in oxidative stress and Th17 pathways; and SUMO activator N106 enhances nuclear localization of pro-caspase-1 and caspase-1 activation (p20) in the nucleus. 4) LPC plus caspase-1 enzymatic inhibitor upregulates inflammatory genes with hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia and interferon pathways, suggesting a novel capsase-1 enzyme-independent inflammatory mechanism. 5) LPC in combination with NES inhibitor and caspase-1 inhibitor upregulate inflammatory gene expression that regulate Th17 activation, endotheli-1 signaling, p38-, and ERK- MAPK pathways. To examine two hallmarks of endothelial activation such as secretomes and membrane protein signaling, LPC plus NES inhibitor upregulate 57 canonical secretomic genes and 76 exosome secretomic genes, respectively, promoting four pathways including Th17, IL-17 promoted cytokines, interferon signaling and cholesterol biosynthesis. LPC with NES inhibitor also promote inflammation via upregulating ROS promoter CYP1B1 and 11 clusters of differentiation (CD) membrane protein pathways. Mechanistically, all the LPC plus NES inhibitor-induced genes are significantly downregulated in CYP1B1-deficient microarray, suggesting that nuclear caspase-1-induced CYP1B1 promotes strong inflammation. These transcriptomic results provide novel insights on the roles of nuclear caspase-1 in sensing DAMPs, inducing ROS promoter CYP1B1 and in regulating a large number of genes that mediate HAEC activation and inflammation. These findings will lead to future development of novel therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), inflammations, infections, transplantation, autoimmune disease and cancers.

605464,"An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and multiple endemic, epidemic and bat coronavirus",2020-03-20,"Category A arenaviruses as defined by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are human pathogens that could be weaponized by bioterrorists. Many of these deadly viruses require biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment for all laboratory work, which limits traditional laboratory high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of small molecule inhibitors. For those reasons, a related BSL-2 New World arenavirus, Tacaribe virus, 67–78% identical to Junín virus at the amino acid level, was used in a HTS campaign where approximately 400,000 small molecule compounds were screened in a Tacaribe virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Compounds identified in this screen showed antiviral activity and specificity against not only Tacaribe virus, but also the Category A New World arenaviruses (Junín, Machupo, and Guanarito). Drug resistant variants were isolated, suggesting that these compounds act through inhibition of a viral protein, the viral glycoprotein (GP2), and not through cellular toxicity mechanisms. A lead compound, ST-294, has been chosen for drug development. This potent and selective compound, with good bioavailability, demonstrated protective anti-viral efficacy in a Tacaribe mouse challenge model. This series of compounds represent a new class of inhibitors that may warrant further development for potential inclusion in a strategic stockpile.","Bolken, Tove′ C.; Laquerre, Sylvie; Zhang, Yuanming; Bailey, Thomas R.; Pevear, Daniel C.; Kickner, Shirley S.; Sperzel, Lindsey E.; Jones, Kevin F.; Warren, Travis K.; Amanda Lund, S.; Kirkwood-Watts, Dana L.; King, David S.; Shurtleff, Amy C.; Guttieri, Mary C.; Deng, Yijun; Bleam, Maureen; Hruby, Dennis E.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16343651/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635420500238X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635420500238X,124

The development of decision support tools for real-time clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is of prime importance to assist patients’ triage and allocate resources for patients at risk. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 2 to June 15, 2020, clinical patterns of COVID-19 suspected patients at admission to the EDs of Liège University Hospital, consisting in the recording of eleven symptoms (i.e. dyspnoea, chest pain, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, dry cough, wet cough, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fever and anosmia) plus age and gender, were investigated during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Indeed, 573 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by qRT-PCR before mid-June 2020, and 1579 suspected cases that were subsequently determined to be qRT-PCR negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, two most relevant symptoms of COVID-19 were identified in addition of the age of the patient, i.e. fever (odds ratio [OR] = 3.66; 95% CI: 2.97–4.50), dry cough (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.39–2.12), and patients older than 56.5 y (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.67–2.58). Two additional symptoms (chest pain and sore throat) appeared significantly less associated to the confirmed COVID-19 cases with the same OR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56–0.94). An overall pondered (by OR) score (OPS) was calculated using all significant predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68–0.73) rendering the use of the OPS to discriminate COVID-19 confirmed and unconfirmed patients. The main predictors were confirmed using both sensitivity analysis and classification tree analysis. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the OPS and the cycle threshold (Ct values) of the qRT-PCR. CONCLUSION AND MAIN SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed approach allows for the use of an interactive and adaptive clinical decision support tool. Using the clinical algorithm developed, a web-based user-interface was created to help nurses and clinicians from EDs with the triage of patients during the second COVID-19 wave.","Saegerman, Claude; Gilbert, Allison; Donneau, Anne-Françoise; Gangolf, Marjorie; Diep, Anh Nguvet; Meex, Cécile; Bontems, Sébastien; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; D’Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705435/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247773,124

To date, there has been considerable progress in the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of breast cancer, which has led to the development of targeted agents. Despite this, eventually all patients with metastatic disease will receive single-agent or combination chemotherapy either to control spread or as a palliative measure. Currently, combinations of targeted agents and chemotherapy are under investigation, thereby indicating that chemotherapeutic agents will continue to be the backbone of future breast cancer therapy.

Participants who had attended a lecture on coronavirus, had a higher level of education, worked in a medical field, lived in urban area, or resided in Amman or northern Jordan had fewer misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (2.64, 2.34, 2.33, 2.50 and 2.50 versus 2.53, 2.73, 2.72, 2.64, and 2.66, respectively, P < 0.001). The use of social media appeared to be an important factor influencing the likelihood of false beliefs (2.61 versus 2.38, P < 0.001). Understanding of the factors influencing public perceptions surrounding the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic will help public health authorities improve public understanding and compliance with public health recommendations directed at combatting the virus, including the use of surgical masks, thorough handwashing, and avoiding close contact. These messages will be better received by the public through correcting misconceptions surrounding COVID-19.","Hammad, Alaa M.; Hamed, Rania; Al-Qerem, Walid; Bandar, Ameena; Hall, Frank Scott",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764890/,124

In this research, we use a large secondary dataset of automotive purchases (N = 323,959) to investigate how advertising spending differentially moderates the positive impact of both customer- and retailer-directed price incentives on consumers’ premium level of purchase for vertically differentiated products. We find that higher advertising spending magnifies the positive impact of customer-directed price incentives on consumers’ preference for more premium purchases. In contrast, higher advertising spending attenuates the positive impact of retailer-directed price incentives on consumers’ preference for more premium purchases. Our work is distinct from previous research, which has almost exclusively focused on the CPG industry and the effects of advertising and price promotions on general demand metrics—instead of consumers’ preferences for premium products. Our work has important implications for practitioners and consumer welfare.","Miller, Chadwick J.; Brannon, Daniel C.; Salas, Jim; Troncoza, Martha",J Acad Mark Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121779/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-021-00791-1,124

Since then many advanced AUC detectors have been developed that provide a vast range of versatile choices when characterizing the physical and chemical features of macromolecules. In addition, there have been remarkable advances in software that allow the analysis of AUC data using more sophisticated models, including quaternary structures, conformational changes, and biomolecular interactions. Here we report the application of AUC to protein size-and-shape distribution analysis and structure-and-function analysis in the presence of ligands or lipids. Using band-sedimentation velocity, quaternary structural changes and an enzyme’s catalytic activity can be observed simultaneously. This provides direct insights into the correlation between quaternary structure and catalytic activity of the enzyme. On the other hand, also in this study, we have applied size-and-shape distribution analysis to a lipid-binding protein in either an aqueous or lipid environment. The sedimentation velocity data for the protein with or without lipid were evaluated using the c(s,f(r)) two-dimensional distribution model, which provides a precise and quantitative means of analyzing the protein’s conformational changes.","Chou, Chi-Yuan; Hsieh, Yi-Hui; Chang, Gu-Gang",Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21087667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202310002768; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046202310002768,124

During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast and ovarian cancer survivors experienced more anxiety and depression than before the pandemic. Studies have not investigated the similarities of this trend among BRCA1/2-positive women who are considered high risk for these cancers. The current study examines the impact of COVID-19 experiences on anxiety and depression in a sample of BRCA1/2-positive women in the U.S. METHODS. 211 BRCA1/2-positive women from medically underserved backgrounds completed an online survey. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression for associations between COVID-19 experiences and self-reported anxiety and depression stratified by demographic factors. RESULTS. Overall, women who reported quarantining/isolation (aOR, 0.46, 95% CI, 0.24–0.88) experienced significantly fewer depressive symptoms than women who did not report this experience. Racial/ethnic minority women caring for someone at home during COVID-19 were 3.78 times more likely (95% CI, 1.04–13.6) to report high anxiety while non-Hispanic white women were less likely (aOR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.10–1.33, p-interaction=0.011). CONCLUSIONS. To date, this is the first study to analyze anxiety and depression considering several COVID-19 predictors among BRCA1/2-positive women. Our findings can be used to inform future research and advise COVID-19-related mental health resources specific to these women.","Dibble, Kate E; Connor, Avonne E",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401875/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-763516/v1,124

To address this crisis, we designed and executed an innovative, radically cooperative, rapid-response translational-research program that brought together healthcare workers, manufacturers, and scientists to emergently develop and clinically validate new swabs for immediate mass production by 3D printing. We performed a rigorous multi-step preclinical evaluation on 160 swab designs and 48 materials from 24 companies, laboratories, and individuals, and shared results and other feedback via a public data repository (http://github.com/rarnaout/Covidswab/). We validated four prototypes through an institutional review board (IRB)-approved clinical trial that involved 276 outpatient volunteers who presented to our hospital’s drive-through testing center with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. Each participant was swabbed with a reference swab (the control) and a prototype, and SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were compared. All prototypes displayed excellent concordance with the control (κ=0.85–0.89). Cycle-threshold (Ct) values were not significantly different between each prototype and the control, supporting the new swabs’ non-inferiority (Mann-Whitney U [MWU] p>0.05). Study staff preferred one of the prototypes over the others and the control swab overall. The total time elapsed between identification of the problem and validation of the first prototype was 22 days. Contact information for ordering can be found at http://printedswabs.org.

The 3·5-year-old cat, positive for feline immunodeficiency virus infection, presented with a left testicular enlargement. A few months after castration the animal was humanely destroyed due to declining health. Post-mortem examination revealed inflammatory lesions in abdominal organs and in the brain compatible with FIP. Infection was confirmed with a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction test and by immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen in the affected tissues, including the left testicle. FIP is usually a systemic disease. However, lesions and presenting clinical signs in a single organ system such as the brain are not uncommon. The results of this case study indicate that orchitis, although rare, should be on the list of lesions of FIP.","Sigurðardóttir, Ó.G.; Kolbjørnsen, Ø.; Lutz, H.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997500904432; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997500904432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11222021/,124

Furthermore, patients infected with similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection. Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.","Lapina, Colline; Rodic, Mathieu; Peschanski, Denis; Mesmoudi, Salma",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027318,124
610724,Cleavage of spike protein of SARS coronavirus by protease factor Xa is associated with viral infectivity,2007-07-01,"There has been a pressing need for an expansion of the ventilator capacity in response to the recent COVID19 pandemic. To address this need, we present a system to enable rapid and efficacious splitting between two or more patients with varying lung compliances and tidal volume requirements. Reserved for dire situations, ventilator splitting is complex, and has been limited to patients with similar pulmonary compliances and tidal volume requirements. Here, we report a 3D printed ventilator splitter and resistor system (VSRS) that uses interchangeable airflow resistors to deliver optimal tidal volumes to patients with differing respiratory physiologies, thereby expanding the applicability of ventilator splitting to a larger patient pool. We demonstrate the capability of the VSRS using benchtop test lungs and standard-of-care ventilators, which produced data used to validate a complementary, patient-specific airflow computational model. The computational model allows clinicians to rapidly select optimal resistor sizes and predict delivered pressures and tidal volumes on-demand from different patient characteristics and ventilator settings. Due to the inherent need for rapid deployment, all simulations for the wide range of clinically-relevant patient characteristics and ventilator settings were pre-computed and compiled into an easy to use mobile app. As a result, over 200 million individual computational simulations were performed to maximize the number of scenarios for which the VSRS can provide assistance. The VSRS will help address the pressing need for increased ventilator capacity by allowing ventilator splitting to be used with patients with differing pulmonary physiologies and respiratory requirements, which will be particularly useful for developing countries and rural communities with a limited ventilator supply.","Bishawi, Muath; Kaplan, Michael; Chidyagwai, Simbarashe; Cappiello, Jhaymie; Cherry, Anne; MacLeod, David; Gall, Ken; Evans, Nathan; Kim, Michael; Shaha, Rajib; Whittle, John; Hollidge, Melanie; Truskey, George; Randles, Amanda",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-48165/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818206/,124

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on mental well-being, working life, family life and social life among Faroese employees within a broad range of professions. A total of 1328 Faroese employees answered an anonymous self-report survey from 13 April to 4 May 2020. Employee mental well-being was only modestly affected by the restrictions and the respondents had a mean score of 50.7 on the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale where a score between 41–44 is found to correspond with possible depression. Work commitment, work and family life, work satisfaction and work ability were all rated significantly worse after the COVID-19 outbreak than before (all p values < 0.005). Contrary to previous research, employees in health services assessed their work ability significantly higher than employees in teaching, and child and youth care (p < 0.05). Working parents had higher levels of stress and assessed their work ability significantly lower than employees without children (p < 0.05), and women tended to be more worried than men because of the pandemic.

This study aimed to establish salivary vibrational modes analyzed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to detect COVID-19 biological fingerprints that allow the discrimination between COVID-19 and healthy patients. Clinical dates, laboratories, and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients (N = 255) and healthy persons (N = 1209) were obtained and analyzed through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Then, a multivariate linear regression model (MLRM) was developed. The COVID-19 patients showed low SaO(2), cough, dyspnea, headache, and fever principally. C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, d-dimer, and ferritin were the most important altered laboratory blood tests, which were increased. In addition, changes in amide I and immunoglobulin regions were evidenced in the FTIR spectra analysis, and the MLRM showed clear discrimination between both groups. Specific salivary vibrational modes employing ATR-FTIR spectroscopy were established; moreover, the COVID-19 biological fingerprint in saliva was characterized, allowing the COVID-19 detection using an MLRM, which could be helpful for the development of new diagnostic devices.","Martinez-Cuazitl, Adriana; Vazquez-Zapien, Gustavo J.; Sanchez-Brito, Miguel; Limon-Pacheco, Jorge H.; Guerrero-Ruiz, Melissa; Garibay-Gonzalez, Francisco; Delgado-Macuil, Raul J.; de Jesus, Maria G.

Studies of immunopathogenesis in hamster infection models are challenging because of the limited availability of reagents needed to define cellular and molecular determinants. RESULTS: We sequenced a hamster cDNA library and developed a first-generation custom cDNA microarray that included 5131 unique cDNAs enriched for immune response genes. We used this microarray to interrogate the hamster spleen response to Leishmania donovani, an intracellular protozoan that causes visceral leishmaniasis. The hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis is of particular interest because it recapitulates clinical and immunopathological features of human disease, including cachexia, massive splenomegaly, pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and ultimately death. In the microarray a differentially expressed transcript was identified as having at least a 2-fold change in expression between uninfected and infected groups and a False Discovery Rate of <5%. Following a relatively silent early phase of infection (at 7 and 14 days post-infection only 8 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed), there was dramatic upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes in the spleen (708 differentially expressed genes were evident at 28 days post-infection). The differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and immune cell trafficking. Of particular interest there was concomitant upregulation of the IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 signaling pathways, with increased expression of a battery of IFN-γ- and IL-4-responsive genes. The latter included genes characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional profiling was accomplished in the Syrian golden hamster, for which a fully annotated genome is not available. In the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis, a robust and functional IFN-γ response did not restrain parasite load and progression of disease. This supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite. The concomitant expression of IL-4/IL-13 and their downstream target genes, some of which were characteristic of alternative macrophage activation, are likely to contribute to this. Further dissection of mechanisms that lead to polarization of macrophages toward a permissive state is needed to fully understand the pathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis.

Most of the recently reported studies were randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials. Our goal was to test the efficiency of remdesivir in reducing nasopharyngeal viral load and hospitalization length in a real-life setting in admitted patients in a large tertiary center in Israel. METHODS: A total of 142 COVID-19 patients found to have at least three reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests during hospitalization were selected for this study. Of these, 29 patients received remdesivir, while the remaining non-treated 113 patients served as controls. RESULTS: Among the tested parameters, the control and remdesivir groups differed significantly only in the intubation rates. Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (Ct 7.07±6.85 vs. 7.08±7.27, p=0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared to non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","Goldberg, Elad; Ben Zvi, Haim; Sheena, Liron; Sofer, Summer; Krause, Ilan; Sklan, Ella H.; Shlomai, Amir",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.02.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21001130?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21001130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705849/,124

Human papillomavirus has been established as the causative agent for cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer. However, the tumor biology involved in the prognoses of different cell types in early cancers and tumor responses to radiation in advanced cancers remain largely unknown. The introduction of microarray technologies in the 1990s has provided genome-wide strategies for searching tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. In this review, we first summarize the two types of microarrays: oligonucleotides microarray and cDNA microarray. Then, we review the studies of functional genomics in cervical cancer. Gene expression studies that involved cervical cancer cell lines, cervical cells of cancer versus normal ectocervix, cancer tissues of different histology, radioresistant versus radiosensitive patients, and the combinatorial gene expression associated with chromosomal amplifications are discussed. In particular, CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P, and MSLN have shown to be upregulated in adenocarcinoma, and increased expression levels of CEACAM5 and TACSTD1 were significantly correlated with poorer patient outcomes. On the other hand, 35 genes, including apoptotic genes (e.g. BIK, TEGT, SSI-3), hypoxia-inducible genes (e.g. HIF1A, CA12), and tumor cell invasion and metastasis genes (e.g. CTSL, CTSB, PLAU, CD44), have been noted to echo the hypothesis that increased tumor hypoxia leads to radiation resistance in cervical cancer during radiation.","Chao, Angel; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Lai, Chyong-Huey",Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182341/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1028455908600054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455908600054; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1028-4559(08)60005-4,124
614592,The Structure Analysis and Antigenicity Study of the N Protein of SARS-CoV,2016-11-28,"PURPOSE: This ecological analysis investigates the spatial patterns of the COVID‐19 epidemic in the United States in relation to socioeconomic variables that characterize US counties. METHODS: Data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID‐19 for 2,814 US counties were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the spatial aspects of this pandemic and investigate the disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities. Multiple regression models were used to explore the contextual risk factors of infections and death across US counties. We included population density, percent of population aged 65+, percent population in poverty, percent minority population, and percent of the uninsured as independent variables. A state‐level measure of the percent of the population that has been tested for COVID‐19 was used to control for the impact of testing. FINDINGS: The impact of COVID‐19 in the United States has been extremely uneven. Although densely populated large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are hotspots of the pandemic, it is counterintuitive that incidence and mortality rates in some small cities and nonmetropolitan counties approximate those in epicenters such as New York City. Regression analyses support the hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID‐19 incidence and mortality rates and socioeconomic factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and percent population tested. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about the spatial aspects of the COVID‐19 epidemic and its socioeconomic correlates can inform first responders and government efforts.

616203,Role of multiple factors likely contributing to severity-mortality of COVID-19,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND: The recent public health risks arising from bioterrorist threats and outbreaks of infectious diseases like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) highlight the challenges of effectively communicating accurate health information to an alarmed public. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate use of the Internet in accessing information related to the anthrax scare in the United States in late 2001, and to strategize about the most effective use of this technology as a communication vehicle during times of public health crises. METHODS: A paper-based survey to assess how individuals obtained health information relating to bioterrorism and anthrax during late 2001.We surveyed 500 randomly selected patients from two ambulatory primary care clinics affiliated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. RESULTS: The response rate was 42%. While traditional media provided the primary source of information on anthrax and bioterrorism, 21% (95% CI, 15% - 27%) of respondents reported searching the Internet for this information during late 2001. Respondents reported trusting information from physicians the most, and information from health websites slightly more than information from any traditional media source. Over half of those searching the Internet reported changing their behavior as a result of information found online. CONCLUSIONS: Many people already look to the Internet for information during a public health crisis, and information found online can positively influence behavioral responses to such crises. However, the potential of the Internet to convey accurate health information and advice has not yet been realized. In order to enhance the effectiveness of public-health communication, physician practices could use this technology to pro-actively e-mail their patients validated information. Still, unless Internet access becomes more broadly available, its benefits will not accrue to disadvantaged populations.","Kittler, Anne F; Hobbs, John; Volk, Lynn A; Kreps, Gary L; Bates, David W",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15111274/,124
616235,Targeting conserved viral virulence determinants by single domain antibodies to block SARS-CoV2 infectivity,2021-01-13,"Shigellosis is a heavy disease burden in China especially in children aged under 5 years. However, the age-related factors involved in transmission of shigellosis are unclear. An age-specific Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious/Asymptomatic–Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to shigellosis surveillance data maintained by Hubei Province Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2005 to 2017. The individuals were divided into four age groups (≤ 5 years, 6–24 years, 25–59 years, and ≥ 60 years). The effective reproduction number (R(eff)), including infectivity (R(I)) and susceptibility (R(S)) was calculated to assess the transmissibility of different age groups. From 2005 to 2017, 130,768 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model fitted well with the reported data (P < 0.001). The highest transmissibility (R(eff)) was from ≤ 5 years to the 25–59 years (mean: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–1.17), followed by from the 6–24 years to the 25–59 years (mean: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.35–1.02), from the ≥ 60 years to the 25–59 years (mean: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.29–0.86), and from the 25–59 years to 25–59 years (mean: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.21–0.78). The highest infectivity was in ≤ 5 years (R(I) = 1.71), and was most commonly transmitted to the 25–59 years (45.11%). The highest susceptibility was in the 25–59 years (R(S) = 2.51), and their most common source was the ≤ 5 years (30.15%). Furthermore, “knock out” simulation predicted the greatest reduction in the number of cases occurred by when cutting off transmission routes among ≤ 5 years and from 25–59 years to ≤ 5 years. Transmission in ≤ 5 years occurred mainly within the group, but infections were most commonly introduced by individuals in the 25–59 years. Infectivity was highest in the ≤ 5 years and susceptibility was highest in the 25–59 years. Interventions to stop transmission should be directed at these age groups.","Zhao, Zeyu; Chen, Qi; Wang, Yao; Chu, Meijie; Hu, Qingqing; Hannah, Mikah Ngwanguong; Rui, Jia; Liu, Xingchun; Yu, Yunhan; Zhao, Fuwei; Ren, Zhengyun; Yu, Shanshan; An, Ran; Pan, Lili; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Zhao, Benhua; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Bin; Chen, Tianmu",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111124/,124

METHODS: This study included 150 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed from January 10 to February 12, 2020 to analyze their clinical and CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: The period between symptom onset and initial CT examination ranged from 1 to 8 days. There were 83 cases (55.33%) involving both lungs, 67 cases (44.67%) involving a single lung (left 25 cases and right 42 cases). There were 49 cases (32.67%) of single intrapulmonary lesion, 33 cases (22.00%) of multiple intrapulmonary lesions, 68 cases (44.00%) of diffused intrapulmonary lesions, 67 cases (44.67%) of subpleural lesions, 24 cases (16.00%) of lesions localizing along the bronchovascular bundles, and 59 cases (39.33%) with lesions in both locations. There were 18 cases (12.00%) exhibiting ground-glass nodules of < 10 mm, 124 cases (82.67%) of patchy ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, 8 cases (5.33%) of cord-like lesions, 6 cases (4.00%) of pleural effusion, and 2 cases (1.33%) of enlarged lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The main manifestations of initial chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia patients was ground-glass opacities, commonly involving single site in patients < 35 years old and multiple sites and extensive area in patients > 60 years old. The common lesion sites were the subpleural region and the posterior basal segments of the lower lobes, mostly showing thickening of the interlobular septum and mixed with consolidation.","Fan, Na; Fan, WenHui; Li, Zhen; Shi, Min; Liang, Yi",Jpn J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318916/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-020-00973-x,124

PURPOSE: To evaluate lung injury in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia at six-month follow-up compared to baseline chest CT. METHODS: From March 19th,2020 to May 24th,2020, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and baseline Chest CT were prospectively enrolled at six-months follow-up. CT qualitative findings, semi-quantitative Lungs Severity Score (LSS) and well-aerated lung quantitative Chest CT (QCCT) were analyzed. Baseline LSS and QCCT performances in predicting fibrotic-like changes (reticular pattern and/or honeycombing) at six-month follow-up Chest CT were tested with receiver operating characteristic curves. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to test clinical and radiological features predictive of fibrotic-like changes. The multivariable analysis was performed with clinical parameters alone (clinical model), radiological parameters alone (radiological model) and the combination of clinical and radiological parameters (combined model). RESULTS: One-hundred-eighteen patients, with both baseline and six-month follow-up Chest CT, were included in the study (62 female, mean age 65±12 years). At follow-up Chest CT, 85/118 (72%) patients showed fibrotic-like changes and 49/118 (42%) showed GGOs. Baseline LSS (>14), QCCT (≤3.75L and ≤80%) showed an excellent performance in predicting fibrotic-like changes at Chest CT follow-up. In the multivariable analysis, AUC was .89 (95%CI .77-.96) for the clinical model, .81 (95%CI .68-.9) for the radiological model and .92 (95%CI .81-.98)for the combined model. CONCLUSION: At six-month follow-up Chest CT, 72% of patients showed late sequelae, in particular fibrotic-like changes. Baseline LSS and QCCT of well-aerated lung showed an excellent performance in predicting fibrotic-like changes at six-month Chest CT (AUC>.88). Male sex, cough, lymphocytosis and QCCT well-aerated lung were significant predictors of fibrotic-like changes at six-month with an inverse correlation (AUC .92).

With the rising burden of the pandemic, it is vital to identify not only active disease but any post-recovery complications as well. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the presence of post-viral symptomatology in patients recovered from mild COVID-19 disease. Presence or absence of 11 post-viral symptoms was recorded and we found that 8 of the 11 studied symptoms were notably more prevalent amongst the female sample population. Our results validate the presence of prolonged symptoms months after recovery from mild COVID-19 disease, particularly in association with the female gender. Hence, proving the post-COVID syndrome is a recognizable diagnosis in the bigger context of the post-viral fatigue syndrome.","Kashif, Alina; Chaudhry, Manahil; Fayyaz, Tehreem; Abdullah, Mohammad; Malik, Ayesha; Anwer, Javairia Manal Akmal; Inam, Syed Hashim Ali; Fatima, Tehreem; Iqbal, Noreena; Shoaib, Khadija",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183705/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92717-8,124

Examples of recent advances in diagnostic tests are CRISPR technology, IgG assay, spike protein detection, and use of artificial intelligence. The gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR) has also been upgraded with point-of-care rapid tests. Supportive treatment, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain the primary choice, while therapeutic options include antivirals, antiparasitics, anti-inflammatories, interferon, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibody, hyperimmunoglobulin, RNAi, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Different types of vaccines such as RNA, DNA, and lentiviral, inactivated, and viral vector are in clinical trials. Moreover, rapidly deployable and easy-to-transport innovative vaccine delivery systems are also in development. As countries have started easing down on the lockdown measures, the chance for a second wave of infection demands strict and rational control policies to keep fatalities minimized.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods Genome wide screening was used to establish intra-viral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-kappa-B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Our study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms, representing a powerful resource in the pursuit for therapeutic intervention.","Li, Jingjiao; Guo, Mingquan; Tian, Xiaoxu; Wang, Xin; Yang, Xing; Wu, Ping; Liu, Chengrong; Xiao, Zixuan; Qu, Yafei; Yin, Yue; Wang, Chunxia; Zhang, Yucai; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Liu, Zhenshan; Peng, Chao; Zhu, Tongyu; Liang, Qiming",Med (N Y),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634020300155?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666634020300155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838362/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.07.002,124

Here we report experimental evidence and a theoretical model for memory in retroviral quasispecies in vivo. Apart from replicative memory associated with quasispecies dynamics, retroviruses may harbour a “cellular” or “anatomical” memory derived from their integrative cycle and the presence of viral reservoirs in body compartments. Three independent sets of data exemplify the two kinds of memory in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The data provide evidence of re-emergence of sequences that were hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments for extended periods of infection, and recovery of a quasispecies from pre-existing genomes. We develop a three-component model that incorporates the essential features of the quasispecies dynamics of retroviruses exposed to selective pressures. Significantly, a numerical study based on this model is in agreement with the experimental data, further supporting the existence of both replicative and reservoir memory in retroviral quasispecies.","Briones, Carlos; Domingo, Esteban; Molina-Parı́s, Carmen",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12875847/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603006612; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603006612,124

We designed this clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of use of midodrine hydrochloride in early sepsis to reduce the duration for IV vasopressors and decrease ICU and hospital length of stay. DESIGN: Pilot, two-center, placebo-controlled, double blinded randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Medical ICUs at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi were the study sites. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr old) were included within 24 hours of meeting the Sepsis-3 definition if the mean arterial pressure remained less than 70 mm Hg despite receiving timely antibiotics and initial IV fluid bolus of 30 cc/kg. INTERVENTION: Three doses of 10 mg midodrine versus placebo were administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Total 32 patients were randomized into midodrine (n = 17) and placebo groups (n = 15). There were no major differences in baseline variables between the groups except for higher baseline creatinine in the midodrine group (2.0 ± 0.9 mg/dL) versus placebo group (1.4 ± 0.6 mg /dL), p = 0.03. The median duration of IV vasopressor requirement was 14.5 ± 8.1 hours in midodrine group versus 18.8 ± 7.1 hours in the placebo group, p value equals to 0.19. Patients in the midodrine group needed 729 ± 963 norepinephrine equivalent compared with 983 ± 1,569 norepinephrine equivalent in the placebo group, p value equals to 0.59.

METHODS: We assessed medication use, healthcare utilization, gout-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) on the Gout Impact Scale (GIS), psychological distress using the patient health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and resilience in people with self-reported physician-diagnosed gout during the COVID-19 pandemic in a cross-sectional Internet survey. RESULTS: Among the 122 survey respondents with physician-diagnosed gout, 82% were prescribed urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and 66% were taking ULT daily; mean age was 54.2 years [standard deviation (SD), 13.8], 65% were male, and 79% were White. More regular use of gout medication was reported during the COVID-19 pandemic: allopurinol, 44%; colchicine, 37%; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 36%. Gout flares were common: 63% had ⩾1 gout flare monthly; 11% went to emergency room/urgent care; and 2% were hospitalized with gout flares. Between 41% and 56% of respondents reported more difficulty with gout management and related functional status related to COVID-19; 17–37% had difficulty with healthcare access for gout. HRQOL deficits were evident for gout concern overall, 79.4 (SD, 25); unmet gout treatment need, 64.5 (SD, 27.1); and gout concern during flare, 67.3 (SD, 27.1); but less so for gout medication side effects, 48.9 (SD, 27.4).

Data are needed to support the work of the emergency services and enhance governance. This study develops a Europe-wide analysis of perceptions, needs and priorities of the public affected by the Covid-19 emergency. An online multilingual survey was conducted from mid-May until mid-July 2020. The questionnaire investigates perceptions of public healthcare, emergency management and societal resilience. In total, N = 3029 valid answers were collected. They were analysed both as a whole and focusing on the most represented countries (Italy, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom). Our findings highlight some perceived weaknesses in emergency management that are associated with the underlying vulnerability of the global interconnected society and public healthcare systems. The spreading of the epidemic in Italy represented a ‘tipping point’ for perceiving Covid-19 as an ‘emergency’ in the surveyed countries. The respondents uniformly suggested a preference for gradually restarting activities. We observed a tendency to ignore the cascading effects of Covid-19 and possible concurrence of threats. Our study highlights the need for practices designed to address the next phases of the Covid-19 crisis and prepare for future systemic shocks. Cascading effects that could compromise operational capacity need to be considered more carefully.

Herein, we evaluated the presence of rheumatic, thyroid and phospholipid autoantibodies in sera samples from 120 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in comparison to pre-pandemic samples from 100 healthy individuals. In addition, to estimate the frequency of these autoantibodies in COVID-19, a meta-analysis of selected articles was conducted. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 displayed latent autoimmunity mainly mediated by a high frequency of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide third generation antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), IgM β2-glycoprotein I (β2GP1) and IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies. The meta-analysis confirmed our results, being RF and ANAs the most common autoantibodies. In addition, cluster analysis revealed that those patients with high positivity for RF, IgM β2GP1 antibodies and ANAs had a longer hospital stay, required more vasopressors during hospitalization, and were more likely to develop critical disease. These data suggest that latent autoimmunity influences the severity of COVID-19, and support further post-COVID studies in order to evaluate the development of overt autoimmunity.","Anaya, Juan-Manuel; Monsalve, Diana M.; Rojas, Manuel; Rodríguez, Yhojan; Montoya-García, Norma; Mancera-Navarro, Laura Milena; Villadiego-Santana, Ana María; Rodríguez-Leguizamón, Giovanni; Acosta-Ampudia, Yeny; Ramírez-Santana, Carolina",J Transl Autoimmun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909021000113?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589909021000113; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtauto.2021.100091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681751/,124
622864,Hepatitis C Virus Protease Inhibitors Show Differential Efficacy and Interactions with Remdesivir for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro,2021-08-17,"The COVID-19 pandemic has a multifaceted impact on mental health due to ill health, restrictions and lockdowns, and loss of employment and institutional support. COVID-19 may disproportionally impact families with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) due to the already higher prevalence of mental health conditions in children with SEND and their parents. Therefore, it is essential to determine the short-term impact of the pandemic on the mental health of families with SEND in order to identify their ongoing health support needs. The current study aims to examine the anxiety level and concerns of children with SEND and their parents living in China. The sample consisted of 271 parents of children with SEND aged between 6 and 17 years (M(age) = 8.37; SD(age) = 2.76). Parents completed an online survey between 10 April to 8 June 2020. Both child and parental anxiety levels and various concerns increased after the initial wave of COVID-19 when compared with retrospective pre-COVID-19 levels. Parental anxiety and concern levels were significantly higher for those living in rural areas compared to urban areas. In addition, parental and child anxiety and concern levels were significantly correlated with each other. Parental anxiety at the lowest level made a unique and significant statistical contribution to children's anxiety levels. The implications of the study findings are discussed.","Su, Xueyun; Cai, Ru Ying; Uljarević, Mirko; Van Herwegen, Jo; Dukes, Daniel; Yang, Yufang; Peng, Xiaomei; Samson, Andrea C.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616315/,124
622966,Label-free SARS-CoV-2 detection and classification using phase imaging with computational specificity,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the main causative agent of porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs) which causes huge yearly economic losses in the swine industry. Capsid protein (Cap) is the major structural protein of PCV2 that can induce a protective immune response. Therefore, developing a novel and safe subunit vaccine against PCV2 infection is needed. RESULTS: In this study, the Cap gene was bound to the truncated calreticulin (CRT) (120–250 aa/120–308 aa) at the N/C terminal, and then the CRT-Cap fusion genes were expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli). The size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data showed that the purified recombinant CRT-Cap fusion protein (rP5F) existed in the form of polymers. Immunization with rP5F stimulated high levels of PCV2 specific antibody and neutralization antibody in mice, which were almost identical to those induced by the commercial subunit and inactivated vaccines. The lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion were also detected in rP5F immunized mice. According to the results of PCV2-challenge experiment, the virus loads significantly decreased in mice immunized with rP5F. The data obtained in the current study revealed that rP5F had the potential to be a subunit vaccine candidate against PCV2 in the future. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully expressed Cap-CRT fusion proteins in E.coli and optimized rP5F could form into immunogenic polymers. Mice immunized with rP5F efficiently induced humoral and part of cellular immune responses and decreased the virus content against PCV2-challenge, which suggested that rF5P could be a potential subunit vaccine candidate.","Liu, Chang; Liu, Yunchao; Feng, Hua; Zhao, Baolei; Chen, Yumei; Huang, Huimin; Wang, Pan; Deng, Ruiguang; Zhang, Gaiping",BMC Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02527-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854700/,124

It is the major etiological agent of the recent outbreaks of piglet diarrhea and death in the US. Limited knowledge is currently available regarding the role of dendritic cells in PEDV infection. Here, we observed that PEDV did not replicate in monocyte-derived dendritic cells as evidenced by the decrease of viral gene transcript copies in infected cells by qRT-PCR and the absence of viral proteins by immunofluorescence staining as well as the absence of virus particles in infected cells by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, PEDV did not compromise cell viability at 48, 72, and 96 h after infection at either a MOI of 2.5 or 5. Interestingly, an increased transcription of type I interferon including interferon-α and β was observed in infected cells compared to mock infected cells. Surprisingly, we did not detect any interferon-β in the supernatants of infected cells. A slight increase in interferon-α protein production in the supernatants of PEDV-infected cells was observed compared to mock infected cells. We also observed a markedly increased transcription of interferon inducible protein −10 (IP-10). Overall, PEDV does not replicate in porcine Mo-DC, but activates the transcription of type I interferon and chemokine IP-10.","Wang, Xiuqing; Ohnstad, Martha; Nelsen, April; Nelson, Eric",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517306661; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517306661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888653/,124

In Internet of medical Things (IoMT), it is efficient and convenient for users to report their physical symptoms to hospitals or disease prevention departments by various mobile devices. Unfortunately, it usually brings leakage risk of these symptoms since data receivers may be untrusted. As a strong metric for health privacy, local differential privacy (LDP) requires that users should perturb their symptoms to prevent the risk. However, the widely-used data structure called sketch for frequency estimation doesn’t satisfy the specified requirement. In this paper, we firstly define the problem of frequency estimation of physical symptoms under LDP. Then, we propose four different protocols, i.e., CMS-LDP, FCS-LDP, CS-LDP and FAS-LDP to solve the above problem. Next, we demonstrate that the designed protocols satisfy LDP and unbiased estimation. We also present two approaches to implement the key component (i.e., universal hash functions) of protocols. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate four protocols on two real-world datasets, representing two different distributions of physical symptoms. The results show that CMS-LDP and CS-LDP have relatively optimal utility for frequency estimation of physical symptoms in IoMT.","Wu, Xiaotong; Khosravi, Mohammad Reza; Qi, Lianyong; Ji, Genlin; Dou, Wanchun; Xu, Xiaolong",Comput Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366420319022?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140366420319022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2020.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873996/,124

In the COVID-19 pandemic, we were confronted with a shifting epidemiological landscape, clinical uncertainties and evolving evidence. These unexpected challenges compelled us to amend standard LSR methodology. Objective and outline: Our primary objective is to discuss some challenges faced when conducting LSRs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to provide methodological guidance for others doing similar work. Based on our experience and lessons learned from two Cochrane LSRs and challenges identified in several non-Cochrane LSRs, we highlight methodological considerations, particularly with regards to the study design, interventions and comparators, changes in outcome measure, and the search strategy. We discuss when to update, or rather when not to update the review, and the importance of transparency when reporting changes. Lessons learned and conclusions: We learned that a LSR is a very suitable review type for the pandemic context, even in the face of new methodological and clinical challenges. Our experience showed that the decision for updating a LSR depends not only on the evolving disease or emerging evidence, but also on the individual review question and the review teams’ resources.","Iannizzi, Claire; Dorando, Elena; Burns, Jacob; Weibel, Stephanie; Dooley, Clare; Wakeford, Helen; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole; Piechotta, Vanessa",J Clin Epidemiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435621002936; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435621002936?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34525406/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.09.013,124

This paper explores the impacts of COVID-19 on clinical research in an NHS Trust and how the embedded research system was adapted and repurposed to support the COVID-19 response. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a multi-method qualitative case study of a research-intensive NHS Trust in London UK, we collected data through a questionnaire (n = 170) and semi-structured interviews (n = 24) with research staff working in four areas: research governance; research leadership; research delivery; and patient and public involvement. We also observed key NHS Trust research prioritisation meetings (40 hours) and PPI activity (4.5 hours) and analysed documents produced by the Trust and national organisation relating to COVID-19 research. Data were analysed for a descriptive account of the Trust’s COVID-19 research response and research staff’s experiences. Data were then analysed thematically. Our analysis identifies three core themes: centralisation; pace of work; and new (temporary) work practices. By centralising research prioritisation at both national and Trust levels, halting non-COVID-19 research and redeploying research staff, an increased pace in the setup and delivery of COVID-19-related research was possible. National and Trust-level responses also led to widescale changes in working practices by adapting protocols and developing local processes to maintain and deliver research. These were effective practical solutions borne out of necessity and point to how the research system was able to adapt to the requirements of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The Trust and national COVID-19 response entailed a rapid large-scale reorganisation of research staff, research infrastructures and research priorities. The Trust’s local processes that enabled them to enact national policy prioritising COVID-19 research worked well, especially in managing finite resources, and also demonstrate the importance and adaptability of the research workforce. Such findings are useful as we consider how to adapt our healthcare delivery and research practices both at the national and global level for the future. However, as the pandemic continues, research leaders and policymakers must also take into account the short and long term impact of COVID-19 prioritisation on non-COVID-19 health research and the toll of the emergency response on research staff.","Wyatt, David; Faulkner-Gurstein, Rachel; Cowan, Hannah; Wolfe, Charles D.

We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first six weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being. Methods: In this observational study patients with established COPD were recruited. Exacerbation frequency was measured in the first six weeks of COVID lockdown and compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, shopping and visitor behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal. Results: 160 participants were recruited (mean [SD] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted) and 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 vs 99, p=0.026). The increase was as a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% vs 33.8%). During 'lockdown' participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001). Discussion: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first six weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change.","McAULEY, Hamish J C; Hadley, Kate; Elneima, Omer; Brightling, Christopher E; Evans, Rachael; Steiner, Michael C; Greening, Neil",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197202v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.20197202,124

Methods: A compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. Results: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed and moves closer to the peak day. Conclusions: Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available.","Fujimoto, A.

We announced a knowledge-test entailing prizes in the classrooms of a primary school and a middle school. Altogether 79 Chinese children (6–18 years) voluntarily participated in the test: listening to a series of animal sounds before guessing the names of the animals. Meanwhile, behind the participants, a video was playing images that ostensibly corresponded to the sounds being played. In fact, this was not necessarily the case, i.e., some items cannot be solved because the sounds played are not from any animal but machine-synthesized. Participants were instructed not to look back at the video. However, 51 children peeked at the video for the unsolvable items, although the peeking behavior decreased with age. Moreover, when explaining how they correctly guessed the unsolvable items, children as young as 6 years old were able to apply a linguistic strategy (i.e., “capability attribution”) for lying. Besides “capability attribution,” Children also applied “fortune attribution” and “topic shift” for lying. Finally, “fortune attribution” and “topic shift” increased with age. Therefore, educators need to be aware that children are able to apply verbal strategies for lying that could involve truthful statements (i.e., “topic shift”) or statements that are difficult to be proved as untruthful (i.e., “fortune attribution”).","Hu, Chao; Huang, Jinhao; Wang, Qiandong; Weare, Ethan; Fu, Genyue",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425844/,124

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity to promote the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.","Brook, Cara E.; Boots, Mike; Chandran, Kartik; Dobson, Andrew P.; Drosten, Christian; Graham, Andrea L.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Müller, Marcel A.; Ng, Melinda; Wang, Lin-Fa; van Leeuwen, Anieke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/696195,124

Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods EMBASE, PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, Tau2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias. Results: 148 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12149 patients (5739 female) and a median age was 47.0 [35.0-64.6]. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication, while 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic. Older age (SMD: 1.25 [0.78- 1.72]; p < 0.001), being male (RR = 1.32 [1.13-1.54], p = 0.005) and pre-existing comorbidity (RR = 1.69 [1.48-1.94]; p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5-98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Eggers test: p < 0.05).

Parental Reflective Functions (PRF) and Parental Sense of Competence (PSOC) have been identified as key protective factors in predicting maternal functioning and well-being, yet little is known of its role among fathers, let alone combat veteran fathers. In this study we explored whether PRF and PSOC moderated the association between PTSS and AUD among 189 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) male combat veterans. Participants filled out validated measures assessing PTSS, PRF, PSOC and AUD. Results indicated that PTSS, as well as PRF’s “interest and curiosity regarding the child’s mental states” subscale, were positively correlated to AUD. In addition, PRF’s “certainty about child mental states” subscale moderated the association between PTSS and AUD, so that PTSS and AUD were significantly correlated for participants who reported average or high levels of certainty about their child’s mental states. This finding may imply that intrusive mentalizing (“hypermentalizing”) by veteran fathers may facilitate the association between PTSS and AUD, presumably by constituting a maladaptive mechanism for coping with the stressful uncertainty embedded in the parent–child relationship.","Feingold, Daniel; Zerach, Gadi",J Child Fam Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230797/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-02024-z,124

Here, bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses of studies on COVID-19 were performed, including more than 1500 papers on COVID-19 available in the PubMed and CNKI databases from January 1, 2020 to March 8, 2020. In this review, we found that because of the rapid response of researchers worldwide, the number of COVID-19-related publications showed a high growth trend in the first ten days of February; among these, the largest number of studies originated in China, the country most affected by pandemic in its early stages. Our findings revealed that the epidemic situation and data accessibility of different research teams have caused obvious difference in emphases of the publications. Besides, there was an unprecedented level of close cooperation and information sharing within the global scientific community relative to previous coronavirus research. We combed and drew the knowledge map of the SARS-CoV-2 literature, explored early status of research on etiology, pathology, epidemiology, treatment, prevention, and control, and discussed knowledge gaps that remain to be urgently addressed. Future perspectives on treatment, prevention, and control were also presented to provide fundamental references for current and future coronavirus research.","Gong, Yue; Ma, Ting-can; Xu, Yang-yang; Yang, Rui; Gao, Lan-jun; Wu, Si-hua; Li, Jing; Yue, Ming-liang; Liang, Hui-gang; He, Xiao; Yun, Tao",Innovation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2020.100027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914141/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675820300278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675820300278?v=s5,124

In the Philippines, where stringent lockdown rules have been implemented, households living in poverty have had to rely largely on food aid in the form of food packs distributed by local governments and private donors. An evaluation of the commonly distributed food items reveals a diet that addresses acute hunger but does not contain sufficient nutrients to promote and maintain health. Such a diet puts low-income households at a greater risk of acute and chronic disease. The negative health impact of commonly distributed food packs on food aid-dependent households shine a light on how the COVID-19 pandemic and public health policies exacerbate health inequities. A primary care perspective is essential in creating food security policies that can effectively address acute hunger and malnutrition without contributing to the long-term deleterious effects of inadequate nutrition on the health of indigent communities.","Ong, Madeline Mae; Ong, Ronnah Marie; Reyes, Gladys Kaye; Sumpaico-Tanchanco, Lourdes Bernadette",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715893/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720946951,124
631343,The impact of the interferon-lambda family on the innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections,2014-07-16,"Dental disease due to osteoclast over‐activity reaches epidemic proportions in older domestic cats and has also been reported in wild cats. Feline osteoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL) involve extensive resorption of the tooth leaving it liable to root fracture and subsequent tooth loss. The aetio‐pathogenesis of FORL is not known. Recent work has shown that systemic acidosis causes increased osteoclast activation and that loci of infection or inflammation in cat mouth are likely to be acidotic. To investigate this, we generated osteoclasts from cat blood and found that they formed in large numbers (∼400) in cultures on bovine cortical bone slices. Acidosis caused an increase in the size of cells—in cultures maintained up to 14 days at basal pH 7.25, mean osteoclast area was 0.01 ± 0.003 mm(2), whereas an 8.6‐fold increase was observed in cells cultured between 11 and 14 days at pH 7.15 (0.086 ± 0.004 mm(2)). Acidosis caused a modest increase in the number of osteoclasts. Exposure to pH 6.92 exhibited a 5‐fold increase in the area of bone slices covered by resorption lacunae (∼70% bone slice resorbed). In line with this finding, significant increases were observed in the expression of cathepsin K and proton pump enzymes (both approximately 3‐fold) that are key enzymes reflective of resorptive activity in osteoclasts. These results demonstrate that acidosis is a major regulator of osteoclast formation and functional activation in the cat, and suggest that local pH changes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of FORL.

632415,Genomic Similarity of Nucleotides in SARS CoronaVirus using K-Means Unsupervised Learning Algorithm,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND: When confronted with a stressor, animals react with several physiological and behavioral responses. Although sustained or repeated stress can result in severe deleterious physiological effects, the causes of stress in free-ranging animals are yet poorly documented. In our study, we aimed at identifying the main factors affecting stress levels in free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) as an index of stress, after validating the method for its application in wolves. We analyzed a total of 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations, in Italy (Abruzzo), France (Mercantour), and the United States (Yellowstone). We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In social mammals sharing strong bonds among group members, the death of one or several members of the group most likely induces important stress in the remainder of the social unit. The potential impact of social and territorial stability on stress levels should be further investigated in free-ranging populations, especially in highly social and in territorial species. As persistent or repeated stressors may facilitate or induce pathologies and physiological alterations that can affect survival and fitness, we advocate considering the potential impact of anthropogenic causes of stress in management and conservation programs regarding wolves and other wildlife.","Molnar, Barbara; Fattebert, Julien; Palme, Rupert; Ciucci, Paolo; Betschart, Bruno; Smith, Douglas W.; Diehl, Peter-Allan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398784/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137378,124

It is essential to develop later-generation biodiesel from unexploited non-food resources for a more sustainable future. Reuse of biowaste is critically important to address these issues of food safety and sustainability. Thus, the co-transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO), algal oil (AO) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for the synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was investigated over a series of nanoparticle catalysts containing calcium, magnesium, potassium or nickel under mild reaction conditions. Nanoparticle catalyst samples were prepared from biowaste sources of chicken manure (CM), water hyacinth (WH) and algal bloom (AB), and characterized using XRD, Raman and FESEM techniques for the heterogeneous production of biodiesel. The catalyst was initially prepared by calcination at 850°C for 4 h in a major presence of Ca(x)Mg(y)CO(3), KCl and K(2)CO(3). The WCO and AO co-conversion of 98% and FAMEs co-selectivity of 95% were obtained over CM nanoparticle catalyst under the reaction conditions of 80 °C, 20 mins and DMC to oil molar ratio of 6:1 with 3% catalyst loading and 3% methanol addition. Under the optimum condition, the density, viscosity, and cetane number of the biodiesel were in the range of diesel standards. Nanoparticle catalysts have been proven as a promising sustainable material in the catalytic transesterification of WCO and AO with the major presence of calcium, magnesium and potassium. This study highlights a sustainable approach via biowaste utilization for the enhancement of biodiesel quality with high ester content, low acid value, high cetane number, and low viscosity.","Li, Fanghua; Hülsey, Max J.; Yan, Ning; Dai, Yanjun; Wang, Chi-Hwa",Chem Eng J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32958996/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720331648?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894720331648,124

Clinical presentation is characterized with acute diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration in pigs of all ages, with a possible high mortality in suckling piglets. The disease emerged in the USA in 2013 causing heavy losses, and re-emerged in Europe in 2014, but with milder consequences. RESULTS: In the spring 2016, PED-like symptoms were reported to be seen on an agricultural holding in Eastern Croatia; laboratory workup confirmed the Croatia’s first PED outbreak ever. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) strain responsible for the outbreak was of the S-INDEL genotype, much the same as other European PEDV strains. In 2017, a post-outbreak serology was carried out in three counties in Eastern Croatia, revealing seropositivity in pigs bred on four large industrial holdings (9.09%). The seroprevalence across PEDV-positive holdings was up to 82.8%. The latter holdings were unanimously managed by an enterprise that had never reported PED before. CONCLUSIONS: PED has emerged in Croatian pig population causing potentially considerable losses. The circulating strain was of the S-INDEL genotype. Serological workup proved PEDV spread to another four agricultural holdings, demonstrating the importance of not only external, but also internal biosecurity measures.","Brnić, Dragan; Šimić, Ivana; Lojkić, Ivana; Krešić, Nina; Jungić, Andreja; Balić, Davor; Lolić, Marica; Knežević, Dražen; Hengl, Brigita",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319854/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2002-x,124
633466,Host-Directed FDA-Approved Drugs with Antiviral Activity against SARS-CoV-2 Identified by Hierarchical In Silico/In Vitro Screening Methods,2021-04-06,"Background: Clinicians in their role as teachers and medical faculties were struggling to address the medical students’ needs regarding their medical education in times of COVID-19. They were especially confronted with several challenges regarding what medical training should look like and how to transfer medical training to integrate relevant skills like interpersonal or practical competencies. This study aimed to investigate the teachers’ perspectives on medical education and COVID-19 in general, including their distress level. Methods: This quantitative questionnaire study was distributed online among responsible lecturers of medical training at the Medical Faculty of Tuebingen. Teachers answered questions about the medical training, COVID-19 in general (on a seven point- Likert scale from “not at all” to “completely”) and their mental well-being (STAI). Descriptive data analysis and t-tests were performed. Results: The teachers reported being significantly (p<.01) more distressed regarding the medical training (M=4.63, SD=1.24) in comparison to their private lives (M=3.58, SD=1.38) or the clinical context (M=3.33, SD=1.95). They also felt significantly less informed about the medical training in times of COVID-19 (p<.001). They wished for more support and information from their medical faculty. When teachers were asked which teaching should be implemented in future, they reported the most the online lectures (87.5%), followed by collaborative working (75.5%), live broadcast (62.5%) and online chats (58.3%). Teachers also saw the current situation of COVID-19 as a chance for a digital transformation of the medical education (M=5.92, SD=0.95). Discussion: Teachers of the Medical Faculty of Tuebingen saw online-based teaching formats as a chance to meet the medical students’ needs regarding the medical education. Video-based formats like online lecturers and online chats with teachers might play a relevant role in order to impart knowledge. Furthermore, medical students should also be taught in digital formats like telehealth, including patient-physician distance interactions.","Herrmann-Werner, Anne; Erschens, Rebecca; Zipfel, Stephan; Loda, Teresa",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286073/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001489,124

DESIGN: Preregistered prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: University hospital ICU. PATIENTS: All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to our ICU during the first European pandemic wave. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months after hospital discharge, 46 survivors underwent a comprehensive physical assessment (6-min walking distance, Medical Research Council sum score and handgrip strength), a full pulmonary function test, and a chest CT scan which was used to analyze skeletal muscle architecture. In addition, patient-reported outcomes measures were collected. Physical performance assessed by 6-minute walking distance was below 80% of predicted in 48% of patients. Patients with impaired physical performance had more muscle weakness (Medical Research Council sum score 53 [51–56] vs 59 [56–60]; p < 0.001), lower lung diffusing capacity (54% [44–66%] vs 68% of predicted [61–72% of predicted]; p = 0.002), and higher intermuscular adipose tissue area (p = 0.037). Reduced lung diffusing capacity and increased intermuscular adipose tissue were independently associated with physical performance. CONCLUSIONS: Physical disability is common at 3 months in severe coronavirus disease 2019 survivors. Lung diffusing capacity and intermuscular adipose tissue assessed on CT were independently associated with walking distance, suggesting a key role for pulmonary function and muscle quality in functional disability.","van Gassel, Rob J.

634311,Structural Bases of Coronavirus Attachment to Host Aminopeptidase N and Its Inhibition by Neutralizing Antibodies,2012-08-02,"Abstract The murine coronavirus polymerase gene is 22 kb in length with the potential to encode a polyprotein of approximately 750 kDa. The polyprotein has been proposed to encode three proteinase domains which are responsible for the processing of the polyprotein into mature proteins. The proteolytic activity of the first proteinase domain has been characterized and resembles the papain family of cysteine proteinases. This proteinase domain acts autoproteolytically to cleave the amino terminal portion of the polymerase polyprotein, releasing a 28-kDa protein designated p28. To identify the cleavage site of this papain-like cysteine proteinase, we isolated the peptide adjacent to p28 and determined the amino terminus sequence by Edman degradation reaction. We report that proteolysis occurs between the Gly-247 and Val-248 dipeptide bond. To determine the role of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage site, we introduced a total of 42 site-specific mutations at the residues spanning the P5 to P3′ positions and assessed the effects of the mutations on the processing of p28 in an in vitro transcription and translation system. The substitutions of Gly-247 at the P1 position or Arg-246 at the P2 position resulted in a dramatic decrease of proteolytic activity, and the mutations of Arg-243 at P5 position also led to considerable reduction in p28 cleavage. In contrast, the substitutions of amino acids Gly-244 (P4), Tyr-245 (P3), Val-248 (P1′), Lys-249 (P2′), and Pro-250 (P3′) had little or no effect on the amount of p26 that was released. This work has identified Gly-247-Val-248 as the cleavage site for the release of p28, the amino-terminal protein of the murine coronavirus polymerase polyprotein. Additionally, we conclude that the Gly-247 and Arg-246 are the major determinants for the cleavage site recognition by the first papain-like cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus.","Dong, Shanghong; Baker, Susan C.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284715674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7941320/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284715674,124

Enhanced support for parents may decrease parental stress and improve subsequent parent and child outcomes. The Coached, Coordinated, Enhanced Neonatal Transition (CCENT) programme is a novel bundled intervention of psychosocial support delivered by a nurse navigator that includes Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-based coaching, care coordination and anticipatory education for parents of high-risk infants in the NICU through the first year at home. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the intervention on parent stress at 12 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled superiority trial with 1:1 allocation to the CCENT model versus control (standard neonatal follow-up). Parents of high-risk infants (n=236) will be recruited from seven NICUs across three Canadian provinces. Intervention participants are assigned a nurse navigator who will provide the intervention for 12 months. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 4, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome measure is the total score of the Parenting Stress Index Fourth Edition Short Form at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include parental mental health, empowerment and health-related quality of life for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A cost-effectiveness analysis will examine the incremental cost of CCENT versus usual care per QALY gained. Qualitative interviews will explore parent and healthcare provider experiences with the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval was obtained from Clinical Trials Ontario, Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board (REB), The Hospital for Sick Children REB, UBC Children’s and Women’s REB and McGill University Health Centre REB.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected health care systems across developing and developed countries. Therefore, it is important to understand its impact on various parameters of patient care as regards revised infrastructure and policies in hospitals during the pandemic. METHOD: It is a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from 13-3–2020 to 26-4-2020 at King Khalid University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. Patient satisfaction and surgical outcomes were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: 331 participants were included in the study (median age: 53 years; 70% female), and 223 completed the patient's satisfaction survey. 260 of the surgeries were non-oncolog cases (78.6%) compared to 71 oncology cases (21.4%). With respect to the surgical outcomes, 12% of the patients required admission to the ICU, and 10.9% developed postoperative complications, most of which were infectious complications. Only 1.8% (6 patients) were re-admitted to the hospital. Three patients died within 30 days post-op (0.9%), all had emergency surgery. Regarding patient satisfaction, 77.6% and 93% of the patients reported that nurses and doctors, respectively, treated them with courtesy and respect, listened to them carefully, and provided clear explanations to them. 90.3% were satisfied with the hospital sanitary measures. 64.1% stated that they got written instructions at the time of discharge. CONCLUSION: The satisfaction level of patients was high for all the studied domains, and there were a small number of complications with overall good surgical outcomes. That indicates that all the actions and policies that were implemented during the pandemic were proven beneficial for the patients. It is recommended to continue those measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.","Bin Traiki, Thamer A.; AlShammari, Sulaiman A.; AlAli, Mohammed N.; Aljomah, Nadia A.; Alhassan, Noura S.; Alkhayal, Khayal A.; Al-Obeed, Omar A.; Zubaidi, Ahmad M.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864124/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.08.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080120302661; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080120302661?v=s5,124

Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be –141 ± 11 and –136 ± 16 kJ/mol, respectively. The IC(50) were predicted to be 9.2 µM and 30 µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å(2) by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: Identifying the changes in eating habits and lifestyles including, physical activity, sleeping hours, and sleep quality after the cancellation of lockdown than the period of restrictions. METHODS: A quasi-experimental cross-sectional study was conducted among 394 students in Bangladesh using a structured questionnaire from February 3, 2021, to February 13, 2021. RESULTS: Consuming homemade foods drops by 8.63% at post lockdown than lockdown period. At post lockdown, 26.67% of students gained weight whereas 47.46% of respondents never engaged in any physical works. There has been a significant correlation between weight gain and physical activities (p = 0.007). Not continuing the academic activities from home was significantly associated with weight changes (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.95), meals per day (AOR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.79, 5.92), screen time for entertainment (AOR = 3.08; 95% CI: 1.78, 5.33), sleeping hours (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.83), and sleep quality (AOR = 2.38; 95% CI: 1.35, 4.23) whereas female gender was related to meals per day (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.95) and sleep quality (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.85). However, 43.91% of respondents never felt any sleep disturbances. The rates of students who always experienced mentally tired, resentment, and sadness at post lockdown was lower than lockdown period. All of these changes were significant (p < 0.000) in terms of the lockdown situation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows notable changes in eating habits and lifestyles after lockdown which may indicate the tendency to adopt normal life than restrictions.","Shaun, Md Mahbubul Alam; Nizum, Md Wahidur Rahman; Munny, Shahnaz; Fayeza, Fahmida; Mali, Sujan Kanti; Abid, Mohammad Tazrian; Hasan, Al- Riaj",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466707/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07843,124
635311,The production and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference material,2021-03-19,"abstract: Both innate and adaptative immune responses contribute to the control of infectious diseases, including by limiting the spreading of zoonotic diseases from animal reservoirs to humans. Pigs represent an important animal reservoir for influenza virus infection of human populations and are also naturally infected by coronaviruses, an important group of viruses, which includes the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Studies on both innate and adaptative immune responses of pigs to influenza virus and coronaviruses contribute, therefore, to a better control of these infections in their natural hosts and will be briefly reviewed in this article. Pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), were found in lung secretions of influenza virus infected pigs, and correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, whereas prior vaccination against influenza strongly reduced the production of infectious virus and cytokines in the lungs upon challenge, which was associated with clinical protection. An early type I IFN production was also found in coronavirus infected pigs, including at mucosal sites. IFN induction by coronavirus is shown to involve interaction between a viral glycoprotein and a leukocyte subset, likely equivalent to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, present in the mucosae and associated lymphoid tissues. Given the IFN mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, the use of IFN or IFN inducers may prove an efficient strategy for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs. Because influenza and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces, adaptative immune responses have to be characterized at mucosal sites. Thus, nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing short‐lived, but potentially protective local IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Interestingly, primary influenza virus infection induced long‐lived increase of lung CD8(+) T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. Pigs infected by a respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) showed virus‐specific IgG Ab‐secreting cells in the bronchial lymph nodes, whereas the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) induced more IgA Ab‐secreting cells in gut tissues, which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms. Porcine viral infections provide, therefore, valuable models for evaluating the immune parameters that are important for controlling transmission of important viral zoonotic infections.","CHARLEY, BERNARD; RIFFAULT, SABINE; VAN REETH, KRISTIEN",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17135502/,124

In light of our appreciation for the efficacy of PPE and the nuances associated with interpretation of polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2, particularly as community transmission decreases, we call for a re-evaluation of universal preprocedural testing. We propose a transition to a patient-centered approach, focusing on testing patients whose outcomes would be improved by a delayed procedure in the event of a positive test and a greater reliance on appropriate PPE rather than preprocedural test results. We recommend that a community infection rate threshold be set at which point preprocedural testing is discontinued, understanding that there is an inflection point at which testing downsides outweigh the benefits.","Penney, Jessica; Shah, Sajani; Doron, Shira",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322568/,124
637469,SARS-CoV-2: Cross-scale insights from ecology and evolution,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Anti-viral CD8 T-cell activity is enhanced and prolonged by CD4 T-cell-mediated help, but negatively regulated by inhibitory B7-H1 interactions. During viral encephalomyelitis, the absence of CD4 T cells decreases CD8 T cell activity and impedes viral control in the central nervous system (CNS). By contrast, the absence of B7-H1 enhances CD8 T-cell function and accelerates viral control, but increases morbidity. However, the relative contribution of CD4 T cells to CD8 function in the CNS, in the absence of B7-H1, remains unclear. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and B7-H1(−/−) mice were infected with a gliatropic coronavirus and CD4 T cells depleted to specifically block T helper function in the CNS. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis of purified T-cell populations from lymph nodes and the CNS was used to directly monitor ex vivo T-cell effector function. The biological affects of altered T-cell responses were evaluated by analysis of viral control and spinal-cord pathology. RESULTS: Increased anti-viral activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(−/−) mice was lost upon depletion of CD4 T cells; however, despite concomitant loss of viral control, the clinical disease was less severe. CD4 depletion in B7-H1(−/−) mice also decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by microglia and macrophages, consistent with decreased microglia/macrophage activation and reduced interferon (IFN)-γ. Enhanced production of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-21 mRNA was seen in CD4 T cells from infected B7-H1(−/−) compared with WT mice, suggesting that over-activated CD4 T cells primarily contribute to the increased pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The local requirement of CD4 T-cell help for CD8 T-cell function is not overcome if B7-H1 inhibitory signals are lost. Moreover, the increased effector activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(−/−) mice is attributable not only to the absence of B7-H1 upregulation on major histocompatibility complex class I-presenting resident target cells, but also to enhanced local CD4 T-cell function. B7-H1-mediated restraint of CD4 T-cell activity is thus crucial to dampen both CD8 T-cell function and microglia/macrophage activation, thereby providing protection from T-cell-mediated bystander damage.","Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237504/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-9-269,124

637978,Effect of handling and storage conditions and stabilizing agent on the recovery of viral RNA from oral fluid of pigs,2014-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Despite effective treatments, more than 30% of patients with diabetes will present with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) at some point. Patients with DKD are among the most complex as their care is multifactorial and involves different groups of health care providers. Suboptimal adherence to polypharmacy is frequent and contributes to poor outcomes. As self-management is one of the keys to clinical success, structured medication adherence programs are crucial. The PANDIA-IRIS (patients diabétiques et insuffisants rénaux: un programme interdisciplinaire de soutien à l’adhésion thérapeutique) study is based on a routine medication adherence program led by pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to define the impact of the duration of this medication adherence program on long-term adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with DKD. METHODS: This monocentric adherence program consists of short, repeated motivational interviews focused on patients’ medication behaviors combined with the use of electronic monitors containing patients’ medications. When patients open the electronic monitor cap to take their medication, the date and hour at each opening are registered. In total, 73 patients are randomized as 1:1 in 2 parallel groups; the adherence program will last 6 months in the first group versus 12 months in the second group. After the intervention phases, patients continue using their electronic monitors for a total of 24 months but without receiving feedback. Electronic monitors and pill counts are used to assess medication adherence. Persistence and implementation will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves and generalized estimating equation multimodeling, respectively. Longitudinal adherence will be presented as the product of persistence and implementation and modelized by generalized estimating equation multimodeling. The evolution of the ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation) and UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) clinical scores based on medication adherence will be analyzed with generalized estimating equation multimodeling. Patients’ satisfaction with this study will be assessed through qualitative interviews, which will be transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed for the main themes. RESULTS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee (Vaud, Switzerland) in November 2015. Since then, 2 amendments to the protocol have been approved in June 2017 and October 2019. Patients’ recruitment began in April 2016 and ended in October 2020. This study was introduced to all consecutive eligible patients (n=275). Among them, 73 accepted to participate (26.5%) and 202 (73.5%) refused. Data collection is ongoing and data analysis is planned for 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The PANDIA-IRIS study will provide crucial information about the impact of the medication adherence program on the adherence and clinical outcomes of patients with DKD. Monitoring medication adherence during the postintervention phase is innovative and will shed light on the duration of the intervention on medication adherence.

In the present study, we investigated whether there is a beneficial effect of senicapoc in a large animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The primary end point was the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio. METHODS: ARDS was induced in female pigs (42–49 kg) by repeated lung lavages followed by injurious mechanical ventilation. Animals were then randomly assigned to vehicle (n = 9) or intravenous senicapoc (10 mg, n = 9) and received lung-protective ventilation for 6 h. RESULTS: Final senicapoc plasma concentrations were 67 ± 18 nM (n = 9). Senicapoc failed to change the primary endpoint PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (senicapoc, 133 ± 23 mmHg; vehicle, 149 ± 68 mmHg). Lung compliance remained similar in the two groups. Senicapoc reduced the level of white blood cells and neutrophils, while the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were unaltered 6 h after induction of the lung injury. Senicapoc-treatment reduced the level of neutrophils in the alveolar space but with no difference between groups in the cumulative lung injury score. Histological analysis of pulmonary hemorrhage indicated a positive effect of senicapoc on alveolar–capillary barrier function, but this was not supported by measurements of albumin content and total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, senicapoc failed to improve the primary endpoint PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, but reduced pulmonary hemorrhage and the influx of neutrophils into the lung. These findings open the perspective that blocking KCa3.1 channels is a potential treatment to reduce alveolar neutrophil accumulation and improve long-term outcome in ARDS.

Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is highly expressed in response to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and induces activation of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. We targeted EMMPRIN with paramagnetic/fluorescent micellar nanoparticles conjugated with the EMMPRIN binding peptide AP-9 (NAP9), or an AP-9 scrambled peptide as a negative control (NAPSC). We found that NAP9 binds to endogenous EMMPRIN in cultured HL1 myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Injection of NAP9 at the time of or one day after IR, was enough to reduce progression of myocardial cell death when compared to Control and NAPSC injected mice (infarct size in NAP9 injected mice: 32%±6.59 vs Control: 46%±9.04 or NAPSC injected mice: 48%±7.64). In the same way, cardiac parameters were recovered to almost healthy levels (LVEF NAP9 63% ± 7.24 vs Control 42% ± 4.74 or NAPSC 39% ± 6.44), whereas ECM degradation was also reduced as shown by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans have shown a signal enhancement in the left ventricle of NAP9 injected mice with respect to non-injected, and to mice injected with NAPSC. A positive correlation between CMR enhancement and Evans-Blue/TTC staining of infarct size was calculated (R:0.65). Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN targeted nanoparticles as a new approach to the mitigation of ischemic/reperfusion injury.","Cuadrado, Irene; Piedras, Maria Jose Garcia Miguel; Herruzo, Irene; Turpin, Maria del Carmen; Castejón, Borja; Reventun, Paula; Martin, Ana; Saura, Marta; Zamorano, Jose Luis; Zaragoza, Carlos",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941847/; https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.13352,124

At present, there is no other systematic review that evaluates the effectiveness of zeolite in all dental materials. The purpose of this study was to review all available literature that analyzed the antimicrobial effects and/or mechanical properties of zeolite as a restorative material in dentistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, an exhaustive search of PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Embase, and the Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source was conducted. No language or time restrictions were used and the study was conducted from June 1, 2020 to August 17, 2020. Only full text articles were selected that pertained to the usage of zeolite in dental materials including composite resin, bonding agents, cements, restorative root material, cavity base material, prosthesis, implants, and endodontics. RESULTS: At the beginning of the study, 1534 studies were identified, of which 687 duplicate records were excluded. After screening for the title, abstract, and full texts, 35 articles remained and were included in the qualitative synthesis. An Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) test, which included a percent user agreement and reliability percent, was conducted for each of the 35 articles chosen. CONCLUSION: Although ion-incorporated zeolite may enhance the antimicrobial properties of dental materials, the mechanical properties of some materials, such as MTA and acrylic resin, may be compromised. Therefore, since the decrease in mechanical properties depends on zeolite concentration in the restorative material, it is generally recommended to add 0.2-2% zeolite by weight.","Hao, Jessica; Lang, Spencer; Mante, Francis; Pavelić, Kresimir; Ozer, Fusun",Acta Stomatol Croat,https://doi.org/10.15644/asc55/1/9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867540/,124

643496,A map of binary SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions implicates host immune regulation and ubiquitination,2021-03-18,"Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.","Chandra, Rohitash; Krishna, Aswin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411112/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10662v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255615,124
643718,The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Development of Neurodegeneration in Multiple Sclerosis,2021-02-11,"Abstract: Each year, over 98% of the almost 4 million pregnant patients in the United States receive prenatal care—a crucial preventive service to improve outcomes for moms and babies. National guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule unchanged since 1930. In scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it quickly becomes clear that prenatal care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefit of many prenatal services, like screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. Yet how to deliver these services is much less clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate such care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits, and that we do not need to provide all maternity services in person. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Our institution has worked for the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. Our initial work assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in patient-centered care delivery. Two key principles emerged to inform prenatal care redesign: 1) design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services; and 2) create flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of COVID-19 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan). We then explore how lessons from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peahl, Alex F.; Smith, Roger D.; Moniz, Michelle H.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425200/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305561?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820305561,124

This case study describes the utilization of Harrison's open-systems model to create an approach for rapid adoption of existing telehealth technologies in a large scale academic medical center. Methods An internal group of organizational developers, was enlisted to enable this effort. Local networks were employed and organized into focus groups to rapidly assess and address barriers to adoption and informal interviews with executive leadership were conducted to align organizational goals. Interventions include rapid deployment of focused and data driven provider, staff and patient support bolstered by effective communication and resource management. Results There was an increase in the number of patient portal activation codes by 75% during the month of March. The number of activation codes generated expectedly decreased in April as many patients now had activated patient portals. The video visit volume as a result of provider self-scheduling increased went from a baseline of 0 to over 600 clinical visits. Discussion Experienced organizational development programs can facilitate adoption of change. The faculty practice of CUIMC has years of experience with supporting wide scale operational change centered on technology. In this case, providing engaged networks with tailored content that is focused on the process and available technology promoted rapid adoption and optimization. Conclusion In the setting of profound external pressure, experience with the ability to focus on tailoring training and support to the culture of the organization helped to rapidly increase the availability and success of telehealth visits for a large scale academic medical center.","Touson Jonathan, C; Namita, Azad; Corinne, Depue; Timothy, Crimmins; Rosalie, Long",Learning health systems,https://doi.org/10.1002/lrh2.10239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838036/,124

They are known to fundamentally change the electronic states of the layers, but similar effects on their mechanical and vibrational properties have not been discussed so far. Here we show that the Moir\'e potential shifts the radial breathing mode in double walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). It is expected that the frequency change is proportional to the shift in optical transition energies, which are induced by the Moir\'e patterns. To verify our model we performed resonant Raman scattering on the purified and sorted semiconducting DWCNTs. We find that the radial breathing mode in the Raman spectra of DWCNTs is up to 14 cm$^{-1}$ higher in energy and their optical transitions energies up to 200 meV lower in energy than in the corresponding single-walled tubes. The shift follows the expected linear correlation with a slope -88 eV/cm$^{-1}$. We show how to identify the strong coupling condition in DWCNTs from their phonon frequencies and construct a Kataura plot to aid their future experimental assignment.","Gordeev, Georgy; Wasserroth, Soren; Li, Han; Flavel, Benjamin; Reich, Stephanie",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00295; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07337v1.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369792/,124
645050,Rapid Enrichment and Ultrasensitive Detection of Influenza A Virus in Human Specimen using Magnetic Quantum Dot Nanobeads Based Test Strips,2020-08-21,"BACKGROUND While the role of contact tracing in the containment of the COVID-19 epidemic remains important until vaccines are widely available, literature on objectively measurable indicators for the effectiveness of contact tracing is scarce. We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenario 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","Mettler, Sofia K.; Park, Jewel; Özbek, Orhun; Mettler, Linus K.; Ho, Po-Han; Rhim, Hye Chang; Maathuis, Marloes.

647397,Establishing a mass spectrometry-based system for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in large clinical sample cohorts,2020-12-03,"Background: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority populations, both in the UK and internationally. To date, much of the evidence has been derived from studies within single healthcare settings, mainly those hospitalised with COVID-19. Working on behalf of NHS England, the aim of this study was to identify ethnic differences in the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and mortality using a large general population cohort in England. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using linked primary care records of 17.5 million adults between 1 February 2020 and 3 August 2020. Exposure was self-reported ethnicity collapsed into the 5 and 16 ethnicity categories of the English Census. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify ethnic differences in the risk of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and COVID-19 mortality, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, clinical co-morbidities, geographic region, care home residency, and household size. Results: A total of 17,510,002 adults were included in the study; 63% white (n=11,030,673), 6% south Asian (n=1,034,337), 2% black (n=344,889), 2% other (n=324,730), 1% mixed (n=172,551), and 26% unknown (n=4,602,822). After adjusting for measured explanatory factors, south Asian, black, and mixed groups were marginally more likely to be tested (south Asian HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.07-1.09; black HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06-1.09, mixed HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and substantially more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.02. 95% CI 1.97-2.07; black HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.61-1.76; mixed HR 1.46, 95%CI 1.36-1.56). The risk of being admitted to ICU for COVID-19 was substantially increased in all ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.96-2.52; black HR 3.07, 95%CI 2.61-3.61; mixed HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.19-3.75, other HR 2.86, 95%CI 2.31-3.63). Risk of COVID-19 mortality was increased by 25-56% in ethnic minority groups compared with white adults (south Asian HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.17-1.38; black HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.38-1.75; mixed HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.12-1.76; other HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.05-1.49). We observed heterogeneity of associations after disaggregation into detailed ethnic groupings; Indian and African groups were at higher risk of all outcomes; Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean groups were less or equally likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, but at higher risk of all other outcomes, Chinese groups were less likely to be tested for and test positive for SARS-CoV-2, more likely to be admitted to ICU, and equally likely to die from COVID-19. Conclusions: We found evidence of substantial ethnic inequalities in the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, ICU admission, and mortality, which persisted after accounting for explanatory factors, including household size. It is likely that some of this excess risk is related to factors not captured in clinical records such as occupation, experiences of structural discrimination, or inequitable access to health and social services. Prioritizing linkage between health, social care, and employment data and engaging with ethnic minority communities to better understand their lived experiences is essential for generating evidence to prevent further widening of inequalities in a timely and actionable manner.","Mathur, Rohini; Rentsch, Christopher T.; Morton, Caroline; Hulme, William J; Schultze, Anna; MacKenna, Brian; Eggo, Rosalind M; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Wong, Angel YS; Williamson, Elizabeth J; Forbes, Harriet; Wing, Kevin; McDonald, Helen I; Bates, Chris; Bacon, Seb; Walker, Alex J; Evans, David; Inglesby, Peter; Mehrkar, Amir; Curtis, Helen J; DeVito, Nicholas J; Croker, Richard; Drysdale, Henry; Cockburn, Jonathan; Parry, John; Hester, Frank; Harper, Sam; Douglas, Ian J; Tomlinson, Laurie; Evans, Stephen; Grieve, Richard; Harrison, David; Rowan, Kathy; Khunti, Kamlesh; Chaturvedi, Nish; Smeeth, Liam; Goldacre, Ben",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20198754v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.20198754,124

At risk groups including diabetic and obese patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19-related complications and poor outcomes. Substantial evidence points to hypovitaminosis D as a risk factor for severe disease, the need for ICU, and mortality. 1,25(OH)D, a key regulator of calcium homeostasis, is believed to have various immune-regulatory roles including; promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, down regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, dampening entry and replication of SARS-COV-2, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. In addition, there are strong connections which suggest that dysregulated 1,25(OH)D levels play a mechanistic and pathophysiologic role in several disease processes that are shared with COVID-19 including: diabetes, obesity, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and even hypercoagulable states. With evidence continuing to grow for the case that low vitamin D status is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease and poor outcomes, there is a need now to address the public health efforts set in place to minimize infection, such as lock down orders, which may have inadvertently increased hypovitaminosis D in the general population and those already at risk (elderly, obese, and disabled). Moreover, there is a need to address the implications of this evidence and how we may apply the use of cheaply available supplementation, which has yet to overcome the near global concern of hypovitaminosis D. In our review, we exhaustively scope these shared pathophysiologic connections between COVID-19 and hypovitaminosis D.","Menshawey, Esraa; Menshawey, Rahma; Nabeh, Omnia Azmy",Inflammopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-021-00835-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185200/,124

Business sectors such as solar distributors, which have been instrumental in supporting the governments' ambitious universal electrification programs, have been negatively affected by the pandemic. The main aim of this paper is therefore to explore and conduct a comparative assessment before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic of the key challenges of solar‐based businesses in Ethiopia focusing on the distributors and installers and to provide policy recommendations. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were employed during this study. The results show that before the pandemic, finding a skilled workforce, gaining a technical knowledge of the technology, competing in the market, and lack of consumer awareness and initial investment were the key challenges. The importation of solar technologies has been halted by the arrival of the COVID‐19 exacerbating existing challenges and threatening the very existence of the businesses. The impact of the pandemic on income levels of end‐users of solar technologies, together with the lack of sufficient supply of technologies to the businesses, most of the businesses are forced to lay off their employees deepening the unemployment rate and, in some cases, forcing businesses to be closed. These circumstances affect economic development and dents the progress made so far in facilitating energy access to remote communities.

649907,Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus,2017-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that causes serious life threatening and nosocomial infections including pneumonia. PA has the ability to alter host genome to facilitate its invasion, thus increasing the virulence of the organism. Sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, is known to play a key role in facilitating infection. Sphingosine kinases (SPHK) 1&2 phosphorylate sphingosine to generate S1P in mammalian cells. We reported earlier that Sphk2(−/−) mice offered significant protection against lung inflammation, compared to wild type (WT) animals. Therefore, we profiled the differential expression of genes between the protected group of Sphk2(−/−) and the wild type controls to better understand the underlying protective mechanisms related to the Sphk2 deletion in lung inflammatory injury. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on mouse lung tissue using NextSeq 500 sequencing system. RESULTS: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis was performed and differentially expressed genes following PA infection were identified using whole transcriptome of Sphk2(−/−) mice and their WT counterparts. Pathway (PW) enrichment analyses of the RNA seq data identified several signaling pathways that are likely to play a crucial role in pneumonia caused by PA such as those involved in: 1. Immune response to PA infection and NF-κB signal transduction; 2. PKC signal transduction; 3. Impact on epigenetic regulation; 4. Epithelial sodium channel pathway; 5. Mucin expression; and 6. Bacterial infection related pathways. Our genomic data suggests a potential role for SPHK2 in PA-induced pneumonia through elevated expression of inflammatory genes in lung tissue. Further, validation by RT-PCR on 10 differentially expressed genes showed 100% concordance in terms of vectoral changes as well as significant fold change. CONCLUSION: Using Sphk2(−/−) mice and differential gene expression analysis, we have shown here that S1P/SPHK2 signaling could play a key role in promoting PA pneumonia. The identified genes promote inflammation and suppress others that naturally inhibit inflammation and host defense. Thus, targeting SPHK2/S1P signaling in PA-induced lung inflammation could serve as a potential therapy to combat PA-induced pneumonia.","Ebenezer, David L.; Fu, Panfeng; Krishnan, Yashaswin; Maienschein-Cline, Mark; Hu, Hong; Jung, Segun; Madduri, Ravi; Arbieva, Zarema; Harijith, Anantha; Natarajan, Viswanathan",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842752/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6367-9,124

Now, although a few drugs and vaccines have been proved for its treatment and prevention, little systematic comments are made to explain its susceptibility to humans. A few scattered studies used bioinformatics methods to explore the role of microRNA (miRNA) in COVID-19 infection. Combining these timely reports and previous studies about virus and miRNA, we comb through the available clues and seemingly make the perspective reasonable that the COVID-19 cleverly exploits the interplay between the small miRNA and other biomolecules to avoid being effectively recognized and attacked from host immune protection as well to deactivate functional genes that are crucial for immune system. In detail, SARS-CoV-2 can be regarded as a sponge to adsorb host immune-related miRNA, which forces host fall into dysfunction status of immune system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 encodes its own miRNAs, which can enter host cell and are not perceived by the host’s immune system, subsequently targeting host function genes to cause illnesses. Therefore, this article presents a reasonable viewpoint that the miRNA-based interplays between the host and SARS-CoV-2 may be the primary cause that SARS-CoV-2 accesses and attacks the host cells.","Zhang, Song; Amahong, Kuerbannisha; Sun, Xiuna; Lian, Xichen; Liu, Jin; Sun, Huaicheng; Lou, Yan; Zhu, Feng; Qiu, Yunqing",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675361/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab062,124

DATA SOURCES: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, ScienceDirect, Elsevier and PubMed were used to search literatures published from December 2019 to December 2020 by entering the keywords “Traditional Chinese medicine”, “COVID-19”, “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, “Pathogenesis”, “Syndrome differentiation”, “Prescriptions” and their combinations. Hence, we have performed an extensive review of research articles, reviews and primary scientific studies to identify TCM against COVID-19. RESULTS: Among clinical treatments of COVID-19, several TCM prescriptions and characteristic therapies have been effectively suggested, the underlying mechanisms of which are mainly involved in antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and organ-protective effects of multi-components acting on multi-targets at multi-pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This review may provide meaningful and feasible information that can be considered for the treatment of COVID-19 pandemic globally.","Ren, Wei; Liang, Pan; Ma, Yue; Sun, Qin; Pu, Qingrong; Dong, Li; Luo, Gang; Mazhar, Maryam; Liu, Jiali; Wang, Raoqiong; Yang, Sijin",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111310; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221000950?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221000950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761591/,124

652402,Application of One-Step Reverse Transcription Droplet Digital PCR for Dengue Virus Detection and Quantification in Clinical Specimens,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Fungal diseases have an ever‐increasing global disease burden, although regional estimates for specific fungal diseases are often unavailable or dispersed. OBJECTIVES: Here, we report the current annual burden of life‐threatening and debilitating fungal diseases in the Netherlands. METHODS: The most recent available epidemiological data, reported incidence and prevalence of fungal diseases were used for calculations. RESULTS: Overall, we estimate that the annual burden of serious invasive fungal infections in the Netherlands totals 3 185 patients, including extrapulmonary or disseminated cryptococcosis (n = 9), pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 740), invasive aspergillosis (n = 1 283), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 257), invasive Candida infections (n = 684), mucormycosis (n = 15) and Fusarium keratitis (n = 8). Adding the prevalence of recurrent vulvo‐vaginal candidiasis (n = 220 043), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (n = 13 568) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (n = 17 695), the total debilitating burden of fungal disease in the Netherlands is 254 491 patients yearly, approximately 1.5% of the country's population. CONCLUSION: We estimated the annual burden of serious fungal infections in the Netherlands at 1.5% of the population based on previously reported modelling of fungal rates for specific populations at risk. With emerging new risk groups and increasing reports on antifungal resistance, surveillance programmes are warranted to obtain more accurate estimates of fungal disease epidemiology and associated morbidity and mortality.","Buil, Jochem B.; Meijer, Eelco F.

We report a unique case of an STA pseudo-aneurysm that developed due to mask wearing during the Covid-19 pandemic. A 70-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of a rapidly growing pseudo-aneurysm of the right STA. Over the past 3 months the patient had been wearing a mask for the prevention of Covid-19. The STA aneurysm was located exactly at a pressure point created by the rubber mask. Therefore, we assumed that an enlargement of the preexisting aneurysm had taken pace due to irritation from the elastic band of the mask. Surgical excision of the aneurysm and reconstruction of the STA using STA-STA bypass were performed. To our knowledge, we here report the first case of an STA pseudo-aneurysm that was potentially affected indirectly by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Their biological diversity and rapid adaptive rates have proved to be difficult to overcome and to anticipate by modern medical technology. Also, the anthropogenic change of natural ecosystems and the continuous population growth are driving increased rates of interspecies contacts and the interchange of pathogens that can develop into global pandemics. The combination of molecular, epidemiological, and ecological knowledge of RNA viruses is therefore essential towards the proper control of these emergent pathogens. This review outlines, throughout different levels of complexity, the problems posed by RNA viral diseases, covering some of the molecular mechanisms allowing them to adapt to new host species—and to novel pharmaceutical developments—up to the known ecological processes involved in zoonotic transmission.","Carrasco-Hernandez, R; Jácome, Rodrigo; López Vidal, Yolanda; Ponce de León, Samuel",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28985316/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar/ilx026,124

656041,Diagnostic performance of a rapid in-clinic test for the detection of Canine Parvovirus under different storage conditions and vaccination status,2015-02-20,"Background: The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is reducing health care accessibility to non–life-threatening diseases, thus hiding their real incidence. Moreover, the incidence of potentially fatal conditions such as acute type A aortic dissection seems to have decreased since the pandemic began, whereas the number of cases of chronic ascending aortic dissections dramatically increased. We present two patients whose management has been affected by the exceptional sanitary situation we are dealing with. Case report: A 70-year-old man with chest pain and an aortic regurgitation murmur had his cardiac workup delayed (4 months) because of sanitary restrictions. He was then diagnosed with chronic type A aortic dissection and underwent urgent replacement of ascending aorta and aortic root. The delay in surgical treatment made the intervention technically challenging because the ascending aorta grew up to 80 mm inducing strong adhesions and chronic inflammation. The second case report concerns a 68-year-old woman with right lower-limb pain who was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. However, a CT scan to exclude a pulmonary embolism could not be realized until 5 months later because of sanitary restrictions. When she eventually got the CT scan, it fortuitously showed a chronic dissection of the ascending aorta. She underwent urgent surgery, and the intervention was challenging because of adhesions and severe inflammation. Conclusion: Delayed treatment due to sanitary restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the management of potentially life-threatening conditions including type A aortic dissection. We should remain careful to avoid COVID-19 also hitting patients who are not infected with the virus.","Lyon, Arnaud; Gunga, Ziyad; Niclauss, Lars; Rancati, Valentina; Tozzi, Piergiorgio",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.645135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996941/,124

656524,Recombinase-Aided Amplification Coupled with Lateral Flow Dipstick for Efficient and Accurate Detection of Porcine Parvovirus,2021-07-28,"Survivors from COVID-19 pneumonia can present with persisting multisystem involvement (lung, pulmonary vessels, heart, muscle, red blood cells) that may negatively affect exercise capacity. We sought to determine the extent and the determinants of exercise limitation in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital discharge. Eighteen consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 1:1 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls underwent: spirometry, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography for the study of pulmonary circulation. Arterial blood was sampled at rest and during exercise in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 lie roughly on the same oxygen consumption isophlets than controls both at rest and during submaximal exercise, thanks to supernormal cardiac output (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was reduced by 30% in COVID-19 (P < 0.001), due to a peripheral extraction limit. In addition, within COVID-19 patients, hemoglobin content was associated with peak oxygen consumption (R(2) = 0.46, P = 0.002). Respiratory reserve was not exhausted (median [IRQ], 0.59 [0.15]) in spite of moderate reduction of forced vital capacity (79 ± 40%). Pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise was not different between patients and controls. Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (39.5 [8.5] vs. 29.5 [8.8], P < 0.001), and such an increase was mainly explained by increased chemosensitivity. When recovering from COVID-19, patients present with reduced exercise capacity and augmented exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, including anemia and reduced oxygen extraction by peripheral muscles were the major determinants of deranged exercise physiology. Pulmonary vascular function seemed unaffected, despite restrictive lung changes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY At the time of hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 present with reduced functional capacity and exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, namely reduced oxygen extraction (myopathy) and anemia, which are not fully compensated by a supernormal cardiac output response, account for exercise limitation before exhaustion of the respiratory reserve. Enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity, rather increased dead space, mainly accounts for exercise hyperventilation. The pulmonary vascular response to exercise circulation of survived patients with COVID-19 does not present major pathological changes.","Baratto, Claudia; Caravita, Sergio; Faini, Andrea; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Senni, Michele; Badano, Luigi P.; Parati, Gianfranco",J Appl Physiol (1985),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764166/; https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00710.2020,124

Besides probing PPIs with immunoprecipitation-based techniques, peptide pull-downs are an alternative tool specifically useful to study interactome changes induced by post-translational modifications. Peptides for pull-downs can be chemically synthesized and thus offer the possibility to include amino acid exchanges and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the pull-down reaction. The combination of peptide pull-down and analysis of the binding partners with mass spectrometry offers the direct measurement of interactome changes induced by PTMs or by amino acid exchanges in the interaction site. The possibility of large-scale peptide synthesis on a membrane surface opened the possibility to systematically analyze interactome changes for mutations of many proteins at the same time. Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are amino acid patterns that can mediate protein binding. A significant number of SLiMs are located in regions of proteins, which are lacking a secondary structure, making the interaction motifs readily available for binding reactions. Peptides are particularly well suited to study protein interactions, which are based on SLiM-mediated binding. New technologies using arrayed peptides for interaction studies are able to identify SLIM-based interaction and identify the interaction motifs.

A multi-university team has focused on the identification of the host (human) proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, with the aim of hampering these interactions that may cause severe COVID-19 symptoms. Sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors surprisingly belong to the “druggable” host proteins found, with the pan-sigma receptor modulator PB28 displaying the most potent anti–SARS-CoV-2 activity in in vitro assays. Being 20-fold more active than hydroxychloroquine, without cardiac side effects, PB28 is a promising antiviral candidate worthy of further investigation. Our research group developed PB28 in 1996 and have thoroughly characterized its biological properties since then. Structure–affinity relationship (SAfiR) studies at the sigma receptor subtypes were also undertaken with PB28 as the lead compound.

Patients with comorbidity, such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated mortality. The development of effective antiviral drugs is in urgent need to treat COVID-19 patients. Here, we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of antihypertensive drug that is widely used in clinics, inhibited the post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, while no in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect was observed for the two other major types of antihypertensive drugs, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. CCB combined with chloroquine showed a significantly enhanced anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. A retrospective clinical investigation on hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the only comorbidity revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate therapy was associated with a decreased case fatality rate.

We report three male children who were surgically treated for acute appendicitis and had concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our first patient was a 12-year-old male who presented with symptoms indicative of appendicitis but no respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 (e.g. cough, shortness of breath). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms. Our third patient was a 13-year-old patient who also presented with symptomatic acute appendicitis without apparent COVID-19 manifestations.

Some of the impacts of COVID-19 have been widely reported already. However, many effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still to be discovered. The main objective of this study was to assess the changes in the frequency of reported physical back pain complaints reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to other published studies, we target the general population using Twitter as a data source. Specifically, we aim to investigate differences in the number of back pain complaints between the pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. A total of 53,234 and 78,559 tweets were analyzed for November 2019 and November 2020, respectively. Because Twitter users do not always complain explicitly when they tweet about the experience of back pain, we have designed an intelligent filter based on natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify the examined tweets into the back pain complaining class and other tweets. Analysis of filtered tweets indicated an 84% increase in the back pain complaints reported in November 2020 compared to November 2019. These results might indicate significant changes in lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions in daily body movements and reduced exposure to routine physical exercise.","Fiok, Krzysztof; Karwowski, Waldemar; Gutierrez, Edgar; Saeidi, Maham; Aljuaid, Awad M.; Davahli, Mohammad Reza; Taiar, Redha; Marek, Tadeusz; Sawyer, Ben D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922924/,124

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (∼15 kb), was served as a model virus and its genomic cDNA was recombinated into baculovirus. We investigated whether infectious virus particles could be generated by expression of the full-length cloned genome from the modified baculovirus vector. The recombinant baculovirus, AcAPRRS, was used to infect sf9 cells. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated the presence of PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp) 2 and nucleocapsid (N) protein and electron microscopy revealed PRRSV particles in the culture supernatant. Infectious PRRSV particles were also produced in susceptible MARC-145 cells inoculated with AcAPRRS, and the growth characteristics of the PRRSV generated were similar to those of the parental PRRSV strain. Infectious PRRSV particles were also generated following AcAPRRS transduction of BHK-21 cells and Vero cells that are not sensitive to PRRSV. Titers of PRRSV obtained from BHK-21 and Vero cells were up to 10(4.05) TCID(50)/ml. These findings open a new route to the propagation of the virus in vitro and will be of utility in vaccine development.","Zheng, Hao; Liu, Changlong; Zhuang, Jinshan; Yuan, Shishan",J Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20728481/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168165610003901; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165610003901,124

Methods: secondary analysis of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Results: staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Conclusions: delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to the needs of women; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.","Wilson, C. A.; Dalton-Locke, C.

664803,High-throughput assay using a GFP-expressing replicon for SARS-CoV drug discovery,2008-06-13,"Feline kobuvirus (FeKoV), a novel picornavirus of the genus kobuvirus, was initially identified in the feces of cats with diarrhea in South Korea in 2013. To date, there is only one report of the circulation of kobuvirus in cats in southern China. To investigate the presence and genetic variability of FeKoV in northeast China, 197 fecal samples were collected from 105 cats with obvious diarrhea and 92 asymptomatic cats in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Changchun, Jilin and Harbin regions, Northeast China, and viruses were detected by RT-PCR with universal primers targeting all kobuviruses. Kobuvirus was identified in 28 fecal samples with an overall prevalence of 14.2% (28/197) of which 20 samples were co-infected with feline parvovirus (FPV) and/or feline bocavirus (FBoV). Diarrhoeic cats had a higher kobuvirus prevalence (19.1%, 20/105) than asymptomatic cats (8.7%, 8/92). By genetic analysis based on partial 3D gene, all kobuvirus-positive samples were more closely related to previous FeKoV strains with high identities of 90.5%–97.8% and 96.6%–100% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis based on the complete VP1 gene indicated that all FeKoV strains identified in this study were placed into a cluster, which separated from other reference strains previously reported, and three identical amino acid substitutions were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein for these FeKoV strains. Furthermore, two complete FeKoV polyprotein genomes were successfully obtained from two positive samples and designated 16JZ0605 and 17CC0811, respectively. The two strains shared 92.9%–94.9% nucleotide identities and 96.8%–98.4% amino acid identities to FeKoV prototype strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that FeKoVs were clustered according to their geographical regions, albeit with limited sequences support. This study provides the first molecular evidence that FeKoV circulates in cats in northeast China, and these FeKoVs exhibit genetic diversity and unique evolutionary trend.","Niu, Ting-Jiang; Yi, Shuai-Shu; Wang, Xin; Wang, Lei-Hua; Guo, Bing-Yan; Zhao, Li-Yan; Zhang, Shuang; Dong, Hao; Wang, Kai; Hu, Xue-Gui",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818309547; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818309547; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529719/,124

However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.","Wang, Yilong; Liu, Rongxian; Lu, Mijia; Yang, Yingzhi; Zhou, Duo; Hao, Xiaoqiang; Zhou, Dongming; Wang, Bin; Li, Jianrong; Huang, Yao-Wei; Zhao, Zhengyan",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218300655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300655,124

However, existing devices may not be suitable for use in low-resource settings, where the burden of non-communicable diseases is high. Here we describe the development of a target product profile (TPP) for a point-of-care multi-parameter device for detection of biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, including diabetes, in primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: A draft TPP developed by an expert group was reviewed through an online survey and semi-structured expert interviews to identify device characteristics requiring refinement. The draft TPP included 41 characteristics with minimal and optimal requirements; characteristics with an agreement level for either requirement of ≤ 85% in either the survey or among interviewees were further discussed by the expert group and amended as appropriate. RESULTS: Twenty people responded to the online survey and 18 experts participated in the interviews. Twenty-two characteristics had an agreement level of ≤ 85% in either the online survey or interviews. The final TPP defines the device as intended to be used for basic diagnosis and management of cardiometabolic disorders (lipids, glucose, HbA1c, and creatinine) as minimal requirement, and offering an expanded test menu for wider cardiometabolic disease management as optimal requirement. To be suitable, the device should be intended for level 1 healthcare settings or lower, used by minimally trained healthcare workers and allow testing using self-contained cartridges or strips without the need for additional reagents. Throughput should be one sample at a time in a single or multi-analyte cartridge, or optimally enable testing of several samples and analytes in parallel with random access. CONCLUSION: This TPP will inform developers of cardiometabolic multi-parameter devices for LMIC settings, and will support decision makers in the evaluation of existing and future devices.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the demand for accurate, easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective antigen tests for clinical application. We propose a de novo antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 using the combination of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thio-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. Our test takes advantage of the spike proteins specific to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The limit of detection of our test was 2.3 × 10(−18) moles/assay. If the virus has ~25 spike proteins on its surface, our method should detect on the order of 10(−20) moles of virus/assay, corresponding to ~10(4) copies of the virus RNA/assay. The detection sensitivity approaches that of PCR-based assays because the average virus RNA load used for PCR-based assays is ~10(5) copies per oro- or naso-pharyngeal swab specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasensitive antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that can be performed with an easy-to-use microplate reader. Sufficient sensitivity can be achieved within 10 min of thio-NAD cycling. Our antigen test allows for rapid, cost-effective, specific, ultrasensitive, and simultaneous multiple measurements of SARS-CoV-2, and has broad application for the diagnosis for COVID-19.","Kyosei, Yuta; Namba, Mayuri; Yamura, Sou; Takeuchi, Rikiya; Aoki, Noriko; Nakaishi, Kazunari; Watabe, Satoshi; Ito, Etsuro",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10080594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823866/,124

Based on data from official German health authorities since the beginning of the pandemic, we developed a case-fatality prediction model that correctly predicts COVID-19-related death rates based on local geographical developments of infection rates in Germany, Bavaria, and a local community district city within Upper Bavaria. Our data point towards the proposal that local individual infection thresholds, when reached, could lead to increasing mortality. Restrictive measures to minimize the spread of the virus could be applied locally based on the risk of reaching the individual threshold. Being able to predict the necessity for increasing hospitalization of COVID-19 patients could help local health care authorities to prepare for increasing patient numbers.","Borgmann, Stefan; Meintrup, David; Reimer, Kerstin; Schels, Helmut; Nowak-Machen, Martina",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802866/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030338,124

Whether systemic medication for skin diseases affects the efficacy of vaccination and whether temporary interruption or extension of the dosing interval is necessary is under debate. Most immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drugs only affect vaccine-induced immune responses to a limited or moderate extent, preserving sufficient immunity in most patients. Mycophenolate mofetil, Janus kinase inhibitors, and rituximab require a more cautious approach, and judicious timing of vaccination might be appropriate in patients receiving these treatments. It should be noted that, for most drugs except methotrexate, data on the length of the interruption period to restore vaccine-induced immune responses to normal levels are either very limited or absent. In these cases, only the drug half-life can be used as a practical guideline. In most patients, systemic medication can be continued through the vaccination process, although case-by-case decisions can be considered.","Speeckaert, Reinhart; Lambert, Jo; Puig, Luis; Speeckaert, Marijn; Lapeere, Hilde; De Schepper, Sofie; van Geel, Nanja",Drugs R D,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40268-021-00349-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106430/,124

This virus primarily targets the human respiratory system. Available information suggests that people with epilepsy (PWE) are not at higher risk of being infected by the virus, nor of more severe COVID‐19 manifestations, as a result of the epilepsy alone. However, COVID‐19 is a serious disease that currently has no effective treatment or vaccine. A face mask is probably effective in preventing the spread of a respiratory pathogen, at least to some extent. So, should we recommend wearing a face mask to all during a pandemic of respiratory infectious disease (eg, COVID‐19) without any precautions or exemptions? While concrete evidence is lacking, if we consider that wearing a face mask may simulate hyperventilation, at least to some extent, we would probably avoid recommending this practice indiscriminately to all PWE. On the other hand, in the absence of any proven treatment or vaccine to combat COVID‐19, prevention is the best available strategy and it is probably not reasonable to suggest avoid wearing face masks in PWE under any circumstances. Logically, PWE do not need to wear a face mask most of the time, as long as there is no close contact with others, especially during intense physical activities such as exercise. To the contrary, it is probably more advantageous to wear a face mask in crowded locations, with intermittent breaks in safe locations, away from others.","Asadi‐Pooya, Ali A.; Cross, J.

The objective of this paper is to critically review the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience regarding COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hebei and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and non-essential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. While some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers and contacts, and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organized, proactive and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.","Peng, Fujun; Tu, Lei; Yang, Yongshi; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Hu, Qinyong; Cao, Feng; Jiang, Taijiao; Sun, Jinlyu; Xu, Guogang; Chang, Christopher",Can J Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439306/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20303950?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20303950; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.010,124

There were significantly lower levels of mRNA expressions of IFN-γ, TNFα and FOXP3 in COVID-19 patients than in the control group. On the other hand, IL-6 and COX-2 expressions were significantly higher in patients suffering from severe disease. FOXP3 expressions were correlated with the severities of hypoxia and were excellent in predicting the disease severity. This was followed by the IL-6, COX-2 and TNFα expressions. FOXP3 expression was the only biomarker to show a significant correlation with patient mortality.

Here, we developed a multiplexed Spike-ACE2 Inhibitor Screening (mSAIS) assay that can measure the neutralizing effect of antibodies across numerous variants of the coronavirus's Spike (S) protein simultaneously. By screening purified antibodies and serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinees against 72 S variants with the mSAIS assay, we identified new S mutations that are sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Serum from both infected and vaccinated groups with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) displayed a broader capacity to neutralize S variants than serum with low titer NAbs. These data were validated using serum from a large vaccinated cohort (n=104) with a tiled S peptide microarray. In addition, similar results were obtained using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay specific for wild-type S and four prevalent S variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1), thus demonstrating that high antibody diversity is associated with high NAb titers. Our results demonstrate the utility of the mSAIS platform in screening NAbs. Moreover, we show that heterogeneous antibody populations provide a more protective effect against S variants, which may help direct COVID-19 vaccine and drug development.","Zhang, X.; Zheng, M.; Liang, T.; Zhou, H.; Wang, H.; Zhang, J.; Ren, J.; Peng, H.; Li, S.; Bian, H.; Wei, C.; Yin, S.; He, C.; Han, Y.; Li, M.; Hou, X.; Xie, L.; Lv, J.; Kan, B.; Wang, Y.; yu, x.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.15.21257254v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.15.21257254,124

The latest CATH+ release, version 4.3, significantly increases coverage of structural and sequence data, with an addition of 65,351 fully-classified domains structures (+15%), providing 500 238 structural domains, and 151 million predicted sequence domains (+59%) assigned to 5481 superfamilies. The FunFam generation pipeline has been re-engineered to cope with the increased influx of data. Three times more sequences are captured in FunFams, with a concomitant increase in functional purity, information content and structural coverage. FunFam expansion increases the structural annotations provided for experimental GO terms (+59%). We also present CATH-FunVar web-pages displaying variations in protein sequences and their proximity to known or predicted functional sites.

The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 triggered a major global epidemic, which is now a major community health issue. As of April 17, 2020, according to Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported 1838 confirmed cases in between 8 March to 17 April 2020, with > 4.08% of mortality rate and >3.15% of recovery rate. COVID-19 outbreak is evolving so rapidly in Bangladesh; therefore, the availability of epidemiological data and its sensible analysis are essential to direct strategies for situational awareness and intervention. This article presents an exploratory data analysis approach to collect and analyze COVID-19 data on epidemiological outbreaks based on first publicly available COVID-19 Daily Dataset of Bangladesh. Various publicly open data sources on the outbreak of COVID-19 provided by the IEDCR, World Health Organization (WHO), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) of Bangladesh have been used in this research. A Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (V-EDA) techniques have been followed in this research to understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in different districts of Bangladesh in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 and these findings were compared with those of other countries. In all, this is extremely important to promptly spread information to understand the risks of this pandemic and begin containment activities in the country.","Dey, S. K.; Rahman, M. M.; Siddiqi, U.

For example, morbidity and mortality could be mitigated by a proactive regional plan for the triage of mechanical ventilators. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This paper explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one US metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this paper aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It also addresses the ethical and practical aspects of not continuing to offer ECMO during a disaster.","Prekker, Matthew E.; Brunsvold, Melissa E.; Bohman, J.

For viable skin grafts, sterilisation techniques cannot be applied, however antibiotics and antimycotics may be used to disinfect the tissue with respect to bacteria and fungi. Nevertheless, strict standards are applied to avoid disease transmission from donor to recipient involving donor medical history, donor testing for viral diseases, aseptic retrieval and processing, and control of storage temperature. Cryopreservation is the preferred method for long term storage of viable skin grafts. If viability is not required, then additional long term preservation methods may be used including deep-freezing, freeze-drying or high concentration solute preservation. All three methods work by reducing water activity. In addition it is possible to apply certain sterilisation techiques that have been shown not to damage the tissue. It is important that sterilisation methods are validated in accordance with precise definitions of sterilisation, and for the initial levels of “bioburden” expected to be present immediately prior to application of the sterilisation method. The application of improved and refined methodologies in accordance with defined standards has ensured improved graft performance while reducing risk to the recipient.","Kearney, John N.",Clin Dermatol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738081X0400149X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738081X0400149X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023931/,124

Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS) implemented a 16-week social media campaign, #eatwellcovid19, led by a dietitian and nutrition student that focused on sharing stories submitted by the Saskatchewan public about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to describe the implementation of the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign and the results from the evaluation of the campaign, which included campaign performance using social media metrics and experiences and perspectives of campaign followers. METHODS: Residents of Saskatchewan, Canada, were invited to submit personal stories and experiences to EWS about how they were eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic from April to August 2020. Each week, one to three stories were featured on EWS social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter—along with evidence-based nutrition information to help residents become more resilient to challenges related to food and nutrition experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who submitted stories were entered into a weekly draw for a Can $100 grocery gift card. Social media metrics and semistructured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate the #eatwellcovid19 campaign. RESULTS: In total, 75 stories were submitted by 74 individuals on a variety of topics (eg, grocery shopping, traditional skills, and gardening), and 42 stories were featured on social media. EWS shared 194 #eatwellcovid19 posts across social media platforms (Facebook: n=100; Instagram: n=55; and Twitter: n=39). On Facebook, #eatawellcovid19 reached 100,571 followers and left 128,818 impressions, resulting in 9575 engagements. On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310 followers, made 14,145 impressions, and received 823 likes and 15 comments. On Twitter, #eatwellcovid19 made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. Featured story submission posts had the best engagement on Facebook and the most likes and comments on Instagram. The EWS social media pages reported increases in their following during the campaign (Instagram: +30%; Facebook: +14%; and Twitter: +12%). Results from the interviews revealed that there were two types of campaign followers: those who appreciated hearing the stories submitted by followers, as it helped them to feel connected to the community during social isolation, and those who appreciated the evidence-based information. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous stories were submitted to the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign on various topics. On Instagram and Facebook, posts that featured these stories had the highest engagement. During this campaign, EWS’s social media following increased by more than 10% on each platform. The approach used for the #eatwellcovid19 campaign could be considered by others looking to develop health promotion campaigns.","Grantham, Jordyn L; Verishagen, Carrie L; Whiting, Susan J; Henry, Carol J; Lieffers, Jessica R L",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/27448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133314/,124

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training programs have been shown to decrease stress. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated 4-weeks MBSR training program in relation to a standard 8-weeks one on the stress levels. A controlled and randomized clinical trial was designed, in which 112 tutors and resident intern specialists in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing of six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated. Participants included in the experimental groups (EGs) received a MBRS training program (standard or abbreviated), while control group (CG) participants did not receive any intervention. The stress levels were assessed by the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) in three different moments during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant reduction in stress (F((2,91)) = 5.165; p = 0.008; η(2) = 0.102) in the post-test visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program, but without the maintenance of its effects over time. No significant impact of the abbreviated training program on stress levels was observed in the intergroup comparison. A standard 8-weeks MBSR training program aimed at tutors and resident intern specialists in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing produces significant improvements in stress levels compared with the abbreviated intervention and no intervention. New studies about abbreviated training programs are needed to provide effective treatments which improve well-being of these professionals.","Verdes-Montenegro-Atalaya, Juan Carlos; Pérula-de Torres, Luis Ángel; Lietor-Villajos, Norberto; Bartolomé-Moreno, Cruz; Moreno-Martos, Herminia; Rodríguez, Luis Alberto; Grande-Grande, Teresa; Pardo-Hernández, Rocío; León-del-Barco, Benito; Santamaría-Peláez, Mirian; Mínguez, Luis A.; González-Santos, Josefa; Soto-Cámara, Raúl; González-Bernal, Jerónimo J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639532/,124

An exploration of ACP uptake in older adults may identify barriers and facilitators. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an integrative review of research on the uptake of ACP in older adults, and create a conceptual model of the findings. METHODS: Using Whittemore and Knafl’s methodology, we systematically searched four electronic databases of ACP literature in older adults from 1996 through December 2019. Critical appraisal tools were utilized to assess study quality and articles were categorized according to level of evidence. Statistical and thematic analysis was then undertaken. RESULTS: Among 1081 studies, 78 met inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis evaluated ACP and variables within the domains of demographics, psychosocial, disability and functioning, and miscellaneous variables. Thematic analysis identified a central category of enhanced communication, followed by categories of: (1) provider role and preparation; (2) patient/family relationship patterns; (3) standardized processes and structured approaches; (4) contextual influences; and (5) missed opportunities. A conceptual model depicted categories and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced communication and ACP facilitators improve uptake of ACP. Clinicians should be cognizant of these factors.

We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019–September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. FINDINGS: We identified 14 210 507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 43·0% (95% CI 38·3–47·4), anxiety disorders by 47·8% (44·3–51·2), and first antidepressant prescribing by 36·4% (33·9–38·8) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18–44 and 45–64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 37·6% (34·8–40·3%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (75·3% reduction [74·0–76·4]). INTERPRETATION: Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide. Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised.

METHODS: Children at a single pediatric institution quaternary referral center with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or MIS-C and neuropsychiatric symptoms were included in this retrospective case series. Clinical symptoms, ancillary testing data, treatments and outcomes are described. Multiplexed electrochemiluminescence assays for cytokines, chemokines and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested in the CSF NP-COVID-19 patients compared to five controls and were analyzed using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: Three of five NP-COVID-19 patients had psychiatric symptoms, and two patients had encephalopathy and seizures. All patients had full or near resolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms by discharge. One patient received intravenous steroids for treatment for psychiatric symptoms; 3/5 other patients received immunotherapy for MIS-C, including IVIG, high-dose steroids, anakinra, and tocilizumab. Pro-inflammatory chemokines, including MIG, MPC, MIP-1β, and TARC were significantly elevated in NP-COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Two of five patients had elevated CSF neurofilament light chain. CSF SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers to the full-length spike, receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain were significantly elevated. SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers strongly correlated with pro-inflammatory chemokines/cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (P≤0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: A spectrum of neuropsychiatric clinical manifestations can occur in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CSF pro-inflammatory chemokines and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may serve as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 mediated NP-COVID-19.

We used data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of August 21, 2020 on county level. We classified states into four groups based on the 7-day change in prevalence and the state's approach to SAH policy. The groups included: (1) High Change (19 states; 7-day prevalence change ≥50th percentile), (2) Low Change (19 states; 7-day prevalence change <50th percentile), (3) No SAH (11 states: did not adopt SAH order), and (4) No SAH End (2 states: did not relax SAH order). We performed regression modeling assessing the association between change in prevalence at the time of SAH order relaxation and COVID-19 prevalence days after the relaxation of SAH order for four selected groups. After adjusting for other factors, compared to the High Change group, counties in the Low Change group had 33.8 (per 100,000 population) fewer cases (standard error (SE): 19.8, p < 0.001) 7 days after the relaxation of SAH order and the difference was larger by time passing. On August 21, 2020, the No SAH End group had 383.1 fewer cases (per 100,000 population) than the High Change group (SE: 143.6, p < 0.01).

However, current CAR therapy is highly personalized as cells used are derived from patients themselves, which can be costly, time-consuming, and sometimes fails to achieve optimal therapeutic results due to poor quality/quantity of patient-derived cells. On the contrary, universal CAR therapy, which is based on healthy individuals’ cells, circumvents several limitations of current autologous CAR therapy. To achieve the universality of CAR therapy, the allogeneic cell transplantation related issues, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and host-versus-graft activities (HVGA), must be addressed. In this review, we focus on current progress regarding GVHD and HVGA in the universal CAR therapy, followed by a universal CAR design that may be applied to allogeneic cells and a summary of key clinical trials in this field.

The mechanism by which resistance occurs is still not completely known, however, recent studies suggest that impaired/defective interferon signaling might play a role. In the present study, we assessed the functional role of IFITM1 and PLSCR1; two well-known interferon response genes in AI resistance. METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to assess mRNA and protein levels of IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-7 in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on tissue microarrays consisting of normal breast tissues, primary breast tumors, and AI-resistant recurrence tumors. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular IFNα level. Neutralizing antibody was used to block type 1 interferon receptor IFNAR1 signaling. Small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, IRF-7, and IFNα expression. RESULTS: We found that IFITM1 and PLSCR1 were constitutively overexpressed in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-resistant tumors and that siRNA knockdown of IFITM1 significantly inhibited the ability of the resistant cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade. Interestingly, suppression of IFITM1 significantly enhanced estradiol-induced cell death in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells and markedly increased expression of p21, Bax, and Noxa in these cells. Significantly elevated level of IFNα was detected in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells compared to parental MCF-7 cells and suppression of IFNα dramatically reduced IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells. Lastly, neutralizing antibody against IFNAR1/2 and knockdown of STAT1/STAT2 completely suppressed IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells, thus confirming the involvement of the canonical IFNα signaling pathway in driving the overexpression of IFITM1 and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the resistant cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of ISGs enhances the progression of AI-resistant breast cancer and that suppression of IFITM1 and other ISGs sensitizes AI-resistant cells to estrogen-induced cell death.

Several studies have pointed to their inadequacy, which is becoming a serious problem during the global crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a direct link between the leadership in the healthcare system and its performance, conditioned by the level of decisions of leaders of medical teams. It is they who determine the performance of healthcare delivery. The study published in this article contains the results from the examination of the dependence between crisis leadership and team performance in healthcare providers. The subject of the research is the impact of cognitive diversity and the quality of crisis-leadership decision-making on the performance of medical teams in the acute crisis phase. The study was conducted on a research sample of 216 healthcare providers after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia (April 2020). The respondents to the research sample involved team leaders in healthcare providers, who have been involved in managing the crisis. The study has justified the positive association between crisis leadership and team performance, which is mediated by cognitive diversity, supporting the quality of decision-making in crisis leadership. The results of the research have proven that the performance of the medical team in the acute crisis phase can be positively influenced through qualified decision-making in crisis leadership amplified by the usage of cognitive diversity.","Joniaková, Zuzana; Jankelová, Nadežda; Blštáková, Jana; Némethová, Ildikó",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799831/,124

An anonymous, online, survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3–24, 2020) included a modified pregnancy-related anxiety scale (PRAS) reflecting respondents’ perception of pregnancy anxiety before COVID-19 and a current assessment of pregnancy-related anxiety. The difference between these scores was used as the outcome variable. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Two thousand seven hundred forty pregnant women from 47 states completed the survey. 25.8% (N = 706) stopped in-person visits, 15.2% used video visits (N = 415), and 31.8% (N = 817) used phone visits for prenatal care as a result of COVID-19. Those planning a hospital birth dropped from 2641 (96.4%) to 2400 (87.7%) following COVID-19. More than half of women reported increased stress about food running out (59.2%, N = 1622), losing a job or household income (63.7%, N = 1745), or loss of childcare (56.3%, N = 1543). More than a third reported increasing stress about conflict between household members (37.5%, N = 1028), and 93% (N = 2556) reported increased stress about getting infected with COVID-19. Slightly less than half of respondents (either selves or family members) were healthcare workers (41.4%, N = 1133) or worked in essential services (45.5%, N = 1246). In multivariate analysis, those reporting higher agreement with COVID-19-related stressors had greater changes in pre- to post-COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting pregnant women’s mental health, and factors independent of pregnancy appear to be driving changes in pregnancy-specific anxiety.","Moyer, Cheryl A.; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria",Arch Womens Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01073-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989598/,124
681445,MERS-CoV virus-like particles produced in insect cells induce specific humoural and cellular imminity in rhesus macaques,2016-03-30,"In February 2020, Italy became one of the first countries to be plagued by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19. In March 2020, the Italian government decreed a lockdown for the whole country, which overturned communication systems, hospital organization, and access to patients and their relatives and carers. This issue had a particular regard for cancer patients. Our Thoracic Oncology Division therefore reorganized patient access in order to reduce the risk of contagion and, at the same time, encourage the continuation of treatment. Our staff contacted all patients to inform them of any changes in treatment planning, check that they were taking safety measures, and ascertain their feelings and whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms. To better understand patients’ fears and expectations of during the pandemic period, we created a nine-question interview, administered from April to May 2020 to 156 patients with lung cancer. Patients were classified by age, sex, comorbidity, disease stage, prior treatment, and treatment type. The survey showed that during the pandemic period some patients experienced fear of COVID-19, in particular: women (55% vs. 33%), patients with comorbidities (24% vs. 9%), and patients who had already received prior insult (radiotherapy or surgery) on the lung (30% vs. 11%). In addition, the patients who received oral treatment at home or for whom intravenous treatment was delayed, experienced a sense of relief (90% and 72% respectively). However, only 21% of the patients were more afraid of COVID-19 than of their cancer, in particular patients with long-term (> 12 months) vs. short-term cancer diagnosis (28% vs. 12.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the quarantine period or even just the lockdown period alone, worsened the quality of life of some patients (40%), especially those in oral treatment (47%). Our data demonstrate how lung cancer patients are more afraid of their disease than of a world pandemic. Also this interview indirectly highlights the clinician’s major guiding principle in correctly and appropriately managing not just the patient’s expectations of their illness and its treatment, but also and especially of the patient’s fears.","Catania, Chiara; Spitaleri, Gianluca; Del Signore, Ester; Attili, Ilaria; Radice, Davide; Stati, Valeria; Gianoncelli, Letizia; Morganti, Stefania; de Marinis, Filippo",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163413/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.584612,124
681781,An in vitro antiviral activity of iodine complexes against SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-16,"Like many governments in this COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian government imposed a lockdown on the country. As a consequence of the lockdown, many businesses shutdown and effectively had no source of revenue. Yet, without receiving any bailout or palliatives from the government, these businesses are required to meet their tax obligations to the government. Bearing in mind that this time (COVID-19 era) is different, one wonders what is required of businesses in view of the taxation problem and the social contract between the businesspersons and the government. In view of social contract obligations, in this COVID-19 pandemic should businesses pay tax to a government that seems to have delegitimised itself by its exploitative actions in terms of taxation and delinquent omission in terms of the provision of public goods and social services? The Nigerian government at all tiers (federal, state and local) seldom respect the essence of taxation. Therefore, businesses often pay tax for nothing. For many businesses, as far as taxation is concerned, to pay or not to pay? that is the question. This article is aimed at teasing out this taxation problem that may or may not be a moral dilemma. In view of certain ethical considerations, this article shows why in spite of social contract obligations, there is no consensus or canonical agreement on whether, as law-abiding citizens and juridical persons (legal entities), businesspersons and businesses ought to or ought not to pay tax to the Nigerian government in this COVID-19 pandemic.","Abumere, Frank Aragbonfoh",Philosophia (Ramat Gan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814644/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11406-021-00354-2,124

Pathogens and their vectors can now move further, faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Three important consequences of global transport network expansion are infectious disease pandemics, vector invasion events and vector-borne pathogen importation. This review briefly examines some of the important historical examples of these disease and vector movements, such as the global influenza pandemics, the devastating Anopheles gambiae invasion of Brazil and the recent increases in imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases. We then outline potential approaches for future studies of disease movement, focussing on vector invasion and vector-borne disease importation. Such approaches allow us to explore the potential implications of international air travel, shipping routes and other methods of transport on global pathogen and vector traffic.","Tatem, A.J.; Rogers, D.J.; Hay, S.I.","Global Mapping of Infectious Diseases: Methods, Examples and Emerging Applications",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X0562009X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3145127?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X0562009X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16647974/,124

The ability to reversibly control their binding activity to their targets on demand would significantly expand their applications in biotechnology, medicine, and research. Here we present, as proof-of-principle, the development of a light-controlled monobody (OptoMB) that works in vitro and in cells and whose affinity for its SH2-domain target exhibits a 330-fold shift in binding affinity upon illumination. We demonstrate that our αSH2-OptoMB can be used to purify SH2-tagged proteins directly from crude E. coli extract, achieving 99.8% purity and over 40% yield in a single purification step. By virtue of their ability to be designed to bind any protein of interest, OptoMBs have the potential to find new powerful applications as light-switchable binders of untagged proteins with the temporal and spatial precision afforded by light.","Carrasco-López, César; Zhao, Evan M.; Gil, Agnieszka A.; Alam, Nathan; Toettcher, Jared E.; Avalos, José L.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792484/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17837-7,124
683836,Ethacridine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating viral particles,2021-09-03,"BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a novel zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus emerged in China. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became pandemic within weeks and the number of human infections and severe cases is increasing. We aimed to investigate the susceptibilty of potential animal hosts and the risk of anthropozoonotic spill-over infections. METHODS: We intranasally inoculated nine fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets (Mustela putorius), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), and 17 chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) with 10(5) TCID(50) of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate per animal. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included 24 h after inoculation to test viral transmission. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and for virus shedding by nucleic acid extraction from nasal washes and rectal swabs (ferrets), oral swabs and pooled faeces samples (fruit bats), nasal and rectal swabs (pigs), or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (chickens) on days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 after infection by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). On days 4, 8, and 12, two inoculated animals (or three in the case of chickens) of each species were euthanised, and all remaining animals, including the contacts, were euthanised at day 21. All animals were subjected to autopsy and various tissues were collected for virus detection by RT-qPCR, histopathology immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralisation test in samples collected before inoculation and at autopsy. FINDINGS: Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for viral RNA, and none of the pigs or chickens seroconverted. Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung, and lung-associated lymphatic tissue in two animals euthanised at day 4. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets, with transmission to all three direct contact animals. Mild rhinitis was associated with viral antigen detection in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Prominent viral RNA loads of 0–10(4) viral genome copies per mL were detected in the upper respiratory tract of fruit bats and ferrets, and both species developed SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies reaching neutralising titres of up to 1/1024 after 21 days. INTERPRETATION: Pigs and chickens could not be infected intranasally by SARS-CoV-2, whereas fruit bats showed characteristics of a reservoir host. Virus replication in ferrets resembled a subclinical human infection with efficient spread. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for further studies—eg, testing vaccines or antivirals.

684816,SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in non-human primates,2021-03-17,"An important stage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) life cycle is the binding of the spike (S) protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) host cell receptor. Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity. By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility. Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an “up” and “down” state. In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a “bouncing spring” that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening. Several hits were identified that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in published cell models. In particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for molecules including Chitosan and macrolides such as the mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) pathway inhibitor Rapamycin. These findings identify a novel small molecule binding-site formed by the spike protein oligomer, that might assist in future drug discovery programs aimed at targeting the coronavirus (CoV) family of viruses.","Kalathiya, Umesh; Padariya, Monikaben; Mayordomo, Marcos; Lisowska, Małgorzata; Nicholson, Judith; Singh, Ashita; Baginski, Maciej; Fahraeus, Robin; Carragher, Neil; Ball, Kathryn; Haas, Juergen; Daniels, Alison; Hupp, Ted R.; Alfaro, Javier Antonio",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422996/,124

CONTEXT: Diabetes mellitus was associated with increased severity and mortality of disease in COVID-19 pneumonia. So far the effect of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or hyperglycemia on the immune system among COVID-19 disease has remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the clinical and immunological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among COVID-19 patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 306 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 129 diabetic and 177 non-diabetic patients) were analyzed. The serum concentrations of laboratory parameters including cytokines and numbers of immune cells were measured and compared between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. RESULTS: Compared with non-diabetic group, diabetic cases more frequently had lymphopenia and hyperglycemia, with higher levels of urea nitrogen, myoglobin, D-dimer and ferritin. Diabetic cases indicated the obviously elevated mortality and the higher levels of cytokines IL‐2R, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, and TNF‐α, as well as the distinctly reduced Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios compared with non-diabetic cases. The longitudinal assays showed that compared to that at week 1, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated at week 2 after admission in non-survivors of diabetic cases, whereas there were greatly reductions from week 1 to week 2 in survivors of diabetic cases. Compared with survival diabetic patients, non-survival diabetic cases displayed distinct higher serum concentrations of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF‐α, and lower Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios at week 2. Samples from a subset of participants were evaluated by flow cytometry for the immune cells. The counts of peripheral total T lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and NK cells were markedly lower in diabetic cases than in non-diabetic cases. The non-survivors showed the markedly declined counts of CD8(+) T cells and NK cells than survivors. CONCLUSION: The elevated cytokines, imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios and reduced of peripheral numbers of CD8(+) T cells and NK cells might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of high mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Han, Meifang; Ma, Ke; Wang, Xiaojing; Yan, Weiming; Wang, Hongwu; You, Jie; Wang, Qiuxia; Chen, Huilong; Guo, Wei; Chen, Tao; Ning, Qin; Luo, Xiaoping",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.596518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776910/,124

Regional lymphadenopathy is one of the documented side effects of vaccination. We document the fine needle aspiration cytological findings of an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node in a 34-year-old Asian female following the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, which appears to be the first such report in a premorbidly well patient with no known history of malignancy. The cytological findings featured a reactive pattern in keeping with follicular hyperplasia, with prominent germinal centre elements including lymphohistiocytic aggregates and tingible-body macrophages. Despite an increased proportion of larger lymphocytes, the overall pattern was in keeping with a reactive pattern, bearing in mind the temporal and geographic relation to the vaccination injection. In instances of localised lymphadenopathy, particularly in supraclavicular or axillary locations, pathologists should be cognizant of the possibility of post-vaccination reactive lymphadenopathy, and seek clinical and radiological hints favouring a benign process, whilst recognising potential morphological overlaps with lymphoproliferative disorders. Awareness of this diagnostic pitfall is especially important as COVID-19 vaccination coverage is ramped up worldwide, leading to an expected increase in incidence of post-vaccination reactive lymphadenopathy.","Tan, Nicholas Jin Hong; Tay, Kai Xun Joshua; Wong, Soon Boon Justin; Nga, Min En",Diagnostic cytopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34432391/; https://doi.org/10.1002/dc.24863,124

However, evidence of the association between COVID-19 severity and social determinants is still scarce, particularly, for Latin American countries. The objective was to assess the effect of socioeconomic deprivation in the clinical severity of COVID-19 infection among different localities of Bogotá, Colombia. METHODS: Secondary analyses using data of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Bogotá from 6 March 2020 to 19 April 2020 were carried out. Direct and indirect indicators of deprivation at area level and individual demographic characteristics (age, sex and type of case) were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: 1684 COVID-19 cases were included in the study. There were 217 (12.9%; 95% CI 11.3 to 14.5) serious cases, of which 32.6% (95% CI 26.4 to 38.8) cases were deceased. In the multilevel logistic regression, age, sex (female), type of case (different of imported case), number of serious cases recorded the previous day and multidimensional poverty were associated with serious cases (median OR: 1.72, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.87).

Statistical analysis of the amount of annual fossil fuels consumption in transportation, and the annual average concentration of the atmospheric PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), in the different states of India, suggest that one of the main sources of atmospheric NO(2) is from fossil fuels combustion in transportation. It is suggested that homeless, poverty-stricken Indians, hawkers, roadside vendors, and many others who are regularly exposed to vehicular exhaust, may be at a higher risk in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2018, U.S. MSM living with HIV with a past detectable VL received a dried blood spot (DBS) kit at baseline and 3-month follow-up and returned specimens to a research laboratory. Of 56 consenting participants, 91% returned specimens at baseline and 77% at 3-month follow-up; 74% who returned two specimens had UVL at both time points. At-home DBS collection and longitudinal VL monitoring is feasible among U.S. MSM with fluctuating viral load. This complementary approach to clinical care could improve viral suppression maintenance.","Teran, Richard A.; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E.; Chiasson, Mary Ann; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Weidler, Jessica; Shah, Jayesh G.; Chang, Jennifer Y.; Otto, Caitlin; Hirshfield, Sabina",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909080/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03030-w,124

In this manuscript we attempt to estimate the effect of these steps across ten Indian states using crowd-sourced data. The chosen transmission parameters are -reproduction number (R0), doubling time and growth rate during the early epidemic phase (15 days into lockdown) and 30 days into lockdown (23rd April 2020) through maximum likelihood approach. The overall analysis shows the decreasing trends in reproductive numbers and growth rate (with few exceptions) and incremental doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seemed to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The effective reproductive numbers are still higher above the threshold of 1 and the resultant absolute numbers tend to be exponentiating fundamentally. The curtailment strategy thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of actions.","Mitra, A.; Pakhare, A.

In addition, both drugs are currently used off-label in hospitals worldwide and in numerous clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, CQ and HCQ use has been associated with cardiac side effects, which is of concern due to the higher risk of COVID-19 complications in patients with heart related disorders, and increased mortality associated with COVID-19 cardiac complications. In this study we analyzed over thirteen million adverse event reports form the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System to confirm and quantify the association of cardiac side effects of CQ and HCQ. Additionally, we identified several confounding factors, including male sex, NSAID coadministration, advanced age, and prior diagnoses contributing to drug related cardiotoxicity. These findings may help guide therapeutic decision making and ethical trial design for COVID-19 treatment.","Cohen, Isaac V.; Makunts, Tigran; Moumedjian, Talar; Issa, Masara A.; Abagyan, Ruben",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154498/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76258-0,124
689286,Potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) proteases PLpro and Mpro/ 3CLpro: molecular docking and simulation studies of three pertinent medicinal plant natural components,2021-06-05,"This paper examines the role of entrepreneurs in advancing sustainable lifestyles (SLs) to address climate change and social inequity. It is based on empirical study of eight U.S.-based sustainable entrepreneurs, focused on reducing material consumption. While business has a key role to play, many large companies are unwilling to promote SLs as this is contrary to their current business models which are focused on growing consumption and sales. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models who are passionate about sustainability and social impact, and better positioned to take risks and innovate. The research examined emerging business models for advancing SLs, key success factors and challenges reported by the entrepreneurs, the social and environmental impacts of their actions, and the future opportunities for scaling up such practices. The study found that entrepreneurs are well positioned to address simultaneously environmental and social issues, however, they lack resources to effectively measure these impacts to demonstrate an overall positive benefit and strengthen their value proposition. Promoting green attributes alone is not enough to change the behavior of most consumers. It is critically important to emphasize other benefits such as a product/service quality, time or cost savings, or social impact. Social media, formal and informal sustainability networks, IT, sustainability policies, and consumer awareness are key to developing viable business models and competitive strategies that are difficult to replicate. The study found that sustainable entrepreneurs often face “costly” sustainability actions and lack the power to change „the rules of the game“; for this they need to collaborate with other key stakeholders, including NGOs, policy makers, and progressive companies. Based on the research findings the author proposes a new framework for the role of sustainable entrepreneurs as civic and political actors who not only offer innovative products and services, but help educate and influence key stakeholders, develop informal sustainability ecosystem, and thus create momentum for policy changes.","Veleva, Vesela",J Clean Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620347028?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078048/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620347028,124

We investigated the association of COVID-19 and relevant measures with multivariate outcomes among people affected by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 using the difference-in-differences (DID) method. We then analyzed the associations between sociodemographic factors and outcomes. We assessed psychological distress, problem drinking, insomnia state, unemployment, household economic decline, and interpersonal problems using three questionnaire surveys administered in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Participants were grouped according to three time periods by dates of voluntary stay-at-home requests (February 26) and the declaration of emergency (April 16) in Japan. The years 2020 and 2019 were regarded as the treatment group and control group, respectively, after confirming that no DIDs were found between 2018 and 2019. We performed regression analyses to identify the risk factors for outcomes. The DIDs were significant for household economic decline after the declaration of emergency, whereas problem drinking significantly improved. No significant DIDs were observed for other mental health outcomes including psychological distress and insomnia state. Absence of counselors was positively and significantly associated with all outcomes in 2020. Overall, people affected by the Fukushima disaster experienced more economic damage after the declaration of emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic but their mental health status did not reduce. Identifying people who have no counselors and providing them with support are emergent requirements to prevent a subsequent mental health decline.","Murakami, Michio; Kobayashi, Tomoyuki; Oikawa, Yuichi; Goto, Saori; Momoi, Maho; Takebayashi, Yoshitake; Ohira, Tetsuya; Yasumura, Seiji; Maeda, Masaharu",SSM Popul Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997248/,124

690334,Computational assessment of the spike protein antigenicity reveals diversity in B cell epitopes but stability in T cell epitopes across SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-03-25,"The total number of Americans age 65 and older is expected to nearly double by 2060, and the number of Americans admitted to nursing homes is likewise anticipated to escalate. Studies have found living alone to be an important risk factor for mortality. Yet little is known about possible spillover health effects of living in a community where many elderly residents live alone. Even less is known about whether these risks persist after entering nursing homes. Our study population consisted of 874,162 US elderly adults newly admitted to nursing homes in 2011, as identified from the 3.0 Minimum Data Set. Data on these individuals were linked to Medicare claims and 2010 Census data. In this cohort study, we estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the associations between the quartiles of county-level percentage of households with those age 65 or older living alone and the individual-level risks of all-cause mortality until December 31, 2013, controlling for county-, nursing home facility-, and individual-level factors. Older adults in counties belonging to the highest quartile of elderly single-occupancy households had a 8% higher risk of dying (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.04–1.12, p < 0.001) after entering nursing homes compared to those in counties belonging to the lowest quartile. There was evidence of a linear trend (p for trend < 0.001). Should these findings be confirmed in future studies, it would suggest that living arrangements in elderly communities may have spillover health effects onto their residents. Programs and interventions that modify such living arrangements may yield more favorable health trajectories among older Americans, who are increasingly aging in place and at growing risk of entering nursing homes.","Kim, Daniel; Park, Chanhyun; Briesacher, Becky A.",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489720/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101285,124
