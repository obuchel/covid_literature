The shortage of intensive care units (ICU) beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure produced angst in the clinicians/intensivists who have to decide which patients admit to ICU and in which patients to implement palliative care. They have to apply specific clinical and ethical criteria, in emergency conditions. Proportionality and appropriateness criteria should be integrated with equity, equality, utility criteria, widening the distributive justice concept from the right of the patient to receive all available therapies to a right resources allocation during shortage, guided by public health ethic. The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status. Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied. The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life. Finally particular attention should be paid to the bereavement management of the family/caregivers and in the right approach of psychological problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of health workers involved in the pandemia.","Romanò, Massimo",Recenti progressi in medicina,869,1

Analyses have been carried out on responses of teachers in order to determine the factors affecting them, so as to illustrate an example and to try to understand the impacts of decisions taken by the Turkish Ministry of National Education during the initial stages of the pandemic. The study follows a descriptive survey model and employs quota sampling based on the first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics of Turkey. 1071 teachers participated in the study on a voluntary basis during the 30 March-1 June 2020 period by filling out a questionnaire form developed by the researchers. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of data were carried out via SPSS 24 and NVIVO 10 software, respectively. Findings indicate the most prominent problems reported by teachers are the lack of internet/device access by students as well as lack of experience of teachers with distance education. Analyses of problem frequency based on demographics have revealed that female teachers were more likely to suffer from the lack of IT skills. Teachers in the age group of 41+, who belong to generation X, also tend to experience more problems due to the lack of IT skills in comparison with their younger peers. Moreover, issues such as internet and infrastructure inadequacies experienced in rural regions, low participation rate of students in the online courses, indifference of parents, and failure of teachers to be sufficiently active in the system, were considered as problems by the teachers;and solution suggestions have been presented accordingly. © 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz.

Trimeric spike glycoproteins extend outward from the virion; these class I viral membrane fusion proteins mediate entry of the virus into a host cell and are the dominant antigen for immune response. Cryo-EM studies have generated a large number of structures for the spike either alone, or bound to the cognate receptor ACE2 or antibodies, with the three receptor binding domains (RBDs) seen closed, open, or in various combinations. Binding to ACE2 requires an open RBD, and is believed to trigger the series of dramatic conformational changes in the spike that lead to the shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the spring-loaded S2 subunit to the experimentally observed post-fusion structure. The steps following ACE2 binding are poorly understood despite extensive characterization of the spike through X-ray, cryo-EM, and computation. Here, we use all-atom simulations, guided by analysis of 81 existing experimental structures, to develop a model for the structural and energetic coupling that connects receptor binding to activation of the membrane fusion machinery.","Wang, Yuzhang; Fallon, Lucy; Raguette, Lauren; Budhan, Stephanie; Belfon, Kellon; Stepanenko, Darya; Helbock, Stephanie; Varghese, Sarah; Simmerling, Carlos",bioRxiv,869,17

The method used was the case study. The authors investigated three early-stage entrepreneurs in order to achieve the objective of the paper. These entrepreneurs are both the unit of analysis and the unit of observation.FindingsThe outcomes of this research indicate (1) the combined importance of social capital offline and online;(2) the different performance of the two different types of social capital (they seem to operate in relatively distinct ways) and (3) the existence of recursiveness between resources stemming from the two social spheres (offline and online).Research limitations/implicationsAs research limitations, the authors point out the following: (1) the use of semistructured interviews as the only data collection instrument;(2) the limitation of the outcomes to entrepreneurs only (3) the absence of information on the performance of the business ventures;the focus of the paper was only on establishing causality between social capital offline and online and entrepreneurial performance.Originality/valueThis paper provides important research contributions. Initially, the paper presents a range of offline and online variables, which can be used in further research. At the same time, the paper emphasizes the combined impact of social capital offline and online, expanding the literature related to entrepreneurship. Moreover, this study proposes the creation of an integrative model. Finally, the authors point out the need for new theoretical and empirical studies on the subject, which still presents a gap in the literature.","Tatiane Andreza de Souza, Silva Victor Silva Corrêa Gláucia Maria Vasconcellos Vale Giglio Ernesto Michelangelo",REGE.

The cerebral hemodynamic data from the forehead of 11 patients undergoing propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia were analyzed. The concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and cerebral tissue heart rate were determined from the raw optical information based on the discrete stationary wavelet transform. This custom-made device provides an easy-to-build solution for continuous wave-fNIRS system, with customized specifications.

METHODS Data collection involved administering questionnaires regarding eye and skin irritation to a total of 3,611 staff and homeless study subjects. RESULTS Among these subjects, there were 223 reports of eye or skin symptoms. During the active UV period, 95 questionnaires (6%) noted such symptoms, and during the placebo period, 92 questionnaires (6%) did so. In the 36 remaining cases, either the UV period when symptoms took place was unknown or the symptoms spanned both periods. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of reports of symptoms between the active and placebo periods. One definite instance of UV-related keratoconjunctivitis occurred, resulting from a placement of a bunk bed in a dormitory where a single bed had been used when the UV fixtures were first installed. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that careful application of upper-room UVGI can be achieved without an apparent increase in the incidence of the most common side effects of accidental UV overexposure.","Nardell, Edward A; Bucher, Scott J; Brickner, Philip W; Wang, Charles; Vincent, Richard L; Becan-McBride, Kathleen; James, Mark A; Michael, Max; Wright, James D",Public health reports,869,16

Persons with CO poisoning often overlook the symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, dizziness, or confusion), and undetected exposure can be fatal. Unintentional CO exposure accounts for an estimated 15,000 emergency department visits and 500 unintentional deaths in the United States each year. The most recent state-level estimates of CO-related deaths were described in 1991 for the years 1979-1988. Using the most recent mortality data available, this report updates national and state-specific unintentional, non-fire-related CO mortality rates and describes the demographic, seasonal, and geographic patterns for 1999-2004. During this period, an average of 439 persons died annually from unintentional, non-fire-related CO poisoning, and the national average annual death rate was 1.5 per million persons. However, rates varied by demographic subgroup, month of the year, and state. Rates were highest among adults aged > or =65 years, men, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks. The average number of deaths was highest during January. Among the states, Nebraska had the highest reliable CO mortality rate.

Methods: The data are all from the epidemic information released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Health Commission of Hubei Province. We used the multivariable linear regression by the SPSS 19.0 software: the cumulative number of confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases, and the number of daily severe cases were taken as dependent variables, and the six policies, including the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, lockdown Wuhan city, the first-level response to public health emergencies, the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients, mobile cabin hospitals, and counterpart assistance in Hubei province, were gradually entered into multiple linear regression models as independent variables. Results: The factors influencing the cumulative number of diagnosed cases ranged from large to small: mobile cabin hospitals and the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients. The factors influencing the cumulative number of cured cases ranged from large to small: counterpart support medical teams in Hubei province and mobile cabin hospitals. The factors influencing the number of daily severe cases ranged from large to small: mobile cabin hospitals and the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients. Conclusion: The mobile cabin hospital is a major reason for the successfully defeating COVID-19 in China. As COVID-19 pandemic spreads globally, the mobile cabin hospital is a successful experience in formulating policies to defeat COVID-19 for other countries in the outbreak phase.","Zhang, Yuyao; Shi, Leiyu; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Biomed Res Int,869,20

Here, we present a label-free nanoplasmonic biosensor-based, multiplex screening test for COVID-19 that can quantitatively detect 10 different biomarkers (6 viral nucleic acid genes, 2 spike protein subunits, and 2 antibodies) with a limit of detection in the aM range, all within one biosensor platform. Our newly developed nanoplasmonic biosensors demonstrate high specificity, which is of the upmost importance to avoid false responses. As a proof of concept, we show that our detection approach has the potential to quantify both IgG and IgM antibodies directly from COVID-19-positive patient plasma samples in a single instrument run, demonstrating the high-throughput capability of our detection approach. Most importantly, our assay provides receiving operating characteristics, areas under the curve of 0.997 and 0.999 for IgG and IgM, respectively. The calculated p-value determined through the Mann–Whitney nonparametric test is <0.0001 for both antibodies when the test of COVID-19-positive patients (n = 80) is compared with that of healthy individuals (n = 72). Additionally, the screening test provides a calculated sensitivity (true positive rate) of 100% (80/80), a specificity (true negative rate) >96% (77/80), a positive predictive value of 98% at 5% prevalence, and a negative predictive value of 100% at 5% prevalence. We believe that our very sensitive, multiplex, high-throughput testing approach has potential applications in COVID-19 diagnostics, particularly in determining virus progression and infection severity for clinicians for an appropriate treatment, and will also prove to be a very effective diagnostic test when applied to diseases beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Masterson, Adrianna N.; Muhoberac, Barry B.; Gopinadhan, Adnan; Wilde, David J.; Deiss, Frédérique T.; John, Chandy C.; Sardar, Rajesh",Anal Chem,869,28
